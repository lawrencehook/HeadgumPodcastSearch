00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:02.000 --> 00:30.960
Welcome to another edition of the head-gum podcast.

00:31.920 --> 00:34.480
It's a very special theme episode.

00:34.480 --> 00:37.200
I don't know what else to say. Do you guys have your snacks and lunch ready?

00:37.200 --> 00:38.800
Like I asked?

00:38.800 --> 00:40.400
No.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.720
What do you mean no, not yet?

00:42.720 --> 00:45.360
Or no, you won't have anything for this episode.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.120
Both. Not yet.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.520
Or ever for this episode, to eat.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.960
And Murrico left.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.240
I went to go get a lunch fail.

00:54.240 --> 00:54.960
Okay, great.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.640
Ooh, is that after a city?

00:57.360 --> 00:58.160
Yeah.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.160
That's cool.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.160
Welcome to the lunch break episode.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.160
You didn't ask me if I had a snack.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.160
Do you have a snack?

01:06.160 --> 01:08.160
I did. I have a little bowl of trail mix.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.160
Nice. Okay, so this is going to the title.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.160
This episode is lunch and learn.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.160
The title is lunch and learn.

01:14.160 --> 01:16.160
So I'm adopting the conversation already.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.160
Just let it happen.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.160
I'm cooperating.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.160
You're not.

01:22.160 --> 01:26.160
We are all activating on a co-level to create content.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.160
Exactly right.

01:28.160 --> 01:32.160
And like it, co-op, it's time to learn and grow and change.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.160
Why are we listening to the Wii sound?

01:34.160 --> 01:38.160
Because there's so much dead air in this shit, man.

01:38.160 --> 01:41.160
So I'm trying to like fill the space so that it feels more like a discussion.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.160
Do you want something else?

01:42.160 --> 01:43.160
Let me do it.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.160
I love it.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.160
This music calms me.

01:46.160 --> 01:48.160
All right, uh, here we go.

01:48.160 --> 01:50.160
Fucking.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.160
And then we're going to get into some shit.

01:52.160 --> 01:56.160
But this, you guys have anything that you want to talk about in terms of, um,

01:56.160 --> 02:00.160
you don't have any thoughts about lunch and learn.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.160
That being the title of the episode and the whole thing.

02:02.160 --> 02:05.160
It's called lunch and learn.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.160
You're not having to.

02:06.160 --> 02:11.160
Yeah, we all, Brad, I'm sure has been to a lunch and learn.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.160
Right.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.160
Yeah, my old company is to do a lot of them.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.160
And your new one does too.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.160
Because here we are at a lunch and learn.

02:19.160 --> 02:21.160
This is a company show.

02:21.160 --> 02:24.160
I'm a company man.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.160
Man.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.160
And guess what else?

02:27.160 --> 02:28.160
What?

02:28.160 --> 02:30.160
It's time to lunch and learn.

02:30.160 --> 02:32.160
So what are you, are you teaching us something?

02:32.160 --> 02:33.160
You don't inspire.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.160
Perfect.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.160
He's gone.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.160
Also, also not an employee.

02:37.160 --> 02:40.160
We have to give him something.

02:40.160 --> 02:45.160
Because now my coffee, I'm actually going to be right back to.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.160
Yeah, it's more than fair.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.160
Right.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.160
Good.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.160
When do you come to LA?

02:50.160 --> 02:52.160
I wouldn't stay.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.160
Perfect.

02:53.160 --> 02:56.160
Just in time for me to go to New York.

02:56.160 --> 02:59.160
Are you going for Avito show?

02:59.160 --> 03:02.160
We're going basically for a week.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.160
Next week.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.160
And then she's going off to Europe.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.160
And I'm going back to LA.

03:07.160 --> 03:08.160
Nice.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.160
Nice.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.160
So you're going to see any shows?

03:10.160 --> 03:11.160
Yeah.

03:11.160 --> 03:14.160
I want to see six.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.160
See Andrew Leatt.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.160
I mean, you should see six.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.160
Six is fun.

03:17.160 --> 03:18.160
See Andrew Leatt.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.160
See Andrew Leatt.

03:19.160 --> 03:20.160
Six.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.160
And Andrew Leatt.

03:22.160 --> 03:26.160
Of course.

03:26.160 --> 03:35.160
Who is back.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.160
To get your lunch.

03:37.160 --> 03:39.160
I tried to use the Mike Armigan.

03:40.160 --> 03:50.160
Do you have your lunch?

03:50.160 --> 03:52.160
I have my lunch.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.160
What are you guys eating?

03:53.160 --> 03:54.160
Let's just start off with that.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.160
Because everybody likes food.

03:55.160 --> 03:59.160
So before we get into the team building, we're learning the growing, the changing.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.160
Again, this is a company show.

04:00.160 --> 04:05.160
So I feel like this is the time to get better as a company as a team.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.160
And to learn a little bit about several topics that we'll get into.

04:08.160 --> 04:12.160
But before we start that, what do you guys have to eat?

04:12.160 --> 04:16.160
I can go through what's in my lunch, pale.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.160
Sure.

04:17.160 --> 04:22.160
And if it's not food, then we're going to start maybe with listening to directions.

04:22.160 --> 04:26.160
Would be a good place to start anything.

04:26.160 --> 04:28.160
So I have this.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.160
Sanding.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.160
What's that for?

04:31.160 --> 04:34.160
Is that for grinding down your teeth to like a nob?

04:34.160 --> 04:35.160
Yeah.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.160
Pretty much.

04:37.160 --> 04:41.160
Um, this, the wall staple gun.

04:41.160 --> 04:42.160
Okay.

04:42.160 --> 04:45.160
Is that for getting your roommate to leave your room?

04:45.160 --> 04:48.160
Uh, no, it's more I.

04:48.160 --> 04:51.160
It's for like hacking up my food.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.160
And it's box.

04:53.160 --> 04:57.160
Because I hand make every, when I make food for lunch.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.160
Which is a little wooden box.

04:59.160 --> 05:02.160
And I say food in a box.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.160
Sure.

05:03.160 --> 05:04.160
Sure.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.160
That's a casual answer thing.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.160
Yeah.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.160
That's insane.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.160
That's a big carpentry on a daily basis.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.160
Glee sticks.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.160
Okay.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.160
Is that a snack?

05:14.160 --> 05:16.160
Like chief sticks.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.160
True staples.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.160
Okay.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.160
So the staple gun.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.160
Yeah.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.160
I was worried about that.

05:23.160 --> 05:25.160
Uh, we're not starting from a good place.

05:25.160 --> 05:26.160
Let's just continue.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.160
I'm here with you.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.160
What is still thinking dense that you're playing with?

05:29.160 --> 05:31.160
It looks like rubber cement.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.160
Is this ice cream right?

05:33.160 --> 05:37.160
Or like an assiable that was frozen for an extra hour.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.160
Yeah.

05:38.160 --> 05:39.160
That's exactly it.

05:39.160 --> 05:40.160
How did you know?

05:40.160 --> 05:41.160
Yeah.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.160
Because it's too cold.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.160
Right.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.160
So I did, uh, I did the work ahead of time.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.160
Rather than you guys showing up empty hand.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.160
Um, right.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.160
There's nothing more back yard than a bowl.

05:51.160 --> 05:53.160
Is that fair to say?

05:53.160 --> 05:55.160
I like assiables.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.160
So I'm saying this from a place of love.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.160
But is it like the nutritional equivalent of eating a pint of ice

06:00.160 --> 06:01.160
cream for breakfast?

06:01.160 --> 06:03.160
Like chemically if you break it down.

06:03.160 --> 06:08.160
Is it just like a thousand grams of sugar and then nothing else?

06:08.160 --> 06:09.160
I don't think so, sugar.

06:09.160 --> 06:14.160
Because you're getting a lot of fiber from all the fruits and also from the granola.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.160
Yeah.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.160
And there's definitely a lot of sugar for sure.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.160
But it's all from natural sources.

06:18.160 --> 06:23.160
Instead of like adding sugar to cream, which other than maybe a little bit of protein

06:23.160 --> 06:25.160
doesn't have a lot of nutritional value.

06:25.160 --> 06:28.160
This has a, you know, antioxidants and shit.

06:29.160 --> 06:32.160
How much sugar do you think is in that like more or less than a can of coke?

06:32.160 --> 06:37.160
It's definitely, I think it's probably more than a can of coke, but not that much more.

06:37.160 --> 06:43.160
I wonder if it's like, like if it was yogurt based with that be better.

06:43.160 --> 06:44.160
It was like you.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.160
Then we have probiotic.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.160
We're getting away from the point of this.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.160
I know that we are.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.160
We're talking about your lunch.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.160
We're learning it.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.160
We're learning only about the lunch.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.160
Yeah.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.160
That's all we're learning about.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.160
Well, it's been five minutes.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.160
All I wanted to say, it's been seven.

06:59.160 --> 07:02.160
Is that there's nothing more backyard than a bowl.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.160
And you did.

07:03.160 --> 07:07.160
So like, maybe when you're granola made out of.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.160
We got some almonds.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.160
There's some M&Ms.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.160
Couple a couple raisins.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.160
Lot of peanuts.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.160
Heavy on the peanuts.

07:16.160 --> 07:20.160
So it's not a trader Joe's trail mix.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.160
No, I'm not a trader Joe's girly.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.160
I find it overwhelming in it.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.160
Time management.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.160
Time management.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.160
Let's talk about it.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.160
How do you guys manage your time?

07:34.160 --> 07:36.160
And maybe I could help you out.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.160
Probably can.

07:39.160 --> 07:43.160
Because you're famously really poor at managing your time.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.160
Yeah.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.160
Some days you don't show up at all.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.160
And if you do, you're infamously late.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.160
Yeah.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.160
I'm always on time.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.160
You're constantly running behind.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.160
That's true.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.160
What was that?

07:56.160 --> 07:58.160
This is coffee.

07:58.160 --> 08:01.160
I'm definitely always running behind.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.160
But for records, I'm the first one here.

08:03.160 --> 08:04.160
The Zoom meeting starts.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.160
You have to.

08:05.160 --> 08:06.160
Well, you kind of have to be here, though.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.160
But I am.

08:07.160 --> 08:08.160
I have to be and I am.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.160
You have to do a lot of things.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.160
And you do.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.160
That's what time management is all about.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.160
Yeah.

08:13.160 --> 08:18.160
But like one time you took the call for the recording from your car.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.160
So.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.160
That's because I was right.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.160
That's one time.

08:22.160 --> 08:23.160
That's one time.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.160
Right.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.160
Years ago.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.160
Yeah.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.160
And I still made it there.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.160
The last couple.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.160
You got to end early.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.160
Because you said you had to go to thousand oaks.

08:32.160 --> 08:33.160
But you were running late.

08:33.160 --> 08:34.160
That was fine.

08:34.160 --> 08:36.160
A thousand oaks.

08:36.160 --> 08:37.160
Yeah.

08:37.160 --> 08:40.160
What did you actually do there?

08:40.160 --> 08:42.160
I ended up at IKEA.

08:44.160 --> 08:47.160
What about a thousand oaks dressing?

08:48.160 --> 08:50.160
That's actually.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.160
That's actually.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.160
Really.

08:53.160 --> 09:01.160
Um, eating lunch during a record.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.160
That's an example of good time management.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.160
I don't know about that.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.160
How do you figure?

09:06.160 --> 09:08.160
People don't like hearing it.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.160
Yeah.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.160
People don't like hearing it.

09:10.160 --> 09:13.160
But also I think even though it is.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.160
Good.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.160
For like.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.160
Using your time in other places.

09:18.160 --> 09:24.160
It's bad for your like general demeanor and attitude towards work.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.160
Why is that?

09:25.160 --> 09:28.160
Because I'm knowing on robin Anna.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.160
Yeah.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.160
Absolutely.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.160
It also like I fear you might crash because you're just.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.160
You're eating a lot of things.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.160
And then like at by the end of the episode.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.160
You might be dragging.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.160
What.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.160
What about you guys?

09:42.160 --> 09:44.160
Everybody wants to talk about my shit.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.160
Everybody wants to criticize my time management.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.160
Brad.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.160
You.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.160
Uh.

09:49.160 --> 09:50.160
What's your schedule?

09:50.160 --> 09:51.160
Normally like.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.160
Like my work schedule.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.160
We have work balance.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.160
I'm actually very organized.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.160
I block my time out.

09:58.160 --> 10:01.160
Well, before this, you were saying that you were like neglecting your relationship.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.160
Right?

10:02.160 --> 10:03.160
You're not making a time for you.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.160
I did not.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.160
I did not say that at all.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.160
We have a very strong relationship.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.160
We've been married for over seven years.

10:09.160 --> 10:10.160
Right.

10:13.160 --> 10:16.160
I would kindly ask you to keep my wife's name out.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.160
You're fucking mouth.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.160
I didn't say her name.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.160
And she.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.160
And I.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.160
Why?

10:23.160 --> 10:24.160
Name.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.160
Out your fucking.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.160
Bad time management.

10:31.160 --> 10:34.160
This pause is pregnant for no reason.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.160
I'm here.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.160
Because he kind of looked like he froze.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.160
Not.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.160
And then it was like a little menacing.

10:40.160 --> 10:41.160
What is this?

10:42.160 --> 10:44.160
I came up with a themed episode.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.160
Lunch and learn.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.160
Because this is a company podcast.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.160
I said I have a company man.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.160
And what are we doing?

10:50.160 --> 10:51.160
We're talking about Brad's fucking wife.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.160
What's your name?

10:52.160 --> 10:53.160
Sandy.

10:53.160 --> 10:55.160
Sandy.

10:55.160 --> 10:56.160
Sandy.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.160
Sandy.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.160
Summer.

10:58.160 --> 11:00.160
It's a hot summer.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.160
Sandy.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.160
Summer.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.160
So sorry.

11:05.160 --> 11:07.160
You're heating up summer.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.160
Sandy's.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.160
I'm in the summer.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.160
Boyle and hot.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.160
I'm here.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.160
You're planning a fucking wedding.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.160
You texted us at 11.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.160
20.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.160
Saying.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.160
Bring a lunch or a snack to the record.

11:19.160 --> 11:20.160
You didn't.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.160
Which is a.

11:21.160 --> 11:22.160
Right.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.160
Which is important.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.160
Not lunch time for you.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.160
Not enough time.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.160
That's absolutely.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.160
Time to get some.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.160
I said why.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.160
You didn't respond.

11:30.160 --> 11:31.160
Why?

11:31.160 --> 11:32.160
I said no.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.160
Didn't have to respond.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.160
You need to just follow directions.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.160
And now it's a themed episode.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.160
Because you fired.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.160
And you didn't know that.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.160
When would you rather.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.160
I've worked fucking text you to get.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.160
Yesterday.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.160
It's noon.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.160
You weren't planning on getting lunch in 40 minutes.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.160
Isn't enough time for you to get lunch?

11:49.160 --> 11:50.160
No.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.160
I'm not planning on eating during the show.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.160
I've never done that before.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.160
All right.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.160
That's why.

11:55.160 --> 11:56.160
Interesting, right?

11:56.160 --> 11:57.160
Kind of interesting to do that.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.160
But you weren't selling it.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.160
You were just telling me to do it.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.160
Communication skills.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.160
This is a good segue.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.160
I thought that that was good.

12:10.160 --> 12:16.160
But I think that the benefits of effective communication in the workplace cannot be overstated.

12:16.160 --> 12:21.160
What are you guys think that you could do better on in terms of communication?

12:21.160 --> 12:22.160
I'll start.

12:22.160 --> 12:27.160
I think I could maybe text what 20 minutes earlier.

12:27.160 --> 12:31.160
If I text too soon, you're going to forget that that's what is even happening.

12:31.160 --> 12:35.160
If I texted you at 9 a.m. this morning, you would not have had a lunch.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.160
That's true.

12:37.160 --> 12:42.160
Because again, I don't think it would be good if we were all eating while talking.

12:42.160 --> 12:46.160
And it's less like the time.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.160
Sure.

12:47.160 --> 12:51.160
Window of texting and more just like you didn't give any context.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.160
I wouldn't explain why.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.160
Big reveal.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.160
Big reveal.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.160
Remember when I showed my ass on the show?

12:57.160 --> 12:58.160
That was a big reveal.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.160
People loved it.

12:59.160 --> 13:00.160
They do.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.160
So what about this?

13:01.160 --> 13:02.160
Lunch and learn was a big reveal.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.160
I feel like you guys were floored in America's texting.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.160
Because emailing.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.160
Yeah.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.160
Or playing video games or something, I can't tell.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.160
That's not good.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.160
I'm sending an email.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.160
That's not focused or preparedness.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.160
No, I'm sending an email.

13:15.160 --> 13:18.160
And I would say good communication is like including email.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.160
Yeah.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.160
Body in the conversation.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.160
Then you weren't really including me because you're talking about West Coast stuff.

13:23.160 --> 13:24.160
So that's true.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.160
That's true.

13:25.160 --> 13:26.160
You know what? That's a good note.

13:26.160 --> 13:29.160
That's the first good note that I've received so far.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.160
Ever.

13:31.160 --> 13:33.160
Today.

13:33.160 --> 13:36.160
Today's lunch and learn.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.160
Brad.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.160
What a lunch and learn is.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.160
It's team building.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.160
It's where you have lunch and you learn about shit.

13:41.160 --> 13:43.160
How to make the company more cohesive and good.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.160
Kind of.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.160
I'm buying.

13:46.160 --> 13:47.160
I say no, but.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.160
Really not.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.160
What's that?

13:49.160 --> 13:51.160
What do you mean?

13:51.160 --> 13:53.160
It's not that.

13:53.160 --> 13:57.160
Usually it's like with another company.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.160
Or like like a.

13:59.160 --> 14:02.160
It's considered professional and expert professional.

14:02.160 --> 14:06.160
A 1099 contractor coming in for the road slash ages.

14:06.160 --> 14:09.160
And trying to figure out how we can come to the road.

14:09.160 --> 14:11.160
What's that?

14:11.160 --> 14:12.160
Coming up on the road.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.160
Carrow act style.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.160
Yeah.

14:14.160 --> 14:18.160
Consider me a Neil Cassidy of myself because I'm coming with a ton of energy.

14:18.160 --> 14:24.160
And I'm like keeping it should have float as it teeter burrows on the edge of chaos.

14:24.160 --> 14:28.160
You should do an episode where you talk to people at different companies.

14:28.160 --> 14:31.160
You should do an episode where you treat me with reverence.

14:31.160 --> 14:33.160
You should have earned my respect.

14:33.160 --> 14:38.160
And not just be given it by eating on.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.160
That's a great communication.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.160
Yeah.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.160
I think you should have used.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.160
I feel statements.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.160
I respect what he's saying.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.160
But I think he should have said.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.160
I feel like that's what you should do.

14:46.160 --> 14:48.160
So I don't know if that's good communication because I feel attacked.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.160
And I'm sorry.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.160
Every statement I say is I feel.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.160
That's why I say it.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.160
There are seven kinds of leadership skills.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.160
Can we all agree on that?

14:58.160 --> 14:59.160
No.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.160
What do you mean?

15:00.160 --> 15:01.160
No.

15:01.160 --> 15:05.160
We can't even agree on the basic premise of the lunch and learn.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.160
What are the seven as you know them?

15:07.160 --> 15:09.160
And I'll tell you yes or no.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.160
Strong and empowered coaching for me.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.160
Okay.

15:13.160 --> 15:18.160
Keeping employees engaged on the show or not.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.160
No.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.160
That's why I've got that down.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.160
I already falling apart.

15:21.160 --> 15:24.160
There's five left.

15:24.160 --> 15:33.160
Creating positive team dynamics as I see it.

15:33.160 --> 15:36.160
Okay.

15:36.160 --> 15:39.160
The Royal Eye.

15:39.160 --> 15:44.160
Effective negotiation or not.

15:45.160 --> 15:48.160
Who just said that?

15:48.160 --> 15:51.160
Not that the office.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.160
Don't be so easily distracted.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.160
People are here.

15:54.160 --> 15:58.160
Other people are in the studio.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.160
I know in the studio.

15:59.160 --> 16:00.160
But in the other studio.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.160
Yeah.

16:01.160 --> 16:04.160
I thought that we were doing summer Fridays.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.160
Not now.

16:05.160 --> 16:08.160
I'm just why I'm sending emails.

16:08.160 --> 16:13.160
Understanding and leveraging individual strengths and lack thereof.

16:13.160 --> 16:20.160
Like for example, a mirror's kind of funny and shit.

16:20.160 --> 16:24.160
But at the same time, he's not good about talking about his feelings.

16:24.160 --> 16:30.160
Marica is very good at bringing the heat on a weekly basis.

16:30.160 --> 16:38.160
But if she's not necessarily tired, she's not going to have that deadpan.

16:38.160 --> 16:42.160
Brad is good at climbing.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.160
And what is this?

16:44.160 --> 16:46.160
This is strengths and weaknesses of y'all.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.160
Okay.

16:47.160 --> 16:51.160
Brad is good at climbing, but not necessarily good at organizing his space.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.160
That's why his background's always cluttered and shit.

16:53.160 --> 16:55.160
It's not cluttered, man.

16:55.160 --> 16:58.160
How about you focus on your shit?

16:58.160 --> 16:59.160
What do you mean?

16:59.160 --> 17:02.160
It's not cluttered to me.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.160
It's cluttered to have.

17:04.160 --> 17:05.160
It's not.

17:05.160 --> 17:06.160
That was very organized.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.160
No.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.160
Look at how much stuff's on the top of it.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.160
You just need to pair down.

17:11.160 --> 17:15.160
My fear, and I've always said this to other people, but I don't tell me to pair down.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.160
How about I like it?

17:17.160 --> 17:19.160
My fear is that you're hoarding.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.160
I'm not.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.160
He's a collector.

17:22.160 --> 17:27.160
Hosting efficient and effective meetings.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.160
That's number six.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.160
Inefficient.

17:31.160 --> 17:33.160
Efficient.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.160
I thought he said inefficient.

17:35.160 --> 17:40.160
Developing and utilizing emotional intelligence or not.

17:40.160 --> 17:45.160
Those are the seven leadership skills.

17:45.160 --> 17:48.160
I know I have six out of the seven.

17:48.160 --> 17:52.160
What do you guys think your last one you have to work on is?

17:52.160 --> 17:53.160
No, I mean.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.160
No.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.160
No.

17:55.160 --> 17:58.160
They were all or not, so we all have.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.160
They weren't all or not.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.160
They were three.

18:01.160 --> 18:03.160
These are the ones I have.

18:03.160 --> 18:06.160
Keeping employees engaged or not.

18:06.160 --> 18:09.160
It's kind of a coin flip every week.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.160
Whether you guys buy in or not, right?

18:11.160 --> 18:12.160
Sometimes we're all in the same page.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.160
We're experiencing joy.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.160
Other times.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.160
Everyone's texting.

18:16.160 --> 18:20.160
Creating positive team dynamics or not.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.160
Same pen and every week.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.160
I'm not.

18:23.160 --> 18:27.160
Criticized my room and put my wife's name in.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.160
Not the room.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.160
The room is great.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.160
We should say the room is incredible.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.160
It's organization or lack thereof.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.160
It's the accumulating objects that you might not ever need or use,

18:36.160 --> 18:38.160
but you don't even know you have them.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.160
They're all right there.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.160
Right, but that beat them being in the room doesn't mean you're using them.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.160
But I am.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.160
Amir's in the studio.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.160
Is he using the frame TV?

18:48.160 --> 18:49.160
No.

18:49.160 --> 18:50.160
It's just there.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.160
I don't know.

18:51.160 --> 18:53.160
What about my.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.160
What about my.

18:55.160 --> 18:58.160
You're being attacked.

18:59.160 --> 19:02.160
Everything you say has three people disagree.

19:02.160 --> 19:05.160
You're energy up.

19:05.160 --> 19:06.160
You know, no.

19:06.160 --> 19:09.160
I would say Marika's room is perfectly organized.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.160
She also is bringing.

19:10.160 --> 19:15.160
She's brought in some plant life to balance out the clutter and garbage.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.160
You know what I mean?

19:16.160 --> 19:19.160
So it's like on one side.

19:19.160 --> 19:23.160
Here's here's my note for Brad's business car bridge.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.160
Here's my note for Brad's room.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.160
And this is going to answer Marika's question.

19:28.160 --> 19:31.160
If you want to keep all that garbage.

19:31.160 --> 19:32.160
Do it faster.

19:32.160 --> 19:34.160
Not in garbage, man.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.160
I'm getting mad now.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.160
Do it for sure.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.160
But it's garbage.

19:38.160 --> 19:40.160
What do you see that's garbage?

19:40.160 --> 19:43.160
There's literally a plant right there, man.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.160
Is that real or is that artificial?

19:44.160 --> 19:46.160
There's a fake one and a real one.

19:46.160 --> 19:50.160
Everything there has sentimental value in your tattoo.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.160
See your TTV.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.160
You got to get rid of that.

19:53.160 --> 19:54.160
You don't know.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.160
I use it every day.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.160
For what?

19:57.160 --> 20:08.160
I watch VHS films slash also put my computer screen onto it and watch podcasts on it.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.160
Really?

20:09.160 --> 20:10.160
Yeah.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.160
That's actually actually awesome.

20:12.160 --> 20:15.160
That's actually genuinely awesome.

20:15.160 --> 20:16.160
Yeah.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.160
Where'd you get it?

20:17.160 --> 20:20.160
Where did I get the TV?

20:20.160 --> 20:21.160
Yeah.

20:21.160 --> 20:24.160
A thrift store from the 90s.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.160
Let's talk about it.

20:26.160 --> 20:30.160
How do you attach a new computer to an old TV like that?

20:30.160 --> 20:31.160
How do you question?

20:31.160 --> 20:34.160
I have the sentences that are good to read.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.160
Yeah.

20:35.160 --> 20:36.160
I have an white thing.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.160
Yeah.

20:37.160 --> 20:38.160
Yeah.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.160
The RCA converter.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.160
Yeah.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.160
Plug it in to the Macbook.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.160
Yeah.

20:43.160 --> 20:47.160
Can we see it while you're on the Zoom or is it?

20:47.160 --> 20:48.160
Sure.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.160
Let me turn it on.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.160
Well, actually, I have my dongle connected.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.160
But I can put a something on.

20:54.160 --> 20:58.160
But I prefer a little ambiance over the garden wall maybe.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.160
And that's nice.

20:59.160 --> 21:00.160
Love that.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.160
It's not Halloween time.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.160
But that's fine.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.160
Let's get into it.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.160
Brad is networking.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.160
Network not wearing his headphones.

21:06.160 --> 21:07.160
Yeah.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.160
Let's figure this out.

21:08.160 --> 21:09.160
Just the rules.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.160
Because it's his birthday today.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.160
I wanted to let you guys know.

21:11.160 --> 21:12.160
It's not his birthday.

21:12.160 --> 21:17.160
I know because we're going to say you're always going to say.

21:17.160 --> 21:20.160
But then I say something and you're like actually I was going to say something

21:20.160 --> 21:21.160
really interesting.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.160
No, you weren't.

21:22.160 --> 21:25.160
I was going to say we should do like a surprise thing.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.160
Like now that is.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.160
No, I agree.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.160
Headphones are off.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.160
We should like come back up.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.160
Here we go.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.160
Surprise.

21:33.160 --> 21:34.160
It's a lunch and learn.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.160
And we're talking about networking.

21:37.160 --> 21:39.160
Let's go one by one.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.160
Sorry.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.160
I agree.

21:41.160 --> 21:44.160
It was the last time you talked to somebody outside the network.

21:44.160 --> 21:48.160
Who was in a position of power, who could help this show about this show?

21:52.160 --> 21:54.160
Overlaping dialogue.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.160
These long pauses.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.160
Everybody gets on my case for like the long pauses.

21:57.160 --> 21:58.160
The pregnant pauses.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.160
This is Marika.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.160
You crazy question.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.160
Who did you question?

22:01.160 --> 22:03.160
A question about the show.

22:03.160 --> 22:04.160
Nobody.

22:04.160 --> 22:05.160
I don't talk about it.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.160
So that's the area where you can improve.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.160
That's an area that you can improve networking.

22:10.160 --> 22:13.160
You have to stop eating a side man.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.160
Let's say.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.160
You're chugging a cold.

22:16.160 --> 22:20.160
You're eating just thousands of calories of fruit.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.160
Look at you.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.160
You're shaking.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.160
I'm nervous.

22:23.160 --> 22:24.160
Of course.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.160
I go to the world.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.160
I go to bars every kid and I network.

22:27.160 --> 22:28.160
I mix.

22:28.160 --> 22:32.160
And it's help people about the show that you host.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.160
I'm like, I've heard that.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.160
I ain't gonna block us.

22:34.160 --> 22:35.160
No you're not.

22:35.160 --> 22:36.160
Yes I am.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.160
And I do a weird voice.

22:37.160 --> 22:41.160
They don't recognize me because of course they're already listening.

22:41.160 --> 22:47.160
They listen to the show and they don't know it's you because you disguise your voice.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.160
Multiple choice question.

22:49.160 --> 22:52.160
Two weeks ago, I went to 4,100 bar and silver.

22:52.160 --> 22:58.160
Like, and did I run into an actor that I recognized and went up to and said, hey, like, wait,

22:58.160 --> 22:59.160
are you blanks friend?

22:59.160 --> 23:01.160
Because I thought I knew her from somewhere.

23:01.160 --> 23:04.160
And it wasn't someone I knew personally.

23:04.160 --> 23:08.160
It was just an actor that was in Finn and Wolfhardt and Billy Brick's movie.

23:08.160 --> 23:11.160
And then she was like, I also recognized you.

23:11.160 --> 23:15.160
And I turned out I recognized her from Finn's movie.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.160
And she recognized me from head go.

23:17.160 --> 23:18.160
Who cares?

23:18.160 --> 23:23.160
And then B is none of the above and C is all of the above.

23:23.160 --> 23:26.160
Only one though above it.

23:26.160 --> 23:30.160
Well, B would be not anything above it, which would be not the first one.

23:30.160 --> 23:34.160
And then C would be both of the first two, which is the thing I said.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.160
And then also none of the above.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.160
So a paradox.

23:38.160 --> 23:39.160
Parity.

23:39.160 --> 23:42.160
And also A and B are the same.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.160
Mmm, that's true.

23:45.160 --> 23:49.160
When was the last time you networked about this show?

23:49.160 --> 23:50.160
About this show.

23:50.160 --> 23:53.160
I try not to tell anybody about this show.

23:53.160 --> 23:54.160
Why?

23:54.160 --> 23:56.160
It's an embarrassment.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.160
Not of riches.

23:58.160 --> 24:01.160
I was going to say of riches.

24:01.160 --> 24:02.160
Yeah.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.160
No.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.160
It's a shame.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.160
It's a black mark.

24:05.160 --> 24:07.160
It's a scarlet letter.

24:07.160 --> 24:10.160
But like you said that we were hearing a pitch from

24:11.160 --> 24:12.160
Right?

24:12.160 --> 24:14.160
You didn't tell me about that.

24:14.160 --> 24:15.160
I can podcast.

24:15.160 --> 24:17.160
Don't include this.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.160
Yeah.

24:18.160 --> 24:19.160
Bleep the name.

24:19.160 --> 24:21.160
But you didn't tell him.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.160
Didn't tell him.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.160
You didn't tell me about that.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.160
I can podcast.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.160
Why do you want to be on the network?

24:26.160 --> 24:29.160
It's not anywhere near his house.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.160
Because actually show.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.160
Show.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.160
Show.

24:32.160 --> 24:34.160
Show.

24:34.160 --> 24:35.160
Show.

24:35.160 --> 24:37.160
Really?

24:37.160 --> 24:38.160
No.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.160
You haven't heard?

24:39.160 --> 24:40.160
Yeah.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.160
Brad.

24:41.160 --> 24:42.160
No networking and Portland.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.160
You don't go to like revolution hall and like wax.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.160
Actually.

24:44.160 --> 24:45.160
No.

24:45.160 --> 24:46.160
I was not to talk to for Brad.

24:46.160 --> 24:50.160
But I feel like he's probably the person that would actually talk about the show

24:50.160 --> 24:53.160
the most for his job to other people.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.160
True or false.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.160
Brad.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.160
False.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.160
All right.

24:58.160 --> 25:00.160
We got to talk about change management.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.160
Wait.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.160
I was going to tell you about.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.160
I actually was.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.160
Oh my god.

25:04.160 --> 25:07.160
Thank you.

25:07.160 --> 25:10.160
Thank you to athletic greens for sponsoring this episode of our show guys.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.160
It's hard to keep up with a supplement routine.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.160
All right.

25:13.160 --> 25:14.160
I tried it.

25:14.160 --> 25:18.160
I literally had like a basket of vitamins and I was taking like 18 pills a day.

25:18.160 --> 25:20.160
There's no way that that's sustainable.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.160
And it wasn't.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.160
I stopped doing it.

25:22.160 --> 25:26.160
And then we started getting athletic greens shipped to the office.

25:26.160 --> 25:28.160
Before it was even a sponsor of this show,

25:28.160 --> 25:32.160
I started taking it and I started achieving the same results from my supplement

25:32.160 --> 25:33.160
routine before.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.160
But from one single drink.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.160
My routine is I wake up.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.160
I have a full glass of water these days.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.160
So that I'm hydrated.

25:39.160 --> 25:41.160
Then I have my athletic greens.

25:41.160 --> 25:42.160
And then I have my cold brew.

25:42.160 --> 25:47.160
It's this whole little like one, two, three punch where the cold brew is what I'm like

25:47.160 --> 25:48.160
earning in the morning.

25:48.160 --> 25:51.160
And that's a really good feeling when you start with the water and then you do the

25:51.160 --> 25:52.160
AG one.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.160
And then you do cold brew.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.160
Your sort of off to the races.

25:54.160 --> 25:57.160
And you feel like you've done one thing for your health.

25:57.160 --> 26:00.160
And it just it helps jump start my day and give me that zip.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.160
That's up.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.160
Sorry.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.160
But I had to go improv with it.

26:04.160 --> 26:08.160
I'm always looking for life hacks also, which is why I've come to love and trust

26:08.160 --> 26:09.160
AG one.

26:09.160 --> 26:10.160
Because again, it is a life hack.

26:10.160 --> 26:13.160
Instead of swallowing a bunch of pills, which I don't even like doing by the way.

26:13.160 --> 26:14.160
It's not comfortable for me.

26:14.160 --> 26:19.160
I'd rather have a sweet kind of tropical tasting drink that I know is giving me 75

26:19.160 --> 26:23.160
high quality vitamins, minerals, and whole food source ingredients of the highest quality

26:23.160 --> 26:26.160
that give me major benefits like gut and mood support.

26:26.160 --> 26:28.160
Boosted energy and even healthier looking skin.

26:28.160 --> 26:30.160
Hair and nails, guys.

26:31.160 --> 26:33.160
So if you're looking for an easier way to take supplements,

26:33.160 --> 26:37.160

26:46.160 --> 26:49.160
Guys, this episode is sponsored by Better Help.

26:49.160 --> 26:54.160
I don't know if you guys feel this way, but sometimes in life you are faced with tough decisions

26:54.160 --> 26:56.160
that could send you in any which way.

26:56.160 --> 26:59.160
And you don't know which is the right path to take, right?

26:59.160 --> 27:04.160
And sometimes you don't know who to turn to talk to because everyone in your life has their own personal biases

27:04.160 --> 27:06.160
of course, positive and negative.

27:06.160 --> 27:10.160
And that's where therapy can come in because when you're making decisions around career

27:10.160 --> 27:14.160
relationships or anything else, therapy helps you stay connected to what you really

27:14.160 --> 27:16.160
want while you navigate life.

27:16.160 --> 27:20.160
And it helps you to trust yourself to make the decisions that align with your values,

27:20.160 --> 27:21.160
like anything.

27:21.160 --> 27:22.160
All right?

27:22.160 --> 27:24.160
The more you practice it, the easier it gets.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.160
And I've had that experience with therapy.

27:25.160 --> 27:28.160
I'm in therapy every week as much as I can be.

27:28.160 --> 27:34.160
And it makes me a better version of myself, a better versed version of myself within myself,

27:34.160 --> 27:38.160
to know myself better, to know why I'm making certain decisions, why am I reacting this way.

27:38.160 --> 27:43.160
And again, I say this every week, but it helps me be the best version of myself for the people around me.

27:43.160 --> 27:47.160
If you don't care enough about yourself, you might care about everyone around you,

27:47.160 --> 27:48.160
everyone you love.

27:48.160 --> 27:52.160
That might drive you to be the best version of yourself.

27:52.160 --> 27:55.160
You know, that that's a positive force in your life to people, right?

27:55.160 --> 28:01.160
To understand yourself is to show up for those around you who you care about in the best way possible.

28:01.160 --> 28:04.160
So if you're thinking of starting therapy, give better help a try.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.160
Thanks, better help.

28:29.160 --> 28:30.160
To one conversation.

28:30.160 --> 28:34.160
I was in LA, and I met Miles, bouncing your right.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.160
Why? Why was he around?

28:35.160 --> 28:37.160
We were at VidCon.

28:37.160 --> 28:38.160
He did a pants call.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.160
That's sweet.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.160
We talked about the headcom podcast.

28:41.160 --> 28:42.160
What'd you say?

28:42.160 --> 28:44.160
I said, doesn't it suck?

28:44.160 --> 28:45.160
You said.

28:45.160 --> 28:46.160
Mm.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.160
Yeah.

28:47.160 --> 28:50.160
He said Jeff couldn't even get me in frame on the last episode.

28:50.160 --> 28:54.160
We both had a nice laugh about it.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.160
That is good.

28:55.160 --> 28:58.160
And he was there as a producer of a podcast.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.160
So you're an amateur.

28:59.160 --> 29:02.160
You're an amateur man of an hour.

29:02.160 --> 29:04.160
You're an amateur hour man, basically.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.160
Yeah.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.160
And gets his more of a brother than it does.

29:07.160 --> 29:10.160
I'd love to make this podcast presentable.

29:10.160 --> 29:14.160
Like as the marketing person.

29:14.160 --> 29:17.160
That this company has been nice to be able to talk about.

29:18.160 --> 29:20.160
It's not successful or accessible.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.160
It's great.

29:21.160 --> 29:24.160
Let's kind of just like, if you're there, you're.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.160
Okay.

29:25.160 --> 29:26.160
Well, you know what?

29:26.160 --> 29:29.160
This is a great segue into change management.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.160
Are you guys familiar?

29:31.160 --> 29:32.160
No.

29:32.160 --> 29:33.160
So change management.

29:35.160 --> 29:38.160
Overlapping conversation.

29:38.160 --> 29:42.160
Change management is like being flexible and

29:42.160 --> 29:44.160
changing with the environments, right?

29:44.160 --> 29:50.160
As the industry shifts, so does need to the show have.

29:50.160 --> 29:55.160
So, you know, since it premiered in May of 2020 or whatever the fuck.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.160
I feel like it's changed a lot.

29:57.160 --> 30:02.160
And that's an example of good change management.

30:02.160 --> 30:05.160
But Maria, I hear you and I respect your opinion.

30:05.160 --> 30:08.160
You're saying you want the show to change for the better.

30:08.160 --> 30:11.160
I'm wondering how you see that change management going.

30:11.160 --> 30:16.160
And let's make this America's brothers for three and a half minutes.

30:16.160 --> 30:25.160
I think that if we could find a way to introduce new audiences to the concept of the show and

30:25.160 --> 30:30.160
a not hostile manner.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.160
Finding people inside joke.

30:32.160 --> 30:34.160
I'm your blowing himself.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.160
I'm your power.

30:35.160 --> 30:36.160
I'm here.

30:36.160 --> 30:39.160
There's no way anybody can listen to this.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.160
Yeah.

30:40.160 --> 30:44.160
Um, I mean, I think you're like, I'm, yeah.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.160
Do you have multiple awesome people?

30:46.160 --> 30:47.160
Yeah.

30:47.160 --> 30:49.160
What was so frozen solid?

30:49.160 --> 30:52.160
So he's been kind of like scraping little bits off.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.160
Yeah, chiseling off.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.160
Yeah.

30:54.160 --> 30:55.160
Yeah.

30:55.160 --> 30:56.160
Three minutes.

30:56.160 --> 31:04.160
No, I think if we, you know, he are able to post social videos

31:04.160 --> 31:07.160
everyone's in a while that are like pretty good out of context.

31:07.160 --> 31:14.160
Sage has been doing a great job at making like all of the song clips into TikToks

31:14.160 --> 31:18.160
and those have some of those of like popped off, which is nice.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.160
Oh, yeah.

31:19.160 --> 31:21.160
I think I'm doing the one going.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.160
Doing okay.

31:22.160 --> 31:29.160
Um, not viral for sure, but a couple, couple thousand views.

31:29.160 --> 31:30.160
Yeah.

31:30.160 --> 31:31.160
It's hard.

31:31.160 --> 31:32.160
So we'll take that.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.160
What a lonely bed.

31:33.160 --> 31:34.160
A couple.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.160
Yeah.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.160
I guess Ruth is.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.160
So we're talking about supposed to talk about it.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.160
It's only been a couple of hours.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.160
That's take good.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.160
No, it's been a day.

31:41.160 --> 31:49.600
No, um, but it's got like 3,000, something, view someone just commented that that this

31:49.600 --> 31:52.160
was the role you're born to play.

31:52.160 --> 31:57.120
I, you know, won Uz in the, like being talked about, right now, through an

31:57.120 --> 31:59.120
allotted tomathyshellamy.

31:59.120 --> 32:04.160
Hashtags on the hopes they would pop off and it hasn't yet, but that's fine.

32:04.160 --> 32:08.400
If are sure, it's also kind of the director, Paddington.

32:09.200 --> 32:12.000
So people love that guy. People love that guy.

32:12.960 --> 32:15.440
So there's hope that this one. I feel like a mirror doesn't understand

32:15.440 --> 32:16.960
where he could drillers or how it works.

32:17.600 --> 32:22.880
There is hope for both a mirror and for the movie.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.560
It looks so bad though.

32:26.080 --> 32:29.600
Yeah, but I will watch. I will be seated.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.480
Oh, I'm going to watch it.

32:31.200 --> 32:35.040
Um, but back to the show.

32:35.040 --> 32:40.880
Also, a similar thing like timely discussions are always good.

32:40.880 --> 32:43.920
Yeah, topical with some exciting guests.

32:43.920 --> 32:47.440
Yeah, we love exciting guests. We call to try and get like

32:48.480 --> 32:53.520
other internet e people on the show.

32:53.520 --> 32:57.120
I'm sure like Brad, who do you think would be a good guest on the show?

32:58.080 --> 33:03.520
I think Brittany Broski would be really funny on the show.

33:03.520 --> 33:08.560
Ben and Emil from the Patience podcast would be really funny on the show.

33:08.560 --> 33:11.280
You know, who would be good? Bobby?

33:11.280 --> 33:12.240
I'm Jack Talk.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.240
That podcaster who's always like really small.

33:15.280 --> 33:20.640
Right. That, that, that, um, she's like a young mother.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.120
Right.

33:23.120 --> 33:25.920
You know, you haven't seen this person. She's all over TikTok. She's like,

33:26.720 --> 33:27.840
why did you do that?

33:27.840 --> 33:30.880
And then the guest is like, oh, I don't know. I thought this would be good.

33:30.880 --> 33:34.560
And she's like, so you think this? And they're like, no, no, I don't think because she's like

33:34.560 --> 33:36.000
corners. I'm into canceling themselves.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.520
I think you should go on chicken shop date.

33:40.160 --> 33:43.360
I can't do that. That's like a really crazy.

33:43.360 --> 33:46.800
What a huge reach. That's like saying, I think you should go on the fucking remote.

33:46.800 --> 33:49.600
Anything anymore. So I'm not allowed to either.

33:49.600 --> 33:53.440
Yeah, but like not not your face isn't you.

33:53.440 --> 33:53.920
Yeah.

33:53.920 --> 33:56.800
Also nobody cares about you. So you can do whatever you want.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.520
Like, if you did a patcho, nobody would be like, oh my god.

33:59.520 --> 34:03.520
Yeah, but who cares? Like, nobody would even know this sort of mind.

34:05.120 --> 34:08.720
Like, oh, I heard Jeff James was on a fucking podcast.

34:08.720 --> 34:12.560
Like, who gets up in arms about that? You're barely in the union, right?

34:14.160 --> 34:17.920
Like, does anybody care if you're in or out at this point?

34:17.920 --> 34:20.880
It's not like you're piciting or part of a team, right?

34:21.600 --> 34:22.800
It doesn't feel like you're...

34:24.960 --> 34:26.240
No, do not.

34:31.120 --> 34:35.600
How about you? Have to blur, bleep, bleep, cut, all of it.

34:36.320 --> 34:37.920
Yeah. We will. We will. Yeah.

34:39.200 --> 34:40.960
Why have intent fade, I wonder.

34:46.160 --> 34:47.120
We'll cut entirely.

34:50.880 --> 34:54.880
What's the issue? Is it that we don't have the ends?

34:54.880 --> 34:58.160
Because I refuse to believe that. I think it's that we're not putting our resources towards this show.

34:58.720 --> 35:01.440
Which, by the way, there's a lot of room to grow. So I kind of resent that.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.360
Cheryl Heinz's show didn't do well at all.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.960
Yes, it did. Really?

35:06.960 --> 35:09.440
Yeah. How many really big shows?

35:09.440 --> 35:10.240
I didn't know that.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.560
Yeah. She's never at the stew.

35:13.440 --> 35:14.960
Right. Well, they recorded it.

35:15.600 --> 35:16.800
We're still separately.

35:16.800 --> 35:20.160
Brenwood. Here's my...

35:24.160 --> 35:28.640
You're always wrong and then you just sort of jump on people for acting you.

35:31.360 --> 35:34.160
Who can we get then? Scott Walker, but I thought it would be funny.

35:34.160 --> 35:36.720
But he doesn't run the whole podcast industry anymore.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.640
I feel like that's probably like Conan.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.640
Let's get Conan. We can't get Conan. He's fucking rich.

35:42.640 --> 35:43.840
Sure we can. I actually know Conan.

35:43.920 --> 35:47.360
A single guest that he has is like the biggest person you've ever heard of.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.440
He doesn't want in the show. He's my uncle.

35:50.080 --> 35:51.600
Conan O'Brien's not your uncle.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.080
Yeah. No. Uncle Cones.

35:54.080 --> 35:57.200
No, because it doesn't even... This is nothing. This is nothing.

35:58.800 --> 35:59.600
What do you mean?

35:59.600 --> 36:02.160
The lunch and learn. It's devolved into nothing.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.520
Now we're talking about your uncle being Conan, which is just a lie.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.040
It's why would I lie about that?

36:08.480 --> 36:11.920
That's how I got this job. That's how I got into the podcast industry.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.200
Let's talk about breaking the ice.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.600
I'm a nepo, baby. Let's talk about breaking the ice.

36:16.880 --> 36:19.040
How do you guys choose to break the ice?

36:19.040 --> 36:21.920
Maybe in specific regards, so like trying to get new guests.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.560
Is that a cold email? Is that a cold DM?

36:24.560 --> 36:26.640
Usually tell them my uncle.

36:27.440 --> 36:28.640
Ooh, tell them.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.480
I think the Bobby person would be good. I don't know her last name.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.000
I don't think you're trying about.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.640
Okay.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.120
It could also get Andy Richter.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.160
This is my godfather.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.560
Oh, inksons.

36:48.560 --> 36:51.840
Conan O'Brien's your uncle and then Andy Richter's your godfather.

36:51.840 --> 36:52.720
Five men.

36:52.720 --> 36:53.280
Yeah.

36:53.280 --> 36:56.320
Oh, and the masturbating bear did my bris.

36:58.000 --> 36:58.720
Don't mass.

36:58.720 --> 37:08.480
Um, I don't, maybe I'm not up to damn the internet. Right? Twitters.

37:08.480 --> 37:10.000
Sounds like you're not.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.000
They did no verbal.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.120
Brittany Broski was.

37:13.120 --> 37:14.960
We had Sally Darron this fucking show.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.000
I want to have her back.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.520
I wanted to, I do want to have Sally Darron back.

37:17.520 --> 37:18.240
I was DMing her.

37:18.240 --> 37:19.040
She's great.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.160
But I don't know.

37:20.160 --> 37:22.000
Who's at the top of TikTok right now?

37:22.800 --> 37:26.000
TikTok doesn't translate to podcasts.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.440
What's the internet then?

37:27.440 --> 37:29.200
You just said you want more internet personalities.

37:29.200 --> 37:31.200
So you mean more podcast personalities?

37:31.200 --> 37:32.400
Well, this is a podcast.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.680
That's also on YouTube.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.760
So I like YouTube personalities.

37:36.400 --> 37:36.880
Okay.

37:36.880 --> 37:39.280
Let's go to YouTube and see the first person that pops up.

37:39.280 --> 37:40.720
Mr. Beast.

37:42.720 --> 37:46.240
I've received a watch to my first Mr. Beast video.

37:46.240 --> 37:46.880
Yeah.

37:46.880 --> 37:49.440
His tweet about it was so intriguing.

37:49.440 --> 37:50.240
What do you think?

37:50.240 --> 37:54.800
And he's really figured something out that guy.

37:54.880 --> 38:00.720
It's just eight minutes of balls to the wall expensive insanity.

38:00.720 --> 38:01.600
And he's out.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.960
He's like, hey, we bought a train.

38:02.960 --> 38:03.920
We're going to drive into a pit.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.760
But first I'm going to blow up $50,000.

38:05.760 --> 38:08.960
And then before that, I'm going to see if any of these mannequins can survive a fall

38:08.960 --> 38:09.760
from outer space.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.440
And you're just like, oh my god.

38:11.440 --> 38:14.400
And then before you can even think about it, he's doing this all.

38:14.400 --> 38:15.440
And then the video ends.

38:15.440 --> 38:16.560
And you're just like, holy shit.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.320
He's like, also that cost $3 million.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.720
And I made $270,000 on ad revenue.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.640
I'm like, this is so much information.

38:23.280 --> 38:26.960
It's all shot in a very exciting fashion and edited really tightly.

38:27.760 --> 38:31.520
Well, I have ideas for this show, but nobody wants to fund the shit.

38:31.520 --> 38:36.000
I keep emailing Katie being like, hey, remember those three ideas we met about in May?

38:36.000 --> 38:37.360
And she's like, I'll get back to you.

38:37.360 --> 38:43.040
To be clear, Ali and Katie brought one of them up to you at the live show.

38:43.040 --> 38:45.120
And you didn't know what they were talking about.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.120
And it was an idea that you pitched and had.

38:48.480 --> 38:50.960
And said, honestly, you studied you in self fun.

38:51.040 --> 38:52.640
And we were like, no, don't do that.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.120
No, I want to do that one.

38:55.120 --> 38:59.920
Katie, we were like, no, don't self fund it.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.360
Oh, I'm not going to.

39:01.360 --> 39:02.400
But here's the other issue.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.600
It's fucking hot.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.760
So that involves being out in the sun.

39:06.640 --> 39:07.520
Sure, yeah, yeah.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.200
And so now we have to wait.

39:09.200 --> 39:13.680
Oh, it's a, it's a weird time in the industry.

39:13.680 --> 39:16.240
And it's the perfect time to do something.

39:16.960 --> 39:18.240
There's two ways of trying.

39:18.240 --> 39:19.760
This is of today, yeah.

39:19.760 --> 39:20.480
Sure.

39:21.200 --> 39:21.760
Sure.

39:22.960 --> 39:23.920
What do you want to do?

39:24.640 --> 39:25.440
You do you.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.600
He's high on our side.

39:31.600 --> 39:32.800
It's happening.

39:32.800 --> 39:33.520
This is him.

39:33.520 --> 39:34.960
Man, so I'm proud of him.

39:34.960 --> 39:35.680
He's high.

39:35.680 --> 39:36.800
He's shot the goal.

39:36.800 --> 39:37.760
This is a video.

39:37.760 --> 39:39.520
It's not in blue berries.

39:39.520 --> 39:43.840
Why are so many of them just four squares of like, attractive

39:43.840 --> 39:44.720
ish people?

39:44.720 --> 39:45.520
You know what I mean?

39:45.520 --> 39:47.200
None of us are like movie star.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.760
Maybe Jake, but now he's a dad.

39:49.760 --> 39:51.360
So you know what's going to get the dad bond?

39:51.360 --> 39:52.800
And that's kind of a sad bond.

39:52.800 --> 39:53.600
Yeah.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.800
Brad's looking good, though.

39:54.800 --> 39:55.360
Marika too.

39:56.960 --> 39:58.400
Brad has a bad bond.

39:58.400 --> 40:03.120
Hey, just going to be napping in 12 minutes.

40:03.120 --> 40:05.920
Yeah, it's going to be so harsh.

40:05.920 --> 40:08.880
It took you 30, seven minutes to eat that.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.880
What if we do we eat the whole time?

40:12.880 --> 40:16.960
I mean, I love if you had all of the money.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.560
To spend on this show, Jeff, what would we do?

40:18.560 --> 40:19.600
All right, I do.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.360
Tour, Mr. Beast style.

40:21.360 --> 40:22.560
Just a tour.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.000
Like, I'm not ashamed of all.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.120
This is why I don't understand, right?

40:25.120 --> 40:27.120
I keep saying, can we please do a mini tour?

40:27.120 --> 40:29.360
And then Katie's like, Marty says, we don't have the budget.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.160
And I'm like, budget.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.200
We're going to make money off the shit.

40:32.160 --> 40:32.880
Will we?

40:32.880 --> 40:34.640
Still have to spend money.

40:34.640 --> 40:39.440
We love making money off of like the live shows that we do

40:39.440 --> 40:44.720
because we, well, when we did like the had gum live and stuff,

40:44.800 --> 40:48.400
we make sure that like the performers could cut

40:48.400 --> 40:50.960
of their ticket revenue for their show.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.960
We all were like traveling there.

40:52.960 --> 40:55.040
So we're paying for airfare.

40:55.040 --> 40:58.240
And it was just like an marketing expense.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.800
Basically, that was very fun.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.320
And we didn't make some money back.

41:02.320 --> 41:05.120
But I mean, Jeff, how many people would have to go to your show

41:05.120 --> 41:08.640
to free you to break even like flying there, staying there.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.800
Other, your guests too.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.320
I don't know, that's not my job.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.080
To figure out some others, right?

41:14.080 --> 41:15.280
It's not.

41:15.280 --> 41:16.320
So I don't know.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.400
I'm also like, what if we just do New York and LA?

41:19.120 --> 41:19.920
And Portland?

41:20.480 --> 41:20.800
Nope.

41:22.800 --> 41:27.760
I think I mean, I think it's some possibility by the end of the year.

41:27.760 --> 41:28.400
Okay.

41:28.400 --> 41:29.920
So in the fall, maybe.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.760
Fred, we could do revolution hall.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.000
How big is revolution hall?

41:36.000 --> 41:37.200
It's way too big, right?

41:37.200 --> 41:39.120
NAD pod is doing revolution hall.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.800
Yeah, we can't do NAD pod numbers.

41:40.880 --> 41:44.800
We could probably do like a shitty, um, yeah.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.080
We could definitely do a store.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.160
Oh, my fucking God.

41:50.160 --> 41:50.880
This was real.

41:50.880 --> 41:52.880
I answer, answer my question.

41:52.880 --> 41:53.840
That was like a question.

41:53.840 --> 41:54.720
Which is the Rick?

41:54.720 --> 41:55.440
What's the question?

41:55.440 --> 41:56.800
If I had all the money in the world, what do I do?

41:57.440 --> 42:01.440
No, if we had all the money to spend on this show,

42:02.480 --> 42:03.280
what would you do?

42:04.480 --> 42:08.640
I kind of, it's hard because I'm only thought about this realistically,

42:08.640 --> 42:10.880
because I don't like any amount of hopes up to be disappointed.

42:10.880 --> 42:13.280
I do want to do that if, well, no,

42:13.280 --> 42:14.400
because I don't even want to talk about it,

42:14.400 --> 42:15.440
because it has to be a surprise.

42:15.440 --> 42:16.400
But I don't want to bleep this.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.200
I want to do that.

42:18.800 --> 42:19.360
Yeah, that's so.

42:21.200 --> 42:22.320
Yeah, it doesn't have to be there.

42:22.320 --> 42:22.960
It could be anywhere.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.440
That's similar to that place.

42:25.440 --> 42:30.240
And then, if we had, like, tens of millions of dollars,

42:30.240 --> 42:32.800
I would want to do a show at Madison Square Garden.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.960
We're like every scene is for sale.

42:37.600 --> 42:37.920
Yeah.

42:37.920 --> 42:40.400
And resell, like, 200 tickets.

42:40.400 --> 42:42.000
I think we could sell it out.

42:42.960 --> 42:45.200
I think we could make that go viral.

42:45.200 --> 42:45.680
Yeah.

42:45.680 --> 42:45.920
Yeah.

42:47.120 --> 42:49.200
I don't know what the rental is for that.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.400
It's probably a million dollars.

42:50.400 --> 42:51.440
So it's just not.

42:51.440 --> 42:52.240
I can ask.

42:52.240 --> 42:53.520
That would be so funny.

42:53.520 --> 42:54.560
Uh, okay, come on.

42:54.560 --> 42:55.520
You don't.

42:55.520 --> 42:56.720
He's never done it.

42:56.720 --> 42:58.240
I don't even even do MSC.

42:58.240 --> 43:00.000
Oh, I think he couldn't see.

43:00.400 --> 43:02.560
Conan's definitely done radio city.

43:02.560 --> 43:03.040
Yeah.

43:03.040 --> 43:05.440
I'm in this funny as MSG because everything is like,

43:05.440 --> 43:06.720
when he's 6,000.

43:06.720 --> 43:07.200
Hold on.

43:09.200 --> 43:11.040
And I think it's the sweet spot because that also,

43:11.040 --> 43:12.960
you could be like, oh, what about giant stadium?

43:12.960 --> 43:15.520
But I'm like, that's too big that it's like,

43:15.520 --> 43:16.720
somehow not funny anymore.

43:16.720 --> 43:19.120
MSG's perfect because it's like, theoretically,

43:19.120 --> 43:21.280
there have been comedy shows there.

43:21.280 --> 43:23.600
And it's like, we are kind of the bottom of the barrel,

43:23.600 --> 43:24.960
especially in regards to like this.

43:24.960 --> 43:30.240
If we could just get like Harry Styles to guest on the show,

43:30.240 --> 43:32.640
I think we could at least the pit sold.

43:33.680 --> 43:34.880
He's not going to guest.

43:35.680 --> 43:38.720
Harry Styles playing the theme song for the show.

43:38.720 --> 43:40.000
That'd be really dope.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.360
That'd be really cool.

43:41.360 --> 43:42.480
It's not going to happen.

43:42.480 --> 43:43.360
How would that happen?

43:43.360 --> 43:45.920
Nobody has an in with anyone in his circles.

43:45.920 --> 43:47.520
I have to like ask him.

43:47.520 --> 43:47.760
Yeah.

43:47.760 --> 43:51.440
I think we could get Lady Gaga because I have an in with the guy who co-wrote

43:51.440 --> 43:51.920
shallow.

43:53.440 --> 43:53.760
Who?

43:54.640 --> 43:55.440
Andrew Wyatt?

43:55.840 --> 43:59.840
That's cool.

43:59.840 --> 44:02.800
I feel like we get like Olivia Rodrigo.

44:04.800 --> 44:05.200
How?

44:07.600 --> 44:08.480
I don't know, people.

44:08.480 --> 44:09.280
Young.

44:09.280 --> 44:13.440
She's in the, who's like the, uh, uh,

44:14.480 --> 44:17.200
I don't know, Quincy Jones.

44:20.640 --> 44:21.600
I was going to say it.

44:21.600 --> 44:23.600
And the six after that.

44:23.600 --> 44:24.240
Nice.

44:24.880 --> 44:25.520
Yeah.

44:25.520 --> 44:30.400
Uh, if I could spend a lot of money on the show,

44:30.400 --> 44:38.240
I think I would try to tour with a really elaborate, like,

44:39.040 --> 44:40.960
yeah, design circus.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.040
Oh, that's what it was.

44:43.040 --> 44:43.840
I wrote this down.

44:43.840 --> 44:45.760
I texted this myself when I was at the Louvre.

44:45.760 --> 44:48.080
I said, had come podcast circus.

44:49.760 --> 44:51.120
It would be, uh,

44:52.080 --> 44:54.240
Sankling Brothers Circus or something.

44:54.800 --> 44:55.680
It's good.

44:55.680 --> 44:57.520
Also, I got a physical yesterday.

44:58.880 --> 45:02.400
And the doctor was like, any swelling in your ankles, and I, like,

45:02.400 --> 45:03.440
laughed.

45:03.440 --> 45:06.240
And I laughed for a little too long to the point where she was like,

45:07.280 --> 45:08.400
I had to explain.

45:08.400 --> 45:09.600
I was like, oh, I'm sorry.

45:09.600 --> 45:10.320
I'm not mean to deliver.

45:10.320 --> 45:13.680
I just, I'm kind of known to have thin ankles.

45:13.680 --> 45:16.240
And she's like, well, that's good that there's no swelling.

45:16.240 --> 45:18.560
And then you said, have you seen the head going podcast?

45:18.560 --> 45:18.960
Yeah.

45:18.960 --> 45:20.560
And that was your networking for the day.

45:20.720 --> 45:21.920
Yeah, exactly right.

45:21.920 --> 45:24.160
And what would we have at our circus?

45:24.160 --> 45:26.400
Would it be like, animal actor?

45:26.400 --> 45:31.120
Would it be like, uh, what?

45:31.120 --> 45:34.560
Would it be like a quote unquote freak show?

45:34.560 --> 45:39.360
I think it would be, um, it would just be me trying

45:39.360 --> 45:41.840
to turn the normal podcast into a circus.

45:41.840 --> 45:44.720
But it's obviously, I didn't do enough work for that.

45:44.720 --> 45:46.080
But it would be like, I agree.

45:46.080 --> 45:47.600
I think it would be so funny.

45:47.600 --> 45:52.880
Like, if everyone just like worked really, we spent money on classes

45:52.880 --> 45:55.120
to like someone learn trapeze.

45:55.120 --> 45:57.920
Yeah, but someone doesn't have time to get good at it.

45:57.920 --> 46:04.000
So it's like, you are doing trapeze acts, but it's kind of like watching someone do a class.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.280
Also, I would love to do a New Year's Eve thing.

46:07.280 --> 46:09.200
That's like Dick Clark's New Year's Rock and Eve.

46:09.200 --> 46:12.000
But it would be Jeff James's New Year's Rock and As.

46:13.680 --> 46:14.640
Dick James.

46:14.800 --> 46:19.440
Rodney James Rodney.

46:19.440 --> 46:25.920
Yeah, the Rodney Brothers Circus, but, uh, Bill Graham today, uh, New Year's Eve show

46:25.920 --> 46:30.080
at a Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco and like winter 70 something San Francisco.

46:30.080 --> 46:31.280
Yeah, what's that?

46:31.280 --> 46:34.000
I'm trying to copy you why.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.720
Where would you want your show to be held at?

46:36.720 --> 46:38.800
Because I feel like that's a good opportunity for a joke.

46:41.200 --> 46:44.400
I have so many venues that I think would be funny to do the show at.

46:44.400 --> 46:47.120
But nobody wants to put any effort or money into this shit.

46:47.920 --> 46:52.960
If it was New Year's Eve, like, like, what if it was just like you're doing the New Year's show?

46:52.960 --> 46:53.280
Sure.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.600
A block from Times Square.

46:56.640 --> 46:59.520
So the ball's like kind of in the background.

46:59.520 --> 47:00.240
That'd be funny.

47:02.240 --> 47:03.520
Yeah, we could figure that out.

47:03.520 --> 47:08.800
But the, uh, I want to do it at a theater because Bill Graham did this New Year's Eve show where he flew in on

47:08.800 --> 47:14.400
like this, uh, like whatever, um, hanging big joint.

47:15.120 --> 47:20.640
And so I could do the same, but it would be like on, um, I don't know, like the Peter Pan style.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.080
I was going to say it on a Geary.

47:24.080 --> 47:25.040
That's pretty good.

47:26.560 --> 47:28.640
I show up as a rice ball.

47:28.640 --> 47:33.280
You could make like a rice dress, like Lady Gaga style.

47:33.280 --> 47:37.040
And then Lady Gaga comes out in her meat dress.

47:37.040 --> 47:37.520
Yeah.

47:39.760 --> 47:40.720
And I'm here.

47:40.720 --> 47:42.480
Feel free to, like, participate.

47:42.480 --> 47:44.720
We should write a shout-out cover.

47:44.720 --> 47:45.520
This isn't nonsense.

47:45.520 --> 47:46.560
This is planning.

47:46.560 --> 47:47.840
This is a lunch and learn.

47:48.880 --> 47:51.760
I would say this is another side of brain story.

47:51.760 --> 47:54.480
I will eat another assignable.

47:54.480 --> 47:55.840
I want to see you explode.

47:55.840 --> 47:57.680
I mean, what do you want to see out of the show?

47:57.680 --> 47:59.200
Violet, you're turning right.

47:59.200 --> 48:01.840
Don't think I want to be on it as much.

48:01.840 --> 48:06.000
Like, I'm like, I'm on nearly every episode and it should be more of a

48:06.080 --> 48:10.320
Poop Poori rotating cast of character style.

48:10.320 --> 48:10.880
But then what?

48:10.880 --> 48:12.480
On guest, would you do regularly?

48:12.480 --> 48:13.440
Buckets?

48:13.440 --> 48:16.000
No, I would just fucking chill out and watch.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.640
I want to just watch and see what happens.

48:18.640 --> 48:20.720
I don't want to, like, have to listen to the show.

48:20.720 --> 48:21.840
Be recorded every week.

48:23.760 --> 48:25.520
That's the only one I'll listen to.

48:25.520 --> 48:28.800
I feel like a step in the wrong direction is not having a mirror on the show.

48:28.800 --> 48:29.440
Because it's hard.

48:31.680 --> 48:32.960
Jakes on paternity leave.

48:32.960 --> 48:34.320
You're also not going to be on the show every week.

48:34.320 --> 48:35.200
This is tough.

48:35.280 --> 48:37.520
People don't want to see you in your turn to do leave.

48:37.520 --> 48:39.120
I'm on uncle leave.

48:39.120 --> 48:41.840
Well, I thought we did kind of establish on the show that you're,

48:44.400 --> 48:45.600
you're sort of the real father.

48:51.680 --> 48:53.520
Not even a donor, really, more of like a

48:55.120 --> 48:56.320
cuckold or

48:57.760 --> 48:58.800
you cuckold.

48:58.800 --> 49:01.600
He's not like a cuckold, cuckold, cuckold, cuckold, cuckold, cuckold, cuckold on earth.

49:02.160 --> 49:09.840
Let's end the show by rounding out this um lunch and learn

49:12.000 --> 49:17.200
which is um about goal setting and we're kind of already doing that.

49:17.200 --> 49:20.160
But like, yeah, what are the, what are the goals that we actually want to see happen to the show?

49:21.120 --> 49:23.280
We've been doing that already, but like, let's figure the shit out.

49:23.280 --> 49:25.040
Let's leave with some action items.

49:25.040 --> 49:27.840
I would like to focus on guests because we can do that easily.

49:27.920 --> 49:32.960
Yes, I would like guests staying to return another 20,000

49:34.240 --> 49:36.880
views slash list listens every week.

49:36.880 --> 49:37.840
Really difficult.

49:37.840 --> 49:39.440
That's a lot of listeners.

49:39.440 --> 49:40.800
How would that happen?

49:40.800 --> 49:42.080
Get the right guest, man.

49:42.080 --> 49:42.800
All right, guests.

49:42.800 --> 49:43.440
Yes, that's the right time.

49:43.440 --> 49:44.240
It seemed to care.

49:44.240 --> 49:45.280
Like you know what I mean?

49:45.280 --> 49:46.400
Like we had Finn on the show.

49:46.400 --> 49:47.120
Nobody gives a shit.

49:48.240 --> 49:50.560
That was like a year and a half ago.

49:50.560 --> 49:55.440
Yeah, I was pretty a long time ago and I think people did actually is what I don't even know

49:55.440 --> 49:58.080
if that was what video was it?

49:58.080 --> 49:59.040
It wasn't.

50:00.080 --> 50:04.080
Yeah, I'm trying to even think of who is on in my phone that's any interesting.

50:07.280 --> 50:10.720
But it's not necessarily the biggest name.

50:11.520 --> 50:11.760
Right.

50:12.560 --> 50:16.800
I have a, somebody who's in a famous rock band, but I don't.

50:16.800 --> 50:18.000
Right, so you're not listening.

50:18.000 --> 50:18.640
Right, yeah.

50:20.640 --> 50:22.560
It's not necessarily the most famous right.

50:22.560 --> 50:24.880
I saw one who's in a famous rock band.

50:27.280 --> 50:32.000
People that are good at engaging online audiences.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.840
People that have their own podcast audience that they can bring over.

50:35.840 --> 50:37.120
We should have a lot of things.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.320
Kind of things.

50:38.320 --> 50:41.840
Lauren currently does not have a podcast that I know.

50:41.840 --> 50:44.960
Well, I guess she has three of them and newcomers.

50:45.680 --> 50:47.600
We could have the three of them on that be funny.

50:47.600 --> 50:50.400
And then we could do like a three socks.

50:51.280 --> 50:56.720
I think that they did at some point want to do some sort of collab.

50:56.720 --> 50:59.200
We might have done, no, at the show.

51:00.240 --> 51:01.280
I don't know if it was gusting.

51:01.280 --> 51:04.240
It might have been like an ad swap situation or something.

51:04.240 --> 51:12.240
But, um, but again, thinking outside the box.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.080
Well, I did something with game credits.

51:17.440 --> 51:19.360
I do really want to get a PS5.

51:21.360 --> 51:23.360
For what?

51:23.360 --> 51:24.960
To play games.

51:24.960 --> 51:25.600
What game?

51:25.600 --> 51:26.240
Well, a game.

51:26.240 --> 51:27.120
Elden ring.

51:27.120 --> 51:32.000
NBA 2K, FIFA, uh, I would love to have a PS4.

51:32.000 --> 51:32.960
Like a C.

51:34.240 --> 51:35.920
We should have a FIFA tournament.

51:35.920 --> 51:36.800
I really.

51:36.800 --> 51:38.560
Well, I brought this up on today's episode.

51:38.560 --> 51:39.680
The one that fucking came out today.

51:39.680 --> 51:41.120
Well, we record this at the last week.

51:41.120 --> 51:46.480
If you're listening to this, which is that the NBA announced their mid-season tournament.

51:46.480 --> 51:49.360
And there's going to be a head-gum podcast, mid-season attorney.

51:49.360 --> 51:51.120
A mid-journey attorney is what we're calling for.

51:51.120 --> 51:53.120
Not a FIFA.

51:53.120 --> 51:54.960
I want to do Mario Kart.

51:54.960 --> 51:55.760
A Mario Kart.

51:55.760 --> 51:56.400
It's dream.

51:56.400 --> 51:58.880
The two brackets are instead of east versus west.

51:58.880 --> 52:01.600
It's uh, joy versus wise.

52:02.400 --> 52:03.360
Oh my god.

52:03.360 --> 52:04.640
I don't know what your time is up.

52:04.640 --> 52:06.480
I was signing up if I'd want to play a game.

52:06.480 --> 52:10.560
The joy fee for conference champion will be announced at the end of the November.

52:12.400 --> 52:13.360
Okay.

52:13.360 --> 52:14.960
At the end of the November.

52:15.600 --> 52:19.120
But you threw and threw man.

52:19.120 --> 52:20.000
Fuck you.

52:21.520 --> 52:24.160
For interrupting my genuine attention.

52:24.160 --> 52:24.800
Continue.

52:24.800 --> 52:25.600
What's the general rule?

52:25.600 --> 52:26.320
FIFA tournament.

52:26.320 --> 52:27.440
FIFA tournament.

52:27.440 --> 52:28.160
Yeah.

52:28.160 --> 52:29.600
FIFA tournament.

52:29.600 --> 52:31.040
Fuckin' not the bet.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.840
The FIFA tournament.

52:35.360 --> 52:36.240
Yeah.

52:36.240 --> 52:37.600
But that shouldn't be for this show.

52:37.600 --> 52:40.400
That should be for uh, one of the game show live streams.

52:40.400 --> 52:41.040
Sure.

52:41.040 --> 52:42.240
Sure or yeah.

52:43.040 --> 52:43.840
Sure yeah.

52:45.920 --> 52:47.360
That's all in the same channel.

52:52.880 --> 52:53.520
Is that on you?

52:55.520 --> 52:57.360
Was it Casey or Kevin?

52:57.360 --> 52:58.080
Is it chef Kevin?

52:58.800 --> 52:59.760
Well, it's Casey.

53:00.560 --> 53:01.040
Get him on.

53:02.400 --> 53:03.040
Oh my god.

53:03.040 --> 53:03.680
Don't have you!

53:04.960 --> 53:06.960
You can't hear you, obviously man.

53:07.600 --> 53:08.320
Can you hear Jeff?

53:09.440 --> 53:10.080
Casey!

53:11.760 --> 53:12.800
Yeah, he goes, you know.

53:13.440 --> 53:14.160
Tell him to get on the mic.

53:15.200 --> 53:16.160
You want to see to get on the mic.

53:16.160 --> 53:16.960
Get on the mic!

53:20.240 --> 53:20.800
This is good.

53:26.000 --> 53:26.480
Hello.

53:27.040 --> 53:27.840
Hey, Casey.

53:27.840 --> 53:28.480
What do you got?

53:28.480 --> 53:30.240
What do you want to point to people to the floor is yours?

53:30.240 --> 53:30.800
Fine.

53:32.080 --> 53:33.600
Listen to the pit wall pod.

53:34.560 --> 53:35.600

53:38.960 --> 53:40.160

Maybe Jeff will be on

53:42.880 --> 53:43.760

53:43.760 --> 53:45.040
We'll find out on Monday.

53:45.040 --> 53:47.760
Which means nothing because I've said that so many times, but I'm going to be on Monday.

53:47.760 --> 53:50.000
Uh, thank you guys so much for listening to the heck of podcast.

53:51.120 --> 53:56.480
Uh, keep tuning in for all the changes and uh, and I think it through the very least we did lunch and learn.

53:56.480 --> 53:57.760
We did lunch and learn.

53:57.760 --> 53:59.280
We did a new bond to the week.

53:59.280 --> 54:00.240
Catch us next time.

54:00.240 --> 54:03.280
We're going to brunch and bring the link is coming up.

54:03.280 --> 54:05.040
I feel like bond to the week.

54:05.040 --> 54:05.600
That's good.

54:06.400 --> 54:07.040
Showed out.

54:07.040 --> 54:08.240
Get out of it from idle.

54:08.240 --> 54:09.040
We're done this in a while.

54:09.040 --> 54:10.000
Catch you on the flip.

54:10.640 --> 54:11.440

54:11.440 --> 54:11.920
Yeah.

54:11.920 --> 54:12.240
Yeah.

54:12.240 --> 54:12.720
Uh.

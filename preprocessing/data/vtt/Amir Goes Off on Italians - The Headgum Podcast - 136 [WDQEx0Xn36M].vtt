00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Rollin' Atkinson.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
Oh, that's good.

00:10.000 --> 00:32.000
This episode comes out on January 6th.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.000
What is 2023 had to hold for y'all so far, would you say?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Hold on one second.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
My dog wants to go outside.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Casey can answer.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
What has 2023 held for me so far?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
What has it had to hold for you?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
What's today's date?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
January 6th?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yes.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
January 6th.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
I'll never forget.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
This is coming out as another insurrection happens.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
We've got Casey Donahue on Mike on Zoom for the first time ever, I think.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
That's true.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Really?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
You've been on the show on Zoom before?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Yes.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
In the same exact chair.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
I'm pretty proud.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Joining us late.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
We said to 15.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
We said, well, we said 5-10.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Eastern.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
She joined at 5-14 and wanted to be on the right thing.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Okay, well, I didn't know that.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
So I wouldn't have put you on blast, but ultimately it is kind of funny to have you shocked.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I grew.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Did you actually shock because a mirror wasn't in the room?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
No, and you're lucky.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
I already started recording.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Casey, and I were just talking about how this is the first episode of 2023, right?

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
So we're coming in with that bang of energy, that sort of like post-New Year's Eve hangover.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Yeah.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Wow.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
But it's not to pull back the curtain too much, but it's mid December when we're recording this.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
So we don't have that energy in us.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Right.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I'm actually pretty fucking exhausted actually.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah, you've been framing in a bunch of stuff before you leave or something.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Yeah, because I'm trying to take three weeks off this year instead of two.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
So it's been sort of, I mean, Casey gets the producer grind.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
Everybody thinks that all I do every week is just show up for the records that you see.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
But I actually do all the editing on most of them.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
This all being said.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
That's where the magic app.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
That's where the magic app.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
That's where the magic app is.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
The track, the tragic happens on Mike and then the magic happens on the editing bay.

02:35.000 --> 02:44.000
But anyway, I'm going to really need your guys to help because Uncle Jeffrey's energy is at an all-time low.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Marika style.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Nice.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
That was in all-time low reference.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
But also, I guess it works with the fact that you're kind of deadpin.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
I assumed it was just an all-time low reference.

02:58.000 --> 03:07.000
This episode is going to be a little shorter just because I feel like we all have a heart out.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
No.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
I think it's just you, you're overworked over stress.

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
And it's almost like all the work you've done to make sure you have three weeks off is for not firing.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Yeah.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
And I just had a heart in.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Yeah.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
I actually do have a heart out to see avatar the way of water.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Yeah.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I want to talk about.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Mm-hmm.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Have you seen the first one recently?

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
Not recently, but I was just in Pandora a mere two days ago.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
So that was kind of a refresher.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Never been there. How is it, is it cool?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Uh, it's the late.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
The area is really like beautifully done.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
I think.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Mm-hmm.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
It's like a soft ass.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
It's like a soft ass.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
No.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
I was at Disney World and Moking Dumb, which has the new avatar land.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
The flight of passage I would say was okay kind of just,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I liked some of the mechanics of the ride,

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
but I thought the, I don't like wearing glasses on top of my glasses,

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
but you had to do.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
The 3D.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Which was a little annoying, but it was fun.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Was it the one with the Navi animatronic that looks real?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
No.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
No.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
That's the hall of president.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
The worst ride that I'm not.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Easily.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
And this is one thing.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Really?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
The animatronic.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Yes.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
The animatronic best part.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Super cool.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
I don't know what her deal is.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
I don't know what character that is because there's no story to the ride.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
You get in a little boat and you go sailing down a little river.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
She's like one of two animatronics.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
The other one I think is Drake Sully at the beginning,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
who like says one word,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
obviously in the Navi language.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
So I said what he's saying.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
And then the rest of the like,

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
like moving things are screens that show like little animals

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
or like Navi people in the distance kind of running.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
And that was upsetting.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
And then the thing that made me really actually mad about this ride

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
was that the the entire ride,

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
where you're like riding through Pandora.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.000
There was like concrete path along the water.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
Like that this probably used for like anyone working there.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Jeff is leaving his pissed off.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I'm gonna keep talking.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
But there's like a concrete path in the middle of like,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Pandora, which is supposed to be beautiful.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Like all these glowing plants.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
It's just like fucking white concrete.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Like paint it at the very least.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
And he said not interesting.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I think it is kind of interesting.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
I'm very interested in this actually.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Casey does love podcasts the ride, right?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Yeah.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Shout out to podcasts the ride.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
I love themed attractions.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Me too.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
So obviously some people do care about this.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
There's a whole podcast about it.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
And yeah, that was my experience.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
I had a really good slushie.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
I was fun.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Sick.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Yeah.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
This was in Florida.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yeah.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Damn Daniel.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
That's funny.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
That really though, right?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Or what do you want to talk about Jeff?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
He's gone.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Glad you asked.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
I was gonna ask if we should just do it.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
My bond of the week is Guy Fieri.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Did he say that?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
That's good.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Did I?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Sounds familiar.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Did I say that last week?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Because I thought it'd be funny if it was like

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Diners, drivers, or sorry.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
It would be

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Cryers.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Because bond died in the last one.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Um,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Gadgets and dimes.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
So it's like

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
People mourning the loss of people in the bond.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
And then it's like Gadgets.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
Because he always has like a new watch that has become a capability or a car that can go into water and do a submarine.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
And then dimes.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Because he's sort of having a lot of head.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Having a lot of what?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Head.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
I'm assuming that the bond girls that he has sex with go down on him.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Mm-hmm.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
But we're.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Do you think we're dimes?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Uh, sorry.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
It's.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
It's crying.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Gadgets and dimes.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
But dimes has nothing to do with oral sex, right?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
It's just like dimes.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Like bond girls like tens.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Yeah, but they're like, I call.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
I said dimes because I assume he's getting a lot of head.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Yeah.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
You said that.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Right.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
It's also dimes.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
Is the only one that is like remotely close to dives?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Dinos and cries.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
It's cryers.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Gadgets and dimes.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
And he's like, yeah, we got it.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Yeah.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Driven's is gadgets.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
And then he's like, bam.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Like when it's like, that's ever old agassie.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
That's actually not a bad bond.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Emerald.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
What about a New Orleans bond?

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
So instead of New Orleans jazz, it's a New Orleans game.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
Yeah, get Daniel Craig to be his New Orleans character.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Yeah.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Yeah.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Yeah.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
As well.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
New Orleans james.

08:33.000 --> 08:41.000
Uh, what do you guys as bonds of the week?

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Um, Jarvis Landry.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
The NFL quarterback.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Yeah.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
He's a white receiver.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Yeah.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Why?

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Because his nickname is juice.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Okay.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
So imagine juice bonds.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
And you didn't want to get it out of jail.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
No, that would be kind of fucked up.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
He just asked if it was bonds with an S.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Yeah.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Like James Bond or James Bond's.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Like obviously the first.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
I should be very bonds and be pretty good.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Very bonds and be good.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
But I feel like the energy is sour.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Let's keep things going with a major killer.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Making it sour.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Take your killer.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
When you don't have the energy.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I should be making it sour.

09:29.000 --> 09:38.000
I should be making it sour.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
My bond a little week is going to be Salt Bay actually.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
That's really good.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Salt Bond.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Imagine James Bond.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Adding salt.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
He saw it.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Maldon to a fucking Tomahawk.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
The double of seven logo.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Font.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
But it's NACL.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Yeah.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Do do do do do do.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
I mean, have you seen?

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Have you seen any of his restaurants?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Yeah.

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
He's like way too intense at them, right?

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
Well, that but also as a self-proclaimed Font nerd.

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
I do have to say that his restaurant logo is the font bleeding cowboy,

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
which was cool in the early 2000s.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
And it looks bad.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
So that's my hot team.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
But imagine the Bond logo and bleeding cowboy.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Yeah.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
So we've got Guy Fury.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
We've got Salt Bay.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
We've got Barry Bond slash Jarvis Landry.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Casey, who's your Bond wig?

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
I'm going to go with Mike White, the creator of the White Lotus,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
and also survivor contestant.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Yeah.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
That's really good.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
He's in the zeitgeist.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
He's in the micgeist.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Sure.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
I don't think he deserves to be Bond.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
You don't think he deserves to be Bond?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
No.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Why not?

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
But Barry Bond's does.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Yeah.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Because Barry Bond's can hit Dingers.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Okay.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Good point.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Lefty, choke up.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Oppo, taco.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
Did he ever watch the baseball game?

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Not a full game, but I've seen clips.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Okay.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
And have you?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Yeah.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
Not clips clips, but I've heard about it.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
All this shit that goes down.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
Well, it should be with White Mike.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
White, Mike, White.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
I haven't watched season two for The White Lotus, but I've got it.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
That's crazy.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Remember the other weird?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
That's not liking season one of The White Lotus.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I thought it was a bad television.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
And I'm happy to say it.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Wow.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
She.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
I'm sorry to Megan Fayette.

12:07.000 --> 12:14.000
I'm sorry to our response and all the other people out there.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
You're a new friend.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Adam de Marco shout out.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Yeah.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
He seems nice.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I'm probably not going to watch it.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Maybe.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
I will say.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
I don't know.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
Does it change anything that a lot of people you know love it?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
No.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Here's what I will say.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I also didn't like season one.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
And season two is some of the best TV I've seen this year.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Wow.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Well, here's what I'll say.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
We were just talking to Emma.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
And she said she don't like season one.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
But love season two.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Or sorry, the reverse.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Like season two.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Or the season two.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
So.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Everyone's different.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Daniel.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
That's what it again with the White.

12:52.000 --> 12:58.000
Major Keeler don't trust anything fully says because a lot of what Emma has to say

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
is on par with fully artists work on the day.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Right.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
So it's like, it's not real.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
It's not real.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
What she says is not real.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
And that goes for everything she says.

13:17.000 --> 13:23.000
Not just the things I disagree with.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
You also watch a lot of trash.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Major Keeler Emma's not the only one who says things that aren't real.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Go on.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
What trash do I watch?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Like I'd be like whatever we talk about.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Major Keeler.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
One of the other people in my life though I say things that are real.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Is a mirror.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
Because it mirrors constantly ribbing me in public.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
And that's like nonsense.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Because I'm actually a pretty nice guy.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Major Keeler.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Be conscious of when you're interrupting.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
That makes what you're saying or what you're trying to say, which is that you're actually a nice person.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Seem on true.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
I don't know what TV you watch, but but we stay up to date on on the movies.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
What TV do you like?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
What question?

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Um, I love succession.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
I think that is a very good show.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Yeah.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Um, I have a lot of, I don't know.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
I definitely, I love Bob Spurgers.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
That's like the show that I've maybe kept up with through the longest steady period of time.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Did you like the movie?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
I did like the movie.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
That was really cute and fun.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Um, I don't know.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
I, you know, I watched some of the classics.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
But I also.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
This is the boss.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Huh.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
The reason company is lying is it anyway.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
All in the family.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
No.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Toys are as commercials.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Oh my god.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I think every television show else.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
I know it's not a good quality show, but it's Merlin on BBC.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Right.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
So I've never heard of it.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Yeah.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
The embetweeners.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Ever watched them betweeners.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Never heard of it.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
I've never heard of it.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Of course.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Psych.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Psych is great.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Psych is also like faulty towers.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Faulty towers is great.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Faulty towers is good.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I don't want to say.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
It's like succession is a very decent comp for white lotus.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
It's rich white people acting.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
Yeah, but it's actually good social commentary.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
It's a post-white lotus.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Hit the bow.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Sound effect.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Of course.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Hit the bow.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
I like to be.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
The bow.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Right.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
You haven't seen the second season.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
You don't know.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
If it's my first one.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Hit it with the whoa.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Yeah.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
But this one takes place in Italy.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Yeah.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
So.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
It's beautiful.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
It'll ease in it.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
I mean, I guess it's nice that it's not dealing with.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Right.

15:47.000 --> 15:57.000
Having to reconcile with this the land of like people of color, like native people as opposed to just Italy.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
There you go.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
It's just a challenge.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Anybody can make fun of Italians.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
We do it here all the time.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
That's basically the log line of this podcast.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
All right.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
30 seconds on the board.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
We all have to say go off on Italians.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
No.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
There we go.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Starting with the mirror.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Gosh.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Yeah.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
I mean, I guess the food.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Well, great is a little repetitive.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
It seems like it's just a series of shapes.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
Warsaw and any real diversity in the food.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
We can all agree on that.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Right.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Like pasta's a specific ingredient.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Just sometimes it's in a tube.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Sometimes it's a corkscrew.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Sometimes it's long through the right.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
It's delicious.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Obviously.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
He doesn't like bread and sauce and cheese.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
But it can be like.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
I mean, I don't feel like I'm being too offensive when I say.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
There could be some variety within.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Yeah.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
And I mean, like, that's it.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
30 seconds.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Game over.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
You're canceled.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
You're done.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
America, Casey and I are not going to do it.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Let's take a break.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Yeah.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
I am Italian.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Yeah.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
So you also have ended someone in the room on the gym.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Um.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
We'll be right back.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
That's so unconfident.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Fuck.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I love your heat.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
This show is sponsored by better help.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Guys shout out better help.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Shout out therapy.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Shout out all the y'all who are already in therapy or even

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
considering therapy for taking that first step.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
Because again, I am such a huge proponent of therapy.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
It's fun, honestly, to get to know yourself more.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
And, and it also just makes life easier.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Truly to to know yourself to know how you react to things.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
Positively and negatively to know what makes you happy.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
So you can pursue that to know how to deal with more difficult emotions.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
So that they're not as bad as they could be.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
That's why I'm in therapy every week.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Could not recommend it more.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
And that's where better help comes in to y'all's life, right?

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
Because when you're at your best, you can do great things.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
But sometimes life gets you bogged down and you may feel overwhelmed.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Or like you're not showing up in the way you want to.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I know I felt that way.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Working with a therapist can help you get closer to the best version of you.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
This is what I've been saying.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I don't know a better help of y'all.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
If your copywriter's been listening to my ads,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
but shout out, this is 100% true.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Because when you feel empowered,

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
you're more prepared to take on everything that life throws at you.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
And things don't feel so perilous.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
There's actually, you know, there's a lightness to life.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
So if you're thinking of giving therapy a try,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
better help is a great option.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
It's convenient, flexible, affordable, and entirely online.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
Just fill out a brief questionnaire to get matched with a licensed therapist.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
If you don't like them, you can switch therapists at any time for no additional charge.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
So if you want to live a more empowered life,

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
therapy can get you there.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I'd like to get to the bottom of this then.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
We're back on the commercial break.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Maria Catast is Niochi Italian.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
So that's where we're at today.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
We should also say.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
It's quite low to season two.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
You would know that.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
There's three episodes about whether Niochi is Italian or not.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
And they get into it.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Yeah, that's good.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Television.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
The first one is.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
It's figuring out that it's not Italian.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
And the second one is them realizing they were wrong.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
And that it actually is Italian.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And the third one is them second guessing.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Both decisions.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
And that was the season finale.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
That was easy.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
Scotland's Colin Schink is the comforting dish you need this winter.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Colin Schink.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Colin Schink.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Is that what you said?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Colin Schink.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Uh.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
Have you guys ever indulged in a nice creamy bowl of clam chowder?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Of course.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
What about a French disc filled with all sorts of shellfish and spices?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
I'm out.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
No.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Yeah.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
And then Casey specifically.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Have you ever had a flim-ish seafood?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Uh.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
No.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Sorry.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Can you say that last word?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Well, if you.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Oh, water.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Water.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Cool.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
It's W-A-T-E-R-Z-O-O-I.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
A water.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Oh.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Oh.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Well, if you guys have had the opportunity to indulge in any of these,

20:11.000 --> 20:18.000
you'll have a pretty good idea of what Colin Schink is like.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
You went from a creamy soup to a water suede.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
It's like a shellfish stew.

20:28.000 --> 20:34.000
What about the most important ingredients of Colin Schink, our potatoes, fish, and cream?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Can we all agree on that?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
I'm out.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Sure.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
Well, some recipes also call for onions or greens, but yeah, those are the main three

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
and three ingredients.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Very nice flavoring.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
What?

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
What?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
What's that?

20:47.000 --> 20:52.000
They're not flavoring with an onion or a green and the traditional recipe.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
In the tradition kit.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
It just revolves around fish, potatoes, and cream.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Yeah.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
And then you can add or subtract it there.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
You got it.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
This is Scottish.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Scottish.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Yeah.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
And the name of it is Colin Schink.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Uh-huh.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Have you had it?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I just learned about it today.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
I just thought it would be interesting to see if you guys had any experience.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
I've been to Scotland.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
I didn't even hear about Colin Schink.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
I feel nauseous every time you describe what it is.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
I don't want.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
What Colin Schink?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Yeah.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
It's like clams and cream.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
It sounds awesome.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
No, it's a cream base.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Yeah.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Hot powder.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Hot fish.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
And ultimately cold potatoes.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
It looks like a jitter.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Yeah.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
So hot.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Hot cream.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Cold potato.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Hot fish.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
And a fucking shell.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
But potatoes are cooked in the cream.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Uh-huh.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Over time.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Stop it.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
It's skink.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Oh, but it is.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Talk about other shit.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
You'll stick to us.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
I'm here.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Went off on Italians.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Now he's taken it to the Scottish.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
I don't know.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Not like my none of my ancestors are safe.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
No.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
There goes that ad revenue.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
We don't get that much ad revenue from the YouTube.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
I mean, it's not insignificant.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Oh.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Oh.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Because you had a bad.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
This just in Pernat, Gio.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Sunflowers make bees poop a lot.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
And here's why that's good.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
The flowers, pollen, works like a medicine for bumblebees.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Afflicted with a nasty parasite.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Respond fast.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Don't just think about it.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
It's um, so is bees.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Poo, honey.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Is that what they do?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Um.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Maria, can we get a number of scrunch on that?

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
I'm pretty sure they throw up honey.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Yeah.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
It's like they throw up honey.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
So what do they put?

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I would love to know.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
I also am really stuck on sunflowers.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
Act as a medicine for parasites.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
So they're eating the sunflower pollen.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
It's going through the little systems.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Yeah.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
It's fully defecate like normal.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Hmm.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
So it's.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
So it's not pooping a lot.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
It's just like, you know, clear and cleaning their system, I guess.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
No.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
Sunflowers specifically make them poop a lot.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
And that's good.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
They like it.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Here's why.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
Healthy honey bee poop is yellow in color and is somewhat sticky.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Like honey.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
No.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Um.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
This is disgusting.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
I don't want to talk about that.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Here you go.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
You brought it up.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Can we get a number of scrunch on it?

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
It's all over.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Here we go.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
What'd you just say?

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Nothing.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
Can we get a number of scrunch on if I'm your hates Italians?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Probably.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
I don't hate Italians.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
What could the number be?

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Number was that like on a scale or something?

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Um.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Here's how much sleep you actually need according to experts.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
As an adult, you need seven hours.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
No less.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
This isn't this.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Like we've known this for.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Yeah, indisgeneration.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Right.

24:14.000 --> 24:19.000
But I guess I wanted to bring it up and be like, what are your guys' sleeping habits?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Oh, okay.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Um.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Usually get like six hours.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Six.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
That's not seven.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
It's not enough.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
None of the hours in the day.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
That's really good.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Do you have an alarm?

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Yeah.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Yeah.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
I have several.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
I see.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
I like 15 minutes.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
I like to see.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
I got you beat.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Sounds alarm.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
What do you do?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Five.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Yeah.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
My alarm app is just fully in five minute increments.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Oh, okay.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Wow.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
That is a lot.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
How far?

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Okay.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
So how do you do you get?

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
I'll show you my alarm.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
So that's every five minutes for the entire day.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
It seems like.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Yeah.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Yeah.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Yeah.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Yeah.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Yeah.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Yeah.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
If I needed to be out of bed by eight a.m.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
I'd probably do the lot like 15 minutes.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
So like, 25.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
But if I, I usually wake up at eight.

25:11.000 --> 25:18.000
So I usually do like eight to eight 15 is with my alarm's go off.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
And it's not.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
It's less of a.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
I do it because I am anxious that I will over sleep.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
But I never.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Exactly.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
I feel that.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
You've never overslept ever.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
No.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
I mean, I have.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
But it's not like a common enough.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
A occurrence where like that is like to stop me from over sleeping.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
It's just like I'm worried that like a one day maybe it will happen again.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
It will happen again.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Yeah.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Oh, yeah.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
I've overslept.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I've been late for stuff because of that.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
And that's what made me like up the number of alarms that I said.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Yeah.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Yeah.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
To make sure I get out of there.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
You know.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Yeah.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
The last time I overslept was when I was at Le Mans and I said,

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
like three alarms to go off every five minutes.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
And my friend who like we were sharing a tent.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
We both were like we're going to take a nap and wake up in a few hours.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
Never woke like I kept like turning off the alarms.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Right.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
And he was like, you didn't.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
You just like let them play.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Yeah.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
You could have like shaken me awake.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
What do you mean?

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Yeah.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
You brought this topic up.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
You wanted to hear us talk about.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Right.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
A sleeping.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
And you're mad about it.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
I'm not bad about it.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
I'm saying I relate.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
How.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
How?

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Because sometimes.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Because sometimes.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Specifically.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Well, I'm tired.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
I do the same thing.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I set the five minutes alarm increments.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
But if I wake up and I didn't get enough sleep.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
I will just be like.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
And then like, you know, snooze snooze.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
And then something they start all overlapping.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Right.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Okay.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Okay.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Okay.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Make your healer.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Take everything on the show with a grain of salt.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
And proceed with reverence slash caution.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
From hence your fourth.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Nice.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
A grain of salt bay.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
Well, a New York Times article recently did a story.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
It's a story.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
It's a story.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
It's a story.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
It's a story.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
It's a story.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
It's a story.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
It's a story.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
It's a story.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
It's a story.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
It's a story.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Well, a New York Times article recently did a story on

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
Ledite teens that don't want your likes.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
These bookworm Brooklynites have ditched social media and iPhones for

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
journaling and flip phones.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
So my question to y'all is what are your thoughts?

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
And also, would you guys do a Ledite week with me for this show?

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
Where I provide y'all with a flip phone.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Take your iPhone.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
And you have to sign out of all your social media.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
So you don't even get the notifications, right?

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
So it's like you living like it's 2001.

27:50.000 --> 27:56.000
You know, I've kind of been thinking about this and how kids these days

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
are growing up with iPhones have already been invented.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Right?

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Yeah.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
They have it's all they would know.

28:05.000 --> 28:12.000
So I think they're going to grow up and make their kids not be online.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
Or they're going to like, like, I think we're going to circle back.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
This makes sense to me.

28:16.000 --> 28:21.000
Like, we're going to circle back around two people actively trying to not be online.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Yeah.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
I'm your left.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Yeah.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Yeah.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I want to say that I would do it.

28:27.000 --> 28:33.000
But I don't think I could actively like agree to.

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
I think I could like fall into it.

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
I basically I don't think it would be as bad as I feel like it would be.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
I think I'd be able to get through it.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
But I don't want to give my photo away.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Um, all right.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
So cases on board.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
I don't think a mirror would do it.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
I think Jake would do it.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
So it's me, Casey, Jake.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
And maybe like if I'm here in the chat says he's out.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Yeah.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Maybe, uh, maybe on your would do.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
I'm really, I am genuinely trying to think if I agree with that.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
I don't know if I agree with that.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
With what?

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
With Onya doing it.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
Oh.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
That's a good point.

29:19.000 --> 29:34.000
I'm here so that he could still use it on your computer.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
Start a rewatching James Cameron's movies.

29:38.000 --> 29:43.000
In preparation for avatar, the way of water.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
How's that going?

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
It's going great.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
I watched the Terminator movies.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Amazing.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
There's a really on one of my favorite TV shows.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Future man.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
This is a really good episode.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
Really characters break into James Cameron's house.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Hmm.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
I highly recommend.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Really funny.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
A lot of good jokes.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
In the chat, Amir says T2 is the goat.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
I gotta agree with that.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
Um, I haven't gotten to the abyss yet.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Yeah.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Yeah.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
The Terminator movies are great.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
When people are listening.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
You got to check them out.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
I can't.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
You're doing this.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Yeah.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Twenty twenty three.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Yeah.

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
The two anniversary of, uh, you know, the insurrection.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
And, uh, it's interesting to think about, you know, what this means for

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
our country.

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
And also, we're a bunch of, like, left-leaning liberal cucks.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
So I wonder if, like, we could just play house for a second.

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
White house, specifically, or, I guess, the capital building.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
But, uh, it's kind of a choose your own adventure game that I've come up with.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Of what you would have done.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
If you were in DC on January 6th.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
Are you guys ready?

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
As long as so loud, I could barely hear what you just said.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Same.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
Um, I said I've created a choose your own, I quick choose your own adventure game for, like,

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
what you would have done if you were in DC on January 6th.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Mm-hmm.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
In a part of the mob.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
I'm a part of it.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Yeah.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
Like, I'm choosing to storm the capital.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Yeah.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
You have to.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
In the scenario, you have to.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Okay.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Oh, I have to.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Yeah.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
Are we being forced?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
You don't have to.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Actually, just case yesterday.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
Oh, my being forced to do it or do I believe him in it?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
You've already said that I'm asking you.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
I'm asking you.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
That's true.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
So.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
And I would like to know also for being forced.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
Is it also Katie Moose's birthday?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Yeah.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Yeah.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Have you birthday?

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
I think was the only reason she wasn't in DC in 2020.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
One.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Here we go.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Uh, fuck you guys.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
Um, so I'm going to give you multiple choice answers

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
for how your January 6th would have gone.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
It was 2021.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
You're in DC.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
You're part of it.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Uh, number one.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
How far did you travel from?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Or where did you travel from?

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
The model.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Uh, these are your options.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
A.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
The monolithically white regions of the Pacific Northwest.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
Like, uh, east Washington.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
State.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Uh, B.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Jeff's hometown in Ohio.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Sugar and Falls.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
C.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Surprisingly nearby.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
Or D. Jackson Heights Queens.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
So I'm not even myself in this scenario.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
No, you're Casey Donahue.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
But there's like a photo that surfaces of like holy shit.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Is that, is that, is that Casey?

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
He was there.

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
And then this is like the backstory there.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Let's go with A.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
The monolithically white regions of the Pacific Northwest.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Yeah, sure.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Brownley.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Um.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I'm going with surprisingly nearby.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
All right.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
So you're, you're staying at Waterdale.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
All right.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Here we go.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
What are you wearing?

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
A.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Army fatigues.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Despite never having served.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
B.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
Like you're going to play paintball after this.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
C.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Uh, Native American headdress.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Or D.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Just a truly, really bad outfit.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Like really poor fitting jeans.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Uh-huh.

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
You know, architects or whatever that like jacket company is.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Um.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
I don't know.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
Like high end.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
I don't know.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
It just always looks bad.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Erno spider.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
That's what I was thinking.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Oh.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
And then like some really stupid shoes.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
Well, uh, it truly could never be me.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Um.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
I'm too drip-y.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Um.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
So, but I end it.

33:48.000 --> 33:53.000
Put that on the out of the out of Godducks Twitter.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
That thing stopped doing shit.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I feel like he hasn't done it since October.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Yeah.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Let's turn.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Um, I love gear.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
So let's do the paintball one.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Okay.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Riga.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Brown.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
Let's go.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Army fatigues.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
All wear my dad's old Vietnam War.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Clothing.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Uh, pick your weapon.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
American flag on a pole.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
And AR15.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
The speaker's podium or pure white rage.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Can I add a weapon?

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Yeah.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
I'm here's been answering these.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
These are his answers so far.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Yeah.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Uh.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
Just a really bad outfit and gun.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
All calves.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Um.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
I'm going to go.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Yeah.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I mean, you say recurved.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
You mean, like, it was originally a perfect bone arrow.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
And then it was recurved into a flat stick.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
Yeah.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
It's kind of like a harp at this point.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Yeah.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Uh, don't know you.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
Uh, this is a tough one.

34:59.000 --> 35:04.000
Um, I would feel like I would want something in my hands.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I, because I, I.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
I feel like I don't know.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
I feel like I don't know what to do with your hands.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Yeah.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Exactly.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
So I'm going.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
I think I got to go with the American flag on a pole.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
I feel like it would be if I'm like photographed in my paintball gear.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Yeah.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
Like carrying an American flag going into the capital.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
It'd be a sick photo.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
I agree.

35:29.000 --> 35:35.000
I'm just imagining a mirror in a really bad outfit with a gun.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Yeah.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Keep imagining it.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
I'll fuck it.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Show up ahead.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
I'm east in this spider jacket.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
And I got damn block.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
If you keep talking to your shit.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I, I really might go postal.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Sure.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
What are like ugly shoes that you're wearing?

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Good question.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I was thinking all birds.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
I was thinking all birds.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
And I've done his nature box.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
Everything I wear is podcasts.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Soilant tea.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Soilant tea.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
Soilant tea.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Soilant.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
Soilant.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Soilant.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Soilant.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Soilant.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Tossing.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Soilant.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Soilant.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
It's the powder.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Pick your target.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
AOC.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
The capital police.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
Mike Pence or Baron Trump.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I personally would love to table top.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Baron Trump down the capital top.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Yeah.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
It's like, you know, somebody leans down.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Get on all fours behind him.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
And then the other person like pushes him.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
And then he runs into your body.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Which is like on all fours.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Yeah, the low bridge.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Yeah, the low bridge in a way.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
And then he kind of cartoonishly falls down.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Capital Hill symbolically.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
It's good.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
That's a easy teenager.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
So I wouldn't.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
And then imagine.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Yeah.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Imagine the memes.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
That would be like Jason Darula fell down at the Met Gallup.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
But it's barren Trump fell down at the January 6th insurrection.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
That'd be fun.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
That's funny.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I don't think you thought it was funny.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
No one really laughed.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
We have to.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Pick your target.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
AOC.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Capital police.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Mike Pence or Baron Trump.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
I would be a fly on Mike Pence's hairdo.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
That's funny.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
That's good.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Thank you.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
I'll take down the police.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Yeah.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I was thinking that too.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
But I think I'm going to target AOC.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
And I'm going to do the old.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
The old Terminator come with me if you want to live.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
And I was actually a good guy the whole time.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
That's really.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
I'm saving her.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
I'm saving her.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Yeah.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Yeah.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
And then you can go back to Jackson Heights.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Yeah.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Pick your center.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Close your boots and your motorcycle.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Pick your sentence.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Yeah.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Yeah.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
Presidentially pardoned.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
63 months in prison.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
No prison time.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
But you're fired from your job.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
Or you injure your genitals so bad trying to break into the capital that you

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
do.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
You're doing it yourself.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
This is a really weird cosmopolitan quiz.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
We're taking.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Yeah.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
Which insurrectionist are you exactly right.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
You're.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
That would be better actually.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Yeah.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Which insurrectionist.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Do we already do that, though?

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
Just like showed us a bunch of photos of.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
We were talking about this so much.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
We did.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
It brings it up.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
One year or the two year or the three year anniversary.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Two year.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Okay.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
We did prices right.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Or price.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
All right.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
And then it was guessing the time of sentence.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
Should we just say fuck it for this segment then?

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
What do you guys want for me?

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
We're almost done.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
How many questions are out?

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
That was the last one.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Okay.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
60 months.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Yeah.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
A little over five years.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
I'll go with.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
I'll lose my job.

39:17.000 --> 39:24.000
Because then I could like do a conservative podcast and probably make like a lot more money.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
I would love to see case turned up.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
I think there should be a Donna coin.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
Donna.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Uh, plugs.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
I don't know how to make a crypto.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
What do we got going on?

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Plan?

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Why?

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
Amir, you looked at me like that's it.

39:46.000 --> 39:52.000
That was an anti climactic ending for a podcast that already lacked any pot.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
That was a waste.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Pretty good.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Really?

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Yeah.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
I mean, you were.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
We used to have it in the bathroom.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
That's true.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
I did spend a lot of it in the bathroom.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
But I had to prioritize number one.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Or should I say number two?

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Yeah.

40:09.000 --> 40:14.000
It's funny to spend five minutes out of a 45 minute podcast.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
That's shipping.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
Well, I didn't say that.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
You guys did.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
I was.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
But you.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
I never actually explained where I was going.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
I just said to the bathroom.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
I could have been anything.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Yeah.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
But then you also got number three.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
That's right.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
You're prioritizing number two.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Yeah.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
That's true.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
That's true.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
That's true.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
That's true.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
Yeah.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Nice.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Yeah.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
I guess that's okay.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Let's round it out with a couple more major killers.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
I'm going to do a round robin of this and just see what comes out.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Major killer.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
Don't spend too much time gifting for the holidays or birthdays.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
It's like first thought best thought.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
And when you overthink it, you end up giving someone like way too much shit or like something where it's like,

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
Well, I thought this and then I thought this because of this and then this because of this and then it's like,

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Oh, thanks.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Well, that was thoughtful.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
But this gift like isn't anything.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
Major killer.

41:00.000 --> 41:05.000
When you're dealing with someone at work who sort of like not it, you know,

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
they're not really him.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
You know, I think there's probably.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
There's at least two examples of that on the zoom.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
One of them's me, the other one's probably Marie.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
If I'm being honest,

41:15.000 --> 41:20.000
I would advise patients because you never really know what someone else is dealing with.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Yeah.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Major killer.

41:22.000 --> 41:27.000
I would say that flowers can brighten up anyone's day even if they're not like a flowers person.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Somebody gave me flowers the other day and I was like,

41:29.000 --> 41:34.000
Holy shit, this actually is pretty nice to have and I put them on ice in a bag.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Major killer.

41:37.000 --> 41:42.000
One of the most expensive details in an apartment is the windows, right?

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
So like you can either elevate your space or if you're like, you know, you want to do plaques and you know,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
you want to cut back costs on the other unit.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
You know, you can put shitty windows in there,

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
but then also you have to charge rent accordingly.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
You know what I mean?

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
But landlord's aren't necessarily ideal.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
Major killer.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
It's important to invest in lifetime pieces, right?

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
I have these two lamps here.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
They're vintage and they're pretty friggin awesome.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I'm going to sell them in two years.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Major killer.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
People don't get lead in.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
They earn it.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Right.

42:18.000 --> 42:26.000
So emotionally like you can't just expect to have trust with someone that they will open up to you all right away.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
Like it's going to be.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
I also want to go back to the windows of you.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
I'm a very hip major.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
Yeah.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Yeah.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
If you don't have double pain windows, they're insulated.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
And you are trying to cut costs on heating during the winter.

42:39.000 --> 42:45.000
Can I stick just putting up some foam along the line?

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
The line of the window, the pain of the window.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
I can also get some.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Casey and a mirror.

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000
Switching off just texting gun in the chat.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
I think this is danger killer.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
We finally lose our shit.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
It's all.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Yeah.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
We're all going a little fucking nuts at this point.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
Like enough is enough.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
This is a prison sentence.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
And people are going to just start snapping.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Hell yeah, brother.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
I'm not paying another $23 for a salad.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
All right.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Like that ends to the problem.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Yeah.

43:19.000 --> 43:27.000
Not like we're still in a pandemic because people can't fucking put on a mask for five minutes of the day.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
The salad.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
Yeah.

43:29.000 --> 43:38.000
Don't let anyone tell you how to feel.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Send your friends gifts.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Whether they're convenient for them or not.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Right?

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
So like put some thought into like, what can I send to a mirror?

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
What can I order for him?

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
That's going to be sitting out on his soup for a year.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
That makes me a killer.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Yeah.

43:54.000 --> 44:02.000
If you go to the Pandora world in Disney, I think just not waiting in line 45 minutes to go on not these river journey.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
If it's a five minute wait, sure, go on.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
It's set on a boat.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
But it's not worth your time.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
At Jeff Boy already on Twitter at Jeffrey James on Instagram.

46:06.000 --> 46:12.000
And also the first episode of review that I'm not on came out three days ago.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
So go listen to that.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
Yeah.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
It's going to be a funny episode.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
I know the topic that they did.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Uh, but I haven't heard it yet.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
So, uh, come along with me and listen to that.

46:23.000 --> 46:28.000
And Riley and I are performing at the, uh, had come happy hour that Marie could just mention

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
We're doing a, uh, live review bit sort of a send off.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
So, at the LA one.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Yeah.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
So come out for that.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
And, uh, let's send it out with, uh, seven more major killers.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Major killer.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
Every time there's a turning of the season or a change of the tides.

46:46.000 --> 46:51.000
It's good to keep everything closed except for your thighs, right?

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
So don't open up your mind to new ideas during periods of change.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Just don't get changed.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
You know, be nude and have your ass spread.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
Um, actually, I think that that kind of counts for.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
Oh, this is the second one here.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
Major killer.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
When your friends with someone like Marieka,

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
it's important to sort of check in and make sure that you guys are good.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
Right.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
I make a point on probably a weekly basis to be like Marieka.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
You know, is there anything I can do?

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
Uh, you know, to foster communication, to foster joy in our friendship.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
And she doesn't usually respond.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
Major killer.

47:21.000 --> 47:27.000
When you have glands, don't neglect them.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
Wank.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Major killer.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
Uh, don't forget to like experiment with your cooking, right?

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
If you cook at home, which obviously everyone probably should be.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
Most of the time, uh, it's important to, you know, try new things.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
Tie that yarn.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
You know, uh, let's fucking make a sauce that no one's ever made before.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Major killer.

47:45.000 --> 47:50.000
One of my favorite things to do is to read about times of your.

47:50.000 --> 47:54.000
But I think that one of my news resolution is to read more modern books.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Major killer.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
Change it up.

47:57.000 --> 48:02.000
You know, fashion wise, like don't be afraid to like wear those, you know.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
And we afraid to wear that hat in 2023.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
Major killer.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Pain to yard.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
Um,

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
2023 is going to be a huge year for the show.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
We've got a lot of ideas.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
I've got a lot of ideas.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Uh, so stay tuned.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Tell your friends and, uh,

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
look out for some announcements, maybe.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
That's does.

48:36.000 --> 48:49.000
That was a hit them original.

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
How's this for lighting for an ad?

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Whatever.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
You know my problem with edibles.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Sometimes you get so high.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
It can be really difficult to dose it outright, to control the how high you get.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
There's nothing worse than being baked out of your mind when you didn't plan on it.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
And you don't want to eat it.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
There's no going back.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
You just sit there suffering.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
I'm stoned out of your mind.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
That's why when I need the perfect medium high, I had up my friends at Diet Smoke.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
For the delicious Delta ATHC gummies.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Alright, Diet Smoke isn't light.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
It's just right.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
So what exactly is Delta 8?

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Delta 8 is a simply less potent THC.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Alright.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
The THC you're probably most familiar with is Delta 9.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
And while both are natural to the cannabis plant,

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Diet Smoke extracts their Delta 8 from hemp.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
So make all this loophole.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
I call it the secret recipe for getting a smooth, stable and most importantly, legal high.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Diet Smoke is legal in most states and it's non-prescription.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Just check Diet Smoke's website to see if they ship their delicious gummies to your state.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Now you're probably asking yourself, does that even smoke really get you?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Of course.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
The high you get with Diet Smoke is best described to somewhere between the chilledness of CBD.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
And that plastic stone feeling you get with regular weed.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Plus, Diet Smoke comes in two delicious flavors.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Blue raspberry and watermelon.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Try and both.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
I don't care.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
So with CBD isn't enough for you.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
And traditional THC is too much.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Enjoy the smooth buzz of Diet Smoke.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Alright, each gummy is infused with 10 milligrams of Delta ATHC.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
They're right from American grown hemp.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
And you don't think say, by American, get high with American.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Delta 8 gummies are low in sugar-fat free and delicious.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
And then I mentioned their legal.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah.

Christ.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Don't ever cross me.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
What's that?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Don't ever cross me.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Because if you cross me then you'll have a cross to bear.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Which is also me.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I'll be on your back.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Like the wood was on Christ.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Okay.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Fine.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I'll make your life.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
I understand.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I'm living shell of its former self.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Your house will be haunted.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Your clothes will be thread bear.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Do I make myself clear?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
It's going to be back.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Yes.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Yes.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
It's going to be back.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
You know, like there's no point in me being here already.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
The energy is great.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
What's that?

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
It's tough to be the third person who's not in the zoom slash room.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Well, it's hard to be a third.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Because, you know, you never know.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Like, especially if we start arguing, she feels like, oh, she shouldn't be here.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
But she does like how much of her responsibility.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
And honestly, none of it.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Because we're making the decision to bring Marie again.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
What do you want to mean?

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
If we were a family, would you say, like, we're three siblings.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Am I like the uncle and then you two are sort of brother and sister?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Like, what's your dad for sure?

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
I think she and I would be brother and sister.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
You'd be the uncle.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
And I sort of married into a wacky family.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Oh, I know.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
I think, I think you're, you're too, you don't marry into a wacky family.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Because you're self are too wacky.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
I see.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
So I had children and you, the children or you.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
I think you're a dad.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Oh, wow.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
That's very related.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Okay.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Then you had children.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
But then I, I, I, I, I, fear to think what the mom could be.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
That create you and Jeffrey at the same damn.

04:30.000 --> 04:38.000
I think we, like, have adapted too much of your personality.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
I see.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
So I am around you too often.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
And that's why I think.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
You act to have grown with me and to grown with me.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Are you not hearing me?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
I can't hear you.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I just don't want to.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
I don't like that.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
You say something.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
I'm trying to like power through.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
I'm Maria.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
This isn't how I wanted this to go already.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I love to go to family dynamic.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Family.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Yeah.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Let's talk about family for a second.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
Do family, I feel like family the whole thing with family is that they have

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
each other's backs.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
And, uh,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
hasn't always been the case.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Yeah.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Well, you're,

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
an adult age.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
So at a certain point, you sort of have to stand up for yourself.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Right.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
And I did.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
And that's why we're here.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
Um, Maria, I don't know if you know this, but they actually did performance reviews of you specifically.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
Uh, last, I think it was a June when last, I think it was last summer.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
And I didn't have your back either.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
So pay back, I guess.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
There's no way you submitted a performance review of me.

05:41.000 --> 05:50.000
I said she doesn't always make things the way I would have her make things in my head.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
This podcast is pretty much the only example.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
You don't bring to the table the energy that I ideally would like to have to feel to see.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
What?

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
What energy do you think I should have?

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Are you hearing this?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Yeah, it sounds fine.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
I'm asking for constructive criticism.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
I don't know.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
I, something, something, some kind of,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
pizzazz, some kind of, uh,

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
June a sec,

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
you know,

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
where people don't understand,

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
oh, like, oh,

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
sorry.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Are you in therapy?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
This feels weird.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
I can't do it.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
It doesn't feel good at all.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
It actually does feel nice.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
You don't actually, I'm going to take her bowl.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Because I'm not yet.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Yeah.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
And get comfortable.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I'm taking my shoes off.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Oh, she's this.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
You have the worst ankles I've ever seen.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
And that's coming from me.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
You do have skinkles.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Yeah.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Yeah.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
I'm thankful for my fangles.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
This is nice, actually.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
We've got producer Casey here as well.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Casey, what are your ankles like?

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
Um, regular, regular style ankles.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
That's what you want.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Yeah.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
You don't want fangles.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
You don't want cancels.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I don't think I think mine are pretty regular.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Yours are fine.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Yeah.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah, yours are fine.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Pretty good.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Let's see your ankles.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Oh, you don't have to show your face.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
It's fine.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
I'm doing that.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
I'm barefoot.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
I will say a problem with my ankles.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
A recent problem is that I got a bunch of bug bites.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Kind of like in a row on my ankles.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
And so now I've got some scars to deal with.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
But otherwise they're normal.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
You gotcha.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Yeah, I guess.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
I mean, I guess.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
You guys, you guys have like kind of similar socks.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
But truly the angle that I'm seeing Jeff's feet.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
It's like, this is half the size of a mirror.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Yeah.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
We do have the inverse.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
So open.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Imagine an ankle so thin.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
It can hardly.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
And you're also a more barrel chested.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
So you're very like, do you find yourself off balance?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Of course.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
But like that has to.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
That's the way into the calculus of how you move around because you're sort of so.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Top heavy.

08:10.000 --> 08:19.000
You know how there was like a meme for a while during the the height of the Avengers movies that Chris Evans body was shaped like a Dorito.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Jeff was like a Dorito on a stick.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
I'm like, why is the cake pop?

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Cake pops more accurate.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Not a cake pop, but a cake pop.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Yeah.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Very good.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Have you ever sprained your ankle, Jeff?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
That was easy.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Uh, I've never sprained my ankle.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I've never sprained my ankle.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
I've never broken a bone or been thrown one.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
What I have done is torn.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
My pectoral muscle.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Oh, wow.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
That sounds very painful.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Yeah.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
How?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Climbing.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Oh, my God.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
Put me out of commission, not only in the gym, but also sexually for the better part of 18 months.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
I bet I bet it probably healed faster than that.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
I was involuntarily celibate for those months and afterwards, right?

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
I think there must have been a level of voluntary.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
I'm a valsell, voluntarily celibate.

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
Um, I had an Instagram bio pitch that I wanted to get your guys thoughts on.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Born to be a drunken.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
No.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
You, you, you.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Drunken.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Drunken is another one of your crutches.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
What?

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I'm trying to help you.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
Born to be drunken.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
That I like.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
What?

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
You like that?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Yeah.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
This is sort of like born to be drunken.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Is better than born to be a drunken.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
Let's talk about sex, baby.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
No, let's talk.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Oh, my God.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
That's not it.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Self out of the week.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
I don't.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
There's no song.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Casey, there's no, there's no jingle.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
There's no parody.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
My pick is Jenny Osman.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Why?

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
What do you mean?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Why?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
He's a Turkish basketball player.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
He's unbelievably handsome.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
His jaw could cut not only glass, but also tension.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Hmm.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Yeah.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
It would be cool to have an athlete bond.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
What about Tom Cruise?

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Because he's sort of a cool mission impossible guy.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
He can transition into bond as he grays.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
What about Michelin possible?

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
So it's about a restaurant being like, honestly, we're not that far off.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Casey loved it.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I do like that.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Michelin possible.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
That's actually pretty good.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
It's better than born to be a drunken.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Michelin possible.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Murdieka, who's your bond to the fucking week?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Sorry for my.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
I don't mean to cuss.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah, I guess I wasn't prepared.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
I am wearing a Mads Mikkelson shirt though.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
For all the casino royale fans out there.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Yeah.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
The villain.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
So not he can't be bond.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
I love Jenny.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Full transition.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I mean, he.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
I mean he.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Dies.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
I don't remember.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
But.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
You can't say spoiler alert for every bond movie.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
You don't know.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
It helps the bad guy down.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
I feel like.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I love James Bond.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
I've seen all of them.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Why?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
What?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
What?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
I have hobbies.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
You guys tear them down.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
When I have a lack of cultural knowledge.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
You also tear me down.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
So I just do nothing, right?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
So what I do is I follow my heart.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Cheese style.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Are you Mads bro?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
And then it's a picture of Mads Mikkelson.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
He's ignoring me.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Is that your T-shirt?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
This shirt from Super Jackie by the way.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
And they have a lot of.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
They have a lot of good Mads shirts right now.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
I got a shirt.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Mereka that you would actually like.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I should have worn it today.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
It's a pranks in Austria shirt.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
So it's.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
A little more in Morris from as Winston and New Girl.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
But doing like the Frank Sinatra mug shot.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
And it just brings in Austria.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
That is.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
That's fun.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
I do like that.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
I guess my bond of the week is.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I just saw a picture of Ryan Gosling.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Daniel.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
I said Tom Cruise Tom Cruise.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Casey, who's your bond of the week?

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
He's looking at us.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Sorry, hold on.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I'm texting.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Holy shit.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Holy text to Pierce Brosnan.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
He wants to get his insight.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
He's part of the committee.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Um.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
How about a Timothy Shalaman?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
It could be like a young James Bond.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Oh, that would be bad.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
It could be like young Sheldon, but young James.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
No, fuck.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
What do you mean?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Whoa.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Young Sheldon.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
What do you say?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
My stance.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Mereka's a huge big bang stand.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
She thinks that it's not cannon to have young Sheldon also.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
She's a big bang.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
No.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
I wanted on record that that that kid was like a big feeder.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
It's still a big feeder influencer.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
And one time I saw him tap dancing on the sidewalk and that just ruins tap shoes.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
So I've been dead against him.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
You've been dead against him.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
What?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
12-year-olds.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Probably.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Tagway.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Like on the sidewalk.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Yeah.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
And now you hate the entire show.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Yeah.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Thousands of people work on it.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
They're fine.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
It's just this kid.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
It's just this kid.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Workers, woodworkers.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
They're all gracious.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
They're all gracious.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Yeah.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
I don't have to.

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
I don't have to like not like a show and not like everyone that works on.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Every one that works on it.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Right?

14:01.000 --> 14:09.000
I don't throw me under the bus saying like you need workers.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
I don't have to not like everyone on a show to not like the show.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Yeah.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
It computes.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
She just doesn't like the titular.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Yeah.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Now like the titular young Sheldon.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Yeah.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Um.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Sorry.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
We haven't had a major killer in a minute.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Um, I don't have anything but let's see what we come up with as this place.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Major killer.

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
Don't forget to bond with those speaking of bond with those closest to you.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
You have to make time for people that you maybe feel like you can put on the back burner.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
Like I would say that I'm here is one of my closest friends in the world.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
But we haven't hung out in a while.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
We never hang out.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
And I feel like you went on a trip with him.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Yeah.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
That was like a group.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
I was a company hanging.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
It wasn't a we never hang out one on.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
I would have loved to be wherever you and Abby tell her we're on that roof.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
What?

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
I'm posted a photo of you guys on a roof.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Oh yeah.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Oh yeah.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
That was one of her friends.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Graduation parties.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
You would actually not be in prison.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Twenty two year old.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Now I was in a college graduation.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Assault.

15:17.000 --> 15:23.000
Don't look at me like that.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
What do you want me to say?

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
What do you talk to your brother?

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
He's obviously acting out.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
He's hangry, cranky, or both.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
What's cranky?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
It's cranky and hangry.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
That's redundant.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Yeah.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
Let's talk about dating in LA for a while.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
We're in the wax period.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
We're in the wax period.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
I had a long segment planned after this, but you know what?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
I liked it.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Talk about Casey's dating life.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Fine.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Casey as much as you're comfortable sharing it.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
What is dating in LA like for you?

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
I went on a date like three months ago.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
There you have it.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
So you're in a relationship.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Let's call her now and let her know.

16:15.000 --> 16:21.000
Let's call her now slash daddy.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Was you didn't hit it off?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
No, we didn't hit it off.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Okay.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Was she rich?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Famous?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
She's this man.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
What?

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
Private questions layered on top of private questions.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
The only reason to date in Los Angeles is to social climb.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
And I'm very open and honest about that because why else would I not be single?

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Why else would I not be able to do exactly what I want when I want?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
How I want and where I want?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Why else would you not be single?

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Yeah.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
You mean you are single?

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
I am single.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
So why else would you not be?

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
No, I'm saying why would I want to not be single?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Unless it was just basically climb up the ladder.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Like I want to rub elbows elbows with like, I don't know,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
fucking amazing people.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Rub elbows.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Not a typo.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
I actually do want to rub my elbows.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
That's elbow pebbles.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
I'm fruity pebbles.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
So I'll hang out with famous people, right?

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
And they'll like sort of make me plank on pebbles.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
And I stand up to still pebbles on my elbows.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
And I want to be like, Mr. Curie.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Yes, sir.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Is that joke?

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
No way Joe Curie hangs out with you.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Joe?

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
A different Curie.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
A Curie.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
You were a child.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Curie.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
What will make me plank on pebbles?

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
I might get out there still pebbles on pebbles.

18:04.000 --> 18:14.000
But it's such a long way to justify your pebbles.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
That was easy.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
That was easy.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Yeah.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
What about you?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
You're not even married.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
You're just dating.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
So you're just seeing each other.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
You're like going steady.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Now we live together.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
What do you mean?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I'm not even married as if it's like that's the bar.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
If you're in the hospital, she can't be in the room with you.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Yeah.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
I'm sure she can.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
I mean, my lab one visitor doesn't matter if our marital status I don't think.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Okay.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
But if she had the choice to pull the plug, which obviously she would want.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Yeah.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
She can't make that choice.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
You're saying if I'm on life support.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
And I'm in a coma.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
If you're in hospice, she can't make the call.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Like if something terrible happened to be like,

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
When I'm like 90 or four years old or something.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
As an old man,

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
I feel you still feed me when I'm 42.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I'm almost 42.

19:06.000 --> 19:12.000
When do you think you're most attractive era will be physically?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
There's a lot of people we're saying on the head.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
But first of all, headgames sketches are back.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
YouTube.com slash headgum.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
If you're watching this video, you can also click on this channel.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
People were saying that you look great.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Oh, really?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
I didn't see any of those comments.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Yeah.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I saw some that said we look older.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I didn't see anyone that said anyone specifically looked great.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
There were some compliments about Riley's jump suit, I should say.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Yeah.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I feel like, but you know, you specifically,

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
I think latch on to like minor criticisms,

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
instead of like seeing the praise that's maybe on the table.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
No, I pretty much searched for praise with the fine tooth comb

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
and I didn't find any.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Is this on TikTok or YouTube, you saw?

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
This is going to be on YouTube for something.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Okay, I'll go back and look at that.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
I think my peak attractiveness was my mid-30s.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Like when I was 35 to 37.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
When like in our old office,

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
like pre-lacic post-move into LA.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
So do you ever do happen in LA?

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
I don't regret LASIC because it's much more convenient.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
But I think I looked more handsome with glasses,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
but I like not needing them.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Like I can always just put on fake glasses.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Yeah.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Which I did in our video.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Yeah.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I think you're, I think you're peaking.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Wow, thank you.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
I needed to hear that.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
And if you can find that YouTube comment, please send it to me.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
All right.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
Casey, when was or is going to be your peak attractiveness?

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Or is it now, do you feel?

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
I've only known you for like three months, so I can't wait in.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
When were you high-key, the Zaddiest?

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
I was probably high-key, Zaddi.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
At 2017, a lot of similar to me.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I guess it's four or five years ago.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
Yeah, but then, you know, I feel like, you know, a COVID.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Yeah.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Has taken a toll.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
I'm trying to get back to my Zaddi days.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Yeah.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
I think you're Zaddi.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Zaddi.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Well, thanks.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
Maria, same question.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Right?

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
Um, I have low self-esteem.

21:21.000 --> 21:29.000
I don't think I've hit my peak yet.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
That's really good.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
It's optimistic.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Well, it's actually high self-esteem if you think about it.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Yeah.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Best is yet to come style.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
No, because I just don't.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
I think badly of myself at current and past moments.

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
Well, when I made that call for people to sort of bed and or wed you on this show,

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
a couple of months ago.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Yeah, you should.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
There were a lot of people that were like, I want to.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
I'm sorry, but fuck, Marie.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Yeah.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
She's so screwed.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
I think they just said, fuck, Marie, kill like they were angry.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Yeah.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
That's what I read.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
I just heard the last two words of the sentence.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
There were like two people that had an elaborate date planned for you.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Oh.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
That could be exciting.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
Maria, could you ever date a head-gump podcast fan?

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
I feel like I would have to depend on the person.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
And I'd also just be always slightly concerned.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Right.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
That's why they listen to it.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
Or I should say, was it a check for or against if someone's like,

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
I'm a huge head-gump podcast fan?

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
I think it's pretty neutral.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
I don't think it's like the deciding factor.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
That's way that's worse than negative.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
Because it's like, it's the thing of, hey, man, what's your problem with me?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
You don't like me?

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
I don't think about you.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Yeah.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
I don't think about you at all.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Right.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
What do you mean?

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
So you'd rather, you'd rather someone have a strong opinion against the no opinion.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
I'd rather Marie could be turned off by the fact that they listen to the show rather than be like,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
it doesn't affect it at all.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Yeah.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
It should at least affect the decision.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
I don't think it should.

23:05.000 --> 23:12.000
Well, I guess the thing of that, it is like so many of us internally as a company

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
listen to it because it's like hearing what each other have to say.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
So I feel like in that way, there's like some level of like, it's okay too.

23:24.000 --> 23:31.000
But also, I would probably like, not if I didn't work.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
But do you listen to the episodes you're not on?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Sometimes, yeah.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
I fall in the hind.

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
I think we should do like a revolving door of like a sexual deep dive of everyone at the company.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
I don't think so.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Oh, thank you.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
That's right.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
That's probably legal.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
You know, I shouldn't be on the episodes when that happens.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
You know, exit interviews?

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Well, this is a Brexit interview.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
What are your thoughts on the whole situation over there?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
We can talk about it.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
I recognize that on its face, it seems.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Yeah.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Like a HR violation.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Yeah.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
But what's your answer to the question?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Do you think you've peaked?

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
You haven't peaked yet or you had a heyday and it's already over.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
I had a heyday in 2017.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Really.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
But right now, I'm in the best shape.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I've been in since high school.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Oh.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
And is that why you posted a topless photo of yourself to Instagram?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Sort of a.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
I mean, you got low key.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
You put their time.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
You got to do something with it.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
But I think I think I'm about to enter a stage of peaking.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Really.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
And I hope that I can hang on to it.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Because, oh my god, peaking is fleeting.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
And, you know, no one's ever happy.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
So.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Major killer.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
I'm sorry.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
He's a healer.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
He's a healer.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
He actually is kind of hard to hear.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
He's fleeting.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
He's fleeting.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
He's fleeting.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
And vice versa.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
And fleeting.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
He's fleeting.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Quick break.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
But before we do that, I'd like to mention that I ran into thinniest the other day.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Uh, who?

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Cool.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
Guys, our next partner has a product that I use literally every day.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
We're talking about letter greens.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
This stuff makes me feel energized.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Obviously, I have a lot of sleep issues.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Last night, I only got five hours.

25:15.000 --> 25:21.000
Um, but I started my day off right with a delicious scoop of athletic greens is AG1, right?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
It has everything I need.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
So what is this stuff?

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
Well, with one delicious scoop of athletic greens, you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins,

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
minerals, whole-food source superfoods, probiotics, and adaptogens to help start your day right.

25:32.000 --> 25:37.000
This special blend of ingredient supports your gut health, your nervous system, your immune system, your energy recovery.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
It's an aging.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
All the things, right?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
I wake up.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
I have water.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
All right.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
I got a, well, I wake up.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Get out of bed.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Drag a comb across my ass.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
And then I have AG1.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
All right.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
It benefits my energy.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
Uh, I feel just kind of more in tune with my body.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Uh, and it tastes great.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
I've said this before.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
I think it tastes kind of like tropical.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Um,

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
Micah disagrees with me, but that's how I feel about it.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
Uh, this stuff is lifestyle friendly, whether you eat keto, paleo, vegan, dairy,

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
or gluten free.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
It's all for you.

26:08.000 --> 26:13.000
It contains less than 1 gram of sugar, no GMOs, no nasty chemicals, or artificial anything,

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
while still tasting good.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
And it also, again, yes, supports better sleep quality and recovery, as well as mental clarity

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
and alertness, which they don't say this, but if you're recovering from COVID, give it a shot.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
It's helped me with some brain fog.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
Um, oh, here's my foster cat.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Okay.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
Um, it's the one thing with the best things.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
Well, that agreement uses the best of the best products based on the latest science with constant

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
product iterations and third party testing, and it costs less than $3 a day, but you're investing

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
in your health, and it's cheaper than your cold brew habit.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
It's also cheaper than getting all the different supplements yourself, and you're investing

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
in an all-in-one nutritional insurance.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
So right now, it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient daily

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
nutrition.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
All right.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
It's just one scoop in a cup of water every day.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
That's it.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
And to make it easy, athletic greens is going to give you a free one-year supply of immune

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
I'm about to go to Michigan.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I don't take my athletic greens.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
Uh, and all you have to do is visit athletic greens.com slash what's that?

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
And we're back.

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
Welcome to a segment that I like to call vague 73 questions.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Sorry, who did you run into?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Phineas.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Oh, Connor.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Billy, I'll hit it off.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
We didn't talk.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
So you don't run into it.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
We brushed apples.

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
Nice.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
All right.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Here we go.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
You guys know, Vogue 73 questions videos.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Yeah.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Well, this is vague 73 questions.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Great.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Wait, I think I'm going to sit up.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Yeah.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I think you should, I think you should, like, keep sliding down.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Until you're, like, awful.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
I can't really show.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
Oh, this is actually more comfortable here.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
So how's this for the framing, though, Casey?

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Can you still see me?

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
I can.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Yeah.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
I could see you.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Turn my mic.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Turn your mouth.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Yeah.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
This is actually one of the more interesting shots I've seen in the studio.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Okay.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
So Vogue 73 questions.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
They ask pretty basic questions, but it's just high powered celebrities.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
So people find it interesting.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
This is going to be because none of us are high powered celebrities.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
They're just going to be a little bit vagueer.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
That, yeah.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Let's hear it to you here.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Here we go.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I am verified on.

28:35.000 --> 28:41.000
You can be famous without having possessing any power.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Thanks.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
Because even in terms of, like, pod, not a content creation.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
It's mainly Katie.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Making the calls.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Appreciate it.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
I needed to hear it, especially today.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
It was a nice reunion.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
What's the, sorry.

28:55.000 --> 29:02.000
What's the movie you watch when you're feeling sad or happy?

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Are we watching this movie?

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Are we not.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
We'll go Marieka Casey, I'm here.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Okay.

29:07.000 --> 29:18.000
We very much when I'm feeling sad or happy is probably starter for 10.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
I knew it was my movie.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
I never fucking heard of it.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
What is that?

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
It's supposed to be relaxed.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
It's supposed to be calm.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
About cliches in England and going to college.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
It's good.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
And then some of our batch James McEvoy,

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Alice, the dominant Cooper James Corden,

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
Rebecca Hall, all in it.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
It's great time.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Not in it.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
Donna Hugh.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
You're a film buff.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
Yeah.

29:53.000 --> 29:58.000
You know, I'd probably say the quick and the dead Sam Ramey.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
Well, I just just getting over COVID.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
And I watched a bunch of my favorite, you know,

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
When you're sick, you watch movies that you like.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Yeah.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
And that was one of the ones I was like,

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
It's time to watch the quick and the dead.

30:12.000 --> 30:18.000
I was in a play in my freshman year of high school with Sam Ramey's niece.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Ramey Ramey.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
So how sick is that?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Is your last name Ramey?

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
No.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Who cares?

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Who cares?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Fine.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
I'm here.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Favorite movie.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
It doesn't matter.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Uh, white men can't jump.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
All right.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
What about favorite news in the last five years?

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
Hmm.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Let's do some quick and interesting.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
Because we do have 70 news in the last five years.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Yes.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
The vaccine was pretty cool.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
When they asked that.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Uh, success.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Vaccine was cool.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
I thought, uh, when Trump got COVID,

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Everyone was having a chance.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Yes.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
All right.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Change my answer.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
When Trump got COVID, for sure.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Hmm.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
We've a nice to see him.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Erish.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Do you ever otherwise?

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Favorite Marvel?

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Sorry.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Favorite Marvel?

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Favorite Marvel.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Favorite Marvel.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
Let's give that one together.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Ironman.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Ironman.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Ironman.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Nice.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
I'm here.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Why would you say?

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
She said Ironman.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
No, but I thought you were going to change the question.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
I don't like.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Favorite Marvel slash Marvel.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Uh, there's this marble I have.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
That was pretty sick growing up.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I've had this like red.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Little almost like a cracking it.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
But it was baked into the DNA of the marble.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Why do you die?

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I know you're telling about it, man.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Those are cool.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Thank you.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Thor Ragnum Marvel.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Casey.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Um.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Uh.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I'm black and I'm a name.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
What's it called?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
With the Thor Ragnarac.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Yeah.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
I just said that.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
No, you said Thor Ragnum Marvel.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Yeah.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
That's what we are.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
I couldn't even possibly think of the name after that.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
All right.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
What about a book you got?

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
What about a book I got?

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
I have the play.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
Small engine repair on my desk right now.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Nice.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Casey.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Uh.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Cathedral by Raymond Carver.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Collection of short stories.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Ooh.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
I feel like I also have that book, but just haven't read it because I'm dumb.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
I'm here.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
I've been trying to read one book a month.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
This year.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Wow.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
That's it.

32:50.000 --> 32:57.000
The four of red so far are the choice by Edith Eager.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
That's my pick.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
Number two is the honest book by meery and fader.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Also very good.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Number two.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
What's uh.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
All right.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
The biggest bluff.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
We need to be fast for it.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
In the videos.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
It's like question answer.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Question answer.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Yeah.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
We're making a meal out of all of them.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
The Bob Odin Kirk memoir.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
He just wrote was kind of interesting.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
If you're like a comedy fan.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Uh.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
It's funny that he wrote an autobiography just in the middle of his career.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
That was kind of interesting.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
And currently reading boon town.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Though I'm not too deep into it.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
So yeah.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
So far I'll say the choice kind of.

33:42.000 --> 33:47.000
You know, despite being about the Holocaust survivors.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Were you?

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Were like.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
They're him.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Did you realize?

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Oh, I'm going to grow up to be shit.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Or did you think that?

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Is this the next vague question?

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
So let's start with Marika.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Are you asking?

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Oh.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
Yeah.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
I did.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
I think I was going to grow up to be like shit.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
This is the next vague 70th question.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
A class you took in high school that you don't remember taking.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
So we can't answer this question.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
You can.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Oh, no.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
I literally.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I think mine is like.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Uh.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
United.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Like, you're not.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Oh, my god.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
American history.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Like, I just don't remember taking US history at all.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
I don't know if I did.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Interesting.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Yeah.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Pretty good.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
KCM here.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Uh, I took forensic science.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
But uh, my god.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
I don't remember any of it.

34:34.000 --> 34:43.000
I took chemistry, but it was senior year.

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
So at a certain point, it was like a new teacher who is almost our age.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
And he sort of let us just get away with stuff.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
So I didn't really learn.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Or we got to go faster here.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Go.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Favorite TV show that never was.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Go.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Oh my god.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Uh, the show that um,

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
Christmas plus and Nicholas Brown were supposed to star in.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Uh, I think it was called like friend me or something.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
And it never went to air because I think the um,

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
the writer uh died.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Hmm.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
He was a writer die.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Uh.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Let's stop going in order.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
Just shout out like a quick answer if you have one.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
My writer die.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Uh, Ralph.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
This equal to elf about a radio alien life form.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
I thought that was rave.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
No.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
You're thinking of rave.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Ha ha ha.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Name.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
Uh, also uh, Ralph.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Yeah.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Interesting.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
On a scale of one to 40.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
How are you feeling about life right now?

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Woo.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
My life or just life on earth.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Uh, your life.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Hmm.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
My life is like in the mid 20s,

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
but life on earth probably in the single digits at a certain point.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Hmm.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
Uh, 16 for my life.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Um,

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
single digits for just in general.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
Uh, 28 for my life.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
That's good.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
And uh,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
three, four.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Everything else.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
We're also cynical and pessimistic.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Favorite.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
What about you Jeff?

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Me probably 30.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Oh, that's good.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Favorite iPhone call.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
And what about for in general society in general society five.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Yeah.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Hello.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Favorite iPhone call.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
iPhone call.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
Favorite iPhone call.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Is it that you can't hear me or you don't understand?

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
It doesn't make sense.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
Like the weather's the last word that you said.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Call.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Okay.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Be me if you want.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
So like the ring tone, a ring tone.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Uh, they're vague.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
You can interpret them as an any way you want.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Favorite like the one that's like.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
Don't do, don, don, don, don, don.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
That's pretty good.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Yeah.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Thanks.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
I think your peaky.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Maria.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Like, my audio.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Physically.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Yeah.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Yeah.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
I'm sure a lot of people are going to see you singing that ring tone and find it charming

37:17.000 --> 37:17.960
Nice just things.

37:17.960 --> 37:18.760
Let's show a good.

37:18.760 --> 37:21.000
We can perfectly sexual.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.640
Next question.

37:25.640 --> 37:27.760
Least social media.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.280
сн Effort.

37:30.520 --> 37:31.880
Okay.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.000
That's really good.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.560
it starts don'tね it's anything

37:46.560 --> 37:47.800
It's not going to be fun, right?

37:47.800 --> 37:51.640
You don't have to move on when people hit the peak.

37:51.640 --> 37:53.960
Who shouldn't everyone know?

37:53.960 --> 37:56.640
So you're just going to ignore Marie's question.

37:56.640 --> 37:59.440
Again, KC, like, these are kind of like,

37:59.440 --> 38:00.720
it's a structure to play with it.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.480
And then it's like whoever has the funniest joke,

38:02.480 --> 38:03.880
OK, we end it there and move on.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.160
OK.

38:05.160 --> 38:07.560
Who shouldn't everyone know?

38:07.560 --> 38:08.560
You.

38:08.560 --> 38:16.520
Oh, my savage garden.

38:16.520 --> 38:24.520
Absolutely, wrecked him.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.520
Mercy kill.

38:26.520 --> 38:29.520
Do you have an audio thing that goes finish him,

38:29.520 --> 38:31.520
like from Mortal Kombat?

38:31.520 --> 38:34.520
How did you not get that set up?

38:34.520 --> 38:36.520
For no shame.

38:36.520 --> 38:39.520
Oh, nice.

38:39.520 --> 38:42.520
He said it so fast.

38:42.520 --> 38:45.520
He wasn't even done.

38:45.520 --> 38:50.520
Say Sam Ramees, niece.

38:50.520 --> 38:54.520
That's funny.

38:54.520 --> 39:00.520
Um, what food do you hate to not have?

39:00.520 --> 39:03.520
Hmm.

39:03.520 --> 39:06.520
Um, mashed potatoes.

39:06.520 --> 39:10.520
Bubbly drinks.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.520
Probably french fries.

39:12.520 --> 39:14.520
Yeah, I was going to say fries.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.520
You're also high up there.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.520
Favorite drink to eat?

39:19.520 --> 39:20.520
Milk shit.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.520
Bubbles to eat.

39:21.520 --> 39:23.520
That's kind of only one right answer there.

39:23.520 --> 39:24.520
Bubbles to eat.

39:24.520 --> 39:25.520
Oh, bubble tea's good.

39:25.520 --> 39:26.520
Yeah.

39:26.520 --> 39:29.520
Favorite dessert time thing?

39:29.520 --> 39:31.520
So favorite dessert?

39:31.520 --> 39:32.520
No, well, it could.

39:32.520 --> 39:35.520
If your favorite dessert time thing is the dessert,

39:35.520 --> 39:37.520
then yeah, it could be the dessert.

39:37.520 --> 39:39.520
But it could also be a digested steaf.

39:39.520 --> 39:41.520
It could be maybe your, you know,

39:41.520 --> 39:43.520
dirty talking with your partner and saying,

39:43.520 --> 39:45.520
Oh, like, I'm going to have you for dessert.

39:45.520 --> 39:48.520
Um, I've never had sex.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.520
It's going to be sick.

39:50.520 --> 39:52.520
Cookies.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.520
Cookies are good.

39:54.520 --> 39:55.520
Yeah.

39:55.520 --> 40:00.520
I'm going to have you for dessert.

40:00.520 --> 40:03.520
And now you want us to just say,

40:03.520 --> 40:10.520
like, how can we?

40:10.520 --> 40:14.520
Uh, vanilla or other.

40:14.520 --> 40:15.520
I'll say vanilla.

40:15.520 --> 40:16.520
Yeah, I'm sorry.

40:16.520 --> 40:17.520
Good.

40:17.520 --> 40:18.520
Me too.

40:18.520 --> 40:19.520
vanilla gets a bad rap.

40:19.520 --> 40:22.520
Coffee, tea, or wax.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.520
Oh.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.520
Oh.

40:28.520 --> 40:32.520
That hurt to hear.

40:32.520 --> 40:36.520
I like coffee.

40:36.520 --> 40:38.520
Maybe you disagree.

40:38.520 --> 40:39.520
Yeah.

40:39.520 --> 40:40.520
I'll go coffee.

40:40.520 --> 40:43.520
I like coffee because you got the ice cream component.

40:43.520 --> 40:44.520
You can have coffee ice cream.

40:44.520 --> 40:46.520
The green tea ice cream is not.

40:46.520 --> 40:47.520
Not it fam.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.520
But what about wax?

40:49.520 --> 40:52.520
Lacks like candles.

40:52.520 --> 40:53.520
Yeah.

40:53.520 --> 40:59.520
You know, they call an open card boxes in case is wax.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.520
Mm.

41:00.520 --> 41:02.520
Kind of a cool term.

41:02.520 --> 41:04.520
I'm not really stuck reading.

41:04.520 --> 41:09.520
If like, if you had an unopened box of 1986,

41:09.520 --> 41:12.520
fleer basketball cards, that's considered wax.

41:12.520 --> 41:14.520
And it's probably several hundred thousand dollars.

41:14.520 --> 41:21.520
I feel like I should put time in a half for the exact time code of everything you've set on this episode.

41:21.520 --> 41:24.520
Because it's been utter nonsense in a way,

41:24.520 --> 41:26.520
not only Casey's time and Marieka's time,

41:26.520 --> 41:28.520
whose time is much more valuable than mine,

41:28.520 --> 41:29.520
but also mine.

41:29.520 --> 41:32.520
And mine doesn't get wasted ever.

41:33.520 --> 41:38.520
Um, I'll say coffee as well, I think.

41:38.520 --> 41:42.520
What's the hardest part about others not being you?

41:44.520 --> 41:47.520
Disagreeing with their opinion.

41:47.520 --> 41:49.520
Mm.

41:49.520 --> 41:51.520
Yeah, I'll go with that.

41:51.520 --> 41:52.520
Yeah.

41:52.520 --> 41:55.520
What's your favorite band's favorite house?

41:56.520 --> 41:57.520
Yeah.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.520
Beverly Hills.

42:03.520 --> 42:06.520
That's where they want to live.

42:06.520 --> 42:08.520
Because my favorite band's weaser.

42:08.520 --> 42:10.520
That's them talking about a house.

42:10.520 --> 42:11.520
Yeah.

42:11.520 --> 42:15.520
Probably whatever house they're performing in at the moment.

42:15.520 --> 42:18.520
Um, house of the rising sun.

42:18.520 --> 42:19.520
It's my guess.

42:19.520 --> 42:21.520
That's nice.

42:21.520 --> 42:23.520
What's band is that?

42:23.520 --> 42:24.520
Uh, credence.

42:24.520 --> 42:28.520
There is a house and new Orleans.

42:28.520 --> 42:29.520
Is that a credence?

42:29.520 --> 42:30.520
That's the order of arrival.

42:30.520 --> 42:31.520
Is it?

42:31.520 --> 42:32.520
No, it's cream.

42:32.520 --> 42:34.520
Casey, do you know the band?

42:34.520 --> 42:36.520
Yeah.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.520
Yeah, I think it's either credence.

42:38.520 --> 42:39.520
I keep thinking the doors.

42:39.520 --> 42:40.520
The doors.

42:40.520 --> 42:41.520
I was going to say it.

42:41.520 --> 42:42.520
It's not the doors.

42:42.520 --> 42:43.520
But it's funny.

42:43.520 --> 42:44.520
I love the doors, but a house.

42:44.520 --> 42:45.520
So it's like it should be.

42:45.520 --> 42:46.520
Yeah.

42:46.520 --> 42:47.520
That should be.

42:47.520 --> 42:49.520
Yeah.

42:49.520 --> 42:53.520
Favorite house is favorite band.

42:54.520 --> 43:01.520
That one doesn't make sense.

43:01.520 --> 43:04.520
Song or long.

43:04.520 --> 43:07.520
Is that related or a new question?

43:07.520 --> 43:09.520
That's a new question.

43:09.520 --> 43:10.520
Song.

43:10.520 --> 43:11.520
Song.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.520
Yes.

43:13.520 --> 43:14.520
Song.

43:14.520 --> 43:17.520
Did you look up who's sing that song?

43:17.520 --> 43:19.520
Who are you asking?

43:19.520 --> 43:21.520
Anybody really?

43:22.520 --> 43:24.520
Oh, it's a song by the animals.

43:24.520 --> 43:25.520
Wow, I would not have guessed that.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.520
I guess one hit wonder.

43:27.520 --> 43:28.520
Hmm.

43:28.520 --> 43:29.520
Well, I know.

43:29.520 --> 43:32.520
I'm not somebody covered it.

43:32.520 --> 43:33.520
Interesting.

43:33.520 --> 43:35.520
Very interesting.

43:35.520 --> 43:38.520
Here we go.

43:38.520 --> 43:46.520
If you could sing a duet with Eric von Stroheim, why wouldn't you?

43:46.520 --> 43:48.520
Because I don't know who that is.

43:48.520 --> 43:49.520
Yeah.

43:50.520 --> 43:52.520
That was my answer.

43:52.520 --> 43:53.520
Yeah.

43:53.520 --> 43:56.520
You asked why wouldn't you answer.

43:56.520 --> 44:07.520
I'm just going to pee powering through because we're only at 22.

44:07.520 --> 44:08.520
Yeah.

44:08.520 --> 44:10.520
And so if you want, don't answer if you don't.

44:10.520 --> 44:12.520
We've gone through all how many 73.

44:12.520 --> 44:13.520
Yes.

44:13.520 --> 44:18.520
If you could master one instrument, where would it be?

44:18.520 --> 44:22.520
There's no way you have 50 more of these.

44:22.520 --> 44:27.520
No tattoos when would that happen?

44:27.520 --> 44:29.520
Now.

44:29.520 --> 44:30.520
Okay.

44:30.520 --> 44:35.520
To be or not to be or not to be.

44:35.520 --> 44:37.520
To be or not to be.

44:37.520 --> 44:39.520
Dogs or rats.

44:39.520 --> 44:41.520
Dogs.

44:41.520 --> 44:45.520
Bird watching and well watching or not.

44:45.520 --> 44:46.520
No.

44:46.520 --> 44:47.520
You have to do both.

44:47.520 --> 44:48.520
Okay.

44:48.520 --> 44:49.520
I would bird watch.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.520
Best gift you've never received.

44:51.520 --> 44:54.520
And here's answer is going to be love unconditionally.

44:54.520 --> 44:57.520
I was going to say that too.

44:57.520 --> 45:01.520
Best gift you've never given.

45:01.520 --> 45:03.520
McDonald's happy meal.

45:03.520 --> 45:04.520
Nice.

45:04.520 --> 45:08.520
Last thing you stole or a friend.

45:08.520 --> 45:10.520
A friend.

45:10.520 --> 45:11.520
Hmm.

45:11.520 --> 45:13.520
My friend, Jesse.

45:13.520 --> 45:16.520
What's your favorite game when you're busy?

45:17.520 --> 45:18.520
Good.

45:18.520 --> 45:19.520
Mortal.

45:19.520 --> 45:20.520
That's really good.

45:20.520 --> 45:23.520
First of all, answer.

45:23.520 --> 45:28.520
What's your favorite place to visit on a whim slash a veils?

45:28.520 --> 45:32.520
What's your favorite place to visit on a veils?

45:32.520 --> 45:33.520
Yeah.

45:33.520 --> 45:37.520
So like you're waiting to hear back about like an enterprise commercial.

45:37.520 --> 45:41.520
And you're jetting off to Vancouver.

45:41.520 --> 45:43.520
Okay.

45:44.520 --> 45:47.520
And that's your place to favorite place to visit on a veils.

45:47.520 --> 45:49.520
Or on a whim.

45:49.520 --> 45:52.520
It could be either or and or.

45:52.520 --> 45:55.520
I can't believe you have 46 more.

45:55.520 --> 45:56.520
Manhattan.

45:56.520 --> 45:57.520
Manhattan's cool.

45:57.520 --> 45:58.520
Yeah.

45:58.520 --> 46:00.520
What country do you wish never even happened?

46:00.520 --> 46:01.520
Oh my god.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.520
Probably the USSR.

46:07.520 --> 46:10.520
What's your favorite color for a day?

46:10.520 --> 46:11.520
Blue.

46:11.520 --> 46:12.520
Purple.

46:13.520 --> 46:14.520
Shoes.

46:14.520 --> 46:16.520
Shirts or other.

46:16.520 --> 46:17.520
Shirts.

46:17.520 --> 46:18.520
Shirts.

46:18.520 --> 46:21.520
Beach party or impassioned argument.

46:21.520 --> 46:22.520
Beach.

46:22.520 --> 46:23.520
Beach.

46:23.520 --> 46:25.520
Jogging or aerobic exercise.

46:25.520 --> 46:27.520
We already asked that one a few words.

46:27.520 --> 46:28.520
A aerobic exercise.

46:28.520 --> 46:30.520
Road trip of course.

46:30.520 --> 46:32.520
That's one question.

46:32.520 --> 46:34.520
That one's the yes or no.

46:34.520 --> 46:35.520
Yes.

46:35.520 --> 46:39.520
Best way to release tension between two former sworn enemies.

46:42.520 --> 46:46.520
Group massage.

46:46.520 --> 46:49.520
If you had no superpowers, what would be different?

46:49.520 --> 46:51.520
Nothing.

46:51.520 --> 46:54.520
What's the weirdest sauce in the English language?

46:54.520 --> 46:56.520
Or is it written?

46:56.520 --> 46:59.520
She made it away.

46:59.520 --> 47:01.520
She made it away.

47:01.520 --> 47:02.520
Jimmy Cherry's good.

47:02.520 --> 47:05.520
I say, where's just a shishire.

47:05.520 --> 47:06.520
Hmm.

47:06.520 --> 47:10.520
What's your favorite flower power?

47:10.520 --> 47:15.520
The ability to pollinate without any human interaction.

47:15.520 --> 47:17.520
Blossom.

47:17.520 --> 47:20.520
How was the last time you sighed?

47:20.520 --> 47:24.520
Good.

47:24.520 --> 47:27.520
It's good.

47:27.520 --> 47:31.520
Do you like your woodworking?

47:31.520 --> 47:34.520
Do you really have so many three of these?

47:34.520 --> 47:35.520
Yes.

47:35.520 --> 47:38.520
Why did you write them how long did it take?

47:39.520 --> 47:40.520
Oh my god.

47:40.520 --> 47:42.520
30 minutes.

47:42.520 --> 47:45.520
It's just dream of conscience.

47:45.520 --> 47:47.520
Do you cock?

47:47.520 --> 47:49.520
Sometimes you're okay.

47:49.520 --> 47:51.520
Never had.

47:51.520 --> 47:57.520
What's your least favorite thing about yourself or not?

47:57.520 --> 47:58.520
Not.

47:58.520 --> 47:59.520
Yeah.

47:59.520 --> 48:00.520
Not everything.

48:00.520 --> 48:03.520
What's your favorite thing about yourself?

48:03.520 --> 48:04.520
Why?

48:05.520 --> 48:07.520
I like that.

48:07.520 --> 48:10.520
I'm not addicted to my phone anymore.

48:10.520 --> 48:11.520
Yeah.

48:11.520 --> 48:12.520
Are you not?

48:12.520 --> 48:14.520
Are you lying?

48:14.520 --> 48:17.520
He's for sure lying.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.520
On my phone.

48:23.520 --> 48:29.520
Who slash why do you miss most slash jost?

48:29.520 --> 48:30.520
Sorry, guys.

48:30.520 --> 48:33.520
I think I'm going to try to strangle him.

48:34.520 --> 48:37.520
What are you listening to right now in this room?

48:37.520 --> 48:39.520
Bullshit.

48:39.520 --> 48:41.520
Nice.

48:41.520 --> 48:43.520
Favorite smell?

48:43.520 --> 48:44.520
Tony.

48:44.520 --> 48:45.520
Hitchcock.

48:45.520 --> 48:47.520
What I was working for?

48:47.520 --> 48:52.520
Why was the last time you spoke to someone on the phone?

48:52.520 --> 48:58.520
To get a prescription refilled.

48:58.520 --> 49:01.520
You're even bored.

49:02.520 --> 49:05.520
The high yawning is a very you never see that on TV.

49:05.520 --> 49:07.520
It must happen, right?

49:07.520 --> 49:10.520
Like James Corden has to like just be tired.

49:10.520 --> 49:11.520
Oh, 100%.

49:11.520 --> 49:16.520
But like you never see a basketball player yawning or a host yawning or like a guest yawning.

49:16.520 --> 49:18.520
Nice cast.

49:18.520 --> 49:22.520
I slept two and a half hours last night.

49:22.520 --> 49:24.520
Where was the last person?

49:24.520 --> 49:25.520
Sorry.

49:25.520 --> 49:26.520
Why did you go to bed?

49:26.520 --> 49:27.520
What's that?

49:27.520 --> 49:28.520
Why did you go to sleep?

49:28.520 --> 49:31.520
I went to sleep at four and you woke up at 6.30.

49:31.520 --> 49:32.520
I woke up at five.

49:32.520 --> 49:33.520
Why?

49:33.520 --> 49:36.520
To take my friend to the airport and then she missed her flight.

49:36.520 --> 49:37.520
Okay.

49:37.520 --> 49:38.520
So I turned back around.

49:38.520 --> 49:41.520
But then she was like, no, they got me on a later flight in two hours.

49:41.520 --> 49:45.520
So then I turned back around and then I hit rush hour traffic.

49:45.520 --> 49:48.520
So I didn't get home until eight and then I slept another two hours.

49:48.520 --> 49:50.520
So you wait.

49:50.520 --> 49:53.520
You dropped her off and then she's like actually I have a flight in two hours.

49:53.520 --> 49:54.520
Come back to get me.

49:55.520 --> 49:58.520
She missed her flight because of my being late to pick her up.

49:58.520 --> 49:59.520
Of course.

49:59.520 --> 50:02.520
So then you drove back with her away from the airport.

50:02.520 --> 50:04.520
I drove her to the airport.

50:04.520 --> 50:05.520
Correct.

50:05.520 --> 50:06.520
Roughly 15 minutes late.

50:06.520 --> 50:07.520
Okay.

50:07.520 --> 50:08.520
She misses her flight.

50:08.520 --> 50:11.520
The door is closed four minutes before she got to her gate.

50:11.520 --> 50:12.520
When was her flight?

50:12.520 --> 50:13.520
6.27.

50:13.520 --> 50:14.520
Got it.

50:14.520 --> 50:16.520
And she got there like around 16 to late.

50:16.520 --> 50:17.520
Yeah.

50:17.520 --> 50:19.520
And so you leave the airport with her?

50:19.520 --> 50:20.520
What's that?

50:20.520 --> 50:21.520
You leave the airport with her.

50:21.520 --> 50:23.520
I left after she went inside.

50:23.520 --> 50:24.520
Right.

50:24.520 --> 50:25.520
And so I'm going back home.

50:25.520 --> 50:26.520
Yep.

50:26.520 --> 50:27.520
Trying to go get some sleep.

50:27.520 --> 50:28.520
It's like 7.30.

50:28.520 --> 50:30.520
At this point, it's 6.10.

50:30.520 --> 50:31.520
Okay.

50:31.520 --> 50:32.520
And then she got her.

50:32.520 --> 50:33.520
It's like starting to get like.

50:33.520 --> 50:35.520
She's like, I might miss my flight.

50:35.520 --> 50:36.520
Okay.

50:36.520 --> 50:37.520
And I'm like, okay.

50:37.520 --> 50:39.520
Well, like, obviously come get you if so.

50:39.520 --> 50:40.520
Oh.

50:40.520 --> 50:42.520
I just wanted to point out that I am.

50:45.520 --> 50:48.520
Where was the last person you sent to text to?

50:48.520 --> 50:52.520
I think he was Marieka in her apartment.

50:52.520 --> 50:53.520
Yeah.

50:53.520 --> 50:54.520
You somewhere.

50:54.520 --> 50:56.520
I don't know.

50:56.520 --> 51:01.520
A sport you wish you could read.

51:01.520 --> 51:03.520
Like, you know, LeBron sort of surveys the court.

51:03.520 --> 51:05.520
Like, he can, you know, everything that's happening.

51:05.520 --> 51:06.520
I guess golf.

51:06.520 --> 51:08.520
I'm intrigued about golf after playing top golf.

51:08.520 --> 51:09.520
Yeah.

51:09.520 --> 51:11.520
We did play top golf and the retreat in Arizona.

51:11.520 --> 51:14.520
That was very fun.

51:14.520 --> 51:17.520
A hairstyle you know, you could pull off.

51:17.520 --> 51:18.520
But can, sorry.

51:18.520 --> 51:19.520
A hairy style.

51:19.520 --> 51:21.520
You know you could pull off.

51:22.520 --> 51:24.520
A hair style you know you can pull off.

51:24.520 --> 51:27.520
But could.

51:27.520 --> 51:28.520
It's hairy style.

51:28.520 --> 51:29.520
Really like real name.

51:29.520 --> 51:30.520
Yeah.

51:30.520 --> 51:31.520
Yeah.

51:31.520 --> 51:32.520
Fucking hell.

51:32.520 --> 51:33.520
It's the coolest guy in the world.

51:33.520 --> 51:34.520
Color.

51:34.520 --> 51:38.520
Did you see the video of him filming a music video in people's house?

51:38.520 --> 51:39.520
No.

51:39.520 --> 51:40.520
The late show.

51:40.520 --> 51:41.520
It's really funny.

51:41.520 --> 51:43.520
It's, uh, I think Ian Carmel probably wrote it.

51:43.520 --> 51:44.520
Oh, yeah.

51:44.520 --> 51:46.520
That's really good.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.520
Sun, glass, z night or other.

51:48.520 --> 51:49.520
Other.

51:49.520 --> 51:50.520
Other.

51:51.520 --> 51:52.520
Happy endings.

51:52.520 --> 51:54.520
The show slash crime.

51:54.520 --> 51:55.520
Who?

51:55.520 --> 51:57.520
The show.

51:57.520 --> 52:00.520
Favorite season within winter?

52:00.520 --> 52:02.520
The end of winter.

52:02.520 --> 52:06.520
I'm going to said cuffing season.

52:06.520 --> 52:11.520
Three people living or dead that you would like to dismiss.

52:11.520 --> 52:19.520
Benish Mark Paul Gossler.

52:19.520 --> 52:21.520
Why or why not?

52:21.520 --> 52:22.520
Why not?

52:22.520 --> 52:24.520
I would not.

52:24.520 --> 52:25.520
Hmm.

52:25.520 --> 52:28.520
He's a very talented guy.

52:28.520 --> 52:31.520
Life is a highway or train station mishaps.

52:31.520 --> 52:32.520
How do you know Mark Paul Gossler?

52:32.520 --> 52:35.520
Because say by the bell was before you were born, right?

52:35.520 --> 52:36.520
I know screech.

52:36.520 --> 52:37.520
Interesting.

52:37.520 --> 52:40.520
How were you recently?

52:40.520 --> 52:42.520
How were you recently passed away, right?

52:42.520 --> 52:43.520
What's that?

52:43.520 --> 52:44.520
You recently passed away.

52:44.520 --> 52:45.520
He's gone.

52:45.520 --> 52:46.520
Yeah.

52:46.520 --> 52:47.520
He's dead.

52:47.520 --> 52:48.520
Yeah.

52:48.520 --> 52:49.520
I'm pretty sure Gossler's gone.

52:49.520 --> 52:50.520
No, Gossler's alive.

52:50.520 --> 52:52.520
Dustin really died.

52:52.520 --> 52:53.520
Yeah.

52:53.520 --> 52:55.520
He wasn't screech.

52:55.520 --> 52:56.520
He was that chorus.

52:56.520 --> 52:59.520
I never thought say by the bell.

52:59.520 --> 53:04.520
How were you born and who?

53:04.520 --> 53:06.520
I think we got a pass on that.

53:06.520 --> 53:07.520
I don't know.

53:07.520 --> 53:11.520
What's the closest you've been from home?

53:11.520 --> 53:12.520
Very loud.

53:12.520 --> 53:13.520
Very loud.

53:13.520 --> 53:14.520
Yeah.

53:14.520 --> 53:17.520
Probably right outside the door or in the door frame.

53:17.520 --> 53:22.520
Sweepcakes or savory buns.

53:22.520 --> 53:24.520
Savory buns.

53:24.520 --> 53:25.520
Ooh.

53:25.520 --> 53:27.520
How many more of these are there?

53:27.520 --> 53:28.520
They're sin.

53:28.520 --> 53:29.520
Okay.

53:29.520 --> 53:30.520
Pretty good.

53:30.520 --> 53:32.520
Lipstick or oath keeping.

53:32.520 --> 53:33.520
oath keeping.

53:33.520 --> 53:34.520
oath keeping.

53:34.520 --> 53:35.520
Yeah.

53:35.520 --> 53:40.520
What book of the Bible have you read over and over and over and over?

53:40.520 --> 53:41.520
Revelations.

53:41.520 --> 53:42.520
Really?

53:42.520 --> 53:43.520
Genesis.

53:43.520 --> 53:45.520
This is a revelation to me.

53:45.520 --> 53:46.520
Exodus.

53:46.520 --> 53:48.520
Cause you read it during the summer.

53:48.520 --> 53:50.520
Of the people.

53:50.520 --> 53:53.520
Not sure.

53:53.520 --> 53:58.520
What favorite bedtime story as an adult?

53:58.520 --> 54:00.520
Hmm.

54:00.520 --> 54:03.520
I've been trying to read a book a month.

54:04.520 --> 54:07.520
What would be the title of your memoir?

54:07.520 --> 54:09.520
Failure?

54:09.520 --> 54:11.520
No.

54:11.520 --> 54:12.520
No.

54:12.520 --> 54:14.520
Mind what would be like avoiding a real job.

54:14.520 --> 54:17.520
The in your blue and spell of good equity.

54:17.520 --> 54:19.520
Who would play with a movie?

54:19.520 --> 54:22.520
Don't choose someone hot.

54:22.520 --> 54:24.520
Let's all choose for somebody else.

54:24.520 --> 54:29.520
Cause you never truly know what you look like.

54:29.520 --> 54:32.520
So for Jeff, I would choose Ben Kingsley.

54:32.520 --> 54:33.520
I don't know.

54:33.520 --> 54:35.520
I think he's gone.

54:35.520 --> 54:36.520
Right.

54:36.520 --> 54:38.520
But Ben Kingsley would be sick.

54:38.520 --> 54:42.520
Well, we need someone with the wafish ankles of a man who's passed.

54:42.520 --> 54:46.520
And who can do brown face and get away with it.

54:46.520 --> 54:47.520
If necessary.

54:47.520 --> 54:49.520
Slash ad nausea.

54:49.520 --> 54:51.520
Casey.

54:51.520 --> 54:52.520
Hmm.

54:52.520 --> 54:56.520
Who's a Casey like slash lucky like he.

54:56.520 --> 54:57.520
Casey.

54:57.520 --> 54:59.520
Do you consider yourself a redhead?

54:59.520 --> 55:00.520
Yes.

55:00.520 --> 55:01.520
I think Rupert Grint.

55:02.520 --> 55:04.520
Are you saying that cause he has red hair?

55:04.520 --> 55:06.520
What about that gleason kid?

55:06.520 --> 55:07.520
Oh, no, you don't know.

55:07.520 --> 55:08.520
Damien.

55:08.520 --> 55:09.520
Damien.

55:09.520 --> 55:11.520
What's his name?

55:11.520 --> 55:12.520
Damien.

55:12.520 --> 55:13.520
Not Shazel.

55:13.520 --> 55:14.520
That's the director.

55:14.520 --> 55:16.520
Damien.

55:16.520 --> 55:17.520
Her spine.

55:17.520 --> 55:18.520
No.

55:18.520 --> 55:20.520
Louis.

55:20.520 --> 55:21.520
Damien.

55:21.520 --> 55:23.520
That's good.

55:23.520 --> 55:25.520
And now for casting.

55:25.520 --> 55:27.520
Marika.

55:27.520 --> 55:30.520
How do we possibly start slash.

55:31.520 --> 55:33.520
Who's a Marika like?

55:33.520 --> 55:35.520
Maybe Zoe Kravitz?

55:35.520 --> 55:36.520
Hmm.

55:36.520 --> 55:37.520
It's pretty good.

55:37.520 --> 55:38.520
Yeah.

55:38.520 --> 55:39.520
It's watering.

55:39.520 --> 55:40.520
Oh, yeah.

55:40.520 --> 55:42.520
And lastly.

55:42.520 --> 55:46.520
Oh, kind of.

55:46.520 --> 55:49.520
You're kind of like one second.

55:49.520 --> 55:52.520
This is what Zoe talked.

55:52.520 --> 55:55.520
Her name would still be Marika in the movie.

55:55.520 --> 55:58.520
Hmm.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.520
I mean, I think you do look like Christmas loss.

56:01.520 --> 56:03.520
Not to bring it back.

56:03.520 --> 56:04.520
I met a once.

56:04.520 --> 56:05.520
Yeah.

56:05.520 --> 56:07.520
He sent me a photo of you guys next to each other.

56:07.520 --> 56:09.520
Nice guy, but Celtics fans.

56:09.520 --> 56:10.520
So I have to move that against him.

56:10.520 --> 56:11.520
Is he from Boston?

56:11.520 --> 56:12.520
Yeah.

56:12.520 --> 56:13.520
I think so.

56:13.520 --> 56:17.520
Um, least favorite animal that you guys think we should all eat.

56:17.520 --> 56:19.520
I don't.

56:19.520 --> 56:21.520
I don't think they're swine.

56:21.520 --> 56:26.520
I think we're roosters because all chicken sex is non-consensual.

56:26.520 --> 56:29.520
That's why I don't have feel bad getting.

56:29.520 --> 56:30.520
Eggs.

56:30.520 --> 56:31.520
Eggs.

56:31.520 --> 56:32.520
Tricks.

56:32.520 --> 56:33.520
Okay.

56:33.520 --> 56:34.520
Okay.

56:34.520 --> 56:35.520
This is good one.

56:35.520 --> 56:37.520
Why would you ever write it first?

56:37.520 --> 56:38.520
First good one.

56:38.520 --> 56:39.520
Well, is it?

56:39.520 --> 56:41.520
Why would you ever write a movie?

56:41.520 --> 56:43.520
Is that just for a mirror?

56:43.520 --> 56:47.520
Because everyone else makes sense.

56:47.520 --> 56:52.520
Oh, this is good.

56:52.520 --> 56:55.520
What's the reason for you to have a platform?

56:55.520 --> 57:02.520
To help other people.

57:02.520 --> 57:05.520
People do what you say.

57:05.520 --> 57:07.520
The people do what you say.

57:07.520 --> 57:09.520
The people do what you say.

57:09.520 --> 57:14.520
The people do what you say.

57:14.520 --> 57:20.520
If people do what you say, why would the world be any different?

57:20.520 --> 57:24.520
People do what you say.

57:24.520 --> 57:31.520
If everyone had to do what I say, I may write off the bat certain laws would change and things would be different.

57:31.520 --> 57:32.520
What laws would you change?

57:32.520 --> 57:33.520
I'm genuinely curious.

57:33.520 --> 57:38.520
I would get rid of certain weapons of mass destruction.

57:38.520 --> 57:39.520
Boom.

57:39.520 --> 57:41.520
Am I a hero for that?

57:41.520 --> 57:42.520
The world's gone.

57:42.520 --> 57:43.520
I mean, you tell me.

57:49.520 --> 57:51.520
You're not listening to music.

57:51.520 --> 57:52.520
Was that?

57:52.520 --> 57:53.520
Oh, sorry.

57:53.520 --> 57:56.520
I'm listening to her podcast.

57:56.520 --> 58:01.520
What drug should everyone have to take to deal with a mirror?

58:01.520 --> 58:02.520
I think ecstasy.

58:02.520 --> 58:05.520
Because you kind of really need to be happy to be around.

58:05.520 --> 58:08.520
Because he will still drag you down to a stasis.

58:08.520 --> 58:11.520
I think stasis is where you want to be, right?

58:11.520 --> 58:12.520
Yes.

58:12.520 --> 58:15.520
But if you don't take the ecstasy, he drags you down.

58:15.520 --> 58:16.520
To a stasis.

58:16.520 --> 58:17.520
No.

58:17.520 --> 58:18.520
That's good.

58:18.520 --> 58:19.520
Without the drug.

58:19.520 --> 58:20.520
You're saying drags you down to depression.

58:20.520 --> 58:21.520
Sorry?

58:21.520 --> 58:22.520
Yeah.

58:22.520 --> 58:23.520
Yeah.

58:23.520 --> 58:24.520
You need a stimulant.

58:24.520 --> 58:25.520
Yeah.

58:25.520 --> 58:26.520
Yeah.

58:26.520 --> 58:30.520
Desert sunsets are suing headgum.

58:30.520 --> 58:37.520
Obviously, the first one is the second one.

58:37.520 --> 58:46.520
The second one will financially ruin me.

58:47.520 --> 58:49.520
Well, that was vague 73 questions.

58:49.520 --> 58:54.520
Thank you guys so much for your in-depth answers and not.

58:54.520 --> 58:56.520
Let's do plugs.

58:56.520 --> 58:57.520
Casey, what do you have going on?

58:57.520 --> 59:00.520
What do you want to point the people to the floor is yours?

59:00.520 --> 59:02.520
Follow me on Twitter.

59:02.520 --> 59:03.520
At Casey Downey.

59:03.520 --> 59:04.520
That's it.

59:04.520 --> 59:05.520
How is Top Gun?

59:05.520 --> 59:08.520
Did you see it in 4DX?

59:08.520 --> 59:11.520
No, I just saw I'm X, but...

59:11.520 --> 59:12.520
Was it awesome?

59:12.520 --> 59:15.520
I mean, to see those guys fly those planes

59:16.520 --> 59:18.520
is really something.

59:18.520 --> 59:19.520
It really is.

59:19.520 --> 59:25.520
Is it better than the original Top Gun, a movie I despise?

59:25.520 --> 59:28.520
As a movie, the story is like whatever.

59:28.520 --> 59:29.520
It's just like it does.

59:29.520 --> 59:30.520
But you don't go for the story.

59:30.520 --> 59:35.520
You're going to see Tom Cruise fly a plane upside down for real.

59:35.520 --> 59:36.520
Yeah.

59:36.520 --> 59:37.520
He's fucking worth it.

59:37.520 --> 59:38.520
He does this shit.

59:38.520 --> 59:39.520
Yeah.

59:39.520 --> 59:40.520
He's a madman.

59:40.520 --> 59:41.520
He's a madman.

59:41.520 --> 59:42.520
Yeah.

59:42.520 --> 59:43.520
He's a madman.

59:43.520 --> 59:44.520
Yeah.

59:45.520 --> 59:47.520
He's a goose.

59:49.520 --> 59:50.520
Um...

59:50.520 --> 59:51.520
Maria?

59:51.520 --> 59:52.520
Uh...

59:52.520 --> 59:59.520
Follow me on Twitter, Instagram, and letter boxed at Maria Gailon.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.520
Follow head-gum on TikTok.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.520
Yeah, we're almost at 10K followers.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.520
I think we're going to get there.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.520
We've got to go for the end of the month.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.520
Why don't you more viral bumps?

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.520
And I think we should get there.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.520
Yeah.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.520
And I'm going to plug two things.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:15.520
My Twitter.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.520
Because I'm almost at 10,000.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.520
That would make me sort of...

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.520
It's been like that for months.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.520
Dateable.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:24.520
And the head-gum YouTube channel.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.520
Head-gum sketches.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.520
Back.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.520
Every other week.

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.520
Uh, this comes out...

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.520
This upcoming...

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.520
On the third.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:32.520
A week from today.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.520
This comes out June 3rd.

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:35.520
So there's another one coming out June 7th.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.520
And we just released one on May 24th.

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.520
So I go check that out.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.520
Or don't.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.520
How did people like this snacks one the new one?

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.520
I think it was a hit.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.520
I think it was unequivocally a hit.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.520
I didn't see any negative comments.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.520
Wow.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:50.520
People's appearances are vibes in general.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:51.520
But...

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.520
I was like...

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.520
Very young.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.520
Yeah, we're young.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.520
Very funny.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.520
And better since the pandemic.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.520
The pandemic didn't basically age us at all.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.520
Yeah.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:01.520
I don't know.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.520
We'll see you guys again next week.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.520
Thanks so much for listening.

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.520
This episode of the Head-gum podcast.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.520
I guess...

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:06.520
That's not as folk.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.520
Could have asked one last question.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.520
Yeah.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:15.520
Just curious if you like the vibe of me laying down versus sitting like...

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:18.520
Is there something like, should I like lean into that?

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.520
Or is it like sort of a one-off?

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.520
You guys didn't really appreciate that.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.520
Or you thought it sort of added to the...

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.520
Yeah.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.520
Leave comments below.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.520
The energy.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.520
Yeah.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:29.520
I personally really liked it.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:33.520
I really wanted to see a mirror on the floor by the end melting.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.520
Yeah.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:38.520
And I posted some screenshots to Slack.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.520
A lot of people wanted you on the floor, so...

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.520
Okay.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.520
So pointing that you will back up.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.520
A little more on the floor fell.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.520
Okay.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.520
And I'm curious to see what the camera picked up.

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:48.520
Okay.

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.520
Let's hear the...

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.520
What was it?

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.520
That is...

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:55.520
That's a dot and dots, folks.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.520
Say the catch phrase again.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.520
I'm just going to end it here.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.520
And it'll end on like a low energy note because of you.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.520
Okay.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:04.520
Okay.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.520
Okay.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.520
Okay.

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.520
Okay.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.520
Okay.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.520
Okay.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.520
Okay.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.520
Okay.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.520
Okay.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.520
Okay.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.520
Okay.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.520
Okay.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.520
Okay.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.520
Okay.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.520
Okay.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.520
Okay.

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.520
Okay.

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:22.520
Okay.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.520
Okay.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.520
Okay.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.520
Okay.

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.520
Okay.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:27.520
Okay.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.520
Okay.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:29.520
Okay.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.520
Okay.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:31.520
Okay.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.520
okay.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.520
Okay.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.520
Okay.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.520
Okay.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.520
Okay.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.520
Okay.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.520
Okay.

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:39.520
Okay.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.520
Okay.

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.520
Okay.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.520
Okay.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.520
Okay.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.520
Okay, okay.

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.520
Okay.

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:47.520
Okay.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.520
Okay.

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.520
Okay.

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.520
Okay.

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:52.520
Okay.

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.520
Okay.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.520
Okay.

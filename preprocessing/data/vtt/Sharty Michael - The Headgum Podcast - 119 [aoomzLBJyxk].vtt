08:34.980 --> 08:41.140
No, yeah, but the cooking one could be like private jeffery. Yeah, that would be cool. I do I do

08:41.940 --> 08:44.580
Think that I I can I can roast a chicken

08:45.300 --> 08:50.980
You're magic and not my chicken, but like I can roast a chicken. So it's one of those things where I'm like, you know

08:50.980 --> 08:55.060
That is a that's a that's a skill that I have in my pocket, but what am I really using it?

08:55.380 --> 09:00.820
I'm sorry. I'm just imagine I'm imagining like chicken on a day is and everybody making fun of her

09:01.780 --> 09:09.220
Like a roast a comedy central roaster chicken. Oh, it's pretty good. Or it's just like you're eating your cat. Sorry one second

09:09.220 --> 09:17.700
It's you're bullying your cat. Well, you sort of like use a rotisserie. Yeah, but yeah, I know I'm like

09:18.580 --> 09:20.580
You please no

09:24.580 --> 09:30.660
I also would love I guess I myself improvement things. I'd love for my dating life to be going better

09:31.380 --> 09:33.940
But you know, what are you gonna do?

09:34.980 --> 09:40.100
Can't say I'm trying it's a num it's a numbers game and I think hinge and all those apps are

09:40.100 --> 09:43.300
Recreated to make you feel bad about yourself. I don't think they're supposed to make you

09:43.940 --> 09:45.940
Find anybody

09:46.500 --> 09:51.460
It's just awesome for you guys or is he just not moving? No, he was I think he's just having a moment

09:52.180 --> 09:56.740
I don't think the show is going going according to his plan. It's going better than I thought so far

09:57.460 --> 09:59.940
You said you wanted to get real. That's what's real with me

10:00.900 --> 10:02.900
Unsatisfied

10:03.540 --> 10:04.900
Uncut

10:04.900 --> 10:06.900
Are you on field?

10:07.940 --> 10:11.380
That's that it's like the casual sex

10:13.460 --> 10:18.180
But people know they never heard of that. It's a great app. I would say it's the only app worth having

10:20.340 --> 10:24.180
People are very honest about what they're looking for and sometimes that's dating sometimes. It's not

10:24.740 --> 10:28.180
But I find the most intelligent people to be on field

10:28.820 --> 10:30.820
Oh, interesting

10:30.820 --> 10:37.060
Yeah, it is also good get forward if you're not into that, but it's a great app. I mean this earnestly

10:39.220 --> 10:41.700
I received I received and thank you

10:44.660 --> 10:46.660
I saw a mirror on there once

10:46.980 --> 10:50.660
Your bio was just playing the field now and

10:51.780 --> 10:55.380
Seeing what it was all about my bio would be a mirror that lumenge field

10:55.780 --> 11:00.020
So it would be like I'm outing myself. This is my full name have at it

11:00.020 --> 11:03.860
But also kind of a pun a wink and a nod to the name of the app itself

11:04.660 --> 11:07.780
I know but like the the profile seemed like a joke

11:07.780 --> 11:13.060
I don't know if you guys were doing like a bit on if I were you but then all of like the interests were highly sexual

11:13.620 --> 11:17.860
I mean some really gnarly stuff like a cock and ball torture

11:19.300 --> 11:21.300
Hot wax on your eyes

11:22.020 --> 11:24.820
You wanted someone to give you a haircut sexual. I don't know what that means

11:25.460 --> 11:32.900
Like what is it like a favorite one of three? I think it probably means pubic waxing, but I don't think I ever put it there

11:32.900 --> 11:37.940
And I definitely wasn't ever on this app. Oh, I know it was yes. Let me just go to the opposite

11:40.180 --> 11:43.380
Yeah, that was the I came across the account I created for you. Oh

11:44.260 --> 11:46.260
I see

11:47.460 --> 11:49.700
Watching yellow jackets so uh

11:50.820 --> 11:52.100
Fuck you

11:52.420 --> 11:54.660
I loved yellow jackets. I loved it

11:54.740 --> 11:56.740
It's so good

11:56.740 --> 12:01.140
I have one more episode of season one so no spoilers no spoilers in general because everybody should go watch it

12:02.260 --> 12:08.420
But tag yourself without saying any spoilers. Who would you be in the forest you'd be misty

12:11.220 --> 12:14.820
Okay, I haven't seen the show so I'm not really sure about

12:15.620 --> 12:17.620
Misty grows on you

12:17.620 --> 12:22.980
Versus incredible hours over time like he's churning up first and then you realize that he's sort of hollow

12:23.620 --> 12:25.620
Right right

12:25.620 --> 12:27.620
Who you

12:29.860 --> 12:31.860
Who would Ali be at once there?

12:33.620 --> 12:40.100
Ali who did it? I don't I don't remember anyone's names that while I watched it so long ago

12:40.420 --> 12:44.900
Part of me could I would have fun maybe being lobby and and yeah

12:44.900 --> 12:49.460
I've always seen I was wanted to run a call. Oh, yeah

12:51.060 --> 12:52.580
Talk about monetizing a hobby

12:53.060 --> 12:57.300
Yes, right that's really great and that's not even like quantifiable

12:57.860 --> 12:58.900
You know

12:58.900 --> 13:04.340
Currency that's you know social currency spiritual currency which you can't put a number of value on

13:04.900 --> 13:08.580
No totally I've been watching Madman for the first time

13:09.300 --> 13:12.580
Whoa, I have one more episode left. Wow

13:14.180 --> 13:18.580
That's really exciting. Yeah, I mean I get it. I get why people thought it was good

13:19.540 --> 13:24.100
Not I'm liking it. I'm I love the clothes you know

13:24.100 --> 13:30.500
I think more than analyzing like this I do like analyzing the story lines and all that stuff

13:30.500 --> 13:34.260
But I can't believe how put together everybody was

13:34.900 --> 13:40.260
Esthetically every single day for years and years and years. I don't have that in me. Yeah

13:40.900 --> 13:44.900
Well, that's it's a fictional show true true

13:45.540 --> 13:49.780
But I'm like Taylor you're shitting yourself if you think I'm sorry

13:52.820 --> 13:54.820
Well, I think you meant like kidding yourself

13:55.940 --> 13:59.220
That was pretty obvious that I

13:59.620 --> 14:02.820
Guess over the course of this podcast at one point

14:04.420 --> 14:10.660
You might have pooped your pants. I was gonna crawl up quickly for that. I just and I'm my emotional

14:11.380 --> 14:14.980
Band with is running very thin today, so it's gonna be apologizing a lot

14:15.540 --> 14:20.900
Yeah, I get texted me saying that do you know where to get an industrial grade plastic wrap for couches?

14:21.700 --> 14:23.700
I guess it's for the radio

14:23.700 --> 14:25.700
I don't think that anything to do with me

14:26.260 --> 14:32.900
That was probably on Jake was in here before I was in here for the record with Marty. I don't know what they were doing

14:33.700 --> 14:37.860
I was in that zoom and that also felt like a few

14:38.820 --> 14:43.460
Sharding situations happened made meeting I was there too

14:43.780 --> 14:45.780
Something was going on

14:45.780 --> 14:50.500
Jake called me shardy Michael at a certain point and I had it was like kind of an inside joke unrelated

14:50.500 --> 14:52.980
So I now I'm starting to put the pieces together

14:56.740 --> 15:02.980
This is a weird company. This is a very weird company. What about shardy Michael as the episode title?

15:02.980 --> 15:07.620
Because I don't think he listens to this, but I feel like he'd have to if that came across his feet

15:08.340 --> 15:10.340
Shardy ginger vitis

15:17.060 --> 15:19.060
I got yeah, I got an espresso machine

15:19.780 --> 15:21.780
By the way, this is a wax episode

15:22.180 --> 15:28.500
Oh, we have nothing planned. We have nothing. No segments planned. Yeah, we came in here saying we have a good episode planned

15:29.380 --> 15:34.980
That was to keep morale high that was to have you guys kind of spend the first 15 to 20 minutes being like there's more coming

15:35.300 --> 15:37.300
Yeah, is it

15:37.300 --> 15:40.820
All right, I see I thought a wedding over the weekend long weekend short week

15:41.300 --> 15:42.900
I started a gig

15:42.900 --> 15:45.300
You're blowing all day

15:45.300 --> 15:47.300
All talk

15:47.300 --> 15:51.140
One rapid fire lightning rounds. Thank God. I thought you

15:52.340 --> 15:56.500
Thank God we had seven straight minutes of a mere talking about financial investments

15:56.580 --> 16:01.940
Yeah, and now that that's only half way done with the first 15 minutes. We still have another half hour to go

16:02.180 --> 16:04.580
Are you just blue by an espresso machine?

16:04.580 --> 16:10.020
You went straight to a wedding and then we're on to like oh, what'd you say a new gig on Tuesday? Oh?

16:10.020 --> 16:13.060
Yeah, what Tuesday? What's that? What?

16:15.860 --> 16:18.100
I can't talk about it. I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to talk about it

16:18.100 --> 16:21.060
I don't want to say a few talk about it, but all I thought yeah

16:22.500 --> 16:24.500
Well, I thought you wanted to connect

16:25.380 --> 16:31.540
Okay, we can talk about my really cool fall outfit that are today. No, yeah, let's do it. Let's start with Kayla. Let's connect

16:32.340 --> 16:34.340
for

16:34.340 --> 16:36.340
Okay, yeah, okay

16:38.660 --> 16:43.620
So I'm wearing a cool fall outfit today. It's misty and starting to feel like fall New York

16:43.620 --> 16:45.620
So that's all I have

16:45.620 --> 16:47.940
Do you like where to rank that seasonally?

16:49.220 --> 16:53.700
Fall number one summer two spring three winter four. Wow spring three

16:54.020 --> 17:00.020
upset allergies babe can't handle it. I see I'm really excited for fall

17:00.020 --> 17:03.220
I need to go to the grocery store after this. I'm going to go to Trader Joe's

17:04.260 --> 17:12.900
Get an array of fall nonsense. It's a hundred and six out. I saw you drinking a hot pumpkin spice latte and a Starbucks parking lot

17:13.860 --> 17:19.860
wedding their shirts off you were so you were the hot one has less calories than the ice blended

17:20.340 --> 17:22.340
Is that true? It's felt

17:24.100 --> 17:31.140
Is that true for real? I think it's I don't know. I don't you know counting calories isn't good for you. No, it's not

17:32.180 --> 17:39.940
Just eat less mindful right right yeah in exercise yeah 10,000 steps. I'm sorry to say

17:40.980 --> 17:48.420
Well, I have a question for everyone. My good Marty we're talking about working out in the office earlier today

17:48.420 --> 17:55.060
and Micah referred to it as getting swollen and then he looked at me and I was laughing at him and

17:55.060 --> 18:00.100
He goes what that's just locker room talk and then Marty was like you can't say those words

18:00.900 --> 18:03.380
Let's discuss that. Can you say those words?

18:04.020 --> 18:09.700
The words locker room talk like the phrase locker room talk is no longer acceptable

18:11.220 --> 18:14.100
Did you get earnestly or was it a trump or a prince in jazz?

18:14.420 --> 18:24.180
It's Micah, so it's like genuine but also he was being a little playful. Yeah, yeah, he was he was going to say like this is how dudes talk

18:24.580 --> 18:30.340
But that he said this is locked locker room talk which is how Trump sort of passed off

18:31.140 --> 18:35.060
Right, yeah salt clean in 20 exactly

18:36.500 --> 18:40.180
Right, with Billy Bush. Yeah, yeah, yeah

18:41.140 --> 18:46.420
I started they maybe you shouldn't say locker room talk, but what if you're talking about a locker room?

18:46.980 --> 18:54.100
I would just say I think even then you can't say that in the locker room or not because oftentimes like

18:54.900 --> 18:59.140
You're in the showers and there's only like scalding or freezing and I'd rather do freezing

19:00.100 --> 19:01.780
Sure

19:01.780 --> 19:06.660
I've started doing this is not really exercise, but it is like bettering my body in some way

19:07.620 --> 19:10.820
Like Ming dynasty era foot binding, but for my hips

19:11.860 --> 19:13.220
Oh

19:13.220 --> 19:15.940
Tell us more. Why have very wide hips?

19:16.580 --> 19:22.100
Everything hips. Yeah, I've birthed in your hips. Yes, and I'm in great shape right now

19:22.740 --> 19:24.980
Best shape. I've been in since high school. I think

19:25.460 --> 19:31.140
Congrats. Thank you, but I still have these wide hips and you can't have the V

19:32.100 --> 19:36.740
With I see hips that honestly look like me's

19:39.700 --> 19:46.820
What so I'll sort of tie a belt around my hips and sort of pull binding the hips to be

19:47.060 --> 19:50.020
Go from like a 30 inch ways to like a 28 inch waist

19:50.900 --> 19:54.740
I feel like you're describing a really that's a course that

19:55.700 --> 20:01.860
Well, that's not like the ribs the navel. Yeah, I don't yeah, I that'll make the problem worse

20:03.220 --> 20:08.900
No, you're right. You're right. I you know what it's hard having an hour glass figure

20:09.540 --> 20:11.540
Yeah, so sorry fucked up

20:12.580 --> 20:17.460
I'm taking a class online and they have a whole hip

20:18.020 --> 20:24.020
Flexibility section that could be helpful in turning like your hips in a little bit. It's called contortion 101

20:24.340 --> 20:26.020
That's good because I

20:26.740 --> 20:35.140
Historically I've opened up my hips for anyone who's asked and so the issue now is that I need to close them up. Yeah, yeah, is that what you put on your field?

20:38.820 --> 20:41.860
I don't know should say historically in any dating bio

20:42.420 --> 20:44.420
Honestly, historically haven't done well

20:45.860 --> 20:47.860
Not so it's the 70s I want to say

20:48.020 --> 20:50.020
Yeah

20:51.620 --> 20:58.420
What Jeff that was fine. It was you got some laughs and move the conversation along Jeff texted me

20:59.700 --> 21:05.300
Fucking helped to bring the funny and now you're texting again. I mean I am. I think I'm doing a fine job

21:06.020 --> 21:13.540
I'm sorry. I'm not being funny in our future. You're grinding you're grinding the show to a halt at every turn

21:13.620 --> 21:15.620
You planned nothing

21:15.620 --> 21:17.620
We're saying normal things

21:19.380 --> 21:22.100
Head in hand to respond it. Yeah

21:22.660 --> 21:26.820
To have to take a break. We have to take a break. Oh my god chicken

21:28.100 --> 21:29.940
Yeah

21:29.940 --> 21:35.540
Thank you to athletic greens for sponsoring this episode of our show guys. I use athletic greens every day

21:35.940 --> 21:38.820
All right instead of taking a million different pills and vitamins

21:38.820 --> 21:43.300
I get it all from one morning drink. I've been doing wake up water and

21:43.540 --> 21:46.660
athletic greens espresso maybe in Americano

They're always striving to make it the best it can't be it costs less than three dollars a day and you're investing in your health

22:53.700 --> 22:55.540
And it's cheaper than a cold brew habit

22:55.540 --> 23:00.260
It's also cheaper than getting all the different supplements yourself. I used to get all these different vitamins that are included in that

23:00.260 --> 23:04.340
Out of greens separately and it was hundreds of dollars a month now. It's much less than that

24:06.100 --> 24:09.300
The eyes are incredible. She just saw something with your likes

24:10.020 --> 24:12.020
You know what she loves a bird

24:12.020 --> 24:14.500
Yeah, do you ever put on the cat TV for?

24:15.220 --> 24:20.420
She loves it. You know what her favorite cat TV video is

24:21.140 --> 24:27.700
It's a of a little trail in a park and my favorite part of the video is this woman walk spy with some dogs

24:28.260 --> 24:30.260
Every time it gets me

24:30.580 --> 24:32.580
And watch it 60 times

24:33.860 --> 24:35.860
Like it bears you or you're like all

24:36.580 --> 24:41.700
No, I'm just it's more like a marker of time where I'm like. Oh, that's my favorite bird. I guess and then I

24:42.660 --> 24:47.780
I've just fully accommodate my life towards her needs and wants which is fine

24:49.780 --> 24:54.980
Just fine, and it's not bad. It's not even over there. Yeah, it's nice. It's just it just is

24:55.540 --> 24:58.340
Yeah, if you guys had to move right now

24:59.220 --> 25:01.220
What house would you move to?

25:02.260 --> 25:04.260
Like you guys play the field the market

25:04.820 --> 25:10.180
You know it could be could be where you live could not, you know, it doesn't matter ultimately

25:10.180 --> 25:12.180
It's just sort of a fun conversation starter

25:12.900 --> 25:16.580
I would love to live in the practical magic house. Have you seen us?

25:17.780 --> 25:18.980
No

25:18.980 --> 25:21.620
Practical magic or a hallywell manner

25:22.340 --> 25:25.300
From trauma yes, yes, yeah

25:25.780 --> 25:30.020
Like a cool house that has a lot of different

25:30.420 --> 25:34.100
Staircases and meat sugar passageway that would mean well

25:34.100 --> 25:37.700
I want home house where you take a book and then a wall opens

25:38.260 --> 25:42.900
Sure, that's awesome. Like in Casper? Yes

25:44.980 --> 25:45.940
Like that girl

25:45.940 --> 25:47.940
I'm here. What about you?

25:48.740 --> 25:54.100
Throw me inside of Drake's pad and Toronto looks like he has a full indoor basketball court there. That seems pretty

25:54.660 --> 26:00.180
Pretty chill to have like a court with the OVO logo on it and you can bring out

26:00.900 --> 26:02.260
some good

26:02.260 --> 26:07.940
Trainers. I saw lethal shooter was there luck. What's that? What are we looking at there? It looks so cute. I'll talk it into

26:08.500 --> 26:10.500
Manchin or something

26:11.940 --> 26:16.820
Drake's house here is saying yeah, Drake's pad and Toronto the T dot the six

26:17.700 --> 26:23.060
He seems like he's doing pretty well firms. What is that? It's a house in St. Remi, New York

26:23.700 --> 26:28.020
What are these original stairs? Is that New York Kingston? Yeah, it's just south of Kingston

26:29.220 --> 26:34.660
I mean are you kidding me? I'm gonna negotiate to get the rugs included, but I could afford this place today

26:35.460 --> 26:40.500
Didn't just move. Yeah, I was forced to move because my landlord Harry

26:42.340 --> 26:44.340
decided to sell our old place

26:47.300 --> 26:52.420
But you know you can always make an real estate investment somewhere in the place

26:53.140 --> 27:03.620
I'd love to have you. I like that. I really want to move to New York. There's two reasons I haven't that I don't feel comfortable sharing right now

27:04.580 --> 27:10.900
Give us the least private one. The least private one is career anxiety. There's everything I want to do

27:11.860 --> 27:15.300
There's like 80% of the opportunities here versus 20 there

27:16.580 --> 27:19.780
I could probably get you a role in the marketing team if you're interested

27:20.740 --> 27:22.500
I did I am

27:22.500 --> 27:27.060
Well shout-out Theo and Harris, which is my favorite watch podcast if anybody's interested in vintage watches

27:27.540 --> 27:34.100
They're very funny. They're like the funny guys of the watch industry and they treat it a funny guys or are they just one second?

27:37.700 --> 27:41.540
I'll get to your question, but let me say my thing. Let me speak my piece

27:44.420 --> 27:46.420
They have like really good numbers and

27:47.380 --> 27:50.740
How does he compartmentalize that so he's like

27:52.340 --> 27:54.340
You're a fucking loose cannon man

27:56.020 --> 28:00.900
What are you gonna say? Are they funny for real? Are they funny for watch guys?

28:02.900 --> 28:08.100
I would say they're not as funny as like Shelby Wolstein, but they're probably funnier than

28:09.700 --> 28:11.700
Amir

28:13.220 --> 28:15.220
I have to cut that out

28:15.460 --> 28:19.700
They're probably funnier than like you know

28:23.860 --> 28:25.860
Yeah, I don't know

28:28.980 --> 28:31.940
Anyway, they just started a podcast and they're like we don't have any ads this week

28:31.940 --> 28:36.820
But we're gonna we're really trying to get some so I was like, oh gumbo would be perfect for them because I know they have at least 10,000

28:36.820 --> 28:38.820
They probably have more like 50,000 listeners

28:39.460 --> 28:43.460
So I message Dane actually and I was like

28:44.420 --> 28:50.980
You gotta reach out to these fuckers and he said, you know, if you broker this deal you stand to make 10 percent

28:50.980 --> 28:52.180
I would ever

28:52.180 --> 28:57.220
They make and I'm like I have always loved deals. I didn't know this was an option

28:58.180 --> 29:03.700
I'd love to broker just one deal and be a business with Christians around with Michael Christie

29:06.580 --> 29:10.740
I thought you said the name was like Harry and Seth there's some shit. Theo and Harris

29:11.380 --> 29:15.140
Yeah, so what are you talking about? Those aren't their names. That's the company name

29:15.860 --> 29:19.220
That's funny because that's the name of the two kids at babysat for a while

29:20.100 --> 29:22.100
Really

29:23.380 --> 29:27.380
Oh my god, you don't think there's no way

29:27.460 --> 29:29.460
Wait

29:39.460 --> 29:44.500
So where would you guys live let's say I was joking about the house

29:44.500 --> 29:46.500
I just there's a couple of houses living like an app

29:47.460 --> 29:51.140
What place would you move if you had to if you could if you wanted to

29:51.380 --> 30:00.180
If I had to move cities or just houses within the same part of Los Angeles

30:01.620 --> 30:07.300
Let's go cities or in a place like L.A. or New York a drastic neighborhood change

30:08.660 --> 30:10.100
Hmm

30:10.100 --> 30:14.420
I guess if I had unlimited funds out by like a really cool modern mansion in Venice

30:15.380 --> 30:16.580
You're the ocean

30:16.580 --> 30:21.060
Why yeah, that's cool. Yeah, that's cool. It would it would be a little bit

30:21.780 --> 30:22.820
more

30:22.820 --> 30:25.460
Breezy and cool on these hot summer days

30:27.060 --> 30:29.380
You can you know eat at all those fancy restaurants

30:30.740 --> 30:35.300
Sort of create a new eco system for you on the west side

30:38.900 --> 30:43.620
That would be cool. I would I would like to have a little I'm maybe not a mansion

30:43.620 --> 30:49.780
But I could do a little bungalow in Venice like Fiona Appled supposedly has that's cool

30:51.460 --> 30:55.620
That would be cool. Yeah, I'd get into gardening. Yeah, finally

30:59.540 --> 31:04.420
I had a bungalow. I could get into fucking gardening if I had a bungalow

31:04.420 --> 31:06.420
I could skip the line at the bungalow

31:08.420 --> 31:10.420
That's a

31:10.420 --> 31:12.420
Barrettian look at fuck you for that

31:13.140 --> 31:19.540
You know I frequent the bungalow and you're sort of tearing it down like it's this not pretty cool trendy spot

31:20.420 --> 31:24.340
For dudes and hats like I'm want to wear on the weekends

31:25.300 --> 31:32.260
And you don't get into the bungalow because I would talk to the door man and he would prevent you from entering the bungalow

31:32.980 --> 31:39.940
And less of course you had a reservation which case and it's a hard to get a reservation or is it just really a couple

31:39.940 --> 31:43.300
Does it but yeah a few days in the van which is fine?

31:43.860 --> 31:49.220
It's not no skin off their rack right this way but if you show up having not had

31:49.620 --> 31:54.260
Then he's going to show you the door which is the door to get in but he's basically going to say look at the door

31:54.260 --> 31:56.260
You're not getting in here today

31:56.260 --> 31:58.260
I can talk to the hostess

31:58.260 --> 32:04.820
Potentially get you that'd be great. Yes, but be great. Thank you. See if there's any cancellations. There are fortunately for you

32:04.820 --> 32:06.820
Thank you. Yeah, so I didn't know that

32:07.460 --> 32:09.460
Yeah, exactly

32:09.460 --> 32:14.100
The bungalow is an notoriously bad bar on the west side unless Ali likes it in which case

32:14.100 --> 32:18.500
I love no I've actually never been I never every time I was invited I politely declined

32:19.460 --> 32:24.340
It's cool if you want to hang out with like sexual assaulty men and

32:25.700 --> 32:31.060
Other people that don't say anything interesting. I've even been there. Yeah. Yeah, no

32:32.180 --> 32:35.140
No, yes, I've been there several times my ex girlfriend loved it

32:36.340 --> 32:38.340
Kayla

32:38.340 --> 32:45.140
My opinion on the bungalow or where I would live lives. Let's do live and then let's make sure we table and get to your opinion on the

32:45.220 --> 32:47.220
bungalow. Sure

32:47.860 --> 32:57.700
You know, I would do like a cool old house in Salem, Massachusetts or like a little beach bungalow and like

32:58.100 --> 32:59.300
Chattam

32:59.300 --> 33:06.980
Hmm, just in Cape Cod. I love that. Yeah, it's like watch great white sharks and shit like that. Yeah, yeah

33:07.540 --> 33:09.940
My family into the bungalow for the right

33:10.660 --> 33:18.260
My family went on a vacation to Cape Cod when I was little and I really wanted to take a side

33:18.260 --> 33:23.060
Detour to Salem because I thought it was so cool with all and I like wanted to go to the museum

33:23.060 --> 33:27.940
Whatever and I at the time my parents said that we couldn't go because it was too scary

33:28.340 --> 33:30.340
But now I just know they didn't feel like it

33:30.580 --> 33:32.580
Yeah

33:34.580 --> 33:37.220
We could go to that down, but it's pretty scary

33:39.140 --> 33:45.700
Whoa really yeah sure whatever the fuck your service. You don't know we want to stay in Cape Cod

33:47.220 --> 33:52.420
Yeah, what should we have for dinner? Lizonio or I want pizza. Well, it's too scary

33:53.540 --> 33:58.500
What yeah, let's do sandwiches instead something easier is less scary

33:59.300 --> 34:02.740
Exactly, it was like well, all right. I guess it's still scary over there

34:09.380 --> 34:15.940
Where would you want to live, Jeff? Thank you. Oh, you already showed us the fucking house

34:15.940 --> 34:19.860
Yeah, while we were talking you showed us your house the house sucked

34:20.580 --> 34:22.580
We answered the question

34:22.580 --> 34:24.580
Moving on

34:24.660 --> 34:31.540
Please, please, let's see what segments you had planned

34:32.100 --> 34:39.700
This certainly can't be a full waxing episode that that means nothing that means you came here

34:39.700 --> 34:44.020
ill-prepared eight minutes late and promised us grandiose ideas

34:44.500 --> 34:46.020

34:59.260 --> 35:04.820
What's your favorite super some shit like that? Let's hear it. Let's get there. We're almost at a time

35:04.820 --> 35:11.220
I'm curious certainly you didn't bring Ali and Kayla here to just fucking wax 40-five minutes

35:12.500 --> 35:14.500
I'm missing a happy hour to do this

35:16.020 --> 35:19.020
Chicken's mad.

35:19.020 --> 35:23.020
It looks like sleepy and the brain.

35:23.020 --> 35:26.020
Chicken's mad.

35:26.020 --> 35:29.020

36:38.020 --> 36:41.020
Welcome to Con Stars.

36:41.020 --> 36:48.020
This is like Con Stars, but instead of valuating things that people bring into a store,

36:48.020 --> 36:51.020
or whatever happens on that show.

36:51.020 --> 36:56.020
Allie, if you do what's the oneness of sort of winning the camera of you assume.

36:56.020 --> 36:58.020
Shut up, dude.

36:58.020 --> 37:00.020
Like fucking let it out.

37:00.020 --> 37:02.020
You asked for this segment.

37:31.020 --> 37:32.020
No, I don't get it.

37:32.020 --> 37:33.020
What is next?

37:33.020 --> 37:36.020
Oh, we're just going to evaluate them.

37:37.020 --> 37:39.020
Also there's a charge delay on the zoom right now.

37:39.020 --> 37:40.020
Yeah.

37:40.020 --> 37:42.020
I think it's because I screened share photo shop.

37:42.020 --> 37:43.020
Yeah.

37:43.020 --> 37:44.020
Oh, dear.

37:44.020 --> 37:49.020
That's... you need more RAM for sure to handle some processing power like that.

37:49.020 --> 37:52.020
Oh, look at that color coordinated bookshelf.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.020
Very nice.

37:53.020 --> 37:54.020
Oh, yeah.

37:54.020 --> 37:55.020
Here's stuff.

37:55.020 --> 37:56.020
Yeah.

37:56.020 --> 37:57.020
Here's my bookshelf.

37:57.020 --> 37:58.020
This is blue and pink.

37:58.020 --> 37:59.020
Oh, that's very good.

37:59.020 --> 38:00.020
Oh, that's very good.

38:00.020 --> 38:03.020
Then we got red orange, yellow and green.

38:04.020 --> 38:08.020
For 250 bucks for the whole set.

38:08.020 --> 38:10.020
All the books.

38:10.020 --> 38:11.020
All the books.

38:11.020 --> 38:12.020
The books.

38:12.020 --> 38:14.020
My collection for my whole life.

38:14.020 --> 38:15.020
Wow.

38:15.020 --> 38:16.020
Your whole life?

38:16.020 --> 38:18.020
$400.

38:18.020 --> 38:19.020
Yeah.

38:19.020 --> 38:21.020
It was your official, I guess, 250 or 400.

38:21.020 --> 38:25.020
Because you're sort of like spouting out like you're in an auction against yourself.

38:25.020 --> 38:26.020
Let us all...

38:26.020 --> 38:27.020
I'll do a stack.

38:27.020 --> 38:28.020
I'll do a stack.

38:28.020 --> 38:29.020
Here's a thousand bucks.

38:29.020 --> 38:31.020
Fucking bones.

38:31.020 --> 38:32.020
I got it.

38:33.020 --> 38:34.020
I got a book.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.020
I get to the book.

38:35.020 --> 38:36.020
Alice in Wonderland.

38:36.020 --> 38:39.020
But it's one of those fake books that has...

38:39.020 --> 38:40.020
Oh, that's really good.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.020
I'll go haul a couple of...

38:41.020 --> 38:43.020
A couple of dollar bills in it.

38:43.020 --> 38:44.020
Wow.

38:44.020 --> 38:45.020
Oh, wow.

38:45.020 --> 38:46.020
Oh, wow.

38:46.020 --> 38:47.020
Oh, wow.

38:47.020 --> 38:48.020
$10.

38:48.020 --> 38:49.020
Fucking clock.

38:49.020 --> 38:52.020
You don't keep that fucking thing on me.

38:52.020 --> 38:54.020
$59.

38:54.020 --> 38:55.020
That's it.

38:55.020 --> 38:56.020
15.

38:56.020 --> 38:57.020
Okay.

38:57.020 --> 38:58.020
I'll give you a rack.

38:58.020 --> 38:59.020
Fine.

38:59.020 --> 39:00.020
I'll give you a fucking band.

39:01.020 --> 39:03.020
That was the book and everything in it.

39:04.020 --> 39:07.020
But I think the $59 deal sounded better.

39:07.020 --> 39:08.020
Right?

39:08.020 --> 39:09.020
It just felt really real.

39:09.020 --> 39:12.020
$5,000 should the book everything in it and your mind

39:12.020 --> 39:13.020
doesn't have any t-shirt.

39:13.020 --> 39:14.020
Deal.

39:14.020 --> 39:15.020
Hmm.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.020
Great.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.020
I'll start over.

39:17.020 --> 39:18.020
Alright.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.020
Let's do this.

39:19.020 --> 39:21.020
This was constar.

39:22.020 --> 39:24.020
Do you have any like expensive soaps?

39:26.020 --> 39:27.020
No.

39:27.020 --> 39:28.020
Do you?

39:28.020 --> 39:29.020
Yeah.

39:30.020 --> 39:31.020
Why?

39:32.020 --> 39:33.020
She likes them.

39:33.020 --> 39:34.020
We've already been through this.

39:34.020 --> 39:35.020
Yeah.

39:35.020 --> 39:36.020
But like, what's the point?

39:36.020 --> 39:38.020
We're just going a little bit.

39:38.020 --> 39:40.020
And then people think that you're good.

39:40.020 --> 39:41.020
That's true.

39:41.020 --> 39:42.020
That is true.

39:42.020 --> 39:44.020
I've never said that you smelled good though.

39:44.020 --> 39:46.020
It seems like you're spending a lot of money.

39:46.020 --> 39:47.020
You're not kidding.

39:47.020 --> 39:49.020
I feel like I said that to you with the off-site.

39:49.020 --> 39:51.020
I thought you smelled nice.

39:51.020 --> 39:53.020
People say that I smelled good all the time.

39:54.020 --> 39:55.020
Okay.

39:55.020 --> 39:57.020
Not minimizing your compliment killer.

39:57.020 --> 39:58.020
No, no, no.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.020
I'm trying to.

39:59.020 --> 40:00.020
I'm reinforcing.

40:00.020 --> 40:01.020
Thank you.

40:01.020 --> 40:02.020
Yeah.

40:02.020 --> 40:03.020
Trying to make sure that you're not.

40:03.020 --> 40:04.020
It's so prolific.

40:04.020 --> 40:05.020
It's just the soap.

40:05.020 --> 40:06.020
It's the soap.

40:06.020 --> 40:07.020
It's my fairer bones.

40:07.020 --> 40:08.020
I'm here.

40:08.020 --> 40:10.020
Has anyone ever told you that you smelled good?

40:10.020 --> 40:11.020
Never.

40:11.020 --> 40:12.020
Yeah.

40:12.020 --> 40:13.020
Because you don't put time and effort in money.

40:13.020 --> 40:15.020
I do often avoid you smell bad.

40:15.020 --> 40:16.020
I'm not a very sweaty guy.

40:16.020 --> 40:18.020
So I don't have a lot of beer.

40:18.020 --> 40:21.020
Although yesterday when we were shooting the videos, it was pretty hot and

40:21.020 --> 40:22.020
musty in that office.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.020
You smelled like absolute.

40:23.020 --> 40:24.020
And I don't really want to.

40:24.020 --> 40:25.020
Like ask.

40:25.020 --> 40:27.020
I probably did.

40:27.020 --> 40:30.020
Have a musky musty stench that day.

40:30.020 --> 40:31.020
Yeah.

40:31.020 --> 40:33.020
That was just for Jeff and Riley to deal with.

40:33.020 --> 40:34.020
Yeah.

40:34.020 --> 40:35.020
You were a.

40:35.020 --> 40:36.020
A Darth of good smells.

40:36.020 --> 40:37.020
That's my word.

40:37.020 --> 40:38.020
Darth.

40:38.020 --> 40:39.020
Darth.

40:39.020 --> 40:40.020
Darth.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.020
Darth Vader.

40:41.020 --> 40:42.020
That's good.

40:42.020 --> 40:43.020
I'm good smells.

40:43.020 --> 40:44.020
I'm here.

40:44.020 --> 40:45.020
Well, who?

40:45.020 --> 40:46.020
I'm sorry to do this.

40:46.020 --> 40:48.020
No, you're not.

40:48.020 --> 40:52.020
Is your current partner your the best you've ever had.

40:52.020 --> 41:00.020
I don't know.

41:00.020 --> 41:02.020
The hell is the.

41:02.020 --> 41:07.020
What is your fucking problem?

41:07.020 --> 41:10.020
Look at the joy you get when you're asking me such invasive questions.

41:10.020 --> 41:12.020
Of course the answer is yes.

41:12.020 --> 41:15.020
Asked an answer moving on.

41:15.020 --> 41:16.020
Wow.

41:16.020 --> 41:18.020
That's great.

41:18.020 --> 41:19.020
Yeah.

41:19.020 --> 41:21.020
It is.

41:22.020 --> 41:24.020
I'm sorry.

41:24.020 --> 41:27.020
I put you in that position.

41:27.020 --> 41:28.020
Yeah.

41:28.020 --> 41:31.020
I hear that and I accept it.

41:31.020 --> 41:32.020
But it won't.

41:32.020 --> 41:35.020
Fully mean the most until you stop putting right.

41:35.020 --> 41:36.020
Yeah.

41:36.020 --> 41:37.020
Yeah.

41:37.020 --> 41:38.020
I'm sorry.

41:38.020 --> 41:40.020
I put you in that position.

41:40.020 --> 41:41.020
Yeah.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.020
Yeah.

41:42.020 --> 41:43.020
I hear that.

41:43.020 --> 41:44.020
And I accept it.

41:44.020 --> 41:45.020
But it won't.

41:45.020 --> 41:48.020
Fully mean the most until you stop putting right.

41:48.020 --> 41:49.020
Yeah.

41:49.020 --> 41:50.020
Yeah.

41:50.020 --> 41:51.020
Yeah.

41:51.020 --> 41:52.020
Jeff.

41:52.020 --> 42:00.020
Can you mirror back to a mirror what he just told you?

42:00.020 --> 42:01.020
Jeff.

42:01.020 --> 42:03.020
It didn't work this time.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.020
Keep trying.

42:04.020 --> 42:05.020
You're hardest.

42:05.020 --> 42:06.020
Okay.

42:06.020 --> 42:08.020
That's an interesting interpretation.

42:08.020 --> 42:10.020
And me or do you feel like he was.

42:10.020 --> 42:12.020
No, he wasn't listening.

42:12.020 --> 42:15.020
What happens that he sort of shuts off as soon as I run.

42:15.020 --> 42:18.020
Anyone gives him like a stern talking point.

42:18.020 --> 42:20.020
Like I guess it goes elsewhere.

42:20.020 --> 42:25.020
And it hopes that nobody will ask him the question that you just asked him, which was repeat back to me what you just said.

42:25.020 --> 42:26.020
Right.

42:26.020 --> 42:29.020
And how does that make you feel in here being in his position?

42:29.020 --> 42:45.020
I feel like Jeff doesn't really give a shit about me or anything really and it creates this kind of negative feedback loop that started to like adversely affect the podcast and our working relationship.

42:46.020 --> 42:48.020
Ali is the witness to this conversation.

42:48.020 --> 42:51.020
How does it make you feel?

42:51.020 --> 42:57.020
I mean, it makes me feel validated to be asked about being a flower on the wall.

42:57.020 --> 43:03.020
I definitely, I can see I see both sides, but ultimately, yeah.

43:03.020 --> 43:04.020
Okay.

43:04.020 --> 43:09.020
Well, Jeff, I think it's a good to acknowledge that a lot of honesty and candor just happened.

43:09.020 --> 43:11.020
And, you know, that could be overwhelming for you.

43:11.020 --> 43:14.020
So I'd love to hear how this makes you feel as well.

43:14.020 --> 43:18.020
I thought those were like breakout rooms. I wasn't listening.

43:18.020 --> 43:19.020
I see.

43:19.020 --> 43:21.020
But that was because I didn't think I was supposed to.

43:21.020 --> 43:26.020
I think this is a really good crystallization of what a mirror was trying to tell you.

43:26.020 --> 43:29.020
That was a microcosm of everything that's wrong with you.

43:29.020 --> 43:30.020
Yeah.

43:30.020 --> 43:31.020
Yeah.

43:31.020 --> 43:32.020
You're so in your own head.

43:32.020 --> 43:34.020
You're so selfish.

43:34.020 --> 43:41.020
The tone of what you're saying sounds really thoughtful and I inspire what you're actually saying the meaning behind that words and the actions is poison.

43:41.020 --> 43:50.020
No, I disagree because at the end of the day, like I ask you guys to be a part of these because I need bodies in the Zoom in the room, right?

43:50.020 --> 43:52.020
And so it could be any one.

43:52.020 --> 43:56.020
But I don't want, I think I feel comfortable speaking for everyone.

43:56.020 --> 43:59.020
You don't want to be thought known for our bodies.

43:59.020 --> 44:01.020
We want to be for our minds.

44:01.020 --> 44:02.020
Yeah.

44:02.020 --> 44:06.020
I'm happy to be thought over both, but that's not the point.

44:06.020 --> 44:09.020
Everyone's feelings here are very valid.

44:09.020 --> 44:11.020
I think it's worth digging into of it.

44:11.020 --> 44:14.020
I feel like maybe I wasn't clear.

44:14.020 --> 44:20.020
I appreciate you guys for coming on the show because they're just, they're has to be three people.

44:20.020 --> 44:23.020
And you were that person.

44:23.020 --> 44:24.020
Okay.

44:24.020 --> 44:26.020
You make us sound like replacement players.

44:26.020 --> 44:29.020
Like it's like you didn't necessarily want any of us to be here.

44:29.020 --> 44:36.020
And that shows in the lack of preparation and the way you're steering this conversation.

44:36.020 --> 44:43.020
I do feel like I'm here just enough to me because I was going to get to the way I think that it wouldn't hurt as much.

44:43.020 --> 44:44.020
Did I interrupt?

44:44.020 --> 44:45.020
Did I interrupt?

44:45.020 --> 44:46.020
Did I interrupt?

44:46.020 --> 44:47.020
I mean, forgive me if I did.

44:47.020 --> 44:51.020
This show would not happen without playing off of you guys, right?

44:51.020 --> 44:54.020
Whether it's a wax episode, whether it's a second episode.

44:54.020 --> 44:56.020
I wouldn't call it a wax episode.

44:56.020 --> 44:58.020
I would call it a non-episode.

44:58.020 --> 45:00.020
An episode without anything is not wax.

45:00.020 --> 45:01.020
wax is something.

45:01.020 --> 45:02.020
And I cannot.

45:02.020 --> 45:05.020
I'm just trying to express my appreciation gratitude to you guys.

45:06.020 --> 45:07.020
It's being received.

45:07.020 --> 45:10.020
Yeah, for, for, for, you know, giving your time.

45:10.020 --> 45:13.020
But again, it could have been anyone at the company.

45:13.020 --> 45:15.020
You know, so I like, you know, you were,

45:15.020 --> 45:16.020
Honestly, I'm here.

45:16.020 --> 45:17.020
You were one of the drags.

45:17.020 --> 45:19.020
I was trying to do an, a Kayla,

45:19.020 --> 45:21.020
Ali English episode.

45:21.020 --> 45:23.020
English wasn't free, right?

45:23.020 --> 45:26.020
So while I appreciate you being here,

45:26.020 --> 45:30.020
I, I can't help but feel like it could have been better.

45:30.020 --> 45:31.020
Wow.

45:31.020 --> 45:33.020
Amir, do you want to mirror back to Jeff?

45:33.020 --> 45:34.020
Will he just sold you?

45:35.020 --> 45:38.020
Yeah, he basically just said that he didn't want me here.

45:38.020 --> 45:42.020
And I accidentally stumbled upon an episode where he gave little

45:42.020 --> 45:45.020
to no shits about what went on during it.

45:45.020 --> 45:47.020
And now that we've reached the end of it,

45:47.020 --> 45:50.020
I think we're all happy that it's nearly over.

45:50.020 --> 45:52.020
But I don't want the lesson to be that like,

45:52.020 --> 45:54.020
this was a good waxing episode.

45:54.020 --> 45:57.020
That's a waxing episode is just a weird way to brand it.

45:57.020 --> 45:59.020
A shit episode, which is nothing.

45:59.020 --> 46:00.020
Okay.

46:00.020 --> 46:03.020
I mean, I see where you're coming from,

46:03.020 --> 46:08.020
but I do think that sometimes people do their best at their worst.

46:08.020 --> 46:11.020
You have to hit rock bottom before you're.

46:11.020 --> 46:12.020
Good.

46:12.020 --> 46:15.020
And do you feel like we're at rock bottom right now, just?

46:15.020 --> 46:17.020
I thought this was a fun episode.

46:17.020 --> 46:18.020
Seconds or not.

46:18.020 --> 46:20.020
I don't know why I'm being raked over the nails.

46:20.020 --> 46:21.020
Being spit roasted.

46:21.020 --> 46:22.020
Because I,

46:22.020 --> 46:24.020
There've been wax episodes that have been bad.

46:24.020 --> 46:25.020
All right.

46:25.020 --> 46:27.020
I mean, the first of just,

46:27.020 --> 46:29.020
There've been wax episodes that have been bad.

46:29.020 --> 46:31.020
All right. I mean, the first of just that.

46:31.020 --> 46:35.020
There've been segment episodes that have been bad.

46:35.020 --> 46:39.020
Sometimes wax episodes turn out to be fine.

46:39.020 --> 46:42.020
Sometimes even, well,

46:42.020 --> 46:44.020
good.

46:44.020 --> 46:47.020
And I think this was somewhere in the middle.

46:47.020 --> 46:48.020
Okay.

46:48.020 --> 46:50.020
Well, thank you so much for sharing that.

46:50.020 --> 46:52.020
I really do feel like we're making some progress.

46:52.020 --> 46:53.020
Yeah.

46:54.020 --> 46:55.020
I agree.

46:55.020 --> 46:56.020
I do wonder, like,

46:56.020 --> 46:58.020
because I feel like we do these emotional,

46:58.020 --> 47:01.020
you know, you know, whatever.

47:01.020 --> 47:03.020
Powwow sometimes, me and a mirror.

47:03.020 --> 47:05.020
I wonder if we should just let it come to blows.

47:05.020 --> 47:06.020
Yeah.

47:06.020 --> 47:07.020
What?

47:07.020 --> 47:09.020
Like take it out against each other physically.

47:09.020 --> 47:10.020
Yeah. Like we have a live show.

47:10.020 --> 47:12.020
We should say on September 22nd,

47:12.020 --> 47:13.020
the headgum happy hour.

47:13.020 --> 47:14.020
Take a link.

47:14.020 --> 47:16.020
Should be in the bio of this or the description.

47:16.020 --> 47:17.020
Oh wow.

47:17.020 --> 47:18.020
And mirror.

47:18.020 --> 47:21.020
You and I scheduled to do some kind of bit up top.

47:21.020 --> 47:23.020
I'm wondering if we just fully duke it out.

47:23.020 --> 47:24.020
Yeah.

47:24.020 --> 47:26.020
I think it might be cathartic.

47:26.020 --> 47:28.020
They're not collapsing or.

47:28.020 --> 47:29.020
I mean, I was thinking gloves,

47:29.020 --> 47:30.020
but if you want, I mean,

47:30.020 --> 47:31.020
the gloves can come off like that.

47:31.020 --> 47:33.020
And I have never lost a fight.

47:33.020 --> 47:34.020
Wow.

47:37.020 --> 47:40.020
A lot of one of us wins in front of everyone else.

47:40.020 --> 47:44.020
I want to be embarrassing for the bloody loser.

47:44.020 --> 47:47.020
I'm not too worried about that.

47:48.020 --> 47:50.020
Yeah.

47:50.020 --> 47:53.020
I'm just might be uncomfortable for everyone who.

47:53.020 --> 47:56.020
Came to see a coffee show.

47:56.020 --> 47:59.020
Well, and you're co-hosting with Danny.

47:59.020 --> 48:03.020
So you'll be baronacle fighting and there's going to be another host.

48:03.020 --> 48:04.020
Yeah.

48:04.020 --> 48:05.020
Not in the fight.

48:05.020 --> 48:07.020
I just, I don't know Danny all that well,

48:07.020 --> 48:09.020
but I feel like he beat kind of into it.

48:09.020 --> 48:10.020
I think he would.

48:10.020 --> 48:11.020
He could provide commentary.

48:11.020 --> 48:13.020
You know, like he had some with a left.

48:13.020 --> 48:14.020
He had some with a right.

48:14.020 --> 48:15.020
A mirror is down.

48:15.020 --> 48:16.020
Down.

48:16.020 --> 48:17.020
Yeah.

48:17.020 --> 48:18.020
Yeah.

48:18.020 --> 48:19.020
Do you know what that stands for?

48:19.020 --> 48:20.020
Don't knock out.

48:20.020 --> 48:32.020
It's interesting that that after so little revealing.

48:32.020 --> 48:38.020
How everybody's feeling that the next step is fight physically.

48:38.020 --> 48:42.020
But you came into this wanting to connect emotionally.

48:42.020 --> 48:45.020
So I'm just sensing maybe something.

48:45.020 --> 48:46.020
I'm just flagging.

48:46.020 --> 48:47.020
I don't know what to do with it.

48:47.020 --> 48:48.020
I'm just flagging.

48:48.020 --> 48:49.020
That's good.

48:49.020 --> 48:51.020
And we can keep that for next week.

48:51.020 --> 48:52.020
I think.

48:52.020 --> 48:53.020
No, because next week.

48:53.020 --> 48:54.020
Like four segments.

48:54.020 --> 48:55.020
Oh, wow.

48:55.020 --> 48:57.020
Can we be on that episode or that sort of?

48:57.020 --> 48:58.020
I think we're old and other.

48:58.020 --> 48:59.020
Yeah.

48:59.020 --> 49:00.020
Why don't you guys come back if we?

49:00.020 --> 49:01.020
Yeah.

49:01.020 --> 49:02.020
Yeah.

49:02.020 --> 49:03.020
Yeah.

49:03.020 --> 49:04.020
Can you guys do that?

49:04.020 --> 49:06.020
I like the idea of con stars.

49:06.020 --> 49:08.020
Con stars.

49:08.020 --> 49:09.020
That's good.

49:09.020 --> 49:10.020
We should do plugs.

49:10.020 --> 49:13.020
I don't want to waste any more of.

49:13.020 --> 49:18.020
Mine, Alley's and Kayla's time.

49:18.020 --> 49:23.020
What do you guys have going on?

49:23.020 --> 49:25.020
I don't want to go first.

49:25.020 --> 49:26.020
Alley.

49:26.020 --> 49:27.020
Sure.

49:27.020 --> 49:30.020
So we have the head going to have your live show.

49:30.020 --> 49:32.020
September 22nd.

49:32.020 --> 49:33.020
I don't need to.

49:33.020 --> 49:35.020
Not a week for him.

49:35.020 --> 49:38.020
And besides that, I guess.

49:38.020 --> 49:41.020
Watch this space next time I come on.

49:41.020 --> 49:43.020
I'll have more going on in my life.

49:43.020 --> 49:44.020
So TVD.

49:44.020 --> 49:45.020
That'd be cool.

49:45.020 --> 49:46.020
Yeah.

49:46.020 --> 49:47.020
Look forward to it.

49:47.020 --> 49:49.020
Gone.

49:49.020 --> 49:51.020
She is well gone.

49:51.020 --> 49:52.020
That's fine.

49:52.020 --> 49:54.020
Probably right.

49:54.020 --> 49:55.020
Yeah.

49:55.020 --> 49:57.020
Well, I worry about him.

49:57.020 --> 49:58.020
It's okay.

49:58.020 --> 50:00.020
Will you go check on him?

50:00.020 --> 50:03.020
He's too far away for me to kill.

50:03.020 --> 50:04.020
Oh, there he's back.

50:04.020 --> 50:05.020
I see.

50:07.020 --> 50:09.020
It's really hot now.

50:09.020 --> 50:10.020
I guess.

50:10.020 --> 50:12.020
You can't hear me.

50:12.020 --> 50:13.020
All right.

50:13.020 --> 50:14.020
There you are.

50:14.020 --> 50:15.020
Let's see.

50:15.020 --> 50:16.020
Follow gumbo.

50:16.020 --> 50:18.020
Follow head gum.

50:18.020 --> 50:20.020
Go by tickets to the 22nd show.

50:20.020 --> 50:21.020
I'll be there.

50:21.020 --> 50:22.020
I'll say hi to me.

50:22.020 --> 50:23.020
Oh, wow.

50:23.020 --> 50:24.020
Kayla.

50:24.020 --> 50:25.020
It's a studio episode.

50:25.020 --> 50:26.020
We got to do it.

50:26.020 --> 50:27.020
Yeah, let's do that.

50:27.020 --> 50:28.020
We go on this for that.

50:28.020 --> 50:29.020
That's really good.

50:29.020 --> 50:30.020
Okay.

50:30.020 --> 50:31.020
Let's do it.

50:31.020 --> 50:33.020
I follow me on Instagram and Twitter.

50:33.020 --> 50:35.020
Kayla, I'm already.

50:35.020 --> 50:37.020
I don't know.

50:37.020 --> 50:39.020
Take Alexa Pro.

50:39.020 --> 50:41.020
If necessary or regardless.

50:41.020 --> 50:44.020
Oh, I feel like everyone could probably use it,

50:44.020 --> 50:45.020
but if necessary.

50:45.020 --> 50:49.020
Fun fact, if your sex drive dies or dies,

50:49.020 --> 50:50.020
unlike the Pro,

50:50.020 --> 50:51.020
it will be a trend.

50:54.020 --> 50:55.020
That's my next step.

50:55.020 --> 50:56.020
If they keep up in my dose.

50:56.020 --> 50:57.020
Yeah.

50:57.020 --> 50:58.020
So.

50:58.020 --> 51:01.020
Anyways, see therapists.

51:01.020 --> 51:03.020
Get on medication.

51:03.020 --> 51:04.020
Love that.

51:04.020 --> 51:05.020
Mm-hmm.

51:10.020 --> 51:11.020
I'm here.

51:11.020 --> 51:15.020
That headgum happy hour is going to be absolutely lit.

51:15.020 --> 51:17.020
Oh, it's so good.

51:17.020 --> 51:19.020
Our own fucking backyard.

51:19.020 --> 51:21.020
Home court advantage.

51:21.020 --> 51:22.020
It's going to be me.

51:22.020 --> 51:23.020
It's going to be Danny.

51:23.020 --> 51:25.020
A whole slew of funny comedians.

51:25.020 --> 51:26.020
Well, fucking see you there.

51:26.020 --> 51:27.020
Please.

51:27.020 --> 51:29.020
TKO is technical knockout.

51:29.020 --> 51:31.020
Not total knockout.

51:31.020 --> 51:32.020
So.

51:32.020 --> 51:33.020
Really?

51:33.020 --> 51:35.020
That's Jeff's first L of the night.

51:35.020 --> 51:36.020
Let's see.

51:36.020 --> 51:39.020
Yeah, everybody stacks up on the day.

51:39.020 --> 51:41.020
He's in over his head a little bit,

51:41.020 --> 51:43.020
so it should be interesting.

51:43.020 --> 51:45.020
Just because you're not comfortable.

51:45.020 --> 51:46.020
I'm seeing.

51:46.020 --> 51:47.020
Is that fair to say?

51:47.020 --> 51:49.020
Um, generally,

51:49.020 --> 51:51.020
but it should be fun to see you.

51:51.020 --> 51:54.020
Try as you might.

51:54.020 --> 51:56.020
Um,

51:56.020 --> 51:59.020
the link again is what headgum.com slash live.

51:59.020 --> 52:01.020
I'm on a set.

52:01.020 --> 52:02.020
Jeffery?

52:02.020 --> 52:03.020
I don't remember.

52:03.020 --> 52:04.020
Is that where the,

52:05.020 --> 52:07.020
or on the description of this episode.

52:07.020 --> 52:10.020
So check it out and we will see you there.

52:13.020 --> 52:15.020
You heard?

52:15.020 --> 52:16.020
Yeah.

52:20.020 --> 52:22.020
No way.

52:22.020 --> 52:24.020
You cannot say that.

52:24.020 --> 52:25.020
Holy shit.

52:25.020 --> 52:27.020
They're already here.

52:27.020 --> 52:29.020
This is a live stream.

52:29.020 --> 52:31.020
At Jeff by already on Twitter.

52:31.020 --> 52:33.020
And we'll see you guys again next week.

52:33.020 --> 52:34.020
We'll see you in this episode.

52:34.020 --> 52:35.020
That's sorry.

52:35.020 --> 52:36.020
Everybody.

52:36.020 --> 52:37.020
That's whack.

52:37.020 --> 52:39.020
That would be better than that stars.

52:39.020 --> 52:40.020
It's sorry, everybody.

52:57.020 --> 52:59.020
That was a headgum original.

53:03.020 --> 53:04.020
Thank you.

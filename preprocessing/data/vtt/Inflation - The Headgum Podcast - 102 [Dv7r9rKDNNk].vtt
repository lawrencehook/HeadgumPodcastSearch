WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
Music

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Just got off the phone with the unemployment office.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
Yeah, you were gone a while.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Yeah, it was, uh, I hope you didn't hear that because I wasn't super kind to them.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Yeah, you were really mean.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Yeah, well, you know what, they're not helping me get another job at a different podcast network.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Maybe you should, you famously have not done very well at this podcast network.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
That's only socially and with work.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Yeah, okay. So there's like the two big things.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
Like, there's also a special project, which they never get through me alone.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
I never got to do anything on my own.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Right, I think it's because they don't trust you.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Why? Cause I don't have follow through.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah, you seem to know every issue you have.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Well, they, I did an exit interview and they told me all this.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
So I'm just spouting their talking points.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
I'm surprised the exit interview wasn't an episode of this podcast.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
I feel like you would have tried to make that content.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
They were very clear that this show is over.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
So now I'm trying to do it on our own.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
So we're here in our living room.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Yeah.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
But you know what? It's sort of freeing to me.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Because we can do whatever we want.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Yeah, I felt like you were doing whatever you wanted before.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
And that was a little of the problem.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Really? Yeah. That's true.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
So what would you have suggested I'd done?

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
Um, I guess like prepared the show like come up with a segment that wasn't just like,

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
what's this or that or a segment that was just you going through a power point

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
with the like expectation that the guests sort of like trying

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
to guess where you're like very illogical.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
I know if thought could have ever gone.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Yeah, I should have tried that.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
Um, I think like as far as like anything you want to do.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah. Like why do you want to keep doing this podcast anyway?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Because I don't have anything else.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
You have anything else.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
I don't have a cat.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Okay. That's one thing.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
I guess I meant like hobbies like you've friends.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Like you don't have to do this, especially you're fine.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah, but you're gone all day because you have a job.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
I'm sitting at home.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
All I did was prepare this episode.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Okay. Why'd you prepare?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
We'll get to it.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
We have 45 minutes to fill.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
All right. We can do whatever we want.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
I have probably 20 minutes of segments.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Uh, I think, okay.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
And that's what I want to flag.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
I think if you have acknowledged your 45 minutes to fill

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
and knowingly are only attempting to fill less than half of that.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Well, the rest is supposed to be jovial conversation.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
What have you been up to?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
What have I been up to?

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
You think it's never been co-jovial conversation on the show?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
What about bond of the week?

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Yeah.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Hey, that's famously never a conversation.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Are you using this as a...

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
What is your bond of the week?

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Uh, I've never gotten to do bond of the week.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
So this is really exciting.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
This is actually kind of exciting.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Do you have anybody in mind?

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Basically, and whether the show is on headgum or not,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
but every week until the next 007 is cast,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
we're going to cast our vote for the next.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Of who James Bond should be?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
You can also, if you want cast side characters,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
some people have lobbed up villains,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
but I'm really excited about my pick.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Let's do yours.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Okay, guys.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
So you seem like you just want to say your thing.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
No, I want to hear yours as well.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I'm giving you the floor first.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Uh, okay.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Uh, I have the top of my head,

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
and I think it's just because this is being spring on me.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
And I, it's the first celebrity that came to my mind.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Max versus stopping.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
The F1 driver?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Yeah.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Well, he's like 26, which feels like a good age to be just.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah, he's not British.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Oh, I forgot that's a rule.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
We did, I mean, I don't follow that to a team.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Yeah, who's the person you're saying?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Are they British?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Uh, the person that I was going to say was Chris Colfer.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Are they British?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Who's Chris Colfer?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Chris Colfer from Glee.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Which I didn't watch Glee.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
You don't know about Glee?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
I know about Glee.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Ah.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
You must not know, oh fuck.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Hehehe.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
You know what?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
I was going to do it again.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
I was going to do, I was going to do Chris Colfer,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
and then I realized I changed it.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Who?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
What?

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Give me the inside baseball.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Because I don't know what happened

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
and where you went wrong.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
It seems like you just bitted yourself in your mind.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
This whole show is one big hat on a hat.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
I can't tell anybody to ever listen to this if I'm on an episode

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
because none of it makes sense.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
You just take two layers upon layers of jokes

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
that are total in jokes that I barely understand.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I didn't even do it.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
It'll make sense if I tell you my actual bond of the weekends.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Who's your actual bond of the week?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Anyone of Sami descent.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
I know I'm being tricked.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I know I'm being tricked.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Sami people created skiing.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
If that clears it up for you at all.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Yeah, okay.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
If you made it skiing.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
I'm familiar with skiing.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
What would you say to those who don't know about skis?

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
I guess I'd say you don't know about ski.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
You must not know about skis.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
You must not know about skis.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
They're used for getting down a mountain quickly.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Sometimes you can drink a shot of whiskey.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Off them you must not know about skis.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
You must not know about skis.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
There's a financial barrier to entry.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
They're not for the wealthy.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
I thought you were going to say you must not know Sami.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
That would have also Sami people.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Yeah.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
And so I was because I'm not familiar with the Sami people.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
I was afraid to ask because I didn't want it to you up.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Right.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
And then I wish I did because I wish you weren't prepared.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
That's all.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Yeah.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Thank you for making this by the way.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
I'm drinking a lot.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Oh, like because you're unemployed.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Yeah.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
That's okay.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Do you still get out revenue from this even in doing it in secret?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I never got out revenue from this.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
That's actually some inside baseball.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
I got paid a fee.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Oh, I got paid a fee.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
You're doing this for free right now.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Ideally for a fee.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
I'm still going to send my invoice.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Okay.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Well, you've been fired for two weeks.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Yeah.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Yeah.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
What happened last week?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Last week.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
They gave me severance a little bit.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
I'll give you one week of severance.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
I feel you've been there in this for what feels like a hundred years.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Well, they gave me four weeks of Apple TV plus.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
So I got severance for.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
That's essentially the next three weeks.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
We're.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
That's horrible.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
That's like not good.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
I was a contractor.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I've always been a 10 99.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
Also four weeks of Apple TV plus is like the free trial.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Insult to injury.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
They didn't even spend any money on my severance package.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
By the way, I don't like severance.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
The show.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Oh, that's the joke you're about to do.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Yes.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
How do you like being the only guest on this show?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
So much work.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
So I thought it'd be better.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Yes.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
There's something about this that feels like.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
I think especially because I haven't talked to you.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
It's like, I don't know.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I was like, this will be easy.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
And then something about this is like because we haven't talked.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
But like, like aside from like half conversation while we were setting up.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
It's like we are now in this elevated bit mindset.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
I know I'm being like making such a meta commentary on this show.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
But I think I just want to get across my struggle.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
That was easy.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Um.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Oh, my.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Oh, I think it's hard because all my energy is pointed at you.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Yeah.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Yeah.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
It's certainly energy at me.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
That's not way.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
This isn't a collaborative environment.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
No.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
No.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
It isn't.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Um.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
That was our bond of the week.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
This isn't really a segment when we're talking point that you might enjoy a little bit more.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Okay.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Let's talk about dating in LA.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Okay.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
I mean, people on the internet love hearing about dating in LA.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Did you not get to do this on the like the show?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Probably.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
Like it feels like you're like you start off with this whole thesis.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Like you want to do things you haven't done on the show before.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Yeah.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
But some some are staples talking about dating in LA with young single people is something I'm interested in.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Have you have this ever come up on the show?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Yes.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
It started with Sally Doug Griffin.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Okay.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
And then it became dating in New York.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
I'm asking Mariko what was what in terms of being young single,

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
flirty and thriving.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Yeah.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
For lack of a better term.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Jackson Heights Queens.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Oh yeah.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
And then lack of a better job.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
And then I assess Lee and Lucy who are dating two people that we know.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
And now I'm asking you.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
So it's been four weeks.

09:03.000 --> 09:11.000
Um, I feel like I'm a bad person to ask because dating has been exceptionally easy for me.

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
I feel like you're the best person to ask because you've had a wild ride the past year.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
It's been a ride.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Yeah. It's been a little weird.

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
Um, I think, you know, I, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, in June.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
Like, a last year I got out of a, um, very long.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
No, that sounds like I, I don't know this feels like very hard to talk about, not in a bad way.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Yeah. You don't have to start there.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Yeah.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
You left a long term relationship.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
I left a five and a half year relationship and then, uh,

09:45.000 --> 10:01.720
Uh, you know, a lot of people could say too quickly, jump into your dating scene and so if anything I am like I'm at a stage where I'm really trying to like focus on myself and like that growth. Yeah, it's so you're dating yourself in LA.

10:02.360 --> 10:14.960
Yeah, but also still dating in LA. It's I don't know. It's I'm not I don't that's the hard thing. I'm not in a place. This is very innocent. I'm not in a place where I think I can like

10:15.960 --> 10:24.280
Actively speak on or like digest dating on LA because it feels like something I'm like fairly passive to go down to say like

10:25.000 --> 10:28.280
I'm not actively making decisions in it. I just feel like

10:29.560 --> 10:36.840
It feels very amorphous because the transition into it has been very fast who and I'm figuring it out like truly minute to minute

10:37.160 --> 10:41.160
But would you say that that's the landscape of dating in LA Los Angeles. I think it's

10:42.040 --> 10:49.240
I don't know. I'd hate to make an umbrella statement. I'd hate to say it was all like this is just me. I feel like every internet comedian or TikTok or

10:49.560 --> 10:56.360
That's the point is to make umbrella statements about dating in LA. Yeah, I'm like dating in LA is like hard because of this one thing

10:56.360 --> 11:03.320
I'm like not really it's actually like 40 different things. Yeah, it's incredibly nuanced. It's like when people on TikTok are like

11:03.320 --> 11:09.320
Well, this is specifically what my therapist said. It was like you are aware that like your therapist is giving advice based on weeks upon weeks

11:10.200 --> 11:16.120
I'm founding information about you like it is so specific you really can't like

11:17.320 --> 11:19.320
Advice is a different thing right?

11:20.040 --> 11:22.040
Like when they're like

11:22.040 --> 11:25.400
Versus this is therapy for everyone. Yeah, exactly

11:26.680 --> 11:29.400
It's a totally different animal. So I don't know. I

11:30.040 --> 11:35.080
Yeah, I think it's funny like all internet comedians who do this is like yeah, I guess maybe I'm not that like no

11:35.080 --> 11:38.760
That's not your brand at all. That's I think also what it's fun to talk about. Yeah, it's also

11:39.320 --> 11:45.720
I'm always like like say when a stand-up talks about dating and they're like oh, I went on this horrible date or like

11:46.360 --> 11:53.320
I had sex with this person and it was weird. I just did a stand-up bit about one specific date you went on that was horrible

11:55.160 --> 11:56.680
Oh

11:56.680 --> 12:02.200
Which uh the field my feelings yeah, but that was the date itself was not horrible

12:03.080 --> 12:08.120
It should just tell the story tell the story used a different name because this is going out to more people

12:08.200 --> 12:10.200
Yeah, this is so much harder

12:10.200 --> 12:12.200
Okay, so I

12:13.160 --> 12:19.400
I got you on field. Yeah Jeffrey a king out Jeffrey convinced me to join field a king gap which is a

12:20.680 --> 12:23.240
Anaphyde decided I don't like I'm not on the apps at all

12:24.520 --> 12:26.520
I feel like I

12:26.920 --> 12:31.240
Here's another thing I'll say and I'm gonna derail it and also make another meta commentary about the podcast

12:31.240 --> 12:34.920
Yeah, I've only ever been on this podcast and a zoom format. Yeah

12:35.320 --> 12:42.120
So I don't know if I should address the camera like this feeling address the camera. Yeah, it feels weird like I'm shooting it feels like we're making a

12:42.680 --> 12:44.680
A girl defined block

12:45.560 --> 12:48.840
Like where those two like we were those like Christian influencers

12:48.840 --> 12:54.600
I I like to think about it just as like it's an early. It's like it is a podcast. This is what a video podcast looked like in 2013

12:55.480 --> 13:00.600
Yeah, I guess anyway, but back to dating in LA for a second

13:00.600 --> 13:05.080
You were just talking about how you were kind of plopped into the dating scene very fast

13:05.640 --> 13:08.840
So let's do this. I think this will be helpful for everybody listening

13:09.880 --> 13:11.880
Between

13:12.920 --> 13:14.920
You're fully listening

13:14.920 --> 13:16.920
And who else was there

13:18.520 --> 13:24.200
This is getting cut out right but no, no, we'll we'll we'll bleep all of this but rank them for sure. Yeah, okay

13:24.200 --> 13:26.200
This is

13:26.200 --> 13:32.520
Yeah, this feels horrible. Let's do physical attraction first. Well, I think part of the thing is yeah, this feels

13:33.800 --> 13:38.920
Okay physical attraction. Yeah, no, this is terrible. No, it's not how everything will be censored

13:38.920 --> 13:40.920
This is between you and me, but it's fun to see your reaction

13:46.600 --> 13:49.640
Okay, I don't think it's right to rank women. Of course

13:50.120 --> 13:52.920
We're not bringing women we're ranking people that you've dated

13:53.640 --> 13:55.640
Who all have to be women

13:57.080 --> 14:00.200
I could do you said physically yeah rank is okay

14:00.920 --> 14:05.560
People you've dated in the last year rank them physically. Well, that's that's a little crass

14:05.560 --> 14:07.560
You just said that

14:08.280 --> 14:12.440
Let's do this three compliments each for the three people I listed three compliments

14:13.160 --> 14:17.160
Specific to them the best part about them. Okay three compliments for each

14:18.600 --> 14:20.600
Okay

14:21.560 --> 14:23.560
I would say

14:24.760 --> 14:26.760
I

14:26.760 --> 14:28.760
I think both

14:28.760 --> 14:35.000
Have the same quality of like you can bring them to any event. Yeah, and yeah, and it's like I don't have to worry about them

14:35.000 --> 14:36.520
Sure, like very

14:36.520 --> 14:40.920
operable and independent. This feels horrible. I hate this so much. Let's move on

14:42.120 --> 14:44.120
I'm gonna beat that

14:44.120 --> 14:48.920
This is this is a conversation. I'm happy to have with you in practice. I just like

14:50.760 --> 14:53.000
Inflation is a thing that isn't going anywhere

14:54.200 --> 14:58.920
I guess the way of up, but we we have to talk about it. We have to

14:59.560 --> 15:02.920
Inflation is the highest level. It's been in four decades

15:03.560 --> 15:08.040
But how you experience inflation can vary greatly. Okay, you know depending on

15:08.760 --> 15:10.360
What you eat how much you travel

15:11.320 --> 15:15.240
Your other spending habits, et cetera, so I the New York Times created this

15:15.960 --> 15:17.960
Basically quiz

15:17.960 --> 15:21.880
And I wanted to see if we could calculate your rate of inflation

15:22.520 --> 15:25.480
It just which is just good. Like how so like how much more

15:26.280 --> 15:29.320
Like by a percent I spending pre-year. Correct. Okay

15:29.880 --> 15:32.760
So the first question is did you buy a car in the past year

15:34.040 --> 15:40.040
Your options are I buy it on new car about a use car. I bought a new and a use car and I didn't buy it. I didn't buy it. All right here we go

15:41.400 --> 15:45.160
You're at 7.6% at this point. How much does it do you not buy a car?

15:46.200 --> 15:51.000
Inflation stuff how how much do you drive in a week?

15:51.720 --> 15:57.000
At least 400 miles between 150 and 400 miles or less than 450 or you have an EV

15:57.960 --> 16:02.280
Is this something I should count like as a grown-up. I should track my miles like the

16:02.280 --> 16:09.160
The guidance I had to guess you don't drive more than 150 because you live kind of close to work. Okay, you know week. Yeah, I think I drive a lot

16:09.960 --> 16:15.080
There's I you have it. There's no way it's a because if you go from one side of LA to the next that's like 25 miles

16:15.880 --> 16:21.400
Yeah, and it's so they're in bags like five it's not that I do that every day. I guess but like I think

16:21.400 --> 16:25.640
Like sometimes I feel like when I'm in the car it's been forever find do less than 150 miles

16:25.640 --> 16:29.800
We could do a between 115 four. Yeah, let's hedge up like I want my percentage to be kind of high

16:30.840 --> 16:37.160
Okay, how much do you drive a baller? I travel three three or more trips here. There you go

16:38.120 --> 16:44.360
That was a big jump. Are you they're gonna see this graph that you're yes there and then are you vegetarian?

16:44.840 --> 16:50.040
I'm like flexitarian. Okay, so note nothing. All right, I know, but I feel like it's a little bit of a great in oh

16:50.040 --> 16:53.240
Do you heat your home with oil? No, thanks

16:55.240 --> 17:00.440
I think we do do you hear with oil? Yeah, okay, because we have the LA so Cal Gas

17:02.120 --> 17:05.960
And then how often do you eat out? Several days of the week or one or two?

17:07.320 --> 17:09.320
We'll say one to two

17:10.280 --> 17:12.280
Do you pay for school

17:12.760 --> 17:15.720
I do not pay for school. I'm a working guy

17:16.280 --> 17:21.240
You're rate of inflation is 11.7 percent and I have no metric for weather. That's a lot

17:22.440 --> 17:25.240
Don't know what you do it. I

17:26.200 --> 17:28.440
Already did mine earlier, so I have screenshots

17:29.720 --> 17:33.000
The average inflation is 8.5 so yours is high

17:34.680 --> 17:38.760
Wait, do you want to get no what would you change? I can adjust any of them

17:39.640 --> 17:44.280
Let's let make me a vegetarian okay, let's say you're a vegetarian who drives a little less

17:47.960 --> 17:53.400
Uh 11.6 so the fuck wait, I feel like okay, here's where I got fucked

17:53.400 --> 17:55.400
But I keep my home with oil

17:56.200 --> 18:00.040
Which you also don't have a choice. I have a choice. We scrub was the first thing we said

18:00.360 --> 18:04.920
You said that you didn't buy a car, which you do you want to change that? No, I'm gonna feel like that's a trip

18:05.720 --> 18:11.560
That sucks so much. All right, well yours was 11.6

18:12.440 --> 18:14.440
Let's see what mine was

18:14.920 --> 18:19.000
So average US inflation is 8.5 percent the first question is did you buy a

18:20.440 --> 18:22.440
car new or used in the past year

18:23.640 --> 18:25.640
for me I

18:26.120 --> 18:30.840
Actually entered an omaze sweepstakes and lost a forced Ford Bronco V8

18:31.320 --> 18:36.920
So um you had different answers than I had well mine was a filled in the blanket and they changed it to a drop-down

18:36.920 --> 18:41.720
Because you can only assume I was one of many people who took some liberties, but yeah

18:41.720 --> 18:46.440
I entered an omaze sweepstakes and lost um but it was the sick like souped up V8

18:47.000 --> 18:52.840
It was a Velociraptor with like a racing straight we what do you mean you sorry that sounds like a disgusting car

18:53.880 --> 18:55.880
What no

18:55.880 --> 18:59.080
This you entered a sweepstakes what did you do

19:01.080 --> 19:05.240
What is happening to you just did you just not like burgers in there

19:06.520 --> 19:08.200
What happened what was your question?

19:09.560 --> 19:17.320
How does the sweepstakes work you you can enter a certain number times for free I ended up paying $50 to get I think

19:17.640 --> 19:21.240
1500 entries um and I lost

19:23.320 --> 19:30.360
Okay, so you didn't the question the first question being did you buy a car you didn't like the loser car you lost the sweepstakes

19:30.440 --> 19:34.520
I didn't lose a car. I didn't get a car because I'll enter it and lost a sweepstakes

19:34.520 --> 19:40.520
So the your answer in the drop-down menu is I didn't buy a car again. It was a type in your own answer

19:40.520 --> 19:44.200
I don't know if they were beta testing it, but I said I lost a Ford Bronco in a sweepstakes

19:44.200 --> 19:49.400
How it's okay, what I will say is that's incredibly sophisticated AI for the New York Times

19:49.400 --> 19:54.840
I understand they're like one of the world's largest publications, but I use a roommate dog pretzel

19:54.840 --> 19:58.280
Hello pretzel you know it's funny when we talked about doing this in the living room

19:58.360 --> 20:04.200
I was thinking oh I wonder when pretzel comes in who she's gonna go to and I had a nightmare scenario

20:04.200 --> 20:06.840
Where should go to you enough? Well, she's making the rounds

20:09.080 --> 20:14.920
So anyway, sure we continue. Yeah, keep going. I know you clearly have some funny jokes in here that you wrote in

20:17.880 --> 20:23.480
So the second one was that the question is how how much do you drive and I say I well I'm in the driver seat

20:23.480 --> 20:29.400
So to speak sexually so what I'll often do is instead of driving somewhere. I'll drive someone

20:31.560 --> 20:33.960
That yeah, I get what you're saying

20:35.000 --> 20:38.200
But when you say I drive someone it's still sounds like you're driving

20:40.520 --> 20:43.800
I get you're making a sex thing. It still sounds like you're just in a car

20:45.080 --> 20:47.080
Good note good note

20:47.080 --> 20:53.240
How did it know how did it know what to like go to you know like how did when the charts

20:53.320 --> 20:55.480
Swings like when you heat your home with oil

20:56.120 --> 21:00.680
How did it know to only go a little bit because you'd drive someone sexually?

21:00.680 --> 21:06.600
It's I think it's powered by Watson. I don't know what else to say. I what also powered by Watson and saying

21:08.440 --> 21:12.840
Like any sort of like any sort of sexual inner well

21:12.840 --> 21:17.320
I don't I was gonna say any sexual action is free and I know sex work is I'm right

21:17.320 --> 21:19.320
I'm not gonna pontificate on this. Yeah

21:20.280 --> 21:23.800
Regular I don't want to make it a assumption about your sexual lifestyle

21:25.640 --> 21:29.640
And then they ask how often you travel and the question the answer is I can't why?

21:30.040 --> 21:35.320
Because of some airport mishaps what are I and I fear that the airport

21:35.720 --> 21:39.560
Mishaps or what would you do I guess? Well, I made a joke about concealing a pipe bomb

21:40.440 --> 21:44.600
But I was really just talking about my really really bad gas at the time

21:45.720 --> 21:46.920
You

21:47.000 --> 21:53.080
All of these are like you're saying things it's just another cluster of words to make it sound worse and putting in your

21:53.080 --> 21:58.120
level of work in arrow. I also edited a plane ticket to say that I was TSA please check

21:59.560 --> 22:03.560
So it was basically that I was like a person of interest in terms of like a why did you do that?

22:03.560 --> 22:09.320
Would you game from being a TSA please check? I don't usually they have a sense of humor depending on which airport you're in like at LX

22:09.560 --> 22:14.360
They're usually like you know joking with me a little bit what airport caught you it was burbank

22:15.240 --> 22:18.120
I guess because there's like they may have more attention to detail because there's less people

22:19.160 --> 22:23.320
Yeah, I guess I want to go back to you said you had a pipe bomb because you had gas

22:23.720 --> 22:30.920
Yeah, I mean flying it just there's it does a number on the body. Yeah, you committed a minor form of domestic terrorism because you had a fart

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
That's one way to put it but

22:35.560 --> 22:39.240
Honestly, it took my inflation rate down so it all ends up being worth it in the end

22:39.960 --> 22:43.240
Yeah, I guess and that um and then it asks

22:43.640 --> 22:46.280
If you're vegetarian or not, I only eat sides

22:47.080 --> 22:53.800
So stuff like corn off the cob tomato grotto and red bean casserole right okay

22:54.280 --> 22:59.480
As a I said I was flexitarian earlier, which is sort of a meat on the side situation does that mean

22:59.960 --> 23:03.320
You like if presented on the side and if the side we're big enough you eat it

23:04.200 --> 23:09.320
I guess that now we're getting a new conversation of what constitute a side because you can definitely have meat in a side

23:09.320 --> 23:14.520
Right exactly like steak tartar. I would say that's an app. Yeah. No, I think you're right

23:14.840 --> 23:17.720
Okay, wait, what's chips and guac side or app? I

23:18.120 --> 23:22.840
That's one of the things that's in the middle of the van. I think okay because there's that'll often be

23:23.800 --> 23:25.560
What's that? I was I think

23:25.560 --> 23:29.880
Sorry you're singing. Yeah, she's saying it's in the middle of the I don't know what that is

23:30.440 --> 23:34.280
Again, I think they were beta testing because I just got this weird computer character

23:34.920 --> 23:38.440
So at least you know your answer even though it's a little bit above the average. Sure, okay

23:40.280 --> 23:42.280
Sure

23:44.360 --> 23:46.360
We have to move on

23:57.960 --> 23:59.960
This song's a lot

24:00.120 --> 24:02.120
It's a little too long probably

24:10.280 --> 24:16.520
It's just hard to edit them down because you have to download the sound edited and like premiere

24:17.480 --> 24:24.200
Export the wave and then upload that too. Okay. This podcast is sponsored by better help online therapy

24:24.760 --> 24:29.800
Guys life can be overwhelming right and so many people are burned out without even knowing it

24:30.040 --> 24:36.360
Symptoms can include mode lack of motivation feeling helpless or trapped detachment fatigue and more

24:37.320 --> 24:44.920
We associate burnout with work, but that's not the only cause right any of our roles in life can lead us to feel burnt out

24:45.160 --> 24:49.640
And better help online therapy wants to remind you to prioritize yourself

24:50.280 --> 24:54.520
By talking to somebody who can help you figure out what's causing stress in your life

24:54.520 --> 24:56.520
I've definitely felt burnt out before

24:57.240 --> 25:03.400
When work gets a little much when you have deadlines to hit when a break is coming up in your work is project based

25:03.800 --> 25:06.520
Right, I can go insane. I can feel burnt out

25:07.240 --> 25:16.520
But I'm in therapy every week. It helps me be a better version of myself. I really think everybody who can should be in therapy

25:19.400 --> 25:21.400
Sorry, I was just

25:21.560 --> 25:22.920
Yeah

25:22.920 --> 25:26.680
I started to get a little burnt out and even just doing this ad. I'm gonna go call my therapist

25:27.480 --> 25:32.840
But that's also where better help can help you find a therapist because better help is customized online therapy

25:32.840 --> 25:37.160
That offers video phone and even live chat sessions with your therapist so you don't have to see anyone on camera

25:37.160 --> 25:42.760
If you don't want to it's also much more affordable than in-person therapy and you can be matched with the therapist in under 48 hours

26:01.000 --> 26:07.480
Um, I thought it'd be fun since we can do whatever we want to do our own little like Vogue 73 questions. Sure

26:08.840 --> 26:13.560
I look and see if we can do whatever we want and still talking about inflation

26:16.760 --> 26:21.400
I think this stuff is interesting. I've tried to make this show a little bit more digestible a little more high

26:21.400 --> 26:26.680
brow by talking about current events and last week we talked about how former president Barack Obama

26:27.400 --> 26:29.400
thinks there needs to be more regulation around tech

26:30.440 --> 26:35.960
Okay, this one's a little bit more fun. All right, if you didn't like inflation let's do 73 questions. Okay. Yeah. What's your favorite movie?

26:37.720 --> 26:39.720
My favorite movie is

26:40.280 --> 26:47.400
Leo from five to seven. Is that an indie movie? No, it's like a French film at the risk of the song. Can I say over the gunwall?

26:47.400 --> 26:52.040
Yeah, okay over the gunwall. Okay. I'm not taking the movie, but favorite movie in the past five years

26:52.360 --> 26:59.080
They're moving the past 20 years again. The year is a 2022 which goes all the way back to 2017. Yeah

27:00.680 --> 27:07.960
I love the Lego Batman movie really. I really love it. I think it there's more praise

27:09.160 --> 27:13.240
I don't know where yours. What are your kinks by the way? I've never talked about this praise.

27:13.240 --> 27:18.200
Well, you answer the question and then that can be the next my favorite movie is the Big Lebowski my favorite

27:18.280 --> 27:20.200
movie in the last five years is probably

27:21.400 --> 27:23.400
God I've hated a lot of the movies I've seen

27:25.960 --> 27:32.840
I liked cats you liked cats. I had a fun experience going to watch cats, but now what's the

27:33.960 --> 27:40.280
There was oh, you know what Spencer was kind of good. Okay, I'm sure Kristen Stewart's really good in it. Oh, I might have

27:40.280 --> 27:44.120
meant my entire parasite. But I mean in parasites. That feels basic. I

27:45.080 --> 27:49.880
Don't watch a lot of movies so like any of the movies that I watch her because I had to to be part of the

27:49.880 --> 27:55.560
cultural conversation so any thing that I picked from the last five years is not going to be interesting. You watch Spencer because we're all talking about it

27:58.280 --> 28:00.280
I watched it with my parents. Okay

28:02.040 --> 28:07.560
Favorite move you want to gloss over kinks and you were about to read favorite movie again favorite Marvel film

28:08.120 --> 28:10.120
Marvel film yeah

28:12.440 --> 28:21.400
I like a Ragnarock feels basic to say, but I think that's a very fun one and then also

28:23.800 --> 28:27.800
I thought civil war was fun when I saw it. I don't think it holds up. Yeah

28:29.000 --> 28:32.520
I haven't seen multiverse of madness. I might see it afterward on recording if you want to go

28:33.560 --> 28:36.680
I have to edit this and get it to fairs. Oh, okay

28:38.040 --> 28:39.560
What do you know and I liked

28:40.520 --> 28:47.160
Into the Spideyverse that's funny. It's not like Marvel licensed Marvel licensed yeah

28:48.120 --> 28:51.320
Yeah, I guess yeah better answer than my dumb thing

28:53.080 --> 29:00.920
I should see Thor Ragnarock because I've heard it's funny. That's fun. Yeah, I don't know you you might I don't think you need that much context to see it either

29:01.480 --> 29:03.480
Um a movie you've read

29:04.600 --> 29:12.440
Movie of red. Okay, this has a movie you read in school that positively shaped you. Why don't we say a book you read in school that positively?

29:12.440 --> 29:14.440
Yeah, why don't we

29:16.840 --> 29:20.760
I don't know if this positively shaped me. It's certainly the book I've been thinking a lot about

29:21.480 --> 29:23.480
Bible

29:23.480 --> 29:30.440
By I think it's called House of the Scorpion and it's about a kid who grows up on this plantation

29:31.000 --> 29:33.880
Everybody's on opium and they're making a lot of them

29:34.760 --> 29:36.760
Which I believe is opium water and

29:38.280 --> 29:44.680
It's he's like not allowed to hang out with other kids because it's revealed he's like the clone of the plantation owner

29:45.240 --> 29:51.160
Who basically when the plantation over owner dies he becomes like a person and then he finds all this out and starts to take it down

29:51.160 --> 29:56.120
They're like well, they're we're gonna kill him because we have plenty of other little clone babies to take over the plantation

29:56.120 --> 29:58.120
I think it's called House of Scorpion

29:59.080 --> 30:05.240
I read Hollywood by Cherk by Bukowski when I was in like when I was like a freshman in high school

30:06.360 --> 30:12.920
I feel like it's you went to an all-boys private school and I feel like it's so dangerous to give a like freshman in all boys private school

30:12.920 --> 30:14.920
Boot Kowski

30:15.320 --> 30:21.320
They didn't give it to me. That was like you wanted to stick you fought for it. Yes, and that was the book that

30:22.040 --> 30:24.040
I read and was like I'm never gonna be an alcoholic

30:25.000 --> 30:32.920
Okay, and that's just positive shaped me which that was also my misconception that alcoholism isn't a mental illness

30:33.640 --> 30:38.600
I also forgot that the the copy of the question was positively shaped you. That's okay. We have

30:39.720 --> 30:45.800
68 more. That's okay. All right rapid fire the next five. Wait. Okay, and just a flag sorry you said

30:46.120 --> 30:50.680
We wouldn't you like you had 20 minutes prepared sure. This is easily third

30:51.400 --> 30:53.800
72 questions. We could have just done this

30:54.360 --> 30:58.760
We didn't have to talk about dating in LA or inflation how I only with this in your pocket

30:58.760 --> 31:04.200
We could have done this. I could have milk this for 45 minutes. Okay, well, we have at most an hour

31:04.520 --> 31:07.640
Okay, so we could do three to 18 more minutes. All right

31:08.760 --> 31:11.560
Let's do rapid fire the next five favorite TV show that's currently on go

Probably eight for me. That's pretty good. Wait, you're gonna eat but you're fired. You're too

31:46.840 --> 31:52.280
I'm an optimist. It's gotta look up to somehow sure. I'm hoping this episode at least gets my foot in the

31:53.400 --> 31:57.960
What do you mean for the door you're making this with like unpoliced anyway? This you can

31:58.520 --> 32:02.600

32:21.880 --> 32:23.880
because it felt too personal

32:23.880 --> 32:30.520
That's like this whole awkward jibber jabber. I gave for most of the time you think that's gonna sell them to bring this back

32:46.280 --> 32:49.240
Great light press thing in let's let's do this

It's a song or apple apple unfortunately Twitter or Instagram

32:56.600 --> 33:02.440
They're both bad, but I guess I'm using Instagram more than I'm using Twitter and I'm not really using either

I think I want to rebrand my regular Instagram to be more like a normal man George Sava. I don't even mean that to be a man George thing

33:22.680 --> 33:27.800
I was gonna make it like RIP George Sava, but that's good or I might leave it as secret

40:35.880 --> 40:42.360
It's the Maison Louis Marie number four. It's nice. It's like the most affordable sandal wood candle that doesn't smell like

40:42.920 --> 40:46.680
I spilled a candle in my car and I haven't cleaned up the wax. It's still in there

40:46.680 --> 40:50.520
But when the it gets hot out it makes the car smell good. So I kind of like

42:24.760 --> 42:31.960
Yeah, I guess I guess sweet cakes, but I like both

42:33.240 --> 42:35.240
lipstick or lip gloss

42:36.840 --> 42:41.400
Gloss stick fuck. I don't know. This feels like one of those things I'll get canceled for what I've been

I think it's what's called right in the pictures the baby by the toilet. I don't know if I ever read that one. It's real

43:13.800 --> 43:19.240
It's like heart wrenching. It's hard because like you don't have to read the classics like you have to read what you like sure

43:20.120 --> 43:26.120
It bedtime story is different than a children's book though, and okay. That's true. What would be the title of your autobiography?

44:18.040 --> 44:23.560

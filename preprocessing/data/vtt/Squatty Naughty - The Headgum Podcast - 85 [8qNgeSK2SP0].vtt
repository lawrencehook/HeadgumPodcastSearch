WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
New combination of guests on the show today should we say.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
We have Michael Hurwitz.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
We got Merricka Brown.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
We got Johnny Villa.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
This has never happened.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
As I really not.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
I don't think so.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Interesting.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Yeah.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Yeah.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Cool.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Yeah.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Core 4.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Core 4.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
All right.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
New nicknames for all of you guys.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Michael, you were previously heard aty.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Yes.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
What about?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
How are you?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
You can't top that.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
That was a really good one.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Yeah.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
What about Big Diesel?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
M.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Big Diesel.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
M.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
No, because then it's basically like because Mike is really strong.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
So it's like Big Diesel.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
And then that doesn't tie into Mike at all.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
So then you have to add the M.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
But I could also be Big Diesel M.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
And it's funny.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
You should say that because what my suggestion for you.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
It was going to be cold minor brownly.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Because you're never afraid to do the hard work.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
All right.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Interesting.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
And that's what Johnny is.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I don't think I can guess.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
House of duty.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
J.U.C.C.I.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
M.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Do you see House of Gucci?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
No.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
I did.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
And I really, really did not like it.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Yeah.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
That movie's fun.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
So that it's crazy.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
I think I don't think Adam drivers got nominated for that movie at all.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Like a major thing.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
But both Lady Gaga and Jared Lotto have gotten nominated.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
And the fact that Jared Lotto got nominated is the craziest thing I've ever experienced.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
I feel insane.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
I heard Jared Lotto had a good Italian accent.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
You heard that?

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
I did hear that from the Italian man.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Wow.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Johnny, didn't you say last night that is Italian accent was absolute garbage?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
No.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
I said that because we were actually talking about this movie yesterday.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
And Micah.

02:33.000 --> 02:40.000
We were saying that or I was saying that everybody who was Italian in the film had

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
a different Italian accent.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
It was very interesting.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Like Jared Lotto's character was very.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
You know, I can't talk while the sound bite is playing.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
So you're just interrupting the flow.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Yeah.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
But that's like it adds to it because it's a reaction.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
But we can naturally react in this show.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
And it's to be a lot less forced.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Okay.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
And it's going to be a lot more intuitive for the listener.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Anyways.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Jared Lotto.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
He's in the film.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Marbi has got pushed back again.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
You guys.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Is this movie exist?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Well, never know.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
What's Morpheus?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Is that with Jared Lotto?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Morbheus.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
How could I have known?

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Because it's, I don't know.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
It's like a big blog poster movie.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
It's the fucking.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
He's a vampire man.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Yeah.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
His name is.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
His name is like.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
It's like.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Doctor Michael Morbheus.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Is this a Marvel movie?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Yeah.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
It looks so dumb.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Yeah.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Really excited to be honest.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
It's insane.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
If it will ever come out.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Michael.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
You've been on the show in like a year.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
I know.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
What's been new?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I mean, I know a little bit about your personal life.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
But what's been new that you want to share with the audience?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
How was the absence treated you?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Good.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Have you found different avenues of joy?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
God.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
It's a great question.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
I don't know.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
I'm a great answer.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
New avenues of joy.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
I'm kind of a, come back to me.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
Disappointed that you don't have the, the, the pilot microphone.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
That was fun.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Good times.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Now that's when we should have had a video podcast.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Yeah.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
That's a very visual gag.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
You dropped the ball on this Jeffrey.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I don't know where that microphone is.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Where it was procured in the first place.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
But neck, if, if we do do a live episode, not live,

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
but all on studio, I think Mike, I should have that Mike.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I can find it.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Okay.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
It's, it's definitely here somewhere.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Yeah.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
The very least it should be like on display in the office.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Yeah.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Do you think when Lady Gaga showed up to set on House of Gucci?

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
They were like, oh, she's definitely here.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Nice.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
No.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
No one said that.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Really?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
For sure.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Damn.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Daniel.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Did you see the, um, you know the ski scene in House of Gucci?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Whether it's just very non-secretor.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
And then they're playing like some generic 80s tune.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
It's almost like they, it's like royalty free 80s music.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
It's like, uh, it's like last holiday.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Which is, with what'd be Goldberg?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I've never seen that film.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Sorry.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
She skis down a mountain.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Uh, and she's like, she doesn't know how to ski.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
She's sort of falling down a slow.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
How is it like that kind of thing?

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
I feel like I could have been like, that's like snow dogs.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Absolutely.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Thank you.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Thank you.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Did you kill her?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
If you have to snack.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Make sure that the snack's going to have your back.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
We're talking athletic greens.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
75 plus new different nutrients absorbed through your liver.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Is this an ad?

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
I've been selling my own ads.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
How do they?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Did it run on the show?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
They will soon, I think.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Did they have it last time?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Have you tried the product?

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
I try every product that we ever does with and I like it a mall.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
I like it a mall.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Speaking of House of Gucci.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Um, Maria, are you, am I going to see you at all one of the New Yorker?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
I mean, ideally.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
I don't know.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
You can easily come to Queens if you want to.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
I would like to come to.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Well, that's be specific.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
No.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Let's meet a LaGuardia for an after-work opportunity.

06:57.000 --> 07:03.000
Um, yeah, mostly what I do is I just walk on a street for blocks and blocks and blocks

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
and blocks and blocks and then I turn around and I go home or I go to physical therapy.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
I'm not really how I get out of the house.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Wow.

07:10.000 --> 07:17.000
My new best friend is my physical therapist because he's the person I see the most during the week outside of my roommate.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Uh, so yeah, you know, just killing it.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
I don't know.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
I might, I might start taking the train into the city and walking around again.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Johnny and I saw licorice pizza on Saturday.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I'm so sorry.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
You didn't really.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
You didn't like it.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
I didn't.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Okay.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
No, no.

07:36.000 --> 07:43.000
I, as a movie, I liked it until the very last scene.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
And if that had just been cut, I would have enjoyed the movie.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
So where do you think it should have ended?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Let's say spoiler alert.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
And, uh, so skip ahead two minutes if you don't want to hear this.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Sure.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I think it should have ended when they collapsed into a hug and fell on the ground.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I think that should have been the end of the movie.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I found it in front of the theater.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
The fact that she, they go on to kiss and then she says, I love you is insane.

08:09.000 --> 08:17.000
And I'm so, I, I've been in the trenches of this discourse for weeks on Twitter.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Not replying with just reading them and getting more and more mad.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
And it's like not like, it's illegal.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
It's illegal.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
I get, I understand like the concept of this is this happened in the 70s.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Like things were different.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
That's totally fine.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
I still think they could have easily just cut that and it would have been a non issue.

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
And the, like the people, the fact that people are defending the age gap as a way to defend the movie is insane.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Just say you like the movie.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Like that's not difficult.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I enjoyed parts of that movie.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
I think scenes and like certain characters were really, really funny and good.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
And then, you know, there's like this crazy racist joke that happens twice.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
We're like, the audience and my theater laughed it appropriately at the joke.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I don't know what happened in your theater.

09:05.000 --> 09:13.000
But like everybody was kind of like, I might think it was like laughing, not at the fact that it was happening.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
But at the joke, which was like second time it happened.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
No, because of how insane it was.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
I stood up in the theater and looked behind to see who laughed at this like a time.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
Yeah, he like pointed people with a really straight thing.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Yeah.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Yeah.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
But the fact that like, I don't know, Paul Thomas Anderson's like defending that by being like essentially being like,

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
I, I know Asian people.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
It's fine.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
It's definitely paraphrasing.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
It's not funny.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
And also like if that's what the reactions are that you're getting in the audience and the tone is wrong.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
And you should just admit that like, yeah.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Sorry, it's not that hard.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
The tone is often this movie and that's what makes it that in certain places.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
And I'm just tired of people defending it in the wrong way.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Just like defend it on its like movie making merits.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Don't like double down on like, yeah, well,

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
who didn't have a crush on their babysitter when they were 15 like,

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
were you like, were you talking?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
I'm doing it.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
Did you know that my soapbox is Paul Thomas Anderson, his,

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
I think old art teacher was the high mother.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Yeah.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
That's about some mother, which is crazy.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Don't do that.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Yeah.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
When that's why she's in it.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
That's why Alana and her name family isn't it.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Yeah.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
He's hard.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I don't know.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
And I don't listen to high.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah, the entire family's in it.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Wow.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
And Leonardo DiCaprio's father is in it.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
George DiCaprio.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Who does he play?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Was he?

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Who does he play?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
He plays.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Have you seen it?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
No, I just looked up the cat.

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
Let's move on because that was longer than two minutes, I think.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And probably spoil the for some people.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
I mean, again, this is one of those times where I'd love to hear more about your

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
character.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Because I feel like sometimes the show acts as a barrier between me and you guys getting

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
closer to you in front of friendship level.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
And I'm feeling pretty fucking lonely today, so like the idea of getting closer to you guys

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
even over this next 40 minutes would be kind of chill.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Right on.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Let's do it.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Yeah.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
What do you want to know, Jeff?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Right on.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Was that right on to us getting closer or right on that I'm lonely?

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Right on to just continue the podcast.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Honestly, it's just hard to be like alone with your thoughts and apartment.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Yeah.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Yeah.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Right on to connect.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Yeah.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Right on to that too, I agree.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
To what to.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
To connect.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
And not about your personal life.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Our personal life's really.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Yeah.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
How do you guys make friends?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Let's start there.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
I have no idea.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I have no idea.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
You just have them.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Everybody just connects and gets them.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Yeah, but I can't.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Oh, go ahead.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
No, I was just going to say, I have some.

12:15.000 --> 12:23.000
But I feel like all the places that I got these friends are like closed or I can't.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Like I feel like I made friends at like going to ECB shows.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
And now that's done.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
And so now I have no new friends.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
And I need some.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
No new friends.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
No new friends.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Let's go.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
No new ones.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
No.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
That's actually because that justifies me not having many.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
You have a lot of friends.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Yeah.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
You really do.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
You know so many people here.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Yeah.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
I do really.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
A lot of people.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Um.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Sorry.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
That made me sadder because it's like you can know a lot of people but not feel close to them.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Pain's the longest.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Knowing that my family is three blocks away.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
It just sucks.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Yeah.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Why don't you take the initiative.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Reach out.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
It's hard.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
How is it hard?

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
You already have established some sort of relationship.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
So it's on you really.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Well, she has covens.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
I can't.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Yeah.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
We live in the digital age where we can reach out via Instagram messages or even text messages.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Yeah.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
I think you should make online friends.

13:26.000 --> 13:33.000
I think you should like find a forum for your interests and to start talking to people there.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Yeah.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Maybe.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Yeah.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
I don't know.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Yeah.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
I'm on those.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Hmm.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Hmm.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Okay.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Haven't made any friends.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Are you just ostracizing people?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
I'm not ostracizing people.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
I just like, I give my opinions on different references and then people like don't either agree with them or don't.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
And when they agree with them, I'm like, okay, well, that's actually my opinion.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
So you can't have it.

13:55.000 --> 14:02.000
And then if they don't agree with them, then I get angry because I'm like, what are you trying to start something?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Yeah.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
I'll go to toe for the tutor, oyster prints, 1967 reference, not year any day of the week.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
So imagine if I did that to you, like, if I wouldn't like that.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
So think about it through like another person's perspective.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
You doing it to them.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Not right.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Maybe not right.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Maybe not right.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Like a Pinterest board because that's what I can do by myself.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
No, it's not.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
You're not going to make friends.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
I can't trust.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
Michael, how long have you been dating your girlfriend?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Two years.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Two years.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Wow.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
And is there trouble in paradise?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Nope.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Smooth sailing.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
That's good.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
Because that's the other thing is like feeling lonely in terms of like relationship.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Woes.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
So I'm not really six with them or not.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
You're not even trying to get to know Michael.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
You just wanted to insert yourself after his comment.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Oh, because that's something we could connect on if he said trouble in paradise.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Then I could say, well, you know, you should do.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
And then suddenly he and I are single guys out on the town out with a frown.

15:00.000 --> 15:08.000
So much so that the crease of your forehead forms just so Johnny, let's talk about fashion.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
How did it intersect with fashion?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
What is fashion?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
It's a build up of tissue as you grow.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, Marika.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
But it's a build up of tissue as you grow that forms around your bones and muscles.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
And it's kind of usually why people have, you know,

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
posture issues.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
You can have it broken up, but it's one of those things.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Look, it's technical.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Oh, oh.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
Oh, sorry.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Yeah, I'm burning a pie.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
A pie.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Attend to the pie.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
No, it's, you know, when you're like making spores, some people just dip their thing in the fire

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
and it burns and they like it that way.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
That's how I like my fucking poison.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Very, very.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
Somebody did make a mock up of a tour poster for the headgon podcast.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
And I'd love to do a tour this year if we can talking, calling it the poison tour.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
No, it's amazing.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
I'll shout them out individually as soon as I pull this up on my Twitter.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
But I actually think it would be called the joys.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Yeah.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Yeah.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
The joys in tour.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
We're staying up with the idea of the joys in tour.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
I earned the poison.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
I came in from Isabelle at IS4 Bell Samuel on Instagram.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
I met Twitter, but it's, it might be their Instagram.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
It's the worst.

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
But yeah, we're going, we should do the joys in tour this year.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
Would any of you guys want to come on that tour on the day?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Sure.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
We should do our tour should just be out of a bus.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Like we should write a bus.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Yeah.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
And just do live shows and parking lots illegally.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Oh, I thought you met.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
No, I think we should do them in big theaters where we make a lot of money.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
Like people say the marquee, which is kind of intriguing.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
And we pick up some new fans along the way.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
But we travel from show to show on a bus.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
Like those old rock bands who get closer because of it.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Yeah.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
And then for the parking lot idea.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Yeah.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Co-signing.

17:03.000 --> 17:09.000
I actually had this idea where we don't go to major metropolitan areas.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Yeah.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
You go like just 10 miles out of it.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
So people like really small bars.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
But no one knows about sort of a grateful data approach.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
So we'll do Albany.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Yeah.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
We should do an amphitheater only tour.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
That would be amazing.

17:27.000 --> 17:33.000
But then we need the joys in to fill the air.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
Because it's easy to have a high energy show when you're in a smaller venue.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Yeah.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
I think it's harder in arenas and amphitheaters.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
The issue is like we're going to sell out no matter what the venue is.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
How I wonder how many tickets.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
No, I don't mean ticket sales.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I mean like we'll be sell outs.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
I know.

17:53.000 --> 18:00.000
I'm just saying I wonder how many tickets you need to like guaranteed sell in order to book like a giant arena.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
You know what I mean?

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
Like imagine if as a bit we did a show at Madison Square Garden.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
But we like.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
I think you're really campaigned for bad.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
I might be wrong.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
But I think they rent the place and then that's how they do it.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
So we usually we can do it.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Still a good bet.

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
That's the exact shape that I would do if like if you know I make billions of dollars on NFTs.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
And how far are you in that?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I've made a couple.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
A little over a thousand dollars.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
And how much have you lost?

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
None so far.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Wow.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
So you're like net positive.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Yeah.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
I'm net positive.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Uh.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
In yeah.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
So get sad again.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
No.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
This was like, this was probably the best the show has gone in weeks.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
We're jelly off each other.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Like I said.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
I thought about all the times that I had COVID and you know how old it is having COVID.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
You know what I'm going to do?

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
I'm thinking just think about how you don't connect with anybody even though you know a lot of people according to them.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
You're going to also just connect with people.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
You can text them.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
You can be a better texture.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
You could face time people.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Yeah.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
I think be a better texture is the best advice because he did text me all I had COVID.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Yeah.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Something along lines of why don't people like me.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
This is a real story.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
And then he, I think he emphasized the text and I didn't respond.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
It was a really awful move.

19:25.000 --> 19:31.000
I also like text their Jeff about a work thing and he never responded to it.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
I was drunk when you texted me that.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Yeah.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
I close.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Didn't upload the podcast at all.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Oh, yeah.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Yeah.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
I had to do it for you.

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
Last week, I forgot how the show worked after having been off of the schedule for two weeks.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Yeah.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Are you going to go back to Saturday?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
We do have to take a quick break.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
But we'll be back with a segment that I'm pretty academic excited about.

19:55.000 --> 20:01.000
And I think it's going to pull us all out of this trench that we call the headgum podcast.

They get to athletic greens for sponsoring this episode of our show.

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
Guys, I've started using athletic greens and it has given me so much more energy to get throughout my day.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
And I just feel like my body is happier for it.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
I'm not someone who is good about eating vegetables.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
I love meat.

21:04.000 --> 21:13.000
So athletic greens allows me to get a lot of the nutritional value of several servings of vegetables with one drink in the morning.

21:13.000 --> 21:20.000
Also, sometimes you just don't have time to find a lunch spot at work or pack a lunch that has healthy stuff.

21:20.000 --> 21:28.000
But if you want better gut health, more energy, optimize immunity, and you don't like taking pills and vitamins, but you want a supplement that tastes actually great.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Try athletic greens.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
So what is this stuff?

21:31.000 --> 21:43.000
Well, with one scoop of athletic greens, you're absorbing 75 high quality vitamins, minerals, whole food source, superfoods, probiotics, and adaptogens to help start your day right.

21:43.000 --> 21:52.000
This special blend of ingredients supports your gut health, your nervous system, your immune system, your energy, recovery, focus, and aging, all the things.

21:52.000 --> 21:59.000
Alright, I take it in the morning, I do a protein shake, and then I do my athletic greens, and it gets me started with some good protein that my body can break down throughout the day.

22:00.000 --> 22:09.000
And some vitamins nutrients, as if I had had the healthiest breakfast possible, but all I had to do was scoop several things into water and shake.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
It's lifestyle friendly, whether you eat keto, paleo, vegan, dairy, for your gluten free.

22:14.000 --> 22:20.000
It contains less than 1 gram of sugar, no GMOs, no nasty chemicals, or artificial anything while still tasting good.

22:20.000 --> 22:28.000
And it also helps support better sleep quality and recovery and mental clarity and alertness, which as someone recovering from having had COVID twice.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
The brain fog can be tough, and honestly, I don't know if it's placebo or not, but I think athletic greens is helping me focus more.

22:34.000 --> 22:41.000
Tons of people will take some kind of multivitamin, and it's important to choose one with high quality ingredients that your body will actually absorb.

22:41.000 --> 22:51.000

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
That's, I used to take vitamin D pills, now I'm taking them from athletic greens.

23:02.000 --> 23:07.000
It costs less than $3 a day, and you're investing in your health, and it's cheaper than your cold brew habit.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
This is the rhythm of the rise.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
The rise.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Oh yeah.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
The rhythm of the rise.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
This is the rhythm of my bite.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
My bite.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Oh yeah.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
I'm biting into rise.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Sing along if you know the words.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
There's an instrumental break. We can't sing along to this part.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
This is the worst part.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
I can't move.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Sorry.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Now I'm pissed.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
Johnny was talking over my entrance. Here we go.

24:51.000 --> 24:57.000
Don't do it over again.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Just move on.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
That was sick, dude. Did you write that?

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
There's so much more to it.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
You could put some soy upon my plate.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
Oh, sushi in a trendy place.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Big rise to burn too.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
And they ball make some rise.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
Oh, I can eat all of your grains.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
Feel you give my rise again.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
Round in round rice goes.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Each time I eat rice plain.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
This is the rhythm of the rise.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
The rise.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Oh yeah.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
The rhythm of the rise.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
This is the rhythm of my wife.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Hi wife.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Oh yeah.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
I married tons of rise.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Sing along if you know the words.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Another instrumental break.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
Sing along of none of those lyrics made sense.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
And we can't sing along because you wrote this song.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
You're original creation.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
But you teach me to eat some more.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
No way.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
I promise you it will suffice.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
So moving your arms better than ice.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
It's like the consistency of sand.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
The coldest looking dancing ever since.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
It's not the consistency.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
I don't want to be without rice.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
But no.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
Be rice bad, be nice.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Take me out to die.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
There's only one place.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
You know what's called arms B.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
This is the rhythm of the rise.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
The rise.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Oh yeah.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
The rhythm of my wife.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
This is the rhythm of my wife.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
My wife.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Oh yeah.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
I learned to play the five.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
This is the rhythm of the rise.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Awesome.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
The rise.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Oh yeah.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
It's pretty good.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
The rise.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Yeah, I'm not going to lie.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
This is the rhythm of my wife.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
By wife.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Oh yeah.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Imagine going to the club and hearing this.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
I don't like my wife.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Oh.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Yeah.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
There it is.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Okay.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
There we go.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
And you deserve it.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
After that performance.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
You deserve it.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
I kind of.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
That really didn't go well.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Yeah.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Because I don't really know that song very well.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Yeah.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
That was clear.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Pretty fair.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
All right.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
That's how the segment starts.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
And then I thought you guys could give me notes.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Well, what is the segment?

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
The segment is I made a song and I need notes.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
A lot of people.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Nice.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Well, all right.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
So one major note.

28:01.000 --> 28:06.000
You were singing a lot about rice and rice adjacent things, which is, I guess, some sort

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000
of thematic thread, you're kind of connecting as the parody.

28:11.000 --> 28:17.000
But you did mention that you could play the five, which is very non-nice rice related.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
And they want you to adjust that.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Yeah.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Also, yeah.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
You rhymed your own rice with wife and wife.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Which aren't really rhyme.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
So maybe I feel like there's a decent amount of ice.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Yeah.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Yeah.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
We're in too good.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Change this too.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Yeah.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Is that it?

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Are you listening to our...

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
I'm not listening to it.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
There's no rebuttals until the end.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
I think I think it should be an open dialogue.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
I think you should.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
All right.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
And I'm kind of pissed because like those notes didn't take into account.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Like how much time this took.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
It definitely didn't take long, right?

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
It was about hours.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Yeah.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
So that's really not long.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
In fact, it's really fast for writing a song parody.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Yeah.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
Can we just zoom in on some of these verses?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Because I feel like I didn't know the rhythm of the...

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Ironic the song.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
The rhythm of the song.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Okay.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Uh...

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
It's a physical rhythm.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
Won't you teach me how to eat some rice?

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
I promise you it will suffice.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Taste better than ice.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
Consistency of sand.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Yes.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
That was a part I was gonna...

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Oh, god.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
That part's pretty good.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
Well, because you say that it has the consistency of sand.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Mm.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
It doesn't.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Rice?

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Rice.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Yeah.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
They're both grains.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Oh, I guess like dry rice.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
No.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Don't even give them...

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
I've got to credit really down.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
It really is not...

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Feel like rice in your mouth.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Yeah.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
And if anything, like...

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Grits.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
Like that's the consistency of sand, right?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Uncooked grits.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
But not rice.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Yeah.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Like a full grain of rice.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
Keenwai for stretching the definition and stretching that feeling.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Yeah.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Um...

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
You could put some soy upon my plate.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Okay.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
So she in a trendy place.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
Big rice to burn to and baby I'll make rice taste.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
The reason that this took you 10 minutes to write is because

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
None of the words makes sense together.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
That makes sense.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
That's a poetic stanza.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
About going to like a fancy sushi spot.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Baby I'll make rice taste.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
And that's the end of the sentence.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Burn rice to what?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
To burn to.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Okay.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
So rice to burn to.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Yeah.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Can you explain that?

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
All right.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
Maybe we're just not understanding the vision of the creator.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
So if you can explain it succinctly, mind you.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
This stanza is about me putting soy sauce on rice.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
You could put some soy upon my plate.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
That's the secret sheet.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
That's the secret sheet.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Yeah.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
Take rice to burn to stick you rice.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Not stick you rice.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
I crispy rice.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
And baby I'll make rice taste.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
So basically not only is there soy on it, which gives more taste to the

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
rice, but you're making rice taste of you.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
So you put the rice on your tongue.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
That's making you taste rice.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
And rice is tasting you if you know in a way.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
If you want to get in stretch, it's sort of poetic.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
No.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
It's imagery.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
It's using words.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Using words and imagery.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Poloems use words.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Yeah.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Poloems use words to create imagery.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
And that's what I've done.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Are you not picturing yourself at Katzuja?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
No.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
No.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Micah.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
I'm not really lucky.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
Like I can tell that Micah really wants to defend you.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
But he really can't find any.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
And he thinks to latch on to.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
This is the rhythm of the rice.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Oh, that was really good Micah.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Yeah.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
It's the same thing I said.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
But he had a lot of gump shit.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
The rice.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Oh yeah.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Yeah.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
I like this.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
I like this.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
I like this.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
I like this.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
I like this.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
It was a different arm.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
It wasn't better.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
I very mind.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
This is the rhythm of your wife.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Oh, wow.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Fine.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
Let's just move on.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Thanks for the notes.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Okay.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
That was the segment that we're really going to enjoy.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
No way.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
You said this was long.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Oh, God.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Jesus.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
How familiar are you guys with as seen on TV products?

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Very.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
I, yeah.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
I watched TV.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
That's cool.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Micah.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Yeah, I've seen this one.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
All right.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I thought we could kind of punch some of these up.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
It's a picture of oxyclean for the whole year.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Yeah.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Got to say that.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Yeah.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
So we're looking at oxyclean here.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I'm saying, how can we punch this up?

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
How can we make it a little bit more interesting than just a versatile laundry

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
stain remover?

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
The punch effect?

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
More interesting?

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Yeah.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
What do you mean punch, punch it up?

33:03.000 --> 33:09.000
Like in terms of like changing the name or like what's on the label or the product?

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
There's, we listen.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
We're, we're confronting a changing media landscape.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
All right.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
We're not really seeing compromises much as we used to.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
People have YouTube premium.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
People have Hulu.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
All right.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
People have Netflix.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
These are things that don't have commercial breaks.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
And that, but these products still exist.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
I looked it up.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Everything that we're going to see still exists.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
And I want to see how we can create a product.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
That's so interesting.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
We don't even need it to be as seen on TV.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
So for oxyclean, I was thinking hydroxyclean.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
So it's hydroxychloroquine for your laundry.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
So when you wash a shirt,

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
uh, COVID can't get to you.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
It's not based in science.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
So we're, so we're taking these products and we're changing them to be better.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
To be better.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Yeah.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Products itself themselves.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Oxyclean being the first.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
It doesn't have to rhyme.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I'm just really good at business.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Okay. Sorry.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Hydroxyclean.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
Yeah.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Hydroxyclean.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Yeah.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Oxycreme.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
It's, uh, that's good.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Cream that makes you clean.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
So you don't have to shower anymore.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Well, isn't showering like you kind of,

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
you got to lather going with like bar soap or body wash.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
That's kind of a cream.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Conditioners of cream.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Well, I guess in a way,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
but I mean, you don't, you need no water.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
You just kind of rub it on you and then you're clean.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Like a dry shampoo.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Yeah.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Yeah, dry shampoo.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Your body.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
I just do think that soap.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
Yeah.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Yeah.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
You just said you need to lather.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
I don't know.

34:44.000 --> 34:49.000
I mean, it sounds like purel, but cream, which would make people probably feel a little bit uncomfortable physically.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
I think it's a powder.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I think it's still a powder like oxyclean.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
But it's called oxycreme.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
It.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
It's powder and then kind of like.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
You do have it.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Add some friction.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
No.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
You add some friction.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
No.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
What?

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
What idiot?

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
You're making it up now.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Add a little bit of friction.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
And then it becomes some sort of liquidy substance.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
You rub that on your body.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
That doesn't have science behind it.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Yeah.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
I thought we were just kind of trying to punch it up.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
These are just ideas.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Yeah.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
It's different.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
What?

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
You like sort of lack of vision.

35:29.000 --> 35:36.000
Nicely saying the rootest thing you could say in entrepreneur.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
John, I want Johnny on Shark Tank.

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
Sitting in his chair doing that same thing that he's doing right now with his hand.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
Got him slowly rubbing his thumb and first finger together.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Like he's playing the world's Chinese violin.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
That's right.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Like he might buy the idea.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
And then.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
I think that he like industries.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Yeah.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Pretty like industries.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
All right.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Marika, Mike, could you guys have any last minute pitches for us?

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Yeah, I got it.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
All right.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Let's go digital.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Oh, we should.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
Okay.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
I like this.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
The stain removed for not just for physical stains.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
But for any stains from your past.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
I like that.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
I like that.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
So you install oxyclean like as an ad block or type thing.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
And it deletes any problematic tweets you might have had from the last decade.

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
And anything else you don't on the internet that somebody could zero in on and try to.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
I like that.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
It's actually really hard.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
That is a fuck.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
It could be called proxy clean nice.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
You said not only clean physical things.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
That means it also does clean physical things.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Yeah.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
It emits.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
It emits.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Uh, one of those.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
A easy part.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Oh.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
All right.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Marika.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Um, moxie mean.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
It's the same container.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Same container.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
So like a jar of sorts.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
But in it's just a bunch of different.

36:59.000 --> 37:03.000
Uh, slips of paper with insults or

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
encouragement for you.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
So you can pull one out.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
And it just you got to be meaner.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
More aggressively.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
And like more confidently.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
That's not a bad idea.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
That's not like almost like a party game.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Yeah.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Could be a party game.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
I'm willing to change that.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Yeah.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Because I'm I take criticism well.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
And I'm willing to accept notes on my ideas.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
A lot of celebrities say that you can't believe the good press unless you.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Fuck.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Let's just move on.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Snuggie.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
Classic as seen on TV product.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
What if it was the druggy?

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
So it's a snuggie.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Same product.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
But it kind of gets you high.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
So you burn it.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
And it's made of hemp.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Yes.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Yes.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Yes.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Yes.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
So by the.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
And fire fire alarm going off again.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
By the way.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Yeah.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
That was a fun.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
He's burn it.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
You burn it while it's on.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
I made a prototype.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
It's on fire.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
I was test.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
Never much.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
I'm going to cut this out.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
But I was saying I was testing it in the Bronx.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
No.

38:12.000 --> 38:17.000
I'm going to go blue with my idea.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
It's called the Tuggy.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
And we know.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
We know that.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
They got it.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Rica.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
You didn't let me finish.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
Yeah.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Let them finish here.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Let's do it.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
All right.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
It's a snuggie with a glory hole.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
All right.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Let's move on.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Obviously.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Yeah.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
There are no laws and ooze for any of us.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Is it still.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
It's still a glory hole.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
If it's in a blanket.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
I think so.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
It's a story hole.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
Because you can kind of get off well.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
You're in a bedtime story.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Oh, God.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
What?

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
That was just a call map.

39:01.000 --> 39:06.000
All right.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
Let's move on.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Yeah.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
You can just skip me.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
No one's going to top Johnny's idea.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
Yeah.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
All right.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
Let's move on.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
The of glove.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
Okay.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
Placing an oven mitt that fits over your entire hand.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
I'm thinking the love glove.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
Yeah.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
And I'm thinking maybe I mean because the same.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
Thought processes the tuggy because it's a reusable oven mitts.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
Like text glove for anal play.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
It's me.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
How does this.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
Mitt.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
It.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
Not only inside of you, but also.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
A bird is only.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
A bird is only.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
It's like an Italian top of the line.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Oh, and range.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
I have no answer.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
I do.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
But I think it's a good idea.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Just.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
I do have an idea.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Yeah.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
It can still be called the of glove.

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
And essentially it's a companion to the druggy.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Oh.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
A companion to the druggy.

40:12.000 --> 40:19.000
It's a companion to the druggy which also is the tuggy.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
So the druggy.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
The druggy is a hole in it.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
And while that's burning.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
You cover.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
You cover yourself with the glove.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Okay.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
To protect your most sacred words.

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
That's really good.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
Because now we're thinking in terms of monopolies.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Vertical integration.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
That's right.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
I just heard on podcast.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
That's good.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
No, yeah.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
I don't know.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
I think the.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Yeah.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Some sort of integration with the tuggy is great.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
That's good.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
All right.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
Thinking the shove glove.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Oh.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
All right.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Oh.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
My.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
I had a bad idea.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
I thought you were just going to go to me.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
But the shop.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
I said I shove glove.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
It's a.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
Yeah.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
It's like a brass knuckles.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
But only for pushing people.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Is it.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Is it.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Does it have brass on it?

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Or does it look exactly like this?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
It looks exactly like the of glove.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
See how there's the rubber rubber lining.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Yeah.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
So like when push somebody.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
It's.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
Well, somebody it works.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
Your hands can kind of slip off.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
That way like you can.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Get some real traction.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Let's move on to the next thing.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
I mean, when they talk about entrepreneurship.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
They talk about finding like a gap in the market.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
How do you satisfy someone's need with a new product?

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
I just don't think people are going to buy gloves to shove people.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Because you never know when you're going to shove people.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Yeah.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
But isn't it nice to be prepared?

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
People buy guns.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
But they're they're not like looking over their shoulder.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Every every day.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Every waking moment of little lives.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Yeah.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
Yeah.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
Yeah.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
I think it's a good argument.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
What are people in the shop?

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
But for guns.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
You can go to my shop with a shove glove.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Oh, yeah.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Maybe if everyone had that Travis Scott concert had a shove glove.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Think about it.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Think about it.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Think about it.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
All right.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
The fairer gun.

42:18.000 --> 42:24.000
This is really as seen on TV.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
And I knew you would say that.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Let's just act like it is.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
There are gun.

42:30.000 --> 42:36.000
What's the idea that you've prepared in order to say that fairer gun is an

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
as seen on TV product.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
They're a stun.

42:40.000 --> 42:47.000
Personal massager that can also act as a self defense item.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Okay.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Issue with the prototype that I have concocted.

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
Is that it's hard to tell when it's in stun mode or massage mode?

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
Hmm.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Yeah.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
You should get that fixed.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Yeah.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
We would fix it.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
We went to market.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Okay.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
You should fix it during the prototyping phase.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
No.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
Let me show you.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
You die.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
Let's do some ideas.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Come on.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
So.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
It's called the tuggy.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
Yeah.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
Instead of the massager, it's just a flashlight.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Oh.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Oh.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
That's a good one.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Is there a weight?

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Can we do a dildo version of that too?

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Of course.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
This is just my shark tank on.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Okay.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Then I want to buy your whole company.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Wow.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
America.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Where are you?

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
There's only so much you can do with those.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Is that a pretty good product?

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Or it's a stun gun.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
Alright.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Alright.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
My pillow.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
Uh.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
My zilla.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
It's a pillow that you can browse houses on.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
The gap in the market is you.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Yeah.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
Yeah.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Right now, I'll be in bed late at night.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
Can't fall asleep.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
And I'm like, well, let me see what the market's like in Boseman.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
And I open zillow.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
And I'm like, damn.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
Like, you know how much nicer'd be if I just could have my face in the pillow and be browsing.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
So it's almost a VR headset.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
But the only capability is zillow.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Hmm.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
You just to put your head in the pillow?

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
It's.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Well, so it would basically be like the middle of the pillow would be hollowed out.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
And there'd be like, uh, uh, uh, uh, is it or a note?

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
What, what's the fucking the VR headset that it really is?

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Oculus.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Oculus would be built.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
And we've partnered with Oculus.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
You put your head in to the pillow and into the Oculus.

44:44.000 --> 44:50.000
And, um, suddenly you're looking at a duplex in fucking Chad.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
That's kind of cool.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
Yeah.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Why stop at zillow?

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
Could it just be like a screen that you could.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
I mean, is it just a VR?

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Could not be like an alternate.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
You're not fucking getting it.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
It's only zillow.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
Okay.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Okay.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
Because you don't want too many distractions when you're in bed.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Hmm.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
Like, you know, I think all of us have a kind of messed up relationship with sleep because we're on our phones.

45:19.000 --> 45:26.000
So you're thinking that having zillow access to zillow on a pillow is going to be less distracting for you to go to bed.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
How's that any different than a nicotine law zinge?

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
It's going to help people get away from, you know, let's say you open your laptop.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
You open your phone to zillow.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
You're look.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
You say, I'm only going to look at a couple of houses that I'm going to go to sleep.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
Then you get a text.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Then you're going to email.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Then you see a video on YouTube.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Suddenly you're browsing for another two and a half hours.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
This would be a way to not only wean people off of,

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
being on their phones and laptops and screens and bed,

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
but also find them a new place to rest their head.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
My zillow.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
It's a terrible idea.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
And there's no real gap in the market.

46:05.000 --> 46:10.000
Whatever gap in the market, you're thinking of is facetious for sure.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
All right.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
How many ideas?

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
I do.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
And this is actually a pretty good one.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
So they can have an offshoot of this called Sky Pillow.

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
And it's designed specifically for when you're flying in an airplane.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
That's good.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
Thank you.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Your plane pillows are important.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
Mm-hmm.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
Maybe huge.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
Okay.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
So just because you don't see a gap in the market,

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
doesn't mean there is no gap.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Well, they already have the neck pillows.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
Yeah.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
It's just my pillow neck edition.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
No sky pillow.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Sky pillow.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
Sky.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
Sky.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
It's pretty good.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Also, I think they should call it your pillow.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Because I see this guy.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
Oh, it's his pillow.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Yeah, he is holding it like it says.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
Yeah.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Jake.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
Wrong.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
So wrong.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
How long have you been waiting on that?

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Too late.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
I respond.

47:09.000 --> 47:14.000
Perfect product.

47:14.000 --> 47:19.000
We just need a closer-up image of his face.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
Yeah.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
It's not enough.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
We need more pictures of his face.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
See?

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
On every side of the box.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Every facade.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
All right.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
Well, I have one.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
Okay.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Right pillow.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
So it's a pillow.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Fill both right.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
We convince everyone that that's like the new thing

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
in terms of like what a pillow can be filled with.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
Sure.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
And then once people are done using it,

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
they can just cook with the rifle hour.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
They can mill their own flower.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
Are you concerned about like mold or something?

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
Growing?

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
No.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
So close to your face for eight hours a day.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
She's not concerned.

48:01.000 --> 48:06.000
It's in plastic and then there's the pillow covering.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
But so you are liking that.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
It's going to be mold.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
And the way you've been in that is not replacing the ride,

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
but just putting it in plastic.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
It's air sealed.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
It's part of a rock.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
Oh.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
And then it's in plastic.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
And it's covered with something soft.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
You start a new pandemic.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
It's ripen a bag.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
All right.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
Scrub daddy.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Scrub daddy.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
The headquarters is in South Jersey.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
I passed it a lot.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
I love it.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Love this.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
Is that the highest res photo you could find?

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
It's like 20 low quality.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Yeah.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
I mean, no, but I didn't know it was this low.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
I just kind of opened in a new tab.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
What about the Scrub's daddy?

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
So it's a sponge shaped like Jeff Goldblum.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
All right.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
It's good.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
That's really good.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Thank you guys.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
Scrub duty.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Just for the toilet.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
That's good.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
It's easy to clean the toilet.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
Yeah.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Scrub daddy.

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
It's an aloof for all the bad bitches out there.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Nice.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Scrub daddy for boys.

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
The bad dudes.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
We're all the bad boys out there.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Scrub daddy.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
For the grill.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
For the Irishman in your life.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
For the Irishman in your life.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
But just a four leaf clover.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
That's that's good.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
Yeah.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
And you'll use it for cleaning potatoes.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
It's only made of natural products and fibers.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
I like Scrub daddy a lot.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
Yeah.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
Scrub daddy's good.

50:03.000 --> 50:08.000
Because you need to eat those things to clean off your potatoes and vegetables and stuff like that.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
When you can get them.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
That's an Irish potato.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
Yeah.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
And there we go.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
Swaddy party.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
What about the squaddy naughty?

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
So it's a leg rest that gets you off on the John.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
Ow.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
Ow.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Ow.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
I think we can integrate the there a go.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Idea that.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
A leg.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
So the leg.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
You're matching everyone's legs.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
They're a rodginess zones.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
And they want that.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Oh, they're going to the bathroom.

50:41.000 --> 50:46.000
I was imagining more that like there'd be a mechanism attached to the squaddy naughty that would integrate.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
And again, this is vertical integration.

50:48.000 --> 50:54.000
Micah's version of the Theragon that it acts as a flesh light that's motorized and or a dildo.

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
And for those most adventurous out there, you could do both at once.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
So you put your legs up on the squaddy naughty.

51:00.000 --> 51:08.000
Suddenly the squaddy naughty enters you and you get getting off at work because you can't focus otherwise.

51:08.000 --> 51:18.000
I just feel like I need to write down the mechanics of this a little bit because it's got to putty.

51:18.000 --> 51:23.000
You rest your feet on it, but you're saying you put your legs on it while you're on the toilet.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
Correct.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
So where is the where's the Theragon integration?

51:28.000 --> 51:37.000
So there'd be kind of a rod that pops up here that you're sort of straddling with two things on a rotating.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
It's not like rotating.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
It definitely should have.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
We'll have engineers.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
We'll have engineers.

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
The rotating is as you you'll press a button here on the squaddy party.

51:46.000 --> 51:53.000
And then that kind of puts into place based on what parts you have to see if you want the dildo in front.

51:53.000 --> 52:01.000
If you want to in back, if you don't want it at all, if you want the flashlight on your member or rubbing up against any other of your parts.

52:01.000 --> 52:11.000
And but my my vision for it if used correctly would be rod dildo flashlight squaddy not be.

52:11.000 --> 52:19.000
Your legs are already up in an add attention up and at a sponsored by Adam and Eve sold in the Adam and Eve store.

52:19.000 --> 52:24.000
You've given this so much thought like you have a mental blueprint.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
The blueprint for this machine.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Why do you think I'm always going to the bathroom at work?

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
I'm thinking about shit.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
Go it.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Everybody goes to the bathroom.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
You do spend a lot of time in the bathroom.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
Yes.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
Thinking shit.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
Okay.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
And testing out product types.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
How is this going to be like a silent profit?

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
That is the issue.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
That is the issue.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
That's the hurdle.

52:52.000 --> 52:57.000
Also I feel like the I feel like the fair again.

52:57.000 --> 53:02.000
Things should be part of the toilet kind of like the like a bidet.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
You know what I mean?

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
Right.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
And so instead of having a rod.

53:07.000 --> 53:13.000
I'm not trying to get into the toilet game.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I'm trying to get into the squatty party game.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
You could I mean it could be like a Tushie situation.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
You're not trying to get into the toilet game.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
It's a toilet accessory.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
All right.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
Well, you know what?

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
This is why we we go.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
If you weren't trying to get into the toilet game,

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
you picked the wrong private.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
Yeah.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
All right.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Then I like this idea actually a lot.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
So it'll be the squatty naughty.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
It comes with the squatty naughty.

53:36.000 --> 53:40.000
And then also a Tushie like accessory that you do have to put under the toilet seat.

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
That includes the Theragon dildo addition and the Theragon flesh light addition.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
You're getting fucked and milked on the squatty naughty.

53:47.000 --> 53:56.000
Well, you know, one of our biggest fucking buyers might be in bulk.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Spirmed donation centers.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
Exactly right.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Because I don't know if you guys have ever tried to donate sperm.

54:01.000 --> 54:07.000
But it's really hard in a clinical environment to be excited about anything.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
And this makes it better.

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
She don't think the thinking is taken out of the equation.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
The squatty naughty does all the work.

54:17.000 --> 54:23.000
It doesn't, it doesn't take the, it takes like, it takes the excitement out of it.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
Yeah.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
Excitement's different from the act.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
And two separate things.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
You're just sitting on a toilet.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
I'm going to touch yourself this.

54:37.000 --> 54:42.000
Can I just pitch you by our slogan before you completely say no in the room?

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
Mm-hmm.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
Squatty naughty.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
Fill and be filled.

54:47.000 --> 54:51.000
I think you get like, fill of the future.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
Branded content going through the future.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
Disney show.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Because people love reboots.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
There's a fresh Prince of Bel Air drama series coming out.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
It's not.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
That's not real.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
That was a fan made trailer that.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
No, what's it?

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
It's an NBC show.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
No way.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
Maria, can you vouch for this?

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
No, it's HBO.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
I think.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
I'm pretty sure it's real.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Yeah, I think I saw this earlier today.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
God, what the hell?

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
Then we can definitely get fill of the future.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
To promote fill and be filled.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
Wow.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
That's a name, right?

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
Like, he's a real person.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
You want him to go back into character?

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
Yes.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
Yes.

55:29.000 --> 55:34.000
It does, it does feel like something that would have been invented during his time,

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
the 22nd century.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
Yeah.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
So let's get ahead of the game.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
Yeah.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
Fine.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
Do you guys have pictures for the squadty party?

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
Hot, Toddy party?

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
You stand up.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
Oh.

55:47.000 --> 55:52.000
And it's also a flask.

55:52.000 --> 55:55.000
Stand on it and it's a flask.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
How do you drink?

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
You got to pick it back up.

55:59.000 --> 56:04.000
It's not a, see, the squadty party is not attached to any kind of floor surface.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
Yeah.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
You can pick it back up.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
Take it with you.

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
But still, the purpose of it is still the squadty party.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
It just also was a flask on it.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Yeah.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
Got it.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
Yeah.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
And you're not concerned the fact that it's on the floor of a bathroom all day,

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
that you're going to be putting your lips to it and drinking from it?

56:21.000 --> 56:26.000
I mean, we've survived this long with COVID going around.

56:26.000 --> 56:31.000
I think that we can, our bodies can handle pretty much anything at this point.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
Yeah, I guess you can brush off any safety concern that way.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
We're all in here, aren't we?

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
I guess.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
There's got that sign on set.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Shouldn't have gone that way.

56:43.000 --> 56:49.000
I feel, can I, can I offer another option for the hot,

56:49.000 --> 56:53.000
toady party, which I guess is, is not going to involve alcohol,

56:53.000 --> 56:57.000
but it's a squadty party with like a straw situation.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
So you can sit on something and maybe you're sitting on like,

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
pediliter gatorade because you're sitting on the toilet for so long.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
You don't need to be hydrate.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
Where is the pedilite coming from?

57:08.000 --> 57:15.000
I, you, you essentially are screwing a bottle under the squadty party.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
With the Australia lights.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
We do have to say that pedilite bottles kind of,

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
they're like 14 inches tall probably in the spot.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Yeah, I think it's like eight.

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
So it will be a squadty party.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Yeah.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
I think it's better for a better pit.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
Wait, you're tall, you miss, totally.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
I mean, we don't even have to stand the bottle up right.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
You can kind of tilt it.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Yeah, horizontally.

57:43.000 --> 57:47.000
So you can also sell our own version of pedilite.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
So now we're tapping into a new market,

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
but it comes in a pouch.

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
Pody and it's basically like save a salt water.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
It's like a bladder that you put under there.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
Oh, yeah.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
And it's refrigerated.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
And then for the more decolocketed customers,

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
they could even have, you know, like richer people have like well water.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
It could be like well pedilite,

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
pody lights, all right.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
And so like you basically like twice a year,

58:11.000 --> 58:15.000
someone comes and refills this like 18 gallon thing of pedilite

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
that's subterranean and connects to the squadty party.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
Yeah.

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
Did you just come up with pody a light or was that said?

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
Johnny said that.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
Johnny said it.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
It's really good.

58:25.000 --> 58:30.000
I said rich people have well water, but I have a good story

58:30.000 --> 58:34.000
that is just my dad goes to an old plantation

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
and gets well water to drink from it.

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
I don't know, I'd down.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
Just to drink.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Why doesn't he get a brida?

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
He likes well water.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Said it tastes better.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
All right.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
We got to have your dad on this show because he's kind of become a staple

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
past three weeks.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
He's cool, but he shouldn't be on the show.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
You don't want to give him a platform now.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
All right.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Well, we do have to wrap things up here.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Thank you guys for your notes on my ideas.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
I think you guys brought some amazing ideas to the table.

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
And I think maybe we'll try and see if we can get some funding for one of these.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
I think maybe the best one we came up with is the squadty.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
Probably the squadty party.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
The one that Marie could just come up with or the squadty naughty.

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
I think maybe you take both of those to market and see what we're doing.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
Because it's really good.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
I think the squadty naughty was perfect.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
Not for life or better term.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
It was just not.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
That's not a great idea.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
Because you're kind of like, you're one of the naughty or people I know.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
And in terms of like getting fucked and fucking.

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
I feel like you would enjoy that experience.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
As what I.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
There's a gap.

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
This would ruin my relationship with sex.

59:44.000 --> 59:50.000
In what way exactly.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
I'd be violated on my toilet.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
It's the most vulnerable.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
I feel like on a daily basis.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
But then you by comparison when you're in an actual sex sexual scenario with a partner,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
you wouldn't feel as vulnerable.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
So you'd be able to feel more confident.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
More aware of your body.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Because you're not on the party.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
That's not how that's going to work.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Yeah.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
There's no way.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I think I think also the drug eat tuggy of.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
It gets you high off.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And protects your junk.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Oh.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Plugs.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
What do we got going on?

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
What do you guys want to point the people to?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
You don't have to plug anything.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Sometimes we go around the horn.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
It takes another five minutes.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Just chime in if you have something.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
For us all of your guys is a job.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
You're you're living on.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
So.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
If people are listening to this show and Brooklyn in New York,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
over there.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Yeah.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Don't.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
You're eyes lit up as you said.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Go over there.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Yeah.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
You would love to have you.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
At least in New York.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
I have some level of protection.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Because there's and I mean, I only say level of protection because there's a lot of people that want to get to me to harm me because of how I can look myself on the show.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
In LA, I live in a house with you know.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
It's not protected in any way.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
We have a super who smoke cigarettes in the hallway.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Yeah.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
That's probably smoke alarm is going helpful.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Probably.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Probably.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
You do feel more secure in an apartment than a house.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
That's true.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Yeah.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
But not as baller.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Depends on the apartment.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Yeah.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
What about a house?

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
There's a Nick Rads apartment.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
That's right.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
That's the comparison.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
The moon light.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
It's crazy.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Instagram.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
That's it.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Yeah.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
That's it.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000

Jake's been doing this podcast.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
He's your brother.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
You guys are like best friends for like eight years.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Do you give a shit?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
About the podcast.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Yeah.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
It's not for you guys.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I'm not telling you to watch the podcast.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I'm telling the people are listening to this because they found out who we are through

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Jake and who we are to go watch their podcast.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Separate question.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Michael, do you give a shit?

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
About what?

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
About Jake's shit.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Yeah.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
It's awesome.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Yeah.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
It's awesome.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Yeah.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
It's awesome.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
You said that Jake and Michael knew each other for eight years.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Yeah.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
They've known each other all their lives.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Jake, Mike, I went to fucking college and California for four years.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Why don't you probably have strange?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Really?

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Fuck.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
I can't do anything right on this show.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000
At you, every jam's on Instagram at Jeff Beardy on Twitter.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Marika, why don't you take us home today?

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I don't want to.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:49.000
That was a hit dumb original.

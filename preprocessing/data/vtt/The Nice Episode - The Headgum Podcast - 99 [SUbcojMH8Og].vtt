00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.560
Thank you to diet smoke for sponsoring this episode of our show guys you know my problem

00:10.560 --> 00:16.560
with cannabis edibles sometimes you get way too high it can really be difficult to control

00:16.560 --> 00:20.360
the dose it out right there's nothing worse than being baked out of your mind when you

00:20.360 --> 00:24.200
didn't plan on it and you know once you eat it there's no going back you just sit there

00:24.200 --> 00:29.560
suffering stone out of your mind that's why when I need the perfect medium high I hit

00:29.560 --> 00:35.960
up my friends at diet smoke for their delicious Delta 8 THC gummies diet smoke isn't

00:35.960 --> 00:41.400
light it's just right so what exactly is Delta 8 well Delta 8 is simply a less potent

00:41.400 --> 00:46.080
THC the THC you're probably most familiar with is Delta 9 and while both are natural

00:46.080 --> 00:51.280
to the cannabis plant diet smoke extracts their Delta 8 from hemp some may call this

00:51.280 --> 00:55.960
alupole I call it the secret recipe to getting a smooth stable and most importantly

00:55.960 --> 01:00.640
legal high diet smoke is legal in most states and it's non-prescription just check

01:00.640 --> 01:04.360
diet smoke's website to see if they ship their delicious gummies to your state now

01:04.360 --> 01:08.920
you're probably asking yourself this diet smoke really gets you high of course the

01:08.920 --> 01:12.680
high you get with diet smoke is best described is somewhere between the chillness of CBD

01:12.680 --> 01:17.480
and that classic stone feeling you get with regular weed plus diet smoke comes in two

01:17.480 --> 01:21.720
delicious flavors blue raspberry and watermelon guys america can't get enough for the

01:21.720 --> 01:27.560
water melon I say try I'm both so when CBD isn't enough and traditional THC is too much

01:27.560 --> 01:32.280
and joy the smooth buzz of diet smoke each gummy isn't fused with 10 milligrams of Delta

01:32.280 --> 01:36.760
8 THC drive from american grown hemp and you know what they say by american get high with

01:36.760 --> 01:42.280

it wasn't a big thing Caleb called me nobody's ever done this by the way this is how I behave yeah

04:39.080 --> 04:43.880
which I kind of got as you're doing it it didn't feel like it I was going yeah at 11

04:43.880 --> 04:47.240
I got a call from Caleb being like what are you doing right now do you want to get lunch and I was like

04:47.240 --> 04:54.120
no one's ever done this yeah yeah um and no one's ever invited you to land no one's ever

04:54.120 --> 05:00.360

05:00.360 --> 05:05.240
and it was a lot of fun time which combo which combo shout out ended up with the farmer's market

05:05.240 --> 05:10.760
is he shout out shout out shout out to some very farmer's market shout out to trying to park

05:10.760 --> 05:15.160
and silver lake on a Saturday or what day was Sunday I don't know today was hard because it's a Friday

05:15.160 --> 05:20.760
and it's street sweeping street so they have a lot at the studio that you can use

05:21.320 --> 05:25.800
well I knew there's two guests and then we have two producers so I wanted to give this

05:25.800 --> 05:29.640

05:42.600 --> 05:46.920
some of these we have do not keep mine better not be repeats they'll go ahead sorry yeah no worries

05:47.080 --> 05:53.000
I actually want to no worries no genuinely no worries yeah it's not worries I mean it's the

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
no worries episode more than anything yeah Caleb is quite honestly one of the most talented

05:57.000 --> 06:07.720
people I know and I think his work ethic has been like a big learning like a learning thing for me

06:07.720 --> 06:14.360
to be around the nice episode David that's so sweet of you to say that's really sweet do you

06:14.360 --> 06:20.440
want to give one for Jeff Jeff is honestly very charming

06:20.440 --> 06:24.840
honestly you hate to give it to him because you even on the nice episode

06:24.840 --> 06:29.320
extremely charming and I think most people that meet Jeff are like I like this guy

06:29.320 --> 06:33.240
some people really don't like me I don't think that's true I don't think it's true there's some

06:33.240 --> 06:37.400
people in the war in like our spheres who dislike me it's wrong I don't think they don't find

06:37.400 --> 06:41.560
I don't think they know you I would also agree with that because actually yeah

06:41.720 --> 06:46.520
friend of mine I think didn't like me because of in then now we're good friends

06:46.520 --> 06:50.680
to know Jeff is to like Jeff yes insecurities biggest insecurities oh this is really good

06:50.680 --> 06:58.440
and nobody did my cheers but oh Jeff is to love Jeff I fully didn't recognize like

06:58.440 --> 07:05.640
none of what you just said registered with me you have that app from like 2008 with me like

07:06.280 --> 07:13.480
oh my god or the I have the lighter I was at a concert like a month ago and somebody

07:13.480 --> 07:18.600
congratulations thank you so much it meant a lot to me because music is well love and uh I

07:18.600 --> 07:25.560
got a ton of music is so long somebody brought a tea candle to like

07:25.560 --> 07:30.840
a cute thing yeah maybe they were limiting screen time that's cute they brought a tea candle

07:30.840 --> 07:34.760
and rock with that they brought well tea candle they went up they said oh baby I love you way

07:34.760 --> 07:38.680
and I crazy for thinking out well they had the little metal tenser on them usually

07:38.680 --> 07:45.880
metal which is a conductor I think my biggest insecurity is my lack of spatial awareness

07:46.600 --> 07:52.760
that's it yeah well it's like tied into like other stuff but I think that I there was I

07:52.760 --> 07:57.720
invited somebody who had a big crush on my house last summer and I was like

07:57.800 --> 08:04.040
what happened I was like she she had told me about uh one of her favorite cocktails and we

08:04.040 --> 08:09.320
have like a lime tree in our front yard so I was like I can make you that cocktail like

08:09.320 --> 08:14.280
with the lime and then like tried to pull a lime this is at a bonfire with like 10 people

08:14.280 --> 08:19.560
I like pull the lime but it like takes too much time and too much force to get it off the tree

08:19.560 --> 08:24.760
so that when I finally pops off I recoil and fall over a bench spilling her friends drink

08:25.080 --> 08:34.840
it's the nice episode so I'm sorry that that happens to yeah biggest insecurity

08:34.840 --> 08:40.360
well in lime with spatial awareness which is not my biggest insecurity it's maybe my least

08:42.360 --> 08:46.920
but do you ever hug someone and accidentally step on their toes that's one of the worst

08:46.920 --> 08:51.560
things to happen to me I hate that people don't do it to me I step on to like I'm the toast

08:51.560 --> 08:59.240
upper yeah I'm mistake my biggest insecurity is most of them yeah you have the big ones yeah

08:59.240 --> 09:02.520
yeah I got good good not gonna know people don't like being those kinds of things yeah

09:03.400 --> 09:09.720
mine is probably that I give too much your biggest insecurity is that you are too generous I think

09:09.720 --> 09:13.960
I'm like I'm like insecure I'm like oh am I giving too much because I'm always giving right and

09:13.960 --> 09:19.160
is the fear that people would be like ah like it's a little too much well yeah just that I'm

09:19.480 --> 09:21.320
I guess I fear pouring from an empty cup

09:39.320 --> 09:43.080
I really feel so free on the nice episode because I know I can't be far

09:44.040 --> 09:50.280
you know this is this is difficult you both already said things that I would have jumped

09:50.280 --> 09:58.760
down your throat for no worries let's let's keep it going with our bonds of the week

10:02.120 --> 10:08.680

10:09.000 --> 10:16.600

10:24.920 --> 10:25.720
Daniel McBride

10:29.400 --> 10:31.960
Daniel McBride would be an incredible bond I think of it

10:32.680 --> 10:39.720

10:40.920 --> 10:46.680
yeah I think it's yeah thanks guys I think casting would love to have a conversation about that

10:47.240 --> 10:51.560

13:46.840 --> 13:52.440
seafood restaurant mostly do you fish we should get you into seafood at least I've never

13:52.440 --> 13:57.320
what's he really wants to anything with you because I didn't know your dietary preferences well

13:57.320 --> 14:05.640
shall be recently became gay right and so there are a lot of changes going on for her right now so

14:05.640 --> 14:09.560
we might be able to get her into fish like sushi stuff like that soon because she's in an

14:09.560 --> 14:16.440
open-minded place right now my mom's been rungerance and she was 14 and for her 60th birthday

14:16.440 --> 14:31.480
crab legs queen damn damn yeah I like to do a you know create your own sort of experience

14:32.280 --> 14:39.320
so picnic you know that's really kind of it you like to do picnic as a first date yeah

14:40.120 --> 14:47.640
what's awesome I um yeah that's really creative and fun I think it's not for me probably because

14:48.680 --> 14:53.400
I don't want to sit on the ground that's fair yeah you have to have a certain

14:54.920 --> 14:59.800
you have to assume a flexibility of the partner and of your own to sit comfortably and

14:59.800 --> 15:10.280
attractively on the floor um while back I went on a date um and today I made a picnic

15:11.240 --> 15:16.840
and we ate it in my truck bed which again spatial awareness is bad getting in and out of a

15:16.840 --> 15:25.720
truck bed to get singria is well it's not looking too good for old Jeff was there padding down there was

15:26.360 --> 15:34.920
um there were blankets pillows did you guys hook up in the truck no you can be honest yeah

15:36.200 --> 15:43.640
really no I just really wanted to be cool on the nice episode no I think Jeff the picnic for you

15:43.640 --> 15:47.080
is a really good understanding of where we're in the straight man yeah

15:49.560 --> 15:53.240
I think where we are culturally with straight men it calls for picnics yeah something

15:53.240 --> 16:02.600
gentle and thoughtful you know it's needed do you guys love hard excuse me love hard

16:04.600 --> 16:09.560
yeah I'm afraid I don't understand what's being asked do you love harder do you love week

16:10.600 --> 16:17.560
oh we're talking about I can in the past how hard do you love do you love little bit or do you love a lot

16:18.520 --> 16:24.520
I mean I don't date so people in your life people in my life oh I think I love hard don't you think yeah

16:24.520 --> 16:34.840
that's what I was trying to guide you to yeah what about you Jeff um oh my boy has

16:34.840 --> 16:43.480
commitment issues no I I love hard I thought I'm the whole time I thought you're

16:43.480 --> 16:47.960
us and that's if we loved hard like hard was a restaurant or something or yeah hard doesn't

16:47.960 --> 16:52.360
come out like not like you actively like hard is it now not an adjective yeah in terms of hard

16:52.360 --> 16:59.240
do you love it yeah I mean it can be so powerful it's been coming context I think we're doing

16:59.240 --> 17:04.360
well being nice to each other I'm feeling good about settled into it yeah I do you guys think they

17:04.360 --> 17:10.760
like it no yeah yeah well I don't care what they want yeah this is about us in the room

17:10.760 --> 17:14.280
when you can I was curious what you thought about what they thought here's can I say something to

17:14.280 --> 17:19.400
the listeners yeah and can you just camera too um I'll probably do one because it's the one pointing

17:19.400 --> 17:29.240
at me I should say if you guys aren't liking the nice episode I really want you to look in

17:29.240 --> 17:33.640
word I want you to do some work around that because that's crazy this is really sweet and beautiful

17:33.640 --> 17:41.080
three friends for if you can't casey but which is up to you yeah that the a couple of friends

17:41.080 --> 17:46.760
be in good to each other man there's nothing like it yeah you don't get this anymore you don't see

17:46.760 --> 17:55.400
this anymore everything's politics and bickering let's take a step back let's speak it nice again

17:55.400 --> 18:07.160
hey anyway make America nice again keep in records let's talk about it that's podcast on

18:07.160 --> 18:13.000
ice it is my one of my favorite podcasts we have to say that no I don't I don't have to say that

18:14.280 --> 18:18.200
I know it's the nice episode but I just wouldn't have said anything okay we took down

18:18.200 --> 18:25.800
your guys's decorations but at the light up moons pretty cool on you in casey geniuses yeah

18:27.400 --> 18:32.760
it's been awesome to be back in the studio I'm realizing that some of our stuff is still up

18:32.760 --> 18:38.360
right well I think that's fine I just am realizing it like the Voyager picture I think it's good

18:38.920 --> 18:44.040
I think it's good too it's sort of a half and half between your guys' show and whatever this is

18:44.520 --> 18:49.960
this is headgum and we're on headgum well Caleb asked me this this morning before she'll be

18:49.960 --> 18:55.400
got here because she was late which is fine and I hold space for people yeah even though we did

18:55.400 --> 19:02.040
push 15 minutes we pushed 15 minutes because of not me right right but in your head when you woke

19:02.040 --> 19:06.840
up this morning but then I you gave me a little bit of extra time and this is the first time that

19:06.840 --> 19:11.480
I've sort of felt that push and pull of wanting to be rude no no I think it was cool I thought it

19:11.480 --> 19:19.080
was powerful even you did walk in a little bit like a rock star because of her sunglasses a little bit

and we're back to the nice episode of the headgon podcast episode ninety nine it's been beautiful

27:20.920 --> 27:27.240
yeah it's been really beautiful ninety nine and so damn fine ninety nine and so damn fine

27:27.240 --> 27:32.200
I I I really need you guys to respond to the email that I sent about the hundredth episode

27:32.200 --> 27:36.520
our spot don't know that I got it I'll forward it to you thank you that's friend

27:36.680 --> 27:42.680
so it's easy to be nice to you consider your friends anyways but I thought that we could kind

27:42.680 --> 27:49.000
of push the boundaries here a little bit who you consider just had a curiosity who do you

27:49.000 --> 27:56.920
things doing the considering because I would say just factually we are friends that's how I felt

27:56.920 --> 28:02.920
but now I'm feeling like you think that's the security coming out okay when you can see that

28:03.000 --> 28:06.600
when you can see that and people like forever you say just now that's just kidding coming out

28:06.600 --> 28:11.560
that change the whole thing for me yeah really yeah because before I was like why the fuck would

28:11.560 --> 28:17.800
Jeff say that but now I'm kind of like oh that's why Jeff said that I thought we could be nice to

28:17.800 --> 28:24.840
some people who it's even more difficult to be nice to great so I'm going to show a couple people

28:24.840 --> 28:32.440
okay don't look around man I didn't know if it was there um and we'll see how

28:34.440 --> 28:44.520
okay Dana White in a white who owns the UFC yeah um he has really created space for

28:44.520 --> 28:50.920
men who would otherwise probably be doing something worse and I mean that

28:51.560 --> 28:58.600
I mean not for both the fighters and the fans yeah I think the couple hours that he puts on a show

28:58.600 --> 29:05.000
for the fans those guys would be out you know doing stuff they shouldn't yeah the fighters and the

29:05.000 --> 29:08.760
fans all of them everyone who likes it would be doing some bad stuff to a lot of

29:08.760 --> 29:16.680
interesting stuff probably so good good job Dana White I think he's created a lane for people who

29:17.640 --> 29:24.360
by virtue of their line of work or just where they live have sort of tanned their skin to a hide

29:25.880 --> 29:30.920
and he's made it's not chic but like he at least there's this celebrity that you can point to

29:30.920 --> 29:34.600
and be like well you know at least I look like Dana White and I think if you're living in the

29:34.600 --> 29:45.240
places that make your skin look like that you're probably a fan okay I think men fighting was

29:45.240 --> 30:04.280
getting enough attention yeah different thing out of Baldwin it is so hard to know if a gun

30:04.680 --> 30:17.400
is loaded and that's what I want to say to Alec it's so hard to know and that vegan woman did miss

30:17.400 --> 30:27.400
you ultimately at the end she said Alec Baldwin is he the one that called his daughter a fat pig yep

30:28.360 --> 30:45.960
whether we like it or not that is funny I think that he he's he's he's he's taught me

30:45.960 --> 30:52.120
out of protect my privacy because the way that he interacts with paparato is second to none

30:53.080 --> 31:00.680
just anger right off the bat sort of using their own words against them to justify his anger

31:00.680 --> 31:05.400
so when somebody will come up to me and be like hey like the podcast or like the sketches you know

31:05.400 --> 31:09.880
I'll just find a way to kind of get them out of my face and then we're just way possible but

31:09.880 --> 31:17.080
it's only to protect my privacy which is important to me that's awesome that's awesome that's

31:17.160 --> 31:23.240
Ellen degenerates Ellen degenerates it's not hard to be nice to her at all she legitimately

31:24.440 --> 31:29.560
paved a massive path for queer people and that can never be taken from her and she let gay people be mean again

31:29.560 --> 31:35.080
yeah gay people used to be mean and it was awesome and then when they said then it was like oh no

31:35.080 --> 31:39.080
gay people are so nice and fun and then she came along and it was like wait we can be mean

31:39.080 --> 31:43.080
oh gay people are like docile little like they like you're trying to go shopping with no gay people

31:43.720 --> 31:49.800
away for gay people to be on daytime television she paved away for gay people to be really

31:49.800 --> 31:55.800
unlikable yeah nightmares which is how it used to be and it was iconic yeah i say bring it back thank you Ellen

31:56.600 --> 31:58.600
it's not fire

32:00.120 --> 32:03.720
pretty cool I nailed that no by the way let out can't do it

32:04.360 --> 32:17.320
no I thought his cartoonish performance in house of Gucci was legitimately transcendent it was

32:17.320 --> 32:21.720
camp I yeah I didn't see that movie but I heard that every scene he had a different regional

32:21.720 --> 32:25.720
telling acts yeah and it was camp yeah so all the things this picture looks like Courtney Cox

32:25.720 --> 32:33.320
and dragging that's exactly right yeah not enough face work though I think that he she took a lot of

32:33.320 --> 32:43.720
that down she's like stop doing a lot of it okay good for her she needed to yeah I think that

32:43.720 --> 32:50.120
he this looks a lot like her now like really like sort of like whoa I check the thumbnail

32:51.160 --> 32:58.680
title is Courtney Cox does drag um I think that he is he well he lives in a missile

32:58.760 --> 33:05.480
silo and moral canyon a former military base and I think that well when you look at him that's

33:05.480 --> 33:09.640
reads his scary I think if any one of us did that it would be awesome have you been to his place

33:09.640 --> 33:17.560
no it's really cool what he has not been I have no there's no way I have we'll talk about

33:17.560 --> 33:21.240
off the path I can't get too much into it but basically I think if you had you would want to get into it

33:21.240 --> 33:25.240
I can't on the path it's I signed an NDA you signed an NDA to go to his missile site

33:25.240 --> 33:36.760
about what happened in there okay Jared Leto has a way of looking that is so unique to him

33:37.800 --> 33:43.960
I think 30 seconds to Mars isn't isn't a bad band I don't know even that he's in that

33:44.520 --> 33:52.440
way Michelle Liam Michelle I don't remember why she got in so much trouble recently

33:53.160 --> 33:59.480
and that is nice that's good for her yeah yeah it's good for her I think she can sing

34:01.720 --> 34:07.080
pretty good can you do your best Liam Michelle no what's it

34:14.200 --> 34:23.080
I saw that exactly like image and heat by mistake she bullied her coha stars ungly yeah they were all

34:23.080 --> 34:29.640
kind of like she wasn't that nice to us oh because one of them no that's something else no one of

34:29.640 --> 34:33.480
them died well the fact that I didn't well more than many of them have died the fact that one of them

34:33.480 --> 34:41.480
died drowning yes who died drowning no yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then

34:41.480 --> 34:47.800
Corey Monty yeah and then the other one well the other one I think what to present but then I thought he died

34:47.800 --> 34:53.160
well yeah if you'd had told me that the nice episode would have been included just a retrospective

34:53.160 --> 34:58.680
of dead Liam cast members I wouldn't I would have started with that well you started

34:58.680 --> 35:02.360
to the truth in the nice episode yeah and they did all die and they did all die

35:02.360 --> 35:18.760
crap Aaron Rogers Aaron Rogers boy can he throw a spiral boy he can really play the game

35:18.760 --> 35:30.120
he can play ball and he's creative Dr Rose I can't endorse his political affiliations at this time

35:30.200 --> 35:38.040
what about yeah I've never seen the show drifted I mean he's a gritty he's he's about his

35:38.040 --> 35:43.080
paper he scammed he scammed his bed at the top you got to give him that that's true hey he owns more

35:43.080 --> 35:47.080
houses than I do I'll give him that did you know how many houses he said well I don't know any so

35:47.080 --> 35:56.760
I'm assuming he's one yeah that was it that was a long segment I think we did our best there's a

35:56.760 --> 36:08.360
really long segment full steam ahead it's time to play one of my new favorite games

36:17.640 --> 36:25.320
welcome to nice or nah that is nice I think so so you don't even need the

36:26.280 --> 36:31.080
the rules of the game oh give us the rules for the listeners yeah yeah so it's based nicer

36:31.080 --> 36:38.760
nah is basically I show a photo of a rock and you guys have to say whether it's nice G and E I S S or

36:38.760 --> 36:45.800
nah yeah great this one the first one you said it is yeah that's gonna be absolutely correct by the way

36:45.800 --> 36:52.360
this is for actual cash here we go again so last time we were on the pod Jeff then mode me like $1,200

36:53.320 --> 36:57.880

36:57.880 --> 37:03.400

and I know I put out 35 rocks and you had to go around and be like good to name the fucking thing yeah

37:29.240 --> 37:32.760
I couldn't believe geology classes the hardest class I took in college I couldn't believe I had a

37:32.760 --> 37:37.000
why did they call it rocks for jox things it's supposed to be the easiest science class and it was not

37:37.000 --> 37:43.560
it was not it's like the professor found that out what's like that my professor was obsessed

37:43.560 --> 37:49.640
making inappropriate jokes he really wanted to be a comedian and he he they were bad like he

37:49.640 --> 37:55.400
like he in he he also by the time I got to him had obviously gotten in trouble a lot so he would be like

37:55.400 --> 37:59.400
he'd be like yeah what do you what do you call it like he would like make a joke about like a woman's

37:59.400 --> 38:03.480
like breasts or something and then he'd be like he'd be like all right now if you guys didn't like that

38:03.480 --> 38:12.280

39:10.440 --> 39:15.240
nice nice no no no that's my own personal I have to be nice and say how I'm feeling okay this one's nice

39:17.800 --> 39:30.360
it's not nice yes oh here we go okay it's gorgeous that's just it's gorgeous that is

39:30.360 --> 39:38.200
oh that's gorgeous is that we said correct here we go yeah yeah you think this is you think this

39:38.200 --> 39:42.360
is nice no I don't but I'm thinking I'm trying to do reverse psychology on myself this is nice

39:43.480 --> 39:53.400
that's correct that is gonna be nice and here we go that is not nice that's a diamond

39:54.280 --> 40:00.760
in the rough I think some people would say Jeff segments go on for too long but I wouldn't I would say

40:01.720 --> 40:06.040
I would say don't say that about my friend Jeff they go on just as long as they're supposed to

40:06.040 --> 40:09.480
that's why I would say to anybody out there who's thinking that when I think of yeah when I think

40:09.480 --> 40:14.600
of the games Jeff puts together I think he worked hard this is the closest we've come

40:15.320 --> 40:22.040
to being that nice no how do you feel how do you mean feel I said you put in the work

40:24.280 --> 40:30.440
I actually feel fine we I think we did it I think that we were you know how much time

40:30.440 --> 40:40.920
to even have we've done minutes left yeah Jeff for me Jeff for me the first episode you guys

40:40.920 --> 40:44.520
were on was one of my favorite of all time I'm not saying I don't like this one I just am saying

40:44.520 --> 40:48.600
that I can't comment on it because I haven't what is your what is your guys is what is your

40:48.760 --> 40:54.760
guys's favorite like podcast episode you've ever done that's a really good question can you think

40:54.760 --> 40:57.720
and and no one's gonna get mad I know there's a bunch that you could pick but like what is the

40:57.720 --> 41:01.960
one that you think of I'll say everyone gets two if you give you a minute you can say two you start

41:01.960 --> 41:07.880
okay I will go first my my favorite keeping records I have to have one of those in there my favorite

41:07.880 --> 41:12.840
keeping records is probably for pure chaos sake the best out in this episode because Beth gets a

41:12.840 --> 41:17.560
fucking delivery in the middle and it's okay and she doesn't do what a normal person would do

41:17.560 --> 41:22.280
she like it nor is the delivery until after she like takes us with her off to the bed bring

41:22.280 --> 41:25.560
the computer so if you've never heard keeping records listen to the best telling it that's telling

41:25.560 --> 41:30.840
great episode or a non keeping records podcast I did that I had a blast with was when I

41:30.840 --> 41:35.720
guessed it on all fantasy everything that was a very good episode that was a super fun podcast episode

41:35.720 --> 41:42.360
yeah you guys did diners we did uh buff build on buffet buffet yeah buffet plate was a great

41:42.360 --> 41:47.560
one to do yeah anyway well that was to be trying to hold in a sneeze so you might want to go

41:48.360 --> 41:53.960
okay Jeff why don't you go ahead and go I think my favorite episode of the headgon podcast

41:53.960 --> 42:00.840
we've ever done is we did this series called the audit where we fabricated this entire back story

42:00.840 --> 42:06.200
that I got in a big argument on a company me didn't like zoom call with a mirror and that he

42:06.200 --> 42:10.920
wasn't speaking to me and so I thought that if I had if we audited the show on how I could be

42:10.920 --> 42:15.400
come a better host in person that maybe he would come back to the show yeah and the first episode

42:15.400 --> 42:20.680
was with my good friend Zack done one of the funniest people I've ever met uh great TV writer

42:20.680 --> 42:29.160
and he shout out Zack done you got it I'm just shouting about he uh he he liked this bit where he

42:29.240 --> 42:34.840
was like he was being the auditor and he kept like being this tertiary character and then he

42:34.840 --> 42:39.880
would just be extra out and then he would like audited it but then he kept adding these other like even

42:39.880 --> 42:48.440
what's the fourth version of tertiary doesn't matter pretty quiet quadratac maybe quadratac

42:48.440 --> 42:53.320
yeah um what where there was an auditor and auditors apprentice and then he kept like we kept

42:53.320 --> 42:57.640
rotating and it was just it was chaos and it was but it was organized chaos in the most fun way

42:57.720 --> 43:03.960
love that um and then I'm trying to think of one that I've guessed it on um

43:07.080 --> 43:12.200
oh actors on actors on actors, Kelly Brick means show uh Riley and I went on that and we were playing

43:12.200 --> 43:17.720
uh brothers directors, brother directors and they were just super fun to improvise with

43:17.720 --> 43:21.640
brother directors, brothers directors, brothers directors, brothers directors, brothers directors,

43:21.640 --> 43:29.880
but it's John and Brian director, oh, shall we? um that's telling wood of maybe

43:29.880 --> 43:34.600
been on my list but because you took it I'm gonna go samurai, yeah great episode, great episode,

43:34.600 --> 43:39.880
samurai makes me laugh so hard in that episode that I'm gonna find these people alive like

43:39.880 --> 43:46.120
almost had to like turn off the mic for a second to gather um so if you have a listen,

43:46.200 --> 43:52.280
samurai be at um and then I'm trying to think of like a recent one that I've done that I've loved

43:53.480 --> 43:59.720
and I'm like recently we've been doing so many together we have um and I had a lot of

43:59.720 --> 44:05.480
fun on newcomers yes oh that was a fun one that was really fun you were very funny on that

44:05.480 --> 44:11.160
hasn't got yet what season is it again marvel marvel what movie did you guys watch

44:11.480 --> 44:18.200
and man I even excited for that episode the first marvel movie I think I'm seeing yes the first

44:18.200 --> 44:23.880
one I've ever seen can we y'all do with the third yeah of course a lapka's came on review review

44:23.880 --> 44:30.280
the day trump lost the election oh and we all pop champagne and that was super that was a

44:30.280 --> 44:35.320
fun day yeah Caleb and I were driving back from big bear that day yeah we drew back early because

44:35.320 --> 44:38.760
everyone was partying in the streets and then we went to the gas station oh you know we did

44:38.840 --> 44:43.720
one on sunset no we went to Hillhurst Hillhurst gas station Hillhurst with yeah everybody was

44:43.720 --> 44:48.600

44:48.600 --> 44:53.880
just shaking her ass on a you all on top of you all yes yes Cecilia it was I it was also because I

44:53.880 --> 44:58.280
kept seeing people I knew which I've never had that experience like you kind of see people when you're

44:58.280 --> 45:03.320
driving sometimes this day everyone in LA was every one when you knew and everyone you knew in LA was

45:03.320 --> 45:07.720
right where you were at yeah I saw I mean that day I must have seen we came back from a big bear

45:07.800 --> 45:13.720
we drove immediately to the gas station on Hillhurst that it was Hillhurst and most feel it for

45:13.720 --> 45:20.200
these the everyone was you were at what do everyone was there it's just people were honking people

45:20.200 --> 45:24.760
were like hanging out the windows holding fucking like pride flags and she was kind of cars got

45:24.760 --> 45:29.000
wrecked because they were dancing on top of them too hard yeah it really in there's the other

45:29.000 --> 45:34.200
funny thing about all this is it wasn't that Joe Biden won yeah nothing was the trump loss that's

45:35.160 --> 45:40.040
like it's you celebrate him losing you don't celebrate in auguration no we didn't sell we weren't

45:40.040 --> 45:50.600
celebrating Joe Biden yeah we were dancing on a grave yeah thank you I've I've never been so excited

45:50.600 --> 45:56.120
to be in standstill traffic too I didn't want to move I mean we were listening to some ultimately

45:56.120 --> 46:12.360
Republican music I think at one point we were just listening to the star-spangled Banner

46:15.640 --> 46:23.160
we're like fuck he's out we were like this country banks I literally woke up the next day

46:23.160 --> 46:27.720
with like I've never had so much shame yeah I was like I was like I was like did I celebrate America

46:27.720 --> 46:31.960
you know I think they were the if it had gone on for one more day I would have like come out

46:31.960 --> 46:38.200
in a like an American flag out I think you like wake up from stomach sleeping and you just see like

46:38.200 --> 46:47.160
the imprint of like blue with stars stripes like I think you know the shot the what was the cue

46:47.720 --> 46:57.320
from who had his face painted two days away from that yeah that was another term away from

46:57.320 --> 47:02.600
that being how I celebrated yeah I don't want this to come off any certain way and I might

47:02.600 --> 47:07.000
edit it out if it comes up the wrong way but it's a nice episode we love that about you January 6

47:07.000 --> 47:14.920
2021 was one of the most fun days of my life Twitter was going crazy I've never laughed harder

47:14.920 --> 47:20.760
at my timeline I think I woke up in the middle of it I think it was going on I either I

47:20.760 --> 47:24.760
either hadn't been online or I'd been asleep or something and I got on in the first time

47:24.760 --> 47:31.480
I was just like a video of the Capitol burning and I was like oh that was like no way and then

47:31.480 --> 47:34.920
I found out that we did it and I was like oh shit I thought at least some other country would have

47:34.920 --> 47:40.920
done it I thought you meant we and I was like what do you mean we we'd be different we

47:40.920 --> 47:45.560

What's your eight week goal?

49:07.480 --> 49:08.280
You have to be earnest.

49:09.000 --> 49:13.160
Well, I mean, if I'm like super earnest, I'm like an hour away from selling this TV show.

49:13.160 --> 49:15.400
I'm working on for two years. So that's what he's done.

49:15.400 --> 49:17.480
I was earnest about the rep thing. So that has to be it.

49:17.480 --> 49:18.680
I know that's why I gave you it.

49:18.680 --> 49:21.160
We're talking about it. Salas are last summer.

49:21.160 --> 49:23.880
The queer one in Kitten, Kitten City.

I was going to Cartoon. I sold that last year.

49:27.480 --> 49:30.440
I mean, so my one that's not work one would be,

49:30.440 --> 49:31.960

49:32.520 --> 49:33.800
I can teach you Guitar.

49:33.800 --> 49:35.800
Jeff, would you actually though, I feel like we'd go for

49:35.800 --> 49:36.840
around too much?

49:36.840 --> 49:37.960
That might happen.

49:37.960 --> 49:38.760
Okay, cute.

49:38.760 --> 49:40.760
I feel like we'd just be goofing around.

49:40.760 --> 49:42.040
Wait, that was really cute.

49:42.040 --> 49:43.160
I'm like cute.

49:43.720 --> 49:44.920
I'm kind of good at Guitar.

49:44.920 --> 49:46.920
No, I know. I bought a Guitar from you.

49:47.000 --> 49:47.880
Oh, yeah.

49:47.880 --> 49:49.000
I forgot about that.

49:50.120 --> 49:51.320
I know you're going to actually, I'm going to,

49:51.320 --> 49:53.320
and that is my fourth favorite podcast episode.

49:53.320 --> 49:56.120
It's just me re-stringing Guitar and your guys' living room.

49:56.120 --> 49:57.960
Keeping records been Jeff, were you strongly Guitar?

49:57.960 --> 49:59.560
I was our first guest list.

49:59.560 --> 50:00.280
You remember?

50:00.280 --> 50:00.600
Yeah.

50:00.600 --> 50:01.720
And it was kind of guested.

50:01.720 --> 50:02.280
Mm-hmm.

50:02.280 --> 50:03.080
Yeah.

50:03.080 --> 50:04.040
We had a guest.

50:04.040 --> 50:05.080
He just wasn't on the pod.

50:05.080 --> 50:06.040
Jeff?

50:06.040 --> 50:07.080
Hey, we go.

50:07.080 --> 50:09.800
I've been working on a scripted podcast for a couple of months.

50:09.800 --> 50:11.400
And I've two more episodes to do.

50:11.400 --> 50:12.520
And I just want to finish it.

50:12.520 --> 50:14.520
I don't even care if anything doesn't happen with it.

50:14.520 --> 50:15.720
I just need to finish it.

50:15.880 --> 50:17.080
Finish it.

50:17.080 --> 50:17.640
Let's go.

50:17.640 --> 50:20.040
Why are we going to get cast in that scripted podcast?

50:20.040 --> 50:20.360
Yeah.

50:20.360 --> 50:22.520
Why are we going to actually, you're on my outline.

50:26.040 --> 50:27.240
You guys heard it here first, folks?

50:27.240 --> 50:29.800
You're also going to, I hopefully be in the show,

50:29.800 --> 50:30.840
but you're not on the outline.

50:33.400 --> 50:34.760
Tell me what that means in a nice time.

50:34.760 --> 50:37.160
It means that the five primary characters

50:38.200 --> 50:39.800
you don't make sense for any of them,

50:39.800 --> 50:41.000
but I want you to be in the show.

50:42.600 --> 50:43.080
That's awesome.

50:44.040 --> 50:45.480
I don't know.

50:45.480 --> 50:46.040
That's awesome.

50:46.040 --> 50:47.640
It's...

50:47.640 --> 50:48.040
That's awesome.

50:49.640 --> 50:53.160
I would love to come and be like a background character

50:53.160 --> 50:53.960
for your scripted podcast.

50:53.960 --> 50:56.600
Now, back from important guest role.

50:57.560 --> 50:58.680
I love that.

50:58.680 --> 50:59.400
That's awesome.

50:59.400 --> 51:02.920
Think of like when like, like, Brad Pitt was on friends.

51:02.920 --> 51:03.720
Hey, you know what?

51:03.720 --> 51:05.640
It's more important than the friends in that episode.

51:05.640 --> 51:06.360
That's really true.

51:06.360 --> 51:06.760
And guess what?

51:06.760 --> 51:08.440
You guys, I really need to get a lot of writing

51:08.440 --> 51:09.880
done in the next couple of weeks.

51:09.880 --> 51:11.480
And Jeff, it sounds like you do too.

51:11.560 --> 51:13.080
And Shelby, it sounds like you do too.

51:13.080 --> 51:15.160
Maybe we have some writing dates.

51:15.160 --> 51:16.280
I would love to do that.

51:16.280 --> 51:16.920
Wouldn't that be nice?

51:16.920 --> 51:17.880
That would be a lot of fun.

51:17.880 --> 51:20.120
Because my thing is I just get like,

51:21.160 --> 51:22.200
I hate writing.

51:22.200 --> 51:24.600
You know it's fun to get with a group of people

51:24.600 --> 51:25.960
who are all working on separate things.

51:25.960 --> 51:26.440
Yeah.

51:26.440 --> 51:29.320
And say, well, this is my idea of fun.

51:29.320 --> 51:31.080
I guess maybe for other people, this would be annoying.

51:31.080 --> 51:32.200
But you said a timer.

51:32.200 --> 51:34.840
And you're like, okay, we're going to work for 40 minutes straight.

51:34.840 --> 51:37.000
And then when the timer goes off, we can gossip for 10 minutes.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.040
I love that.

51:38.040 --> 51:39.640
That's the Pomodoro method.

51:39.720 --> 51:41.880
Well, that's a, that's like for self-pacing.

51:41.880 --> 51:44.040
I thought that was for like a sauce.

51:44.040 --> 51:45.000
Both.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.200
Okay.

51:46.200 --> 51:48.920
I cannot be nice to be worth.

51:48.920 --> 51:49.400
That's good.

51:49.400 --> 51:49.800
All right.

51:49.800 --> 51:50.360
Both.

51:50.360 --> 51:50.760
It's cool.

51:50.760 --> 51:51.960
It's cool.

51:53.320 --> 51:54.200
What do you guys have going on?

51:54.200 --> 51:55.240
What do you want to point to people too?

51:55.240 --> 51:55.880
The floor is yours.

51:55.880 --> 51:56.920
Let's start with Shelby.

51:56.920 --> 51:58.680
Listen to keeping records.

And I really want to get to 10,000 before next week's episode.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.080

Don't you have 10,000 on Instagram already?

52:33.240 --> 52:37.400

52:47.320 --> 52:48.520
We can only help the brand.

52:49.480 --> 52:50.600
Well, I don't have to see it.

52:51.480 --> 52:53.480
If I, I mean, I guess I have to see a photo of my ass.

52:54.440 --> 52:55.480

53:22.920 --> 53:25.240
You're, yeah, I want to plug something.

53:25.240 --> 53:25.720
Plug it.

53:25.720 --> 53:26.440
Friendship.

53:26.440 --> 53:27.320
I want, yeah, I want to plug.

53:27.320 --> 53:28.920
How about the concept of friendship?

53:32.280 --> 53:34.040
How about I plug the concept of friendship?

53:34.120 --> 53:34.520
Puzzah.

53:37.640 --> 53:39.640
I was so confused about what I was looking at.

53:39.640 --> 53:40.600
See that's a thing.

53:40.600 --> 53:43.400
I showed this photo to people on this show before and they always,

53:43.400 --> 53:44.120
you want to see my ass?

53:44.120 --> 53:46.600
I guess people never know what they're looking at because I'm

53:46.600 --> 53:47.560
bending in a weird way.

53:47.560 --> 53:49.880
You're doing, I was like, I don't know where the ass is.

53:49.880 --> 53:50.600
Yeah.

53:50.600 --> 53:52.920
I don't know what part of the body I'm starting from.

53:52.920 --> 53:53.400
Right.

53:53.400 --> 53:55.320
There's no way to ground it in reality.

53:55.320 --> 53:57.000
How many, how many game in have you showed this to?

53:58.600 --> 53:59.240
What?

53:59.240 --> 53:59.800
It's you.

53:59.800 --> 54:02.040
Yeah, I think you could benefit from showing it just

54:02.200 --> 54:05.400
Yeah, because they can help you get angles.

54:05.400 --> 54:07.960
Yeah, if you're trying to take a really good ass pick,

54:07.960 --> 54:09.240
who was that for?

54:09.240 --> 54:11.320
Uh, that was honestly just for me.

54:11.320 --> 54:11.880
Beautiful.

54:11.880 --> 54:12.280
I love that.

54:12.280 --> 54:13.240
Beautiful.

54:13.240 --> 54:15.960
Hey, let me plug the concept of doing things just for you.

54:15.960 --> 54:16.600
Take action.

54:16.600 --> 54:18.600
I'd like to plug taking nudes for yourself.

54:18.600 --> 54:19.000
Yeah.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.080
And I'd like to plug figuring out the angles a little bit.

54:21.080 --> 54:22.440
Yeah.

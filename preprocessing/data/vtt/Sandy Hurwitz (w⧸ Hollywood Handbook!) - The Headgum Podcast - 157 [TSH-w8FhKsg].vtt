WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:22.000
Can we bump that up?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
A little bit more in the head-gum.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Yeah, it's not up here, because it was really loud.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
It was a really loud.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
That was a little louder from me.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
I'm going to be pissed.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
That was really loud.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Can you turn my down, actually?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Yeah.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
There we go.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Yeah, that's good.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Welcome back to another episode of the head-gum podcast.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
We've got the two newest head-gum podcasters on the episode.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
I think I need my turn down a little bit.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Turn down.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Yeah, it's loud.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
It's loud, dude.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Is that a kind of pre-production?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Mine's drawn now.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Yeah.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
This can do for me.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Yeah.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
You can't hear anything.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Like, now I can.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
It's less, it's been less and less.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm going to get started.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
You're going to get sput.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
You're good.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
I think mine's.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
I think fine.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Yes, that's good.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
That's good.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
I can see why the headphones, it's like not really a thing here, because it's like.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
It's always how they work.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
It's always how they work.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Experiences.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
There's hours and that shares in charge of them.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
I can hear other people's voice, but like mine is not coming through.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
And I like mine loud.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Did you hear it?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Once his headphones very loud.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
I don't.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
It's funny.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
We're good.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Can you hear that?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
I can hear.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
That's fine.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
That's whatever.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
I don't know which one of these is which.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Well, that's good.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
You shouldn't just be like touching.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
No.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
No.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
No.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
I just.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I think you had it, man.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
I think you had it.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Just let.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Just let.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Just let.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
We can do that.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
We can do that.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
We can do that.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
For Hayes is not a big.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
As big a problem as it being too loud for someone else.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Right.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Usually it is too loud for everyone on this show though.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Doesn't seem like we have to choose.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
There's no way.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Well, welcome to the show.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
You guys don't know what this is at all.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
No.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I've just been so busy.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
No.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
I'm not devastated.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I'm disoriented.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Of course.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
You guys just recorded that's why this is like a back-to-back episode.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
We don't like to do.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
And we leave it all on the field.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
I'm exhausted.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Yeah.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm completely.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
This is over time for us.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
I'm sort of re-generating my, like, a joy.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Yeah.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
I'm in the recovery period.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Now I'm going to use this for that.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Right.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Your reserve energy.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Yeah.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Your refractory period.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
I would probably say, I mean,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
how would you describe this show?

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
It's kind of chaotic, kind of silly.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Should be fun and funny.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Oh, totally.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
My shit.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Right.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
I think you guys will have a blast.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
But Jeff's in charge of, like, the segments and stuff like that.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Absolutely.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
There are segments.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Sometimes there's segments.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
Sometimes there's what Jeff calls a waxing episode, which is just a free flowing

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
45 minute conversation.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
That's an episode where I don't outline anything.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Right.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Okay.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
But we haven't outlined today.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Okay.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
It's a free flowing conversation that occasionally touches.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I'm sure.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
45 minutes of pop culture discussion.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
I mean, spirited games and quizzes and gotcha journalism.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
That's awesome.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Awesome.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Thanks.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
You guys have been on that.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I've been doing that.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
That's.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
That seems nice.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Okay.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
All right.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
You guys have been on head again for, like, what, two weeks?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I don't know when it officially started.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Like, they had this whole thing about life.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Yeah.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Yeah.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Yeah.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
They kind of kept us on ice for a minute.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Two to four weeks.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Let's say.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Two to four.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
How does it feel?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
You want me to say it in front of him here?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
You can, this is an open forum.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
I'm.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I'm going to be rude to everyone here.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
I'm like, you think you got to know just met 20 seconds ago.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I've got some notes.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
The cans.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
The.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
We can't hear.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
We've been.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Clear.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
But, um.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
I, you know, we talk about it every episode on our show.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
We feel like there could maybe be one of these offices.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Could be a second studio.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Me or says they're not even offering us?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I don't know what they are on.

04:22.000 --> 04:22.720
I think they are on.

04:22.720 --> 04:28.240
We're gonna do think another student, but I have rescinded my request for a second studio

04:28.240 --> 04:32.880
I don't know if you heard and I have instead altered the request to be one working studio

04:32.880 --> 04:34.880
Where the episode does get recorded

04:35.600 --> 04:41.760
Okay, because that's not what we should do that first. This in series would be that one correct. Yeah

04:42.800 --> 04:44.320
if the

04:44.320 --> 04:48.560
cameras were turned on or if the SD card was not being

04:48.560 --> 04:53.680
cameras are on now turned in some way. Okay, that's great. This is not our show

04:53.680 --> 04:58.640
Yeah, but when we've recorded some time I just want to point out when they weren't on at the time

04:58.640 --> 05:00.880
we were also under the impression that they were on

05:00.880 --> 05:04.400
Yeah, okay, so you saying that in my experience is not necessarily mean

05:04.400 --> 05:07.200
I don't double check it. I didn't think that was my job

05:07.200 --> 05:09.920
But it's not had sometimes where we've been told you know

05:09.920 --> 05:14.560
We don't have the audio for this episode. We don't have the video. That's happened more than once

05:15.280 --> 05:16.560
Yes, yeah

05:16.720 --> 05:18.720
Wait, when did you guys not have video

05:20.880 --> 05:23.280
There was an episode of Flagger ones where the cameras

05:24.400 --> 05:29.280
I don't think there was anything wrong with them other than the the power had not been activated

05:29.280 --> 05:33.440
of them. Oh, interesting. Okay good to know off good to say

05:34.480 --> 05:40.160
Get to hear but you guys have also been on earwolf you guys tried your own thing that didn't quite pan out

05:41.200 --> 05:42.960
I mean

05:42.960 --> 05:45.280
It got us here, you know like for me

05:47.520 --> 05:53.040
I try to live without regret and I say like sure there've been periods of my life that were

05:54.240 --> 05:57.920
Not ideal when we were operating the podcast independently

05:58.240 --> 06:02.800
But I never would have ended up in this chair. Yeah, if we hadn't made those choices

06:02.800 --> 06:08.960
So can I really be upset about that? Like seems like you don't like the journey sitting and you're saying the studio doesn't work

06:08.960 --> 06:12.400
I like the chair. I don't like the couch. I do not like yeah

06:12.400 --> 06:17.440
I also notice you guys are like time and nature. Yeah, you don't like the chair and you don't like the couch

06:17.440 --> 06:23.280
So you guys are always on this side and that's right. Yeah, you're guys as guests did walk in earlier and they were like

06:23.280 --> 06:28.960
This is a really nice studio though. So there is a wow factor that do you feel like was missing before maybe at earwolf

06:30.080 --> 06:32.080
I mean again earwolf

06:32.480 --> 06:36.320
It's not it was never a choice between this and earwolf right, you know

06:36.320 --> 06:39.520
There's a choice between indian this yeah and before you were just sun zoom

06:39.920 --> 06:42.640
Yeah, yeah, how this is in the outline

06:43.120 --> 06:48.400
No, this is just the intro. We're trying to break it down. You guys can see angry. So I'm trying to like break the eyes

06:48.800 --> 06:50.800
Well, you said you're gonna be mean

06:50.800 --> 06:52.480
I was that you like you guys

06:52.480 --> 06:56.320
You're gonna be angry. Yeah, what did you say earlier about

06:57.600 --> 06:59.840
You have to start with that you did with him?

07:03.680 --> 07:07.840
Okay, so for people who are just listening

07:08.800 --> 07:12.080
Starting now to the or only out of the audio

07:14.080 --> 07:17.760
Jeffery pointed at me have been pointed out over here. All right

07:20.640 --> 07:22.640
I don't know what I said

07:22.960 --> 07:24.960
We're the day I

07:24.960 --> 07:26.320
said it

07:26.320 --> 07:31.520
Sean said it that's what that that segment is the word of the day was the mirror. Oh, okay

07:32.560 --> 07:34.320
So congratulations

07:34.320 --> 07:38.640
We used to give people a thousand dollars for that, but I can't keep doing that because Venmo

07:39.360 --> 07:44.320
Now you have to pay taxes on any Venmo transaction. That's why I choose the taxes. I'll cover the taxes

07:52.320 --> 07:54.800
People who listen to this show probably listen to your show

07:55.440 --> 07:58.560
Okay, great our show's called Hollywood handbook

07:59.200 --> 08:01.200
It's now a headgun podcast

08:02.160 --> 08:06.800
You mean now too. I mean that's that's most of it. I've

08:07.680 --> 08:10.160
We've been on here for I guess two to four weeks

08:12.240 --> 08:13.600
All right, let's get into it. I guess

08:14.880 --> 08:16.880
WGA strike week six

08:17.440 --> 08:21.760
Are you guys picketing are you on the ground? What are you hearing? What's the best sign you saw this week?

08:23.040 --> 08:23.760
I

08:23.760 --> 08:30.640
I have picketed before I had that I haven't done it this week yet, but I did see a sign where someone had a little bit

08:30.640 --> 08:35.280
Right, just one second. Yeah, okay. You're bringing nothing today. Well, look you asked hey

08:35.280 --> 08:38.640
So I'm listening to you. Yeah, but you're just kind of sitting there baking you're not saying a lot

08:38.720 --> 08:40.720
Usually like you're dominating the discourse and coming out

08:40.720 --> 08:45.040
He wasn't kind of a drill. I want it to hear at the sign what I also want to hear. I'm just saying like yeah

08:45.360 --> 08:50.080
Let's get a little bit more to you. I just I can speak for it. Amir did not pick it this

T. P. stinks worse than my diapers

09:25.280 --> 09:29.840
Oh, no the baby was in the same real babies. I really saw that the baby

09:31.280 --> 09:33.280
I really saw that for real

09:33.280 --> 09:35.280
That's so wow

09:35.280 --> 09:40.560
Yeah, I can't hear my voice at all but but then but the sound though. I can't hear that sound. Yeah

09:42.080 --> 09:47.760
Yeah, you know you'll catch me out pick it in. I go a little more than he's he's has a different job. He has a hat

09:48.320 --> 09:54.080
Yeah, I've got a wj captain's hat at my car. Are you occasionally? I get it's not stolen by valour

09:54.080 --> 09:59.600
I occasionally get deputized to uh to captain a gate. Yeah, why grids a captain?

10:02.080 --> 10:06.880
Knocked me over with a feather a mirror. I can't believe I've heard it here two captains

10:06.880 --> 10:10.400
I think I'm that's kind of exciting. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I'm not a

10:11.120 --> 10:15.360
Is he a is he a captain like at all the time captain like he's like I think so

10:16.080 --> 10:19.120
We'll have a good date. I'm not sure which which or which

10:19.120 --> 10:23.680
We need to be for about ten minutes. All right. We have to move on. I'm sorry. We usually have a walk. This is discuss

10:24.320 --> 10:26.320
Scotland's surgeon

10:26.640 --> 10:29.120
Released from custody after police questioning

10:29.600 --> 10:33.920
Is according to the Washington Post does a fish go say thorough back. Yeah, there's well

10:33.920 --> 10:38.160
They're talking about Scotland's first minister Nicole's storage surgeon, but I also thought they were talking about caviar

10:41.040 --> 10:43.040
Scotland's first minister

10:45.040 --> 10:47.040
Throne back what did they say released

10:48.000 --> 10:56.240
Yeah, that's what it says Scotland's first minister. Yeah, okay. I'll like first lady first minister and maybe it's like but

10:58.000 --> 11:01.840
To most people put their feet up here. I would really like to do it and Sean does it

11:01.840 --> 11:06.080
I just want to know if it's okay. There's a drink. I think it depends what vibe you want

11:06.080 --> 11:09.840
Like you're coming in with like sort of a relaxed energy and you're like you look up

11:09.840 --> 11:16.400
I don't know you look uncomfortable. I always like really squenched over here. Yeah, he gets so squenched in

11:16.480 --> 11:20.880
When he has to share the couch. Yeah, I don't want to be able to couch. Yeah, too soft

11:21.760 --> 11:28.880
You don't try it. I think that you know a lot of podcasts are recorded in like sort of office chairs like you know

11:29.280 --> 11:31.280
Desk chairs. Yeah, and

11:31.920 --> 11:37.440
I think it does make you sit a little more upright and feel like you're at work. Yes, and I think

11:37.840 --> 11:44.800
This morning goes as drawing to lounge vibe. Yeah, because it is my job. Yeah, and when I'm sitting

11:44.800 --> 11:50.560
sort of a table set up that I mean I know that like we're not even talking about a second studio any more

11:50.560 --> 11:54.160
But if like if that conversation ever if it

11:54.160 --> 12:00.480
Like a table as a real table student play yeah, if that was oh like a different vibe maybe that one more feel

12:00.480 --> 12:04.160
Okay, I think chairs or something like that around a table

12:04.800 --> 12:10.480
I'm in that and I can yeah, I can kind of lean and I just I'm a little more upright

12:10.480 --> 12:15.440
I'm a little more engaged. I feel like I've been in KC. I don't fall. I haven't office chair

12:15.440 --> 12:21.280
They have a table like they have a any more business like set up and have consistently been like

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
Doing better stuff for growing yeah the shows KC has been

12:27.040 --> 12:28.400
off the

12:28.400 --> 12:34.400
Fucking charts on the shows and I think it's so much of it is the KC is basically become the BTK of

12:34.800 --> 12:37.760
Of podcast serial killers

12:38.320 --> 12:43.040
Yeah, as you guys are saying this KC's looking at two different monitors. It looks like he's just online shopping

12:43.840 --> 12:47.360
That's what that look yeah, that's what you look like with you online shopping is two different

12:48.800 --> 12:54.960
Yeah, I have accessories on one what's that? KC's and one I got the color all the products. So yeah

12:59.200 --> 13:03.520
We did do a couple of episodes of this where I was behind the boards just to prove that KC and Kevin's job

13:03.600 --> 13:06.800
Is kind of easy. Yeah, we did that um yeah and

13:07.600 --> 13:13.760
2012 we like basically every third not much you can do in podcast that we didn't start

13:16.640 --> 13:18.640
chaotic and funny and fun

13:20.960 --> 13:23.440
Discuss you know Jake just had a daughter

13:23.680 --> 13:32.400
Jeff and I want to I want to like throw out she agenda here. I want to like move past like

13:33.280 --> 13:39.760
We worked together now like let's talk about like you and like what your deal is and like what like

13:40.240 --> 13:44.880
Have you guys ever met Jeff? No, this is literally the first time I've we've only ever

13:44.880 --> 13:51.120
I was on it and like he works he does this podcast. Yeah, yeah, like and but I feel like instead

13:51.200 --> 13:59.520
You're he's coming in with the network. Yeah, that I call home now. Yes, so don't look at the computer like let's like like like I have a lot

13:59.520 --> 14:04.080
I know but like if can we is there like a chunk you went to college with Zack done

14:04.800 --> 14:10.160
Yeah, no, I didn't know that we did this is the kind of thing we can make a while at an improv festival

14:10.160 --> 14:14.960
Did I meet you then I don't remember then he does he goes just

14:16.960 --> 14:20.720
You did a live episode of your show at the improv festival

14:21.120 --> 14:29.760
That we got it. Yeah, that's I didn't know we were at that was it mean Gabriel's I think you couldn't make it that's it was you and Gabriel's okay. Yeah, so yeah

14:30.960 --> 14:33.520
But um everyone from that seems to be

14:34.400 --> 14:39.360
Doing great. Zack's doing great. Yeah. Well I introduced him to my whole network. So like yeah

14:39.920 --> 14:41.920
Are you taking credit

14:41.920 --> 14:48.720
You discovered Zach? No, I guess me introducing him to my entire network like I had had had no impact

14:48.720 --> 14:51.440
So I'm not know I think that look amazing career

14:52.400 --> 14:55.840
Like you did you discover Zach? No, yeah, I'm sure that has nothing to do with it

15:01.520 --> 15:07.600
It's the whole we just put away the whole computer the whole computer. Yeah, it's been four hours outlining this

15:08.720 --> 15:13.520
And I feel like there's a point where it's like it becomes too much

15:14.000 --> 15:20.560
I can feel that the work you know what I mean like not in a good way. Do you want to just have a wax conversation?

15:21.760 --> 15:26.480
I mean, I think we could start there and get to what you're describing by the way is a wax episode

15:26.480 --> 15:30.960
Which every time I do what I do when I do that people hate when I do that

15:30.960 --> 15:36.480
Yeah, okay, but the network are like you didn't prepare anything. Yeah, I was like they like this. Yeah, okay

15:36.480 --> 15:42.160
This is the good stuff. Okay Jake's daughter's name is Gemma. Okay, but I thought it would have been better for name was like sandy

15:43.520 --> 15:45.520
Why sandy her wits

15:47.360 --> 15:52.320
What is that what is that? What is that? I think it's a cooler name. Oh, I see

15:53.280 --> 15:55.280
Okay

15:55.520 --> 16:01.520
What did say on the agenda? Yeah, what is this? Discuss Jennifer Aniston just partnered with Pavol

16:02.320 --> 16:06.240
This is the next Pavol which stands for personal evolution

16:06.240 --> 16:17.840
Okay, so if he Oh, Elvis offers yeah fitness and streaming classes using signature equipment streaming glasses. Yeah, it's encouraging folks to break a sweat not your body

16:19.360 --> 16:23.360
Okay, I mean I'm happy for Pavol obviously

16:24.480 --> 16:27.520
Yes, I have to say that

16:29.120 --> 16:31.120
You know anything

16:31.200 --> 16:33.520
That makes Jen happy makes me happy

16:34.160 --> 16:41.600
We're just ripping through these these topics. I mean, I don't this is only one segment is only one segment. This is just one segment. This is like the discuss wax portion

16:42.720 --> 16:47.920
This is the wax portion. This is there's always a wax portion and I have talking points to kind of unpack

16:47.920 --> 16:50.720
Okay, in case the conversation rolls, okay

16:51.440 --> 16:57.120
And this is just like the news that I was also like the president was indicted this this week as well

16:57.120 --> 17:00.320
I don't know like okay, right, and did you also know that well

17:00.320 --> 17:05.120
I don't want to talk about it when you and me on the bounty Marlin Brando's yeah, I know

17:05.120 --> 17:10.080
The two pairs of pants. You knew this. Yeah, I know this and then he got a five-gallon top of ice cream

17:10.080 --> 17:14.080
And he took like a little dinghy and he like rode out away from the boat and the director was like screaming

17:14.880 --> 17:20.640
Megaflow'd be like please stop please stop you to get any eight the whole ice cream just like far away

17:20.640 --> 17:25.760
Look at the until his pants split as he's he was splitting his pants all the time

17:25.840 --> 17:31.360
Might be the weirdest thing that someone already knew on the show. Yeah, I just read the verbatim the per paragraph

17:31.360 --> 17:35.760
That's written you went out in a little dingy to escape the director. Yeah, they were telling him

17:35.760 --> 17:42.160
They were like please get under control your split a go out pants. We're running out of pants material like and you're

17:43.680 --> 17:49.040
Eating a lot and he was like you think I'm eating a lot now and then he grabbed a tuba ice cream when he jumped a little

17:50.240 --> 17:54.320
He scooted away and he had to get in the boat because otherwise they would try to

17:54.800 --> 17:59.680
Grease my spirit take it away from his don't take another scoop

18:02.160 --> 18:06.880
Yeah, how did you know that I knew Zack don't that's something that's not you're looking at me. I didn't say it

18:06.880 --> 18:12.960
How did you know it? I don't I never reveal my sources see how is that that's not lax conversation

18:12.960 --> 18:14.960
That's like you're looking at me again

18:14.960 --> 18:16.960
Like I and I

18:16.960 --> 18:20.640
The one who's a task like realization something just happened in my headphones

18:21.600 --> 18:28.560
Wasn't I not nothing good, but that's done the show thing is happening and he's episode this show

18:28.560 --> 18:30.880
Yeah, he's like on the episode every good

18:30.880 --> 18:34.160
Yeah, usually this was one of the easiest ones to book ever

18:34.800 --> 18:39.840
Yeah, Zack was tough. Okay. I didn't see that for my first day like three weeks in advance

18:39.840 --> 18:44.640
I feel like I get Zack on my show. I have to stop him from doing it. That's true

18:44.880 --> 18:47.680
It's when I feel like he's right now. I need to do it unemployed

18:48.000 --> 18:56.160
So it's on the drive. Yeah, we talked to it was like the first force measure segment that you brought up right the WJ strike

18:56.160 --> 18:59.680
Yeah, this is segment I like to call so what okay. This is

19:00.640 --> 19:03.440
News headlines that kind of don't unaltymently matter

19:04.240 --> 19:07.360
So ones were not part of that. Yeah, the other ones were interesting

19:08.000 --> 19:11.760
So this one is I read news headlines and then we all say and you can see the dog

19:11.760 --> 19:16.240
I'm not going to look at any of the words. I just want to see Sean can see it and I feel like I'm it's really strong

19:16.480 --> 19:22.160
Yeah, you mean you're showing a shot. Wow, that's really small. It's not that long. It looks like um

19:22.160 --> 19:26.480
It's a crib sheet. I'm getting a little sheet sheet. I'm getting flashbacks of when

19:27.200 --> 19:32.960
Andy was the producer flagrant yeah, so there'd be just like little bullet points. That's where I remember

19:34.560 --> 19:38.560
All of you can spend you used to boast an extensive pizza list

19:39.280 --> 19:41.280
They don't have pizza anymore

19:41.280 --> 19:44.240
No, so they have any pizza? They don't

19:44.720 --> 19:47.680
Well actually, well, I have

19:48.480 --> 19:52.480
Clearly more curious about this than this is this has haze locked in

19:53.520 --> 20:00.720
And I think that haze was promised that when he does attend that establishment that he will be treated like family and family makes pizza

20:02.400 --> 20:07.520
They don't have any pizza like well here's I guess my question this is like a known thing that they don't have pizza

20:07.600 --> 20:09.600
I

20:10.000 --> 20:12.720
Only have the headline. I don't read these okay. Sorry. Yeah

20:13.280 --> 20:16.000
Plenty you stop pizza and they're stopping

20:16.880 --> 20:18.880
They used to boast and extensive

20:19.600 --> 20:24.160
Pizza list yeah, yeah, and they're and no more pizza okay now

20:24.960 --> 20:28.800
Planner for shyness is painful, but some people are treating the wrong way

20:31.680 --> 20:36.640
So you don't know what do you want us to say too? We're supposed to say that you're saying is so

20:37.520 --> 20:40.640
more impactful and I had a big reaction obviously

20:41.120 --> 20:43.120
Janice and partnering with Pavol

20:45.120 --> 20:53.280
But I do think that like finding out that there is an incorrect comment in correct way to treat

20:53.280 --> 20:59.120
Planner for shyness that is possibly making some of your listeners or me or people in my family

20:59.600 --> 21:05.360
Suffer unnecessarily and that it could be corrected that seems more relevant and more impactful

21:05.600 --> 21:09.200
Even than the partnership between Pavol and Janice Janice for Aniston

21:11.520 --> 21:17.920
That's from Grout gets filthy. The model of Brando one too was you were on top of that one. Yeah, I know

21:17.920 --> 21:24.240
But I don't think it it's not actionable in the way that um the plan is planar for shyness one is right

21:25.280 --> 21:31.040
And then according to the New York Times bathroom Grout gets filthy. Yeah. Yeah, so what so much sure

21:31.120 --> 21:38.640
Uh, I'd buy vision apple vision pro just to watch sports and I will

21:39.920 --> 21:41.920
According to imore

21:42.480 --> 21:46.880
dot com so what well that one's kind of interesting to

21:48.880 --> 21:58.320
Declared it is not only what I do it. I'm going to do it. I would do it sure and fuck it watch me do it because it's happening

21:59.280 --> 22:04.480
Teen tries to save it. And that's the kind of thing also that I feel like you could launch into like would would

22:04.480 --> 22:06.320
She's the conversation

22:07.520 --> 22:13.840
You know that's not the point of the segment though our other our other like what's producer has a whole segment we do

22:14.560 --> 22:16.560
That is that is based on that

22:16.560 --> 22:21.920
Where she brings up something it says was you do that and then you guys have a conversation

22:21.920 --> 22:25.600
Yeah, we talked to them and are we do it and so maybe we could like I guess use that

22:25.600 --> 22:27.360
That's the organic plug-in

22:27.840 --> 22:32.160
Yeah, so would you do that would you buy apple vision pro just to watch now? You do want to have a conversation

22:32.160 --> 22:36.080
Yeah, I don't want to dead end your guys. I won't I won't be doing it

22:36.880 --> 22:38.880
No yet

22:39.200 --> 22:46.640
Not the first adopter, but if you like try it and it's pretty cool. I wouldn't do it right and I will yes

22:46.640 --> 22:48.640
That's really cool

22:48.640 --> 22:52.800
Um, teen tries to save his brother, but both drown after jumping into a lake. Oh

22:52.880 --> 22:54.880
Come on, hey man

22:55.360 --> 22:56.880
So what

22:58.880 --> 23:00.880
Kind of important

23:01.680 --> 23:03.680
I would I don't know

23:03.680 --> 23:06.560
I'm not necessarily on the same page as a mirror that it's like

23:07.600 --> 23:13.200
Like it's like it's certainly important to them. I don't know if I would call it like an important new story sure

23:13.200 --> 23:18.080
I also wouldn't react so what I wouldn't say so what that's horrible

23:18.080 --> 23:20.480
I guess I'm just off. I guess I'm not

23:21.440 --> 23:23.440
EG enough for this show. Yeah

23:25.040 --> 23:27.040
Take a break. We'll be right back

23:27.040 --> 23:32.640
The mirror we actually take we're taking a great an ad break. Okay guys our next sponsor has a product that I use

23:32.640 --> 23:38.640
Literally every day all right and that's AG1 by athletic greens. I gave AG1 a try because

23:39.360 --> 23:43.840
I frankly don't have enough energy to make it through the day. You know what I mean? Like I wake up

23:43.840 --> 23:49.280
I could have slept nine ten hours and I just I feel lack of clarity and lack of

23:49.520 --> 23:55.680
proper energy and it's hard also for me to keep up with a supplement routine

23:55.680 --> 24:00.320
I used to take a bunch of different pills and supplements and vitamins to look out for my health

24:00.320 --> 24:05.840
But now I get everything I want and need and more with AG1

24:05.840 --> 24:10.960
So what is this stuff? Well with one scoop of delicious AG1 from athletic greens

24:11.360 --> 24:17.920
You are absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins minerals and whole-food sourced ingredients of the highest quality

24:18.080 --> 24:24.960
That can give you major benefits like gut and mood support boosted energy and even healthier looking skin hair and nails

24:25.520 --> 24:30.560
My AG1 is delivered to me every month. So it's super easy to use on a daily basis. I will wake up

24:30.560 --> 24:36.560
I'll have a glass of water. I'll have my AG1 and then I'll have my coffee and I'm off to the races

24:36.560 --> 24:41.200
I mean, I don't know what else to say. I am a changed man since I started using AG1

24:41.200 --> 24:45.280
All right. I get a single serving travel pack as well so that any time I'm gone

24:45.760 --> 24:51.760
I never have to miss a day and it's one consistent routine in my routine that I am able to point to and be like

24:51.760 --> 24:55.600
Oh look, I did something good for my health, right? You might not always get to be

24:56.240 --> 25:00.000
able to go to the gym, right? You might not be able to get your 10,000 steps every day

25:00.000 --> 25:02.320
But at least if you're taking AG1 once a day

Yeah, I don't know if more hours is like

25:54.160 --> 26:00.240
I mean that's my share of it. You said four four times. Yeah, my hourly rates. That was like over $100

26:00.800 --> 26:02.800
Shit and the edible arrangement

26:02.960 --> 26:04.960
Open for that

26:05.280 --> 26:08.960
Yeah, the edible arrangements were an expense right because that's business-related

26:08.960 --> 26:12.720
I was just gonna put that on my time card. Oh, so we're paying you back for the

26:13.840 --> 26:18.400
Fruit that you both got sent fruit yesterday. Hey, is it a yeah, and it's really big

26:18.400 --> 26:23.600
You're gonna look at the invoice and be like no chance. Yeah, that that's what he spent on these

26:24.160 --> 26:26.160
But they they they were

26:26.640 --> 26:32.240
Mass they were so big much too big. Yeah, really. I don't think you guys have compared

26:32.960 --> 26:38.720
Photos though because yours was I got you the deluxe XL bridal pack is one or something okay

26:38.960 --> 26:44.480
And then I ran out of personal money so then yours was like $10 and it was just kind of a cup

26:46.880 --> 26:48.880
Mine I

26:48.880 --> 26:51.840
Guess could you consume yours and personally?

26:52.800 --> 26:53.840
I

26:53.840 --> 26:56.800
It's some of it, but I you know, I was fortunate that there was a

26:58.400 --> 27:03.760
Music class for babies happening in my backyards. There was a lot of like parents and

27:04.560 --> 27:11.200
And children and nannies and and so I just I brought out the edible arrangement like walked into the backyard

27:11.200 --> 27:16.080
And was met with like a big round of applause. Oh wow and I did a little twirl almost

27:16.080 --> 27:24.720
In spite of myself when people had when I got the pop wow and then I just left it and and other people ate most of it. Yeah, and did you play it off like

27:24.720 --> 27:26.720
Actually could you use the big one

27:27.520 --> 27:28.720
Yeah, that was

27:28.720 --> 27:37.440
Unfortunate I could not use the been just like just like hands like shit like show how much yours how big yours wasn't

27:37.440 --> 27:43.360
Show big yours was just like okay, I mean, but if you were to hold it in visible version of it

27:43.840 --> 27:51.840
Is there gonna be a lot more of like this like making me do physical thing like literally telling me to do like a physical

27:51.840 --> 27:54.880
But this is where you draw the line. I'll do this one. I

27:55.440 --> 27:59.680
Like you're not gonna hold in your way before this. Yeah, you can hold it just like that

28:00.880 --> 28:04.640
I'll do I just yeah, I'll do this one. Okay, it was like this

28:06.960 --> 28:08.960
So it was

28:08.960 --> 28:12.800
$260. That scene or it was about nine ninety nine. Yes, okay

28:14.240 --> 28:16.240
But it seems like

28:16.480 --> 28:19.680
Yours wasn't 25 times. I also want to say mine was

28:20.480 --> 28:26.320
Only really unusual in how huge it was the actual like fruit selection is

28:26.320 --> 28:29.520
Was no it was I I think it was like pretty

28:31.200 --> 28:38.320
Base it I mean it was like three different kinds of fruit just over and over and over and over and a lot of honey do

28:38.720 --> 28:43.520
Honey, I guess the two different kinds of melon right you can't allow then you got of course

28:44.320 --> 28:47.520
Strawberry strawberry and pineapple that's it. Yeah

28:52.320 --> 28:54.320
This is a

28:54.480 --> 28:56.480
segment we forgot to do

28:59.120 --> 29:01.680
Casey's laughing because of how can't hear you

29:02.720 --> 29:04.720
Yeah, this is bond to the week

29:05.680 --> 29:07.680
So

29:07.680 --> 29:16.240
Every week until the Daniel Craig is out as James every week until the next 007 is cast we're loving up our casting decision for bond

29:17.200 --> 29:20.560
This week my bond doing you say lobbying up every time yeah

29:21.600 --> 29:26.480
Usually when I'm explaining it to new guests repeat guests. I just say what's your bond of the week this week and they know what I mean

29:27.520 --> 29:29.520
My pick this week is Sasha Obama

29:29.840 --> 29:31.840
Because it's time for a James Young

29:35.680 --> 29:42.240
It was just queued up at the right. Okay. Yeah

29:46.240 --> 29:48.240
Okay

29:53.840 --> 29:55.440
Who are you guys is bonds of the week

29:57.360 --> 30:00.080
We're some of the repeat guests that you've had like

30:00.880 --> 30:02.080
People have been never

30:02.080 --> 30:07.360
People have staff at the network. I hope people who staff in that work. So Casey's on a lot Jay

30:08.320 --> 30:14.720
The mirrors on a lot Jake used to be on a lot, but he's on paternity leave and and yeah, I'm here is normally like

30:16.320 --> 30:18.320
Really dominating

30:18.320 --> 30:23.760
He's sort of like he can start performance from a mirror. Not really. Yeah, I feel like that is the case at all

30:24.800 --> 30:29.120
I mean we'll let the commenters decide but I feel like I've been we where where are they?

30:29.600 --> 30:31.600
The commenters

30:31.600 --> 30:34.960
The comment you just said the commenters and I said where are they you said who

30:36.240 --> 30:41.440
YouTube where are the commenters YouTube? Yeah, right got it. Okay. Is this live?

30:42.560 --> 30:46.000
Of course not as one of ours going up on YouTube yet. I yet

30:47.680 --> 30:52.400
Okay, that's good. Two weeks. Kevin. Do you have a bond the week from someone you think would be good as James Bond?

30:52.960 --> 30:56.960
Donald Trump. Wow. That's pretty good. Can you imagine that?

30:57.920 --> 31:04.320
There's no way. There's your bond a week. I was gonna say Trump, but I guess no back joke of it or something

31:04.320 --> 31:11.440
He just won the French open. No back joke of it. That's good. Sort of tall slender talented. Yeah looks good in this suit. Sure.

31:12.240 --> 31:14.240
John

31:14.640 --> 31:16.640
Candle Janner. Not bad

31:19.520 --> 31:21.520
Casey

31:23.520 --> 31:26.720
I was actually thinking Kendall Roy. There's no way I was thinking

31:26.960 --> 31:31.040
Kendall Roy would be really good. All right. The character. Yeah, the character.

31:31.040 --> 31:35.200
Maybe Jeffrey give you James Bond. That's good. His last name is James.

31:37.440 --> 31:39.760
He'd better better suited to that.

31:45.200 --> 31:50.000
We have two more things to get to. He's sort of in really he's he's. I don't want to do it.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.160
I don't want to do it. He's because he's not here. You didn't want to do it.

31:54.240 --> 32:00.720
Like it's a lot of like okay now do this like I already had to like do like I would say people don't usually enjoy

32:00.720 --> 32:09.120
be on the show. But they usually participate in it. I am participating like I'm like

32:10.160 --> 32:17.280
actually I'm trying to get to a place where we are just paid even more. Yeah. Like really

32:17.280 --> 32:22.640
was trying to get his feet under him a little bit. There is a game that I do show that people don't

32:22.720 --> 32:27.840
enjoy being up. Oh, handbook and they and that and that they do participate in. Sure.

32:29.120 --> 32:36.240
But I would say that the format's a little more open. Right. And then we don't say do this.

32:36.240 --> 32:43.120
There's been a you imagine if you did this. And that's like it seems really small. But it's a huge

32:43.120 --> 32:47.680
it's huge. It's huge. It's an invitation or we say they're doing this. So to our an actually in

32:47.680 --> 32:51.760
order like they're doing that. Oh my gosh. Look at them doing this. Yes. That's what we do.

32:51.760 --> 33:00.000
So to y'all this feels like you're being met with a wall. No. Not even that. I totally understand.

33:00.000 --> 33:04.640
We have to move on. Here's something that is not going to feel any better for you guys to

33:04.720 --> 33:20.480
stomach. Okay. Okay. This is new. There's something to get the energy out. Yeah.

33:21.360 --> 33:34.480
I see you rise. Consistency of sand when you're charting old grains. Oh, girl. You've got to

33:34.480 --> 33:43.920
scald till the rice over cooks. The hoisin will glob to my hands. When you're burning the rice,

33:44.640 --> 33:54.560
cauterized grains see or thus. Scalded rice is caked with char scraping up burnt rice and

33:55.520 --> 34:05.600
damaged rice is scoped in oil. Scalded rice is searing the searing the searing the searing the

34:12.240 --> 34:18.320
that was really good. Thank you. Yeah. We do parody songs sometimes our shows and so you know

34:18.400 --> 34:23.520
big respect. It's always tough to come out and really sing the parody song. Do it live with

34:23.520 --> 34:29.040
the karaoke track and so thank you for doing that. That's the name of the real song. I don't even know.

34:29.040 --> 34:36.800
I love it. I love it. I love it. He's calling notes, right? Call notes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Call notes.

34:38.160 --> 34:46.800
Scalded. So we've been sort of a massive announcement of songs about burning rice. Okay. Okay.

34:46.880 --> 34:53.440
So we did rhythm of the rice. We. It's always you. It's always been one two weeks ago.

34:53.440 --> 34:58.480
But you wrote it for her. Sure. Okay. I'm a massing an album. Correct. There's rhythm of the

34:58.480 --> 35:05.200
rice to the tune of rhythm of the night and then there was a rice burn which was to the tune of

35:05.200 --> 35:11.440
skyfall and then what was the other one Casey? I can't remember there's been so many. Oh, isn't

35:12.400 --> 35:19.200
all of the rice instead of all of the lights. Yeah, I realized you. It's like a small pool of words

35:19.200 --> 35:24.320
that you use. Right. So a lot of a lot of grains, a lot of rice poison and soy. But anyway,

35:24.320 --> 35:27.520
this is just adding to the album and then I wanted to see if you guys had any notes. Here's a

35:27.520 --> 35:33.280
way to part open discussion. What inspired this to be like the focus of the song, like was there

35:33.280 --> 35:39.760
a particular experience you had that. Well, I'm glad you asked. We the old studio used to be in the

35:39.840 --> 35:45.920
arts district down the street from a place called Omsby. Which was sort of. It was a one of those

35:45.920 --> 35:52.400
rice triangle. Oh, Nicky. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It was an only Gary restaurant. But nobody ever ate

35:52.400 --> 35:59.840
there except for us. It's closed now. Very aily based. Yeah. There's a lot of mayo and bowl. A lot of

35:59.840 --> 36:06.080
mayo, a lot of rice. Yeah. Very little filling. So I sort of became this runner at the network of

36:06.160 --> 36:10.800
just talking a lot about rice. So that's where rhythm of the rice came to be because Omsby

36:10.800 --> 36:17.040
closed in the pandemic. So it was sort of like a, I don't know, uology to Omsby. And then I said,

36:17.040 --> 36:20.400
like, let's take it a step further. Let's talk about how you would actually prepare the rice.

36:21.200 --> 36:27.760
Maybe you'd burn the bitch. You know what I mean? Okay. You would burn it. Let you kind of

36:27.760 --> 36:32.960
purposely charred. Notice how he just said burn it. I just want to sort of like point out like

36:33.120 --> 36:41.440
scalping. You would want to do that. Like how you would prepare it. If you open your own.

36:43.280 --> 36:50.000
I'm just been going on for like years. Yeah. Yeah. I did the restaurant.

36:51.040 --> 36:55.360
The restaurant never writes. No, the restaurant prepared the rice to perfection. It was just too much

36:55.360 --> 37:01.440
rice in these. What are they called? But you want people to burn it. I don't think it's a lot.

37:01.440 --> 37:06.960
Why? Why? Oh, no. So what? The introduction of the burning. Like where it is. It was just too

37:06.960 --> 37:12.080
song. It just kind of worked. Because I'm thinking like when you say the first one was rhythm of the

37:12.080 --> 37:18.560
rice. Yeah. This is the rhythm of the night. And this, why? Like this could have been private rice.

37:18.560 --> 37:25.760
Yeah. But instead it was scalded rice. Sure. So it feels like the burning and the scalding aspect of it

37:25.920 --> 37:30.800
is hurting you. So you're saying I think back to just thinking about rice limiting. Well,

37:30.800 --> 37:35.600
I don't get where that comes from. Like I go like we hated this rice restaurant that gave us too much rice all the

37:35.600 --> 37:45.120
time. I thought it was an experience where you cooked it and then you yeah. Three years ago I ate

37:45.120 --> 37:50.240
rice. That wasn't burnt. And now I sing about it being burned. In fact, the case you don't care

37:50.320 --> 37:56.480
about any of the other versions of this like it now knowing how long to go. Yeah. Do you

37:56.480 --> 38:00.800
mind if I just read through the lyrics and we can keep scrutinizing it. Yeah, sure. I see rice.

38:01.760 --> 38:08.240
It's fine. Consistency of sand. Okay. Would you say. Maybe her with. Right. That's pretty good.

38:08.240 --> 38:14.880
It sounds right. It's my bond by the. It's like a sandier. It should have been. When you're

38:14.960 --> 38:23.840
charting old grains. Oh, girl. You've got this gold. So you thought you do want what's the

38:23.840 --> 38:30.720
what's the the base lyric like what are we playing off of? I see you you see me when you're

38:30.720 --> 38:35.280
blurring the lines. You're making a scene. Oh, girl. You've got to know. And so you turn when you're

38:35.280 --> 38:42.560
blurring the lines to when you're what charting old grains. Yeah. Okay. What I thought really was

38:42.560 --> 38:48.000
that you had eaten rice that was prepared incorrectly and burst in that. Because it was like

38:48.000 --> 38:52.960
I thought it was going to be instructional of like this is what you need to do instead. All right.

38:52.960 --> 39:00.480
Blurring the lines sounds kind of like burning the rice and you turn that into charting old grains.

39:02.240 --> 39:08.320
Blurring the lines sounds like it's like as close as you can get. It's a layup. It is so

39:08.320 --> 39:16.880
clear to burning the rice. Yeah. You changed it to charting old grains. That's a good note.

39:16.880 --> 39:21.680
Blurring the lines should have been burning the rice. Is that what you're saying? What's but what's the

39:21.680 --> 39:27.920
next line? What are you asking questions? The answer is always no. So just stop working towards him.

39:27.920 --> 39:37.520
Got to scold till the rice over cooks. The poison will glob to my hands. Is that how you pronounce it?

39:37.600 --> 39:46.320
Poison or glob of it? That girl is hoisted. Yeah. That's how you pronounce it. That's really good.

39:46.320 --> 39:53.920
When you're burning the rice or frink, cauterized grains seared thus. And that's instead of

39:53.920 --> 40:03.120
you can't escape my eyes. So the other ones we've just been blowing through so fast.

40:03.120 --> 40:09.040
I just feel like I've been stuck in this. We're making a meal of this rice song. Yeah. Well this,

40:09.040 --> 40:17.760
but this is you're intentionally getting further away from the the source sounds and that. I

40:17.760 --> 40:24.400
resent. I like that noise. This is one thing that I think we can't explore. It feels like the beginning

40:24.400 --> 40:32.560
of like a Sergio Leone movie, right? That's like the weather vein. It almost sounds like the word of

40:32.560 --> 40:42.960
the week sound effect. Yeah. What time are we at KC? We've been going for about a 39 minutes.

40:42.960 --> 40:47.520
All right. We have to move. Wow. Well that's actually very surprising. Yeah. That's impressive.

40:47.520 --> 40:51.600
Amazing. Maybe we can get onto something with all those really bad things. We didn't do anything with

40:54.000 --> 40:59.440
when I hold my an hour down here. I would have said, I would get at the old jackpower man. I would have

40:59.440 --> 41:06.080
said 24 minutes or 21 minutes. Oh wow. Time flies when you're out of the way. You guys might

41:06.080 --> 41:13.680
like this segment better. So you're bringing it down the house. This, this, it's jeopardy.

41:29.600 --> 41:35.680
Real quick. Just so you guys know, Jeopardy is pretty much the apex of the Hedigan podcast. This is like

41:35.680 --> 41:40.880
I'm feeling that right. Yeah. I'm feeling that. Yeah. I do bring out Jeopardy for important episodes.

41:40.880 --> 41:47.360
We did almost a jeopardy. Yeah. We can cut that. It's Jeopardy. This is an exciting moment.

41:47.360 --> 41:54.320
Built on a site called Jeopardy Labs. We did this at a live show and it was a hit.

41:54.400 --> 42:01.120
What are you talking about for tickets? Commenters have gone podcast where not great. Not great.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.720
Not great. There's like 250 people.

42:07.120 --> 42:12.960
We rolled into like a weekend of festivity. So it started like, say specifically. Okay.

42:12.960 --> 42:18.880
I just sort of wonder where. But all the, all the reactions to this episode will be like,

42:18.880 --> 42:23.600
Holy shit, they're doing Jeopardy. Oh, I went right to Jeopardy. This is like the most exciting part.

42:23.680 --> 42:30.400
Yeah. Well, skip straight to Jeopardy. If you want, guys. I guess. If it ends up being 250 people coming

42:30.400 --> 42:35.600
to a live show, if that's like, if I can get like a piece of that, I'm like, I'm ready to engage with that.

42:35.600 --> 42:42.240
I just so far have not been. Like being able to pinpoint where the upside is for me in any of this.

42:42.240 --> 42:48.960
But if it is like, I do that. I do that. I'm a person. I'm a live show means like, yes. Okay.

42:49.200 --> 42:54.480
And I was out. You know, I was on Jeopardy. And I lost. Did you know that? No. No. Okay. I thought you said that

42:54.480 --> 42:59.040
you were going to like do gotcha journalism and like be mean and stuff. I thought this would be a very

42:59.040 --> 43:05.680
easy. This is a layup. Right. It is like blurring the lines becoming blurring, burning the rice

43:05.680 --> 43:11.280
for you to be like, hey, as I know, like you suck shit at this or whatever you lost. Right. Like,

43:11.280 --> 43:16.240
that would have required more research on my part of this. Okay. This is Jeopardy,

43:16.320 --> 43:21.280
Hollywood edition. Okay. Um, you did this. Okay. Here's some upside. We'll do this again.

43:21.280 --> 43:26.240
Like we used to do. Uh, this is for actual cash. So the numbers you see on the screen will be,

43:26.240 --> 43:33.040
I will then mow you. Okay. Uh, here we go. Jeopardy, Hollywood edition team one is going to be

43:33.040 --> 43:37.760
Sean team two is a mirror. Team three is Hayes. Do we have a buzzer or anything? We do. Uh,

43:37.760 --> 43:43.440
our categories are iconic. Where's the buzzer? You don't see the buzzer. Okay. But you'll hear. Okay.

43:44.320 --> 43:52.400
The categories are iconic LA fair. All things, Gower. Barnes stole art parts faults.

43:53.200 --> 43:59.200
Joan Dittian's Los Angeles and Fairfax hidden gems. Are we clear on this? Yeah. All right.

44:00.480 --> 44:08.400
Sean, why don't you start us off? Okay. I'll go uh, all things Gower for 200. All things Gower for 200.

44:08.560 --> 44:11.680
The best music mastering facility on Gower Street.

44:15.600 --> 44:21.200
That's real. And then I say do I have to answer in the form of a question? You do. You got a buzz in first. Yeah.

44:22.560 --> 44:32.800
Okay. What is siren studios? Oh. That's really close to Gower. Yeah. That's really good.

44:32.800 --> 44:40.480
That's all you would. Oh, yes. You guys want to steal? I don't know the answer. So he lost $200.

44:41.520 --> 44:50.240
Yeah. Yeah. You at this point now owe you $200. Okay. So just yeah. I do not. I don't want to do. I

44:50.240 --> 44:55.840
don't know the answer. So I don't want to lose money. I don't want to lose money and it's not. We were

44:55.840 --> 45:02.080
looking for what is Bernie Grunman's mask. Okay. I've never heard of that. But I didn't say about it. Yeah.

45:02.240 --> 45:05.520
A mirror controls the board. Why? Just for some reason. Okay.

45:07.120 --> 45:15.600
Barnesville art parks faults for 100. Barnesville art parks faults for 100. One of Barnesville art parks

45:15.600 --> 45:23.840
faults. But it's okay. Go ahead. Yeah. There's no bathroom. I mean, I don't just agree with you.

45:23.840 --> 45:31.920
But that's. Correct. Okay. I just don't feel confident enough that what I would say would

45:32.000 --> 45:36.160
it's just one thing that's up there. There's only one answer for this one. Yeah.

45:36.160 --> 45:39.840
200 and 300. Okay. Some of the other questions have more than one answer.

45:40.480 --> 45:44.560
This, I guess this like subjectively has different answers. But there is a right there. There's a

45:44.560 --> 45:48.880
category. There's three. I think that's going to be the clue for every single one. Yeah. So in

45:48.880 --> 45:53.840
that for this category, I just probably won't guess at all because what if I guess the answer

45:53.840 --> 46:01.520
that's right. But it's not for this one. We're looking for what is it's not. Okay. Okay. So you are

46:01.600 --> 46:10.160
showing up. Trying the gate. Three, six. Yeah. Five, four. Yeah. He's controls the board.

46:10.880 --> 46:16.240
Let's go back to Gower for 300, please. All things they discourage you. Oh,

46:16.240 --> 46:22.880
earned ding ding. Gower's golf. Yes. What is Gower golf? Oh. Okay. You know what? Actually,

46:22.880 --> 46:27.920
no, I'll give you that one. Great. So that's $300. That's $300 in your pocket. That's actually

46:28.000 --> 46:33.280
ultimately coming from, I'm here in John. Okay. What is another name for John T. Gower's

46:33.280 --> 46:45.440
grundle? Okay. He got that. Hey, he's controls the board. I'm going to go to iconic L.A.

46:45.440 --> 46:51.760
Fair for 200. iconic L.A. I was going to say it was they don't like you to bounce around

46:51.760 --> 46:56.720
between the different categories because it would it would make Alex really like confused and

46:56.720 --> 47:01.200
like upset. And he would start reading the wrong question and they go, oh it's

47:03.680 --> 47:12.480
it's cute. And he would stop and they would be like, okay. Could all of the contestants please

47:12.480 --> 47:20.080
turn around. We would turn around. And I honestly am the least qualified person to say what

47:20.080 --> 47:25.680
happened when we did that because I was turning around, right? But they had to then do something to Alex,

47:25.680 --> 47:30.680
to Alex, to the game, to the audience,

47:30.680 --> 47:32.400
like I don't know what happened.

47:32.400 --> 47:33.800
I don't know, I was turning around.

47:33.800 --> 47:35.760
I have no idea, but they were really,

47:35.760 --> 47:36.960
really scared of what happened.

47:36.960 --> 47:40.800
Because my strategy was to go to different categories

47:40.800 --> 47:41.640
on the ground.

47:41.640 --> 47:46.000
Because then everyone, like they're stuck in the gower mindset.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.240
Right, I mean, I'm ahead of them

47:48.240 --> 47:50.200
on what the new tribe were to adapt.

47:50.200 --> 47:52.120
I want to buzz in.

47:52.120 --> 47:52.960
Yeah.

47:52.960 --> 47:53.840
I want to buzz in on that.

47:53.840 --> 47:55.280
OK.

47:55.280 --> 47:58.840
The best place to get those thick ass pancakes,

47:58.840 --> 48:00.280
the daddy likes.

48:00.280 --> 48:01.000
What does it do, Paul?

48:01.000 --> 48:01.520
That's right.

48:01.520 --> 48:03.200
That's what I would say.

48:03.200 --> 48:04.200
I'm not guessing again.

48:04.200 --> 48:09.240
I'm already in the black, so that would be my guess.

48:09.240 --> 48:11.840
That's not really not correct.

48:11.840 --> 48:13.200
Where is all day, baby?

48:13.200 --> 48:13.880
OK.

48:13.880 --> 48:15.640
But I'm not going to take any away from you

48:15.640 --> 48:18.240
because two cars also does have thick pancakes.

48:18.240 --> 48:19.840
And it sort of depends on what you're talking about.

48:19.840 --> 48:22.240
Well, this is iconic LA fair, right?

48:22.240 --> 48:22.680
Yeah.

48:22.760 --> 48:26.480
So two cars, which is an LA institution,

48:26.480 --> 48:30.240
it's where Bosch's wife got shot on the TV show Bosch.

48:30.240 --> 48:33.520
And it has been like a part of the sort of grow

48:33.520 --> 48:37.200
farmers market and existed for whatever 50 years, 60 years.

48:37.200 --> 48:38.520
You just have three locations.

48:38.520 --> 48:41.200
And yeah, one is iconic.

48:41.200 --> 48:42.400
The sign is iconic.

48:42.400 --> 48:43.560
The pies are iconic.

48:43.560 --> 48:45.760
And the pancakes are famous.

48:45.760 --> 48:48.600
Like all of their stuff says the world's best pancakes.

48:48.600 --> 48:52.640
All day, baby has existed for 46 months.

48:52.640 --> 48:53.000
Yeah.

48:53.000 --> 48:53.480
Yeah.

48:53.480 --> 48:56.440
And, but it's just a specific location.

48:56.440 --> 48:58.440
So it is not iconic LA fair.

48:58.440 --> 49:00.840
Can I just say though, like LA's obvious,

49:00.840 --> 49:04.880
it's always been a city of transplants and try telling

49:04.880 --> 49:10.360
that to somebody who moved to like Larissa Street two months ago.

49:10.360 --> 49:12.600
Gladly.

49:12.600 --> 49:15.600
Sean, he just did try doing that.

49:15.600 --> 49:16.600
OK.

49:16.600 --> 49:19.960
Joan did he in Los Angeles for 100, please?

49:19.960 --> 49:21.440
In a pool, probably.

49:26.040 --> 49:26.760
Buzz.

49:26.760 --> 49:27.200
Yep.

49:27.200 --> 49:31.440
Where did Joan Diddy in lose her virginity?

49:31.440 --> 49:32.280
Oh my god.

49:32.280 --> 49:33.440
What?

49:33.440 --> 49:35.440
I'm trying to get in the mine of his collection.

49:35.440 --> 49:36.240
That was so pretty.

49:36.240 --> 49:37.640
Come on.

49:37.640 --> 49:38.240
I don't know.

49:38.240 --> 49:40.480
This whole game show is kind of absurd.

49:40.480 --> 49:43.600
It's going to be like where Joan Diddy and her son were doing.

49:43.600 --> 49:43.960
Yeah.

49:43.960 --> 49:45.960
What was the last thing you said?

49:45.960 --> 49:46.960
Me?

49:46.960 --> 49:47.960
Yeah.

49:47.960 --> 49:48.960
Yeah.

49:48.960 --> 49:49.960
That day.

49:49.960 --> 49:50.960
Oh yeah.

49:50.960 --> 49:51.960
That's all.

49:51.960 --> 49:53.960
Nobody else wants to take a guess.

49:53.960 --> 49:54.960
Casey.

49:54.960 --> 49:56.960
Can you can play?

49:56.960 --> 49:58.960
Well, sort of like a guess swing.

49:58.960 --> 50:00.960
Go in a friend.

50:00.960 --> 50:02.960
And a pool probably.

50:02.960 --> 50:06.960
Jeff wrote the answers.

50:06.960 --> 50:09.960
Oh, now.

50:09.960 --> 50:12.960
I'm going to pass it to Kevin.

50:12.960 --> 50:15.960
Where was Joan when President Nixon resigned?

50:15.960 --> 50:16.960
Okay.

50:16.960 --> 50:20.960
That's just inferred because she was also in a pool when she found out about the Manson

50:20.960 --> 50:21.960
murders.

50:21.960 --> 50:22.960
Interesting.

50:22.960 --> 50:23.960
What do you know?

50:23.960 --> 50:24.960
White album.

50:24.960 --> 50:25.960
Amir controls the board for some reason.

50:25.960 --> 50:27.960
Fair found out about the Manson.

50:27.960 --> 50:28.960
Well, what if I had?

50:28.960 --> 50:29.960
What?

50:29.960 --> 50:31.960
Hey, did you hear?

50:31.960 --> 50:33.960
What if I guess?

50:33.960 --> 50:34.960
Yeah.

50:34.960 --> 50:36.960
There's a guy named there's been no problem.

50:36.960 --> 50:37.960
The Manson murders.

50:37.960 --> 50:38.960
There'd be no problem.

50:38.960 --> 50:39.960
Yeah.

50:39.960 --> 50:43.960
There might be like piss because all of these are really specific and a little bit subjective,

50:43.960 --> 50:45.960
but like there's room for error here.

50:45.960 --> 50:46.960
Like I did give one.

50:46.960 --> 50:48.960
Like he's like, yeah, every hundred dollars.

50:48.960 --> 50:49.960
Yeah.

50:49.960 --> 50:52.960
Fairfax hidden gems for a hundred.

50:52.960 --> 50:57.960
An outdoor mall with a locals only air to it.

50:57.960 --> 51:01.960
An outdoor mall with a locals only air to it.

51:01.960 --> 51:02.960
It's on Fairfax.

51:02.960 --> 51:04.960
Post is saying.

51:04.960 --> 51:07.960
Is it the girl?

51:07.960 --> 51:09.960
Correct.

51:09.960 --> 51:10.960
Okay.

51:10.960 --> 51:11.960
Wow.

51:11.960 --> 51:12.960
Sometimes it's pretty straightforward.

51:12.960 --> 51:15.960
Sean is making up some ways to grow.

51:15.960 --> 51:16.960
Okay.

51:16.960 --> 51:19.960
You think the grove is giving off a locals only.

51:19.960 --> 51:21.960
I've never felt welcome there.

51:21.960 --> 51:23.960
So you're not a local.

51:23.960 --> 51:26.960
You just moved to low risk history.

51:26.960 --> 51:29.960
Sean controls the bloodstand Fairfax hidden gems.

51:29.960 --> 51:31.960
Let's, you know, 200.

51:31.960 --> 51:32.960
Yeah, 200, please.

51:32.960 --> 51:33.960
Where are you from?

51:33.960 --> 51:34.960
I'm from Cleveland, Ohio.

51:34.960 --> 51:35.960
Okay.

51:35.960 --> 51:38.960
This is like, this is a night like.

51:38.960 --> 51:40.960
We could have started there.

51:40.960 --> 51:41.960
Like there's a lot.

51:41.960 --> 51:44.960
If you guys are open to it, we should have just done a wax episode.

51:44.960 --> 51:46.960
It seems like it would really literally what I said.

51:46.960 --> 51:47.960
Yeah.

51:47.960 --> 51:51.960
If you stick around here long enough, you might even be able to see Drew Kerry.

51:51.960 --> 51:54.960
IRL the grove again.

51:54.960 --> 51:56.960
Not correct.

51:56.960 --> 51:57.960
CBS.

51:57.960 --> 51:59.960
That's absolutely correct.

51:59.960 --> 52:00.960
Yeah, sure.

52:00.960 --> 52:01.960
I go.

52:01.960 --> 52:02.960
Did you minimize?

52:02.960 --> 52:03.960
Okay.

52:04.960 --> 52:05.960
So I get 200 more dollars.

52:05.960 --> 52:08.960
You do get, ultimately, you're up, you're up 500 dollars.

52:08.960 --> 52:09.960
Okay.

52:09.960 --> 52:11.960
Um, Sean, I get to zero.

52:11.960 --> 52:13.960
Hayes controls the board.

52:13.960 --> 52:15.960
Let's go back to Gower for 100 dollars.

52:15.960 --> 52:17.960
All things Gower for 100.

52:17.960 --> 52:18.960
White.

52:18.960 --> 52:19.960
White.

52:19.960 --> 52:20.960
White.

52:25.960 --> 52:26.960
So we're looking for a question.

52:26.960 --> 52:29.960
The answer is a white, about Gower.

52:29.960 --> 52:30.960
Uh, buzz in.

52:30.960 --> 52:32.960
What is the, what color is the word Gower?

52:32.960 --> 52:34.960
On street signs.

52:34.960 --> 52:35.960
Oh.

52:35.960 --> 52:36.960
It's done.

52:36.960 --> 52:37.960
Incorrect.

52:37.960 --> 52:39.960
It was just as good a guess as I.

52:43.960 --> 52:46.960
I'm, I'm ready to, I'm ready to see what the answer is.

52:46.960 --> 52:47.960
Yeah.

52:47.960 --> 52:48.960
Okay.

52:48.960 --> 52:51.960
Um, what was early Hollywood pioneer John T. Gower's race?

52:51.960 --> 52:52.960
Okay.

52:52.960 --> 52:53.960
Okay.

52:53.960 --> 52:54.960
What are you guys considering that?

52:54.960 --> 52:57.960
So I was thinking about people.

52:57.960 --> 53:00.960
I was wondering, like, you know, people who live on Gower.

53:01.960 --> 53:03.960
I feel like these were designed in a way.

53:03.960 --> 53:05.960
Which they do encourage you to do on Jeopardy.

53:05.960 --> 53:08.960
Where you just like pick a category and just kind of go in order.

53:08.960 --> 53:09.960
Yeah.

53:09.960 --> 53:12.960
And so the sequence of the answers was what was John T.

53:12.960 --> 53:13.960
Gower's race.

53:13.960 --> 53:14.960
White.

53:14.960 --> 53:15.960
White.

53:15.960 --> 53:18.960
What is this even mastering facility on Gower?

53:18.960 --> 53:19.960
That was the second one.

53:19.960 --> 53:20.960
Okay.

53:20.960 --> 53:21.960
It was Bernie.

53:21.960 --> 53:22.960
Bernie.

53:22.960 --> 53:23.960
Okay.

53:23.960 --> 53:25.960
And then it was the, the Gower goaches.

53:25.960 --> 53:26.960
Then they made for John T. Gower's.

53:26.960 --> 53:27.960
Grundle.

53:27.960 --> 53:28.960
Grundle.

53:28.960 --> 53:29.960
Yeah.

53:29.960 --> 53:32.960
So that that makes my lose your virginity guess.

53:32.960 --> 53:33.960
Make more sense, right?

53:33.960 --> 53:35.960
Because he does sometimes go.

53:35.960 --> 53:37.960
Well, depends on what I don't think you go that far.

53:37.960 --> 53:38.960
I didn't think it was a bad one.

53:38.960 --> 53:39.960
100 point question.

53:39.960 --> 53:41.960
I didn't think it was a bad guess.

53:41.960 --> 53:43.960
What are all I was filming to that.

53:43.960 --> 53:46.960
Is it feels like nobody's been able to get their footing?

53:46.960 --> 53:47.960
Let's go iconic.

53:47.960 --> 53:48.960
I fire 100.

53:48.960 --> 53:50.960
I kind of got a fair list of it.

53:50.960 --> 53:52.960
That's like you can almost buy two of those out of orange.

53:52.960 --> 53:56.960
Under cook beef with a side of corn and potato hash.

53:57.960 --> 53:58.960
Oh.

54:06.960 --> 54:09.960
This is probably like since I know the area.

54:09.960 --> 54:10.960
Yeah.

54:10.960 --> 54:11.960
Operating.

54:11.960 --> 54:14.960
I'm guessing this has something to do with like the Tamo shanter.

54:14.960 --> 54:16.960
But I'm not actually guessing that.

54:16.960 --> 54:17.960
I won't give it to you.

54:17.960 --> 54:18.960
Okay.

54:18.960 --> 54:19.960
That's a really good.

54:19.960 --> 54:22.960
It is the prime rib from Louries prime rib.

54:22.960 --> 54:23.960
Okay.

54:23.960 --> 54:31.020
Equally as iconic is the Tamoshancer. Okay, great. So hey, it controls the board. You're also seemingly doing really well

54:31.020 --> 54:36.320
Let's go back to iconic away fair. How to get kicked out of Nizawa bar?

54:42.520 --> 54:44.520
Ask for a cut roll

54:46.160 --> 54:48.160
That's interesting

54:48.840 --> 54:54.020
The great the answer we're looking for is what is by doing the Omakase and then complaining why they don't have fries

54:55.640 --> 54:57.640
Sean controls the board

54:58.440 --> 55:04.120
Okay, Fairfax hidden gems please for 300 a place where pessimists like to eat

55:05.320 --> 55:12.840
Oh, isn't there a place called a thing it like last half empty or something? Yeah, it's called something like that like a bar called glass half empty

55:12.840 --> 55:14.840
Yeah

55:15.120 --> 55:22.120
So that's a mirror's guess. Is that your guess is officially if it's right. I'll take it. I'll take it. I'll take it. Yeah, man. That was bait

55:22.680 --> 55:24.680
What is canter's belly? Why?

55:24.680 --> 55:30.240
What can't I see? What's so why you give me the board? Sure

55:31.480 --> 55:35.680
Let's go back to Joan Dittian's Los Angeles. This category community

55:37.200 --> 55:39.200
Okay

55:39.200 --> 55:44.000
I'm ready for the answer what was Dittian surprised to find

55:44.840 --> 55:51.040
While living in her pacific coast highway house. I'm not that's interesting because

55:52.520 --> 55:54.520
When the Santa Anna's blowing and

55:55.320 --> 55:59.800
While the fire is ablaze and it's aligned often times

56:00.520 --> 56:06.880
The residents of Malibu have to kind of bend together. What book is that from? This is not a quote. This is a set that's I'm sitting

56:08.720 --> 56:14.400
Let's do Barnes-a-doll art parks fault. Of course for 200

56:15.000 --> 56:18.200
Another one of Barnes-a-doll art parks faults. I'm

56:19.400 --> 56:25.800
Gonna say just so we'd like get through it faster. I'm gonna potentially give up 200 dollars by saying too many stairs

56:29.120 --> 56:34.580
We were looking for what is it's sort of like tone definitely towers over a mixed-in come neighbor

56:34.580 --> 56:41.880
With its manicured grounds flashy mansion and taunting jackarandas. I mean, how would you feel if you were in hospice at Kaiser?

56:42.040 --> 56:49.080
Peering out your window and seeing a group of pansexual esthetes at a birthday picnic drinking petnath from cans and don't say

56:49.080 --> 56:54.360
But it's so bad. It's like a petite natural. It's like a sparkling one and don't say

56:54.360 --> 56:58.200
But it's open to the public because I've never felt welcome there

56:58.200 --> 57:01.840
That's what you always have said about the growth. I don't feel welcome here

57:02.680 --> 57:10.120
Okay, let's do art parks faults for 300 a third fault of Barnes-a-doll art park

57:11.080 --> 57:13.080
Wonder if it's the bathroom thing now

57:15.640 --> 57:21.600
What is no snack house? It felt like it was gonna be a short we did like a short one and then one was really long

57:21.600 --> 57:23.600
And then he did like

57:25.240 --> 57:30.280
Yeah, so that's that's the in the in the vein of what I expected and that's the last one

57:32.920 --> 57:34.920
What do we normally get in terms of

57:35.880 --> 57:46.840
What's jeopardy how many commenters are we talking about like is it round like a hundred for episode 80 doesn't and really how many?

57:48.440 --> 57:50.440
Yeah, that sounds very

57:50.440 --> 57:52.440
Wow

57:53.160 --> 57:55.800
They go crazy for Jeffery though. Okay

57:57.000 --> 58:03.720
What are all these other there's so many other tabs open. There's a bookmarks, right? How those are bookmarks? Okay

58:04.440 --> 58:06.440
Two different banks

58:06.440 --> 58:09.440
Yeah, well bank of America. I just want to say like

58:10.800 --> 58:14.240
Would you guys start working with this podcast now work? Yes, I

58:15.440 --> 58:18.680
Feel like a lot of prom I add really high expectations

58:21.840 --> 58:23.840
So far

58:24.080 --> 58:32.160
We've had one audio failure one video failure. That's like been like sort of what has taken place in the last two to four weeks and now I learn

58:32.720 --> 58:38.000
That the host of the head-gump podcast is selling out 250 c

58:38.640 --> 58:40.000
theaters

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Doing the show really did that once

58:42.200 --> 58:47.920
It's a hundred commenters for every episode that he puts on YouTube and

58:48.560 --> 58:51.880
And it's in a position to be bookmarking two different banks

58:53.160 --> 58:58.120
He needs to bookmark two different banks. Well, bank of America's my checking account

58:58.240 --> 59:03.000
Well, as far as my credit card and then UFB direct is actually my savings because they have a five percent APY

59:03.160 --> 59:07.340
So it's like if you're gonna park your money somewhere have access to it. You might as well even make money on your money

59:08.800 --> 59:10.800
APY

59:10.800 --> 59:11.800
plugs

59:11.800 --> 59:14.080
What do you guys want to point the people to

59:14.760 --> 59:20.160
Social media the show? I guess the head-gump podcast. Yeah, I mean

59:22.000 --> 59:27.600
Feels like the only way we're gonna get traction here is if we can keep doing this show

59:27.600 --> 59:34.120
You can somehow be associated with love to do a wax episode with you guys to sort of what do you do one again soon?

59:36.120 --> 59:44.080
Yeah, I just think you say people are like really responding to love Jeffordy Jeffordy is like a number one rice song probably number two

59:44.080 --> 59:47.400
You this was a best of episode. This is good as it gets

59:52.560 --> 59:54.560
Gone sold out

59:54.560 --> 59:59.880
Like calling this the head-gump podcast. I just feel like it's doesn't it's not like connecting back to

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:08.120
Head-gump really like I don't know. I am search and like trying to find purchase here at this place at head-gump

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:14.800
Well, it started as like a happy hour just talking to people at the network. That sounds great. Yeah, like that sounds really

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:21.680
Like people are just like passing through. They're they're all chilling. Yeah, this is like bizarrely formal

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:27.520
It's like very regimented. I feel like we didn't get to know. There's a lot of room to move

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:37.280
Yeah, exactly. There gotta be something in between a wax episode, which I've told people don't want. Yeah, wax is too loose. I think it's too much

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:44.760
People like staffers at the network like the segments I think because they don't have to participate as much

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:49.560
Maybe the mistake is that you guys bring a lot to the table and we don't need as much of an outline

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:56.280
Yeah, yeah, maybe maybe maybe I'm the problem. I agree. Yeah

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.960
Maybe it was us bringing too much to the table. Yeah, yeah

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.640
Social media

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:10.720
No, no, Max. No, I'm here. Oh my god. Follow me on Instagram

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:17.320
You're still trying to sell your Instagram handle, right? Yeah, still trying to sell that. What is it? Just a mirror

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:26.200
Subscribe to the flavor of one. Subscribe to the flavor of one. Yeah, give the buddy directly to the Patriot page

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:32.940
And do you used to have a Twitter handle that like you changed it and so you like lost your little star

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:39.920
What I might it used to be Jake in here. It was very fight and then I moved it to just bloom and filled right and then I lost you

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:45.000
There too. We're going your kind of separate ways on stuff creatively. No, really that

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.040
But yeah, we want it to separate and personal and I have a plug. Yeah, minus the Jake. Yeah

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:59.640
Vimeo dot com slash lonely and horny lonely and horny. Well, the poster says the long name. I see. Yes, do you not know that

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:05.480
Was there's a type on the poster in the kitchen? It should have read there. You don't know that it says Lonely and horny

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.680
My bed my kitchen said it should say Lonely and Hanway

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:18.680
Yeah, I've only been here two to four weeks. Yeah, that's a long time to note the type the typo is buried

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.120
It's it's really hard to find so it's really well

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:27.720
It's interesting that it should be easier to find because that's how that's what you need people to be going to yeah

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:33.400
It's like the one actionable thing in the poster my pitch actually is that it should be

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:37.640
Lorne Lee and horny and horny and horny calling

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.760
I'm trying to get it wet the sweet gun

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.760
I'm looking to bust

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:54.040
At Jeffrey James on Instagram at Jeffrey already on Twitter. We'll see you guys again next week

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.280
You

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.320
That was a hit-dum original

WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head gum original.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Downboard and...

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
There you go.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
No way.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
We still can't hear you.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Is this the bit?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
This is all play.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Episode one.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
This is his plan the whole time.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
He's not going back for 45 minutes.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Yeah.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
How are you guys doing?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
How's your cock, Grayson?

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
There's no getting away from this.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Here we go.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Nope.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
You cannot hear us?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
All right.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
And then can you hear this?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yes.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Great.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
All right.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
We should have done the thing where even when he comes back,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
we all pretend to still not hear him.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
That was a disaster.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
I'm going to see how much of that I can keep in.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
But first let's talk about Joel's shirt.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
So I texted all of you.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
This is the Tuesday before this episode comes out on this Friday saying,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Hey, sorry for the last minute ask.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Can you guys do this show?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
You're all here.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Thank you very much.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Joel said should we all wear the same outfit?

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
Not only is there one more person than usual on today's episode.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
But to assume that any of us have the same shirt enough to wear it to match beyond a white tea

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
and more specifically manscaped.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
It's a travesty.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I actually do have a manscaped shirt.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
I just chose not to wear it.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
There's no way.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
I do.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I do too.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
I do too.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
I do not have a manscaped.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I'm a brand and ball cedore.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
That's really good.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
How has that not ever been pitched to them?

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
This is like ad agencies never know what to do.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
But let's talk about it.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
How do you guys manscaped?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
It's pretty self explanatory.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Not like how do you do it.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
But like what do you like to keep?

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
Great.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
Grayson.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
I'll pass.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
That's how this episode is going to go.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
You could plug to keep it.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I like to keep a trim.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Sure.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
I like to keep a trim.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Sure.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
It's scorched earth for me.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
What do you mean you were burned?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
No.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Laser hair.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Actually from the waist down.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
There's no way.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
It's all hair.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Yeah.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Why?

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I like to be slick and smooth, man.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Joel.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
How do you manscaped?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
I like the trim.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
What I didn't fact get a Brazilian.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Not too long ago.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
When and why?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
And where?

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
This was actually the week before I started working at head gum.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
So you wanted to be ready for the treat never so bad.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
It was exactly that.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
I came in last in my fantasy football league.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Oh, there you go.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
So was it incredibly painful?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
It was.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
I explained.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I explained like the the bet situation.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I was like, oh, it's going to take a little easier.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
You know, I don't really care about this Brazilian so much.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
And the woman said, no, you paid for Brazilian.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
I'm going to give you a Brazilian.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
So.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
What?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Good.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
For a principle.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
A waxer of principle.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Yeah.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
She's a perfectionist.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Which you do want if you're getting a Brazilian.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Yeah.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
I heard a little.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
I just would rather it hurt a lot and be perfect.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Yeah.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
That makes sense to me.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
We also, we should get her on this show because she's great at waxing.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
That was pretty good.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Casey, who do you think is the best dressed on the pod today?

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
And don't say Joel for the love of God.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
Oh, wow.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
You know?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Brad's already celebrating.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Yeah, Brad.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
Brad does look pretty good.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Brad and Jeff are wearing similar outfits though.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
Yeah, but Brad both of his items of clothes like one up me.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Like my t-shirt is fine.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
His is good.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
And then your hat looks like it costs actual money instead of being found on a street.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Yeah, Brad, what does it say in your hat?

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Channel, channel five.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Channel five news.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Shut up.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah, Brad.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Brad takes it for me.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
For me.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
I feel like I was going to give it to Brad until he said that.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
What which locally news up to me or not up to you.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
You.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
I just am shocked.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
He already said me, Jeff.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
All right.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
All right.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Congratulations.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Brad.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Thank you.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Joel.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
I'm glad you're back on the show because your debut episode.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
I've never prepared anything.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
And I feel like it puts you in a really tough spot.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
It did.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
So this time you also didn't prepare.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
This time I had shit.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
You texted us like two hours ago.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Yeah, but I had an episode outline.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
I changed the last segment to be more specific.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Here's the life update for me.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
I had COVID two Saturday days ago till this upcoming this past Saturday.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
And then I had to move all my shit.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
I already told Joel this.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Um, over the weekend.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
And so I'm fucking exhausted.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
I still feel.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Run down.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Body sore.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Mine, isn't right.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Throde is feeling still.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Honestly.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Little tight.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
And I don't know who to ask for help from in general.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
Forget how I'm feeling today.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.760
Was this thought you were going to wrap in the middle there when the middle part

06:55.760 --> 07:00.760
Yeah, I was waiting for what kind of song was coming up.

07:00.760 --> 07:03.760
How many times have you had COVID now?

07:03.760 --> 07:06.760
That's going to be, I'm in the three timers club.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.760
You're the only one.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.760
No, I know.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.760
And I also did nothing like dirt until I got vaccinated.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.760
So I'm actually pissed about it.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.760
Like I went nowhere.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.760
I was locked down, locked down,

07:20.760 --> 07:23.760
did everything right according to CDC shit.

07:23.760 --> 07:26.760
And even then some, and now I've had it three times.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.760
How is that fair to me?

07:29.760 --> 07:32.760
You get a CDC warning on this video.

07:34.760 --> 07:37.760
I've got a lot of CDC warnings on shit.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.760
Even shit that I don't mention vaccines.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.760
I don't mention COVID.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.760
They're just like, just this might give you a virus.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.760
If you look at this photo of him.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.760
Let's talk about everybody's.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.760
Let's just get it over with.

07:50.760 --> 07:54.760
I hate doing this segment, but I have to commit to it because I think it will eventually get funny again.

07:54.760 --> 07:55.760
Um.

08:03.760 --> 08:04.760
I bond to the week as Dakota Johnson.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.760
It's time for a bondage.

08:11.760 --> 08:12.760
That'll do.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.760
bond DSM.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.760
Honestly, they already did that.

08:16.760 --> 08:20.760
And Casino Royale, the guys doing like cock and ball torture on his ass.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.760
On his ass or.

08:26.760 --> 08:30.760
Imagine that scene every time the like roaps swung up and hit him.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.760
It went into his ass and then back out.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.760
That would be as painful, I think.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.760
Brad, are you into CBT?

08:38.760 --> 08:40.760
CBT?

08:40.760 --> 08:41.760
CBT?

08:41.760 --> 08:42.760
Call torture.

08:42.760 --> 08:43.760
Fuck.

08:43.760 --> 08:44.760
No.

08:44.760 --> 08:47.760
Or is that more of a Joel thing?

08:47.760 --> 08:50.760
I mean, you did get a Brazilian.

08:50.760 --> 08:51.760
Yeah.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.760
It was primed.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.760
Um, do you guys have any bond to the week?

09:00.760 --> 09:03.760
You don't all have to have one this week.

09:03.760 --> 09:04.760
I do.

09:04.760 --> 09:05.760
Yeah.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.760
Yeah.

09:07.760 --> 09:08.760
Uh.

09:08.760 --> 09:09.760
Great.

09:09.760 --> 09:10.760
Um.

09:10.760 --> 09:11.760
Uh.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.760
Daniel Craig.

09:18.760 --> 09:19.760
That's a good one.

09:19.760 --> 09:20.760
Thank you.

09:20.760 --> 09:21.760
I thought so.

09:21.760 --> 09:22.760
I feel like you do well.

09:22.760 --> 09:23.760
Yeah.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.760
You're like first week working at a casting office.

09:26.760 --> 09:29.760
I feel like you've done it before.

09:29.760 --> 09:33.760
The one thing like there's a bunch of actors on the board.

09:33.760 --> 09:37.760
The thing with these guys is they haven't proven themselves like Craig.

09:38.760 --> 09:39.760
We know he can do it.

09:39.760 --> 09:44.760
Why wouldn't we just go with the sure thing?

09:44.760 --> 09:45.760
Uh, Brad.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.760
Sean Connery's ghost.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.760
Is he dead?

09:50.760 --> 09:51.760
Yeah.

09:51.760 --> 09:52.760
He is dead.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.760
I thought you were going to say Sean Kingston.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.760
All right.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.760
He's saying that beautiful girl songs.

09:58.760 --> 09:59.760
Yeah.

09:59.760 --> 10:00.760
Yeah.

10:00.760 --> 10:01.760
And I five.

10:01.760 --> 10:02.760
Yeah.

10:02.760 --> 10:06.760
Plus with Sean, you don't have to pay a second celebrity to write the theme song.

10:07.760 --> 10:14.760
A Sean Kingston bomb theme.

10:14.760 --> 10:21.760
Where all them beautiful girls.

10:21.760 --> 10:22.760
Bomb girls.

10:22.760 --> 10:23.760
Yeah.

10:23.760 --> 10:25.760
That was just the song.

10:25.760 --> 10:27.760
They can reuse it.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.760
It fits.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.760
Um.

10:32.760 --> 10:33.760
All right.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.760
Nobody has any other bond of weeks.

10:36.760 --> 10:37.760
All right.

10:37.760 --> 10:42.760
Then I take it into the news of the day here.

10:42.760 --> 10:43.760
Um.

10:43.760 --> 10:49.760
Side by side, Florida mansions built for identical twins asks 54 million dollars.

10:49.760 --> 10:50.760
So wait.

10:50.760 --> 10:54.760
You said at the beginning that you had prepared for this episode, right?

10:54.760 --> 10:56.760
This is me preparing.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.760
Okay.

10:58.760 --> 10:59.760
Yeah.

10:59.760 --> 11:07.760
And the two versions built for identical twins are coming on the market together for 54 million dollars.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.760
Each.

11:09.760 --> 11:10.760
Uh, for the pair.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.760
So it's actually kind of a deal.

11:12.760 --> 11:13.760
Yeah.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.760
Where in Florida?

11:15.760 --> 11:16.760
Glad you asked.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.760
Um, I think Fort Lauderdale.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.760
I'm from those parts.

11:21.760 --> 11:22.760
Really?

11:22.760 --> 11:25.760
Oh, lucky to get in southwest ranches.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.760
I don't know where that is.

11:27.760 --> 11:28.760
Yeah.

11:28.760 --> 11:29.760
Yeah.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.760
Sounds like a good deal.

11:31.760 --> 11:34.760
Are they identical or?

11:34.760 --> 11:35.760
Honestly.

11:35.760 --> 11:36.760
Yeah.

11:36.760 --> 11:37.760
Kind of.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.760
I mean, you want to see this?

11:39.760 --> 11:41.760
Yeah.

11:41.760 --> 11:52.760
Like I feel like these houses have as about as many differences as physically the twins might.

11:52.760 --> 11:56.760
But the mansions are also identical.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.760
I mean, it seems to be, I mean, this tower isn't on this one.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.760
Honestly, if I'm choosing between the two, I'm leaning this way.

12:01.760 --> 12:02.760
Yeah.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.760
I feel like I'm looking at one of those, like, spot the difference.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.760
Uh, games.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.760
Yeah.

12:08.760 --> 12:12.760
But you don't know what this one looks like on the other side or vice versa.

12:12.760 --> 12:15.760
Does it say anything about the twins that they were built for?

12:15.760 --> 12:17.760
Was it like the fucking island boys or something?

12:17.760 --> 12:18.760
Yeah.

12:18.760 --> 12:22.760
So they're owned by a chiropractor Robert Lewin and his wife, Lisa Lewin.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.760
But that's not actually the twins.

12:25.760 --> 12:26.760
Okay.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.760
Do you subscribe to the Wall Street Journal?

12:30.760 --> 12:31.760
I don't.

12:31.760 --> 12:39.760
I have Apple news though, which I think gives you some limited access to every publication.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.760
Uh, how about this?

12:40.760 --> 12:47.760
A prominent scientist posted a an image of a distant star he said was taken by the web telescope.

12:47.760 --> 12:50.760
It was actually a slice of chorizo.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.760
I heard about this.

12:52.760 --> 12:53.760
Yeah.

12:53.760 --> 12:58.760
Was it was this a prank?

12:58.760 --> 12:59.760
Uh, yeah.

12:59.760 --> 13:03.760
I don't, well, I don't know if it was a joke or not.

13:03.760 --> 13:04.760
That's the issue.

13:04.760 --> 13:10.760
When, when I first saw this, I thought it was that tick talk that how he Mandel posted of the prolapse

13:10.760 --> 13:11.760
Stainace.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.760
Mm-hmm.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.760
Have you guys seen that?

13:15.760 --> 13:16.760
Right.

13:16.760 --> 13:17.760
Yeah.

13:17.760 --> 13:18.760
I have seen that.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.760
How he Mandel just posted a tick talk of a prolapse

13:21.760 --> 13:24.760
Stainace and it went super viral.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.760
He's a weird dude.

13:27.760 --> 13:30.760
Kim Kardashian once he didn't know that.

13:30.760 --> 13:31.760
Who wants that?

13:31.760 --> 13:32.760
No.

13:32.760 --> 13:33.760
It's fine.

13:33.760 --> 13:37.760
Kim Kardashian once you don't know that her bones are extremely dense.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.760
She wants food and now.

13:39.760 --> 13:40.760
How?

13:40.760 --> 13:43.760
Who specifically are you talking to?

13:43.760 --> 13:44.760
Oh.

13:44.760 --> 13:45.760
Kim.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.760
Kim.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.760
Call me.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.760
Um, yeah.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.760
She also, uh, did a body skin.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.760
Um, 18.8% body fat.

13:58.760 --> 14:02.760
So I think she was reaching out to Grace and to see if Rocky Mountain athletics

14:02.760 --> 14:04.760
would be able to get her down to 15.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.760
And he's two weeks in a row of great plugs.

14:07.760 --> 14:08.760
Yeah.

14:08.760 --> 14:09.760
Great.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.760
Grace and you are like a fitness guy.

14:11.760 --> 14:12.760
This is a good question for you.

14:12.760 --> 14:13.760
And Brad, you are too.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.760
But you're like, like, the way Brad does fitness.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.760
It's like, oh, he's just having fun in his life.

14:17.760 --> 14:18.760
He's incorporating into his life.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.760
Grace and on Instagram, it looks like he's putting himself through like physical and mental

14:21.760 --> 14:24.760
anguish just to feel something.

14:24.760 --> 14:31.760
Anyway, Grace and specifically, what do you think the best body fat to have is?

14:31.760 --> 14:33.760
Like the best body fat percentage.

14:33.760 --> 14:34.760
Yeah.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.760
And then also what type of body fat.

14:36.760 --> 14:37.760
Yeah.

14:37.760 --> 14:41.760
I'm going to go with 7.7%.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.760
So it's a joke answer.

14:42.760 --> 14:45.760
Are you being serious?

14:45.760 --> 14:48.760
I mean, that would be cool to have.

14:48.760 --> 14:51.760
If you had that, you'd be real.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.760
But like for health, what do you say?

14:54.760 --> 14:57.760
Probably in the 10 to 15 range.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.760
Actually, I'm just going to go 15.

14:59.760 --> 15:00.760
That's going to be my answer.

15:00.760 --> 15:01.760
Final answer.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.760
Lock it in.

15:02.760 --> 15:03.760
All right.

15:03.760 --> 15:04.760
What are you at?

15:04.760 --> 15:08.760
I'm at, well, my thing said 12, but I don't buy that.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.760
What thing?

15:10.760 --> 15:14.760
The like scale thing that you hold.

15:15.760 --> 15:20.760
The fucking the electricity thing.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.760
The monitor.

15:22.760 --> 15:26.760
A plumber told me that I looked about 10% of the fat.

15:26.760 --> 15:30.760
And I took his word as gospel.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.760
But I think I'm probably more like 14 or 15.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.760
That's perfect.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.760
And I'd like to get down to like 10 or 7 points.

15:38.760 --> 15:41.760
I'm a dietitian and it's not time to stop.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.760
That's the lodge.

15:43.760 --> 15:46.760
Pathological pathologizing emotional eating.

15:46.760 --> 15:47.760
It's okay.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.760
You're feeling sometimes.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.760
Says Christine Byrne.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.760
Is this news?

15:53.760 --> 15:56.760
The publication is called self.

15:59.760 --> 16:02.760
And hand.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.760
Well, this says, okay, so there's a poll quote too.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.760
That's not even like a part of the rest of it.

16:12.760 --> 16:16.760
And it just kind of yells at you that, of course, food is emotional.

16:20.760 --> 16:23.760
This is not only like an op-ed, but a puff piece.

16:23.760 --> 16:26.760
Jeff, what's the least emotional food?

16:26.760 --> 16:29.760
That's a really good do you have an answer?

16:29.760 --> 16:31.760
I mean, what I just saw on the screen was soy land,

16:31.760 --> 16:35.760
which is what I was thinking is kind of the least emotional food.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.760
That's like tech.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.760
That's not even food.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.760
What is this?

16:45.760 --> 16:48.760
This is my favorite one of so far.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.760
Um, Casey, I want you to read this headline.

16:58.760 --> 17:03.760
We bought a bargain of Italian home and added an elevator.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.760
That was the news.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.760
That's the news that we'll see in it.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.760
I'm Anderson Cooper.

17:16.760 --> 17:19.760
Yeah, but there's Italian homes for like rock bottom prices.

17:19.760 --> 17:22.760
I wonder if the five of us go in on sort of a bachelorino pad.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.760
Yeah, what's rock bottom in Italy?

17:25.760 --> 17:28.760
Uh, that's going to be the better part of $10 million.

17:28.760 --> 17:29.760
Hmm.

17:29.760 --> 17:33.760
No, I think they, I think you, I had, and I felt this account on Instagram called cheap dream homes,

17:33.760 --> 17:37.760
and you can get a place for like less than $200,000, like a three-bit room.

17:37.760 --> 17:38.760
Oh, where?

17:38.760 --> 17:39.760
In Italy?

17:39.760 --> 17:41.760
I wish.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.760
My peoleer Vermont.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.760
Uh, no, in Italy, yeah.

17:46.760 --> 17:47.760
Like the country said.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.760
So two of us have just bunk up.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.760
Or two groups of us.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.760
Well, Brad's not invited because it's only for bachelorino's.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.760
That's fine.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.760
Your voice cracked.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.760
I think he's going to cry.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.760
I'm fine.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.760
Uh, all right.

18:04.760 --> 18:10.760
We do have to take a quick break, but when we come back, we're going to put together something I'm

18:10.760 --> 18:12.760
think is really special.

18:22.760 --> 18:26.760
Now a word from our sponsor better help.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.760
Guys, how well would you take care of your car?

18:30.760 --> 18:34.760
If you had to keep the same one for the rest of your life, right?

18:34.760 --> 18:35.760
That's how our brains work.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.760
So why don't we treat them that way?

18:37.760 --> 18:41.760
How we care for our minds affects how we experience life.

18:41.760 --> 18:44.760
So it's important to invest time and care into keeping them healthy.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.760
And there are plenty of ways to support a healthy brain, like learning a new language,

18:47.760 --> 18:51.760
or taking power and apps, and then there's also better help online therapy.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.760
Now I go to therapy every week.

18:53.760 --> 18:55.760
Uh, I've talked about it a lot.

18:55.760 --> 18:59.760
On these ad reads, but it just, you know, the reason I go to therapy, and this is real,

18:59.760 --> 19:04.760
is to not only, so I can feel better about things and deal with my anxieties,

19:04.760 --> 19:07.760
and, you know, you know, the trials and tribulations that life will throughout,

19:07.760 --> 19:10.760
you know, no matter what your position in life is.

19:10.760 --> 19:15.760
Um, but also it's just so that I show up for people in my real personal life,

19:15.760 --> 19:17.760
as the best version of myself.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.760
Because I think if you love people, you love the people around you,

19:19.760 --> 19:22.760
whether romantically, familially, or just friendship, level,

19:22.760 --> 19:26.760
love, you owe it to them to be the best version of yourself.

19:26.760 --> 19:31.760
And anything less is unacceptable.

19:31.760 --> 19:35.760
Better offers online therapy that offers video, phone, and even live chats.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.760
Only therapy sessions.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.760
Uh, so you don't have to see anybody on camera if you don't want to.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.760
It's also much more affordable than in-person therapy,

19:41.760 --> 19:44.760
and you can be matched with a therapist in under 48 hours.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.760

21:55.760 --> 21:56.760
All right, August 16th.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.760
This episode comes out August, I think,

21:58.760 --> 22:03.760
19th summer is nary four weeks, nion ending.

22:03.760 --> 22:04.760
Right?

22:04.760 --> 22:07.760
And so I think that we have to maximize our summers in a certain way.

22:07.760 --> 22:11.760
With specific regards to swinging that thing.

22:14.760 --> 22:19.760
Let's talk about our 2022 summer bucket lists.

22:21.760 --> 22:23.760
What I, this is real.

22:23.760 --> 22:27.760
I want us all to come up with one sexual activity that we'd like to take part in.

22:27.760 --> 22:31.760
And then I want to have the same group on on September 22nd,

22:31.760 --> 22:33.760
the fall solstice this and report back.

22:33.760 --> 22:34.760
How was it?

22:34.760 --> 22:35.760
Do we like it?

22:35.760 --> 22:38.760
You know, maybe choose something that you're not sure if you're going to like it or not.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.760
Okay, I have a good answer for this.

22:42.760 --> 22:43.760
What's here?

22:43.760 --> 22:45.760
Shakespeare in the park.

22:45.760 --> 22:47.760
And is that, yeah?

22:47.760 --> 22:49.760
Is that a position?

22:51.760 --> 22:55.760
One of your legs is spread wide like the stage.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.760
The world's the stage.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.760
Ha ha ha.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.760
Um, care to elaborate.

23:04.760 --> 23:14.760
Uh, no, I just think it's a great summer outdoor activity to go and see with someone special.

23:14.760 --> 23:18.760
So you want to go on a date there and then just have normal sex afterwards.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.760
It won't be normal.

23:20.760 --> 23:21.760
But.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.760
Holy shit.

23:26.760 --> 23:28.760
That's fucking awesome, Joel.

23:34.760 --> 23:39.760
I was just talking to somebody about something I want to try.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.760
But I don't know if I want to divulge it here.

23:41.760 --> 23:43.760
And I don't even remember what it is.

23:43.760 --> 23:44.760
I would just say it.

23:44.760 --> 23:48.760
But I'm like, what was the thing that I was sheepish to bring up to a friend?

23:49.760 --> 23:50.760
Okay.

23:51.760 --> 23:55.760
He wants us to like, beg for him to say it.

23:55.760 --> 23:56.760
No, I don't know what it is.

23:56.760 --> 23:57.760
I kind of want to go last.

23:57.760 --> 23:58.760
Brad, you're married.

23:58.760 --> 24:00.760
So this is really attainable.

24:01.760 --> 24:02.760
Yeah.

24:03.760 --> 24:05.760
I can do whatever I want.

24:07.760 --> 24:12.760
Um, no, you have a partner that you trust that you can have communication with and say, hey, this is something I want to try next four weeks.

24:12.760 --> 24:13.760
You wish.

24:16.760 --> 24:19.760
I think we should have we should have my wife on the show.

24:19.760 --> 24:24.760
I think I would love we did a therapy episode between a mirror and obviously, I'd love to do that for you.

24:24.760 --> 24:25.760
And what's your name, Winona?

24:26.760 --> 24:27.760
No.

24:28.760 --> 24:29.760
Shot in the dark.

24:29.760 --> 24:30.760
But what if it was it?

24:30.760 --> 24:32.760
Not not close.

24:32.760 --> 24:33.760
Grace.

24:33.760 --> 24:34.760
And no.

24:34.760 --> 24:35.760
Hilled.

24:35.760 --> 24:36.760
Grace and.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.760
Grace and Hilled.

24:38.760 --> 24:39.760
Middle name.

24:39.760 --> 24:40.760
Yeah.

24:40.760 --> 24:41.760
Nigella.

24:41.760 --> 24:42.760
Hmm.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.760
Uh, no, what's your wife's name?

24:44.760 --> 24:45.760
First and last.

24:46.760 --> 24:47.760
To Meret.

24:49.760 --> 24:50.760
Okay.

24:50.760 --> 24:51.760
Yeah.

24:51.760 --> 24:54.760
Brad looks like he's going to beat the shit out of me.

24:54.760 --> 24:55.760
I think.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.760
When you look at what I did, I didn't say anything.

24:57.760 --> 24:58.760
Um.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.760
Some are fucking at least.

25:01.760 --> 25:02.760
I don't know.

25:02.760 --> 25:06.760
There's a couple waterfalls we want to run to.

25:09.760 --> 25:11.760
Remy, each other under.

25:12.760 --> 25:13.760
There's a.

25:13.760 --> 25:18.760
Like, I feel like you guys are treating those normally just like as a bucket list, which is fine.

25:18.760 --> 25:21.760
We can also do that, but I'm wondering if we answer the real question first.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.760
I mean, I brought up the how we mandal.

25:26.760 --> 25:27.760
Prolapse to anus.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.760
That's that's a medical emergency.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.760
That's not.

25:32.760 --> 25:36.760
You're in the middle of the forest, not near any medical help.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.760
And depending on Brad's landscaping.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.760
So is the prolapse danis.

25:41.760 --> 25:45.760
I mean, they say don't go chase in waterfalls.

25:45.760 --> 25:46.760
Right.

25:46.760 --> 25:47.760
So don't go.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.760
I also feel like you just did chase waterfalls over the weekend.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.760
I saw it on your Instagram story.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.760
Yeah, I went on a run.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.760
Casey.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.760
Um.

26:01.760 --> 26:07.760
Well, I'm not really, you know, dating right now and probably won't be.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.760
But the end of the summer.

26:10.760 --> 26:13.760
But shakes him in the park sounds pretty good.

26:13.760 --> 26:15.760
Are you going in New York?

26:15.760 --> 26:19.760
Or are you going to start doing hamlet at Griffith?

26:19.760 --> 26:20.760
Yeah.

26:20.760 --> 26:24.760
Yeah, I think I'll go to the old zoo and start doing hamlet.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.760
And then, you know, see what happens.

26:26.760 --> 26:28.760
Go and ham.

26:28.760 --> 26:30.760
Yeah.

26:30.760 --> 26:31.760
Um.

26:31.760 --> 26:34.760
You've a nine, some.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.760
Yeah.

26:35.760 --> 26:36.760
You know what?

26:36.760 --> 26:37.760
That's that's my.

26:37.760 --> 26:40.760
Fuck it with someone who would nine, so.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.760
In the next four weeks.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.760
You know, talking dirty and rhyming couplets.

26:44.760 --> 26:47.760
I had a.

26:47.760 --> 26:49.760
I had a pent up.

26:49.760 --> 26:50.760
Fuck me.

26:50.760 --> 26:51.760
I got up.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.760
All my pent up sexual tension.

26:53.760 --> 26:55.760
And I am a pentameter.

26:57.760 --> 27:00.760
That's good.

27:00.760 --> 27:02.760
That was easy.

27:02.760 --> 27:03.760
Um.

27:04.760 --> 27:07.760
Grayson, let's get yours in real fast.

27:07.760 --> 27:10.760
That's what she said.

27:10.760 --> 27:13.760
Oh, he cut out and it's almost a blessing in this kind of.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.760
I think he did that on purpose.

27:15.760 --> 27:16.760
How can you hear him?

27:16.760 --> 27:17.760
Can you hear me now?

27:17.760 --> 27:18.760
There you go.

27:18.760 --> 27:19.760
Ah.

27:19.760 --> 27:20.760
Okay.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.760
Well, we'll just move on.

27:22.760 --> 27:24.760
All right.

27:24.760 --> 27:25.760
Full steam ahead.

27:25.760 --> 27:26.760
Here we go.

27:33.760 --> 28:01.760
Welcome to Joel's goals.

28:01.760 --> 28:12.760
Joel, from one to ten, how successful do you consider yourself right now?

28:12.760 --> 28:19.760
I think success is something you can always strive for and never fully attain.

28:19.760 --> 28:26.760
So one.

28:27.760 --> 28:28.760
Yeah.

28:28.760 --> 28:30.760
You don't think so?

28:30.760 --> 28:33.760
No.

28:33.760 --> 28:38.760
You can gram Nash is sitting in the East Village being like, I have more to do.

28:38.760 --> 28:42.760
Who's gram Nash?

28:42.760 --> 28:44.760
Forget it.

28:44.760 --> 28:45.760
Forget it.

28:45.760 --> 28:46.760
Just.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.760
If you had to describe a numerical value.

28:48.760 --> 28:49.760
All right.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.760
Let's say like a three.

28:51.760 --> 28:52.760
I disagree with that as well.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.760
I put you out of seven.

28:55.760 --> 28:58.760
That's also because we have differing opinions on your ceiling.

28:58.760 --> 29:03.760
You think I'm pretty close to it.

29:03.760 --> 29:05.760
It's too as good as you can get.

29:05.760 --> 29:09.760
No, I just, but I mean, to your point though, there's always room for growth, right?

29:09.760 --> 29:12.760
And so I thought that we could talk about some of your goals that you have for yourself.

29:12.760 --> 29:16.760
And then we could talk about maybe how we come into the fold of Joel's goals.

29:16.760 --> 29:19.760
How can we be of service to that, that I ask.

29:19.760 --> 29:24.760
And then also what are goals that we may be see for you that you didn't even think possible or probable for yourself.

29:25.760 --> 29:26.760
Got it.

29:26.760 --> 29:27.760
That's good.

29:27.760 --> 29:28.760
Let's start with you.

29:28.760 --> 29:29.760
What tangible goals?

29:29.760 --> 29:31.760
I know this is very similar to the summer bucket list.

29:31.760 --> 29:32.760
But that was what we had said.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.760
This is only for Joel.

29:34.760 --> 29:37.760
And it's about for the rest of the year goals.

29:37.760 --> 29:38.760
It could be about sex.

29:38.760 --> 29:39.760
It could be not.

29:39.760 --> 29:41.760
That you see for yourself that you've set through yourself.

29:41.760 --> 29:43.760
Heights you want to sort to.

29:46.760 --> 29:48.760
It's a tough question.

29:48.760 --> 29:51.760
I would like to make it to 26.

29:51.760 --> 29:53.760
That will be one.

29:54.760 --> 29:55.760
And what is that?

29:55.760 --> 29:57.760
September 15th.

29:57.760 --> 29:58.760
Virgo.

29:58.760 --> 29:59.760
Yeah.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.760
Get that on time.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.760
I like that.

30:03.760 --> 30:04.760
Thanks.

30:04.760 --> 30:07.760
That's a goal of mine.

30:09.760 --> 30:10.760
That's it.

30:10.760 --> 30:11.760
It's sort of like don't die.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.760
The baseline survived.

30:13.760 --> 30:16.760
Let's go up a couple steps on the pyramid.

30:16.760 --> 30:19.760
You know, get to maybe some more like fun goals.

30:19.760 --> 30:20.760
Yeah.

30:20.760 --> 30:21.760
Sure.

30:21.760 --> 30:26.760
Actually on my birthday, I'm going to be in Portland or Oregon,

30:26.760 --> 30:30.760
not sure which one or I'm not sure if I'll actually be in Portland.

30:30.760 --> 30:34.760
So one goal will be a successful Oregon road trip.

30:34.760 --> 30:35.760
That I'm going on.

30:35.760 --> 30:37.760
That's fun.

30:37.760 --> 30:38.760
Brad.

30:38.760 --> 30:39.760
Oh, we've already.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.760
We've already toned by them.

30:41.760 --> 30:42.760
Okay.

30:44.760 --> 30:45.760
Invite him.

30:45.760 --> 30:46.760
Invite him.

30:46.760 --> 30:47.760
Yeah.

30:48.760 --> 30:50.760
All right.

30:50.760 --> 30:56.760
So Joel's two goals are going to Portland and not dying until September 15th.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.760
Um, are there other slides?

30:59.760 --> 31:02.760
I thought you were going to move on sort of you had set the goals out for me.

31:02.760 --> 31:03.760
Is that not?

31:03.760 --> 31:05.760
I mean, I have some ideas.

31:05.760 --> 31:06.760
Okay.

31:06.760 --> 31:08.760
But I want to hear from you guys first.

31:08.760 --> 31:10.760
Casey and Grayson, do you guys have any case in for short?

31:10.760 --> 31:13.760
Do you guys have any ways that maybe you could help.

31:13.760 --> 31:16.760
Joel attain these two goals.

31:16.760 --> 31:19.760
Grayson, maybe you and Joel could work out that helps him.

31:19.760 --> 31:24.760
Uh, you know, whether it's a Rocky Mountain athletics in Denver, Colorado or, uh,

31:24.760 --> 31:26.760
or is it Boulder?

31:26.760 --> 31:27.760
Uh, it's Denver.

31:27.760 --> 31:31.760
Denver, Colorado or whether it's, you know, just in New York.

31:31.760 --> 31:35.760
Keeping his life force strong and vital.

31:35.760 --> 31:36.760
Absolutely.

31:36.760 --> 31:37.760
Joel, let's talk.

31:37.760 --> 31:41.760
I think let's talk offline about that.

31:41.760 --> 31:42.760
Um, good.

31:42.760 --> 31:45.760
And then Casey, maybe you could pay.

31:46.760 --> 31:51.760
I'm sorry to even say, but his airfare to Portland at the huge.

31:51.760 --> 31:58.760
Um, Joel, we'll talk about it offline.

31:58.760 --> 32:00.760
This sucks.

32:00.760 --> 32:03.760
Um, all right.

32:03.760 --> 32:05.760
Well, Brad's already helping.

32:05.760 --> 32:10.760
So I guess that's a good outcome of this segment and not prior conversations.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.760
Um,

32:12.760 --> 32:16.760
now I think it's time that we lob up some goals for Joel.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.760
We talk about the slide again.

32:19.760 --> 32:20.760
Why?

32:20.760 --> 32:26.760
I just noticed you got the same font across the board this time.

32:26.760 --> 32:27.760
It's an improvement.

32:27.760 --> 32:28.760
Huge.

32:28.760 --> 32:29.760
Yeah.

32:29.760 --> 32:31.760
I did a slide last week.

32:31.760 --> 32:33.760
Um, right.

32:33.760 --> 32:36.760
I didn't match the font of breaking bed.

32:36.760 --> 32:41.760
I think it looked a little better if you, uh, kind of.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.760
Fix the kerning a bit.

32:44.760 --> 32:45.760
Hmm.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.760
I think if he stretched out goals.

32:47.760 --> 32:52.760
So it's, uh, kind of even with Joel's and look a little bit better.

32:52.760 --> 32:53.760
Yeah.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.760
That is kind of off putting.

32:55.760 --> 32:56.760
Yeah.

32:56.760 --> 32:57.760
But the S is sort of line up.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.760
I wonder if that's good sort of.

32:59.760 --> 33:02.760
But like, not really actually.

33:02.760 --> 33:07.760
I wonder if that's it.

33:07.760 --> 33:08.760
All right.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.760
I'll just kick things off.

33:11.760 --> 33:12.760
Yeah.

33:12.760 --> 33:14.760
Next slide.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.760
Uh, I guess.

33:16.760 --> 33:19.760
I mean, speaking of a body fat percentage.

33:19.760 --> 33:22.760
Joel, what if you got down to 2.5% body fat?

33:22.760 --> 33:23.760
Unhealthy.

33:23.760 --> 33:24.760
Yeah.

33:24.760 --> 33:25.760
That sounds really bad.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.760
There's actively against goal number one.

33:27.760 --> 33:30.760
Yeah.

33:30.760 --> 33:34.760
I think not only is that I'm going to go to Shakespeare in the park at 2.5.

33:34.760 --> 33:35.760
Yeah.

33:35.760 --> 33:36.760
That's awesome.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.760
Wouldn't last an act.

33:39.760 --> 33:43.760
You take one step in your apartment, not even out and you just shatter.

33:43.760 --> 33:44.760
Yeah.

33:44.760 --> 33:49.760
I do think that that goes beyond the essential fat you need to survive to enough to breathe.

33:49.760 --> 33:53.760
But I just wonder, I mean, it's like, you know, reach for the stars land on the clouds.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.760
You know, maybe you reach for 2.5 and you get to like nine.

33:56.760 --> 33:57.760
Yeah.

33:57.760 --> 34:02.760
Actually, the last time I was in the podcast, we discussed how I wouldn't mind bulking up with that.

34:02.760 --> 34:20.760
Yeah.

34:20.760 --> 34:23.760
It's so bad.

34:23.760 --> 34:27.760
So, Joel, both of you up is one of your goals.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.760
Oh.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.760
Yeah.

34:33.760 --> 34:37.760
I'd like to add 2.5 to whatever my BMI is.

34:37.760 --> 34:38.760
That's good.

34:38.760 --> 34:44.760
I mean, you're probably going to like what's seven pounds?

34:44.760 --> 34:45.760
What?

34:45.760 --> 34:47.760
What is renewable?

34:47.760 --> 34:48.760
Sorry.

34:48.760 --> 34:49.760
All right.

34:49.760 --> 34:51.760
What about journaling less?

34:51.760 --> 34:53.760
Just to save some paper.

34:54.760 --> 34:58.760
Yeah.

34:58.760 --> 34:59.760
No.

34:59.760 --> 35:00.760
That's a great call.

35:00.760 --> 35:05.760
I mean, it's sort of good for the world and me.

35:05.760 --> 35:09.760
In more than one way, too, like not even just like saving paper for the environment,

35:09.760 --> 35:11.760
but also just making sure your thoughts stay up here.

35:11.760 --> 35:12.760
Yeah.

35:12.760 --> 35:13.760
Yeah.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.760
Make me a less thoughtful person as I interact with the world.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.760
Yeah.

35:18.760 --> 35:21.760
Brad Hill.

35:22.760 --> 35:23.760
Yeah.

35:23.760 --> 35:24.760
Joel's goals.

35:24.760 --> 35:27.760
I don't want to be the only one dominating the conversation.

35:27.760 --> 35:29.760
You don't.

35:33.760 --> 35:35.760
I don't know, man.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.760
He said he wants to.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.760
What else else?

35:39.760 --> 35:44.760
Was that on purpose?

35:44.760 --> 35:45.760
Did you guys see that?

35:45.760 --> 35:47.760
Why does that?

35:47.760 --> 35:50.760
Joel's else.

35:51.760 --> 35:55.760
That'll be our end of the year episode.

35:55.760 --> 35:57.760
Knowing we just had anything.

35:57.760 --> 36:02.760
We found all the goals that he failed on.

36:02.760 --> 36:03.760
Um, I don't know.

36:03.760 --> 36:06.760
You made a, you made a pretty nice looking.

36:06.760 --> 36:08.760
What was it an eggplant parm?

36:08.760 --> 36:09.760
The other day, Joel.

36:09.760 --> 36:10.760
That's true.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.760
Have a little bit of a party.

36:12.760 --> 36:14.760
Maybe hosting more dinner parties.

36:14.760 --> 36:16.760
Maybe sending an invite.

36:16.760 --> 36:17.760
It's funny.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.760
That ended up as our when we were on our retreat.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.760
There was the whole like whatever that thing was.

36:22.760 --> 36:23.760
Fast forward thing.

36:23.760 --> 36:27.760
That was one of my goals was hosting dinner more dinner parties.

36:27.760 --> 36:29.760
You also, I think mentioned it on the last episode.

36:29.760 --> 36:30.760
You're on of this show.

36:30.760 --> 36:32.760
So that's our dream.

36:32.760 --> 36:35.760
All right.

36:35.760 --> 36:41.760
That was, that was me and you offline, Jeffrey.

36:41.760 --> 36:42.760
Okay.

36:42.760 --> 36:46.760
I just thought that that was maybe a Joel's goal that you got a hold of.

36:50.760 --> 36:54.760
What about calling friends more out?

36:56.760 --> 36:59.760
So like calling like, I don't know.

36:59.760 --> 37:05.760
Fucking English out on her bullshit.

37:05.760 --> 37:09.760
More often in terms of English.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.760
There's nothing to call out English on.

37:12.760 --> 37:13.760
Really?

37:13.760 --> 37:14.760
She's great.

37:14.760 --> 37:15.760
Great to be in the office with.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.760
She's awesome.

37:17.760 --> 37:18.760
Has she been on the podcast?

37:18.760 --> 37:22.760
No, she was almost on this week's episode when it was going to be yesterday,

37:22.760 --> 37:24.760
but it wasn't possible.

37:26.760 --> 37:27.760
Anyway.

37:27.760 --> 37:28.760
All right.

37:28.760 --> 37:32.760
What about not buying things you need?

37:33.760 --> 37:35.760
Going without.

37:35.760 --> 37:36.760
Yes.

37:36.760 --> 37:37.760
Yeah, that's good.

37:37.760 --> 37:39.760
I actually would like to be more minimalist.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.760
I think about it every time I move,

37:41.760 --> 37:44.760
I'm kind of like, I wish I owned nothing.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.760
That's where I'm at right now.

37:46.760 --> 37:50.760
I mean, like, I've weigh less closet storage.

37:50.760 --> 37:54.760
And these two boxes, I just have nowhere to put them.

37:54.760 --> 37:55.760
And they're full.

37:55.760 --> 37:57.760
You could get rid of them.

37:57.760 --> 38:01.760
Yeah, but they're both kind of essential.

38:01.760 --> 38:03.760
There's other stuff.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.760
The bottom one's closed.

38:05.760 --> 38:15.760
The top one is sort of a bucket list thing.

38:16.760 --> 38:23.760
Get out your car and then put that junk on your bike as a goal.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.760
I don't have a car.

38:25.760 --> 38:26.760
Do we like?

38:26.760 --> 38:27.760
Yeah.

38:27.760 --> 38:28.760
Okay.

38:28.760 --> 38:29.760
New goal.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.760
Trading your bike for a strike.

38:31.760 --> 38:33.760
What's better than two wheels?

38:33.760 --> 38:34.760
Four.

38:34.760 --> 38:35.760
But three will do.

38:35.760 --> 38:38.760
Can sell my track and get a car.

38:40.760 --> 38:43.760
I feel like we're having a fun time conversation.

38:43.760 --> 38:45.760
Because they started Joel's goals.

38:45.760 --> 38:46.760
Everybody's gone quiet.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.760
Except for Joel who's kind of in the hot seat,

38:48.760 --> 38:51.760
which is uncomfortable for him.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.760
I can take it.

38:53.760 --> 38:58.760
Go to the dentist and prove them wrong.

38:58.760 --> 39:02.760
I do not need a feeling, sir.

39:02.760 --> 39:05.760
And let me tell you why.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.760
Last one, by less plastic.

39:08.760 --> 39:12.760
You know, maybe more like polyester and nylon.

39:12.760 --> 39:13.760
That's plastic.

39:13.760 --> 39:14.760
What's that?

39:14.760 --> 39:16.760
That's plastic.

39:16.760 --> 39:18.760
Really?

39:18.760 --> 39:19.760
Yeah.

39:19.760 --> 39:20.760
Yeah.

39:24.760 --> 39:27.760
Oh, Joel's goals is over.

39:36.760 --> 39:39.760
That was Joel's goals.

39:40.760 --> 39:44.760
It is helpful having four guests instead of three because

39:44.760 --> 39:47.760
sort of spreads the poison across equally.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.760
So everybody gets instead of like 33%.

39:49.760 --> 39:53.760
You guys are all getting 25%.

39:53.760 --> 39:54.760
Of the poison?

39:54.760 --> 39:56.760
Yeah.

39:56.760 --> 39:59.760
Or does it not feel that way?

39:59.760 --> 40:01.760
I definitely feel poisoned.

40:01.760 --> 40:04.760
Yeah.

40:04.760 --> 40:07.760
That's all I had.

40:09.760 --> 40:10.760
We can do plugs.

40:10.760 --> 40:11.760
We can end it.

40:11.760 --> 40:14.760
Or if you guys have any grievances or fun facts or anything you want to share.

40:14.760 --> 40:19.760
You know, I want this to be an open form.

40:19.760 --> 40:21.760
What do you guys think of circumcision?

40:21.760 --> 40:24.760
I saw that being debated on Twitter today.

40:24.760 --> 40:25.760
Plums.

40:25.760 --> 40:26.760
I think.

40:26.760 --> 40:27.760
Yeah.

40:27.760 --> 40:30.760
Let's talk about it.

40:30.760 --> 40:33.760
My body, my choice really.

40:33.760 --> 40:34.760
Yeah.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.760
Wow.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.760
Was it your choice though?

40:38.760 --> 40:39.760
Yeah.

40:39.760 --> 40:40.760
No, it was not my choice.

40:40.760 --> 40:41.760
Yeah.

40:41.760 --> 40:42.760
Yeah.

40:42.760 --> 40:45.760
That's a, I feel like you're arguing for not circumcision.

40:45.760 --> 40:46.760
Yeah.

40:46.760 --> 40:48.760
Adult circumcisions.

40:48.760 --> 40:49.760
Yeah.

40:49.760 --> 40:50.760
Okay.

40:50.760 --> 40:53.760
You're arguing against adult circumcisions?

40:53.760 --> 40:54.760
No.

40:54.760 --> 40:57.760
I think only adults should be circumcised.

40:57.760 --> 40:59.760
What about a, like, a...

40:59.760 --> 41:01.760
If you should be.

41:01.760 --> 41:02.760
Maybe.

41:02.760 --> 41:03.760
Okay.

41:03.760 --> 41:04.760
I was like, wait.

41:04.760 --> 41:07.760
That's the, maybe the weirdest take you could have.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.760
No baby should be circumcised, but every 18 year old should.

41:10.760 --> 41:13.760
What about getting it put back on?

41:13.760 --> 41:14.760
Not that.

41:14.760 --> 41:15.760
I can't think.

41:15.760 --> 41:20.760
I can't believe we're not there yet with the science of it all, you know?

41:20.760 --> 41:21.760
Yeah.

41:21.760 --> 41:25.760
Like, we don't have the technology to regrow four skin.

41:25.760 --> 41:27.760
You could get a BBL.

41:27.760 --> 41:28.760
Yeah.

41:28.760 --> 41:30.760
But I can't get a,

41:30.760 --> 41:33.760
an F.S.

41:33.760 --> 41:34.760
I.

41:35.760 --> 41:39.760
What about a B.M. BBL?

41:39.760 --> 41:44.760
So it's like a BBL that has like blackberry messenger capabilities.

41:44.760 --> 41:46.760
Yeah.

41:46.760 --> 41:48.760
Oh, I got that.

41:48.760 --> 41:52.760
You can follow me on Twitter at Jeff Boyardee.

41:52.760 --> 41:54.760
We're 250 away from 10,000.

41:54.760 --> 41:57.760
Again, I actually will post a photo of my ass somewhere.

41:57.760 --> 41:59.760
I have to figure out where that's legal.

41:59.760 --> 42:02.760
Once we get to 10,000, I already have the photo ready.

42:02.760 --> 42:05.760
And let's kick it off to Casey.

42:05.760 --> 42:09.760
Uh, you can follow me on Twitter at Casey Donnie here.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.760
Follow me on letter box at Casey Donnie here.

42:12.760 --> 42:13.760
That's it.

42:13.760 --> 42:15.760
Oh, Casey, have you seen the black phone?

42:15.760 --> 42:16.760
I have.

42:16.760 --> 42:17.760
Yes.

42:17.760 --> 42:19.760
What did you think about it?

42:19.760 --> 42:23.760
Uh, I liked it for the most part.

42:23.760 --> 42:25.760
Um,

42:25.760 --> 42:26.760
Yeah.

42:26.760 --> 42:27.760
I, I, I saw a few months ago.

42:27.760 --> 42:31.760
So I'm kind of having a hard time remembering what exactly happened.

42:31.760 --> 42:33.760
But it was a good little thriller.

42:33.760 --> 42:34.760
Yeah.

42:34.760 --> 42:37.760
I thought it was good because it was maybe jump scare a little bit.

42:37.760 --> 42:41.760
But like some of this normal conversation dialogue.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.760
Nobody would say under those circumstances.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.760
Like children are going missing every day.

42:45.760 --> 42:47.760
And then the, the daughter is like,

42:47.760 --> 42:49.760
And don't eat all the ice cream before I get home.

42:49.760 --> 42:51.760
And I'm like, what?

42:51.760 --> 42:54.760
But also I don't think she was a great actor.

42:54.760 --> 42:57.760
Oh, shots fired.

42:57.760 --> 42:59.760
I'll look, I'll go toe to toe with this fucker.

42:59.760 --> 43:00.760
All right.

43:00.760 --> 43:02.760
Get the little fucker on the fucking show.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.760
And I'll tell her everything she did wrong.

43:04.760 --> 43:05.760
Okay.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.760
Well, no, hang on.

43:07.760 --> 43:09.760
Because I don't actually want her to like, her feelings to get in her.

43:09.760 --> 43:12.760
And I just want to be honest.

43:12.760 --> 43:15.760
Okay, man.

43:15.760 --> 43:19.760
That's how people respond when someone's being a real asshole.

43:19.760 --> 43:22.760
Uh, Joel plugs.

43:22.760 --> 43:23.760
Yeah.

43:23.760 --> 43:28.760
Um, you can get at me on the gram.

43:28.760 --> 43:31.760
At Joelman's honor.

43:31.760 --> 43:32.760
And where could people come at you?

43:32.760 --> 43:33.760
Like, where do you live in New York?

43:33.760 --> 43:36.760
If they want to fight you.

43:36.760 --> 43:39.760
Uh, meet me at Shakespeare in the park.

43:39.760 --> 43:40.760
Fuck out.

43:40.760 --> 43:42.760
Oh, fellow style.

43:42.760 --> 43:48.760
Who's it going to be?

43:48.760 --> 44:01.760
Okay.

44:01.760 --> 44:04.760
It's a real power struggle here.

44:04.760 --> 44:08.760
It's like who wants to get out of here enough to go first so that we can finish the

44:08.760 --> 44:16.760
plugs, but also who wants to be man enough to go last and hold out.

44:16.760 --> 44:17.760
Yeah.

44:17.760 --> 44:18.760
Joel, okay.

44:18.760 --> 44:19.760
She replaced bets.

44:19.760 --> 44:24.760
I think Grayson's going to cave first because he also has to listen to this entire

44:24.760 --> 44:27.760
episode back again in the next two days to edit it.

44:27.760 --> 44:30.760
Brad is home free as soon as he helps.

44:30.760 --> 44:31.760
Yeah.

44:31.760 --> 44:37.760
Yeah, but then Grayson can also cut it.

44:37.760 --> 44:41.760
So he finishes first even if he goes second.

44:42.760 --> 44:46.760
That is true.

44:46.760 --> 44:51.760
I'll go.

44:51.760 --> 44:55.760
Follow Rocky Mountain Athletic on Instagram.

44:55.760 --> 44:59.760
This is an interesting strategy strategic move because you're going first but you're

44:59.760 --> 45:00.760
plugging Grayson shit.

45:00.760 --> 45:02.760
Yeah, I'm kind of big time in him.

45:02.760 --> 45:03.760
Wow.

45:04.760 --> 45:05.760
Yeah.

45:05.760 --> 45:10.760
Brad just has like eight more 10 more 15 more dogs come in.

45:10.760 --> 45:15.760
It's like against the lie, I think.

45:15.760 --> 45:21.760
Every time he plugs Rocky Mountain another one appears.

45:21.760 --> 45:27.760
And follow Brad on Instagram at Brad the human.

45:27.760 --> 45:31.760
Follow Grayson at Gray Kay Wise.

45:31.760 --> 45:36.760
And go to Rocky Mountain Athletics and run up a waterfall if you've got time.

45:36.760 --> 45:38.760
Gray Kay, we get it.

45:38.760 --> 45:39.760
Do you ever do that?

45:39.760 --> 45:42.760
No.

45:42.760 --> 45:44.760
I'm going to kill myself.

45:44.760 --> 45:53.760
Oh my god.

45:53.760 --> 45:55.760
That's how my piece of paper.

45:55.760 --> 45:57.760
The next episode.

45:57.760 --> 46:00.760
We just don't post anything in the feed.

46:00.760 --> 46:07.760
And we don't bring it up at all.

46:07.760 --> 46:14.760
It's just Angie for five minutes being like this is where the service is going to be.

46:14.760 --> 46:18.760
It's at Shakespeare in the park.

46:30.760 --> 46:37.760
That was a hit dumb original.

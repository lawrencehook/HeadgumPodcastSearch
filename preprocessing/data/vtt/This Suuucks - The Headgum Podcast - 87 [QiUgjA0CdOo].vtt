WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
Sorry, I know we were recording, but are you guys ready?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Do you feel good? Are you going to bring the energy?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Yeah.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Okay.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Can I get verbal confirmation from Billy?

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
I was dancing to the theme.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
He was dancing.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
I just want to make sure we're starting this one out on the right foot,

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
because I feel like the past couple of weeks have been less than par.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
People and the comments are so sad.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
It was a return to form our best episode.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Yeah.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Less than par is like what you strive for.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Been golf.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Yeah, but so far is below average.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
What happened last episode that made it so successful

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
so that we can try and mimic it again?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
It wasn't as successful.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
It was just us talking about shit

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
and like friends connecting over bullshit.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
All right.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
So then I'll start the conversation.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I don't know why.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
We didn't even start to show you.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
You're kind of like...

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Now with a show started.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
And the energy was even worse than before.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I don't want to dance anymore.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
The sauce.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Yeah.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Yep.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Yeah.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Welcome to another edition of the head-gum podcast.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
It's Friday, January 28th.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
The fuck is that?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
It's another date.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Yeah.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Can't believe it.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Right.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Right.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Have you been participating?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
In dry January.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
In what regard?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
I don't know.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Some people do for alcohol.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Some people do it for...

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Yeah.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
I believe.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Just in any way.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
I dry.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
I dry.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
I dry.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
It's a fucking challenge.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
We've got...

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
January.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
We've got Billy Ski Fury on the facts.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Maria Brown on the facts.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
And I'm here.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm filming up the rear.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Uh, happy birthday, mirror.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
It's not my favorite.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
So late.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Yeah.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
It's like 12 days after the fact.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Actually, we're recording on my dad's birthday.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
So...

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
We can do it.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
What's named Dorone?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Just happy birthday to my dad.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Happy birthday, Mr. Bowen.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
It's right.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
You don't get to call him by his first name.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
I don't get to call him by his first name.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
I don't get to call him by his first name.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
I don't get to call him by his first name.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Jeff, what do you do for your dad on his birthday?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Um...

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
You know, send him a gift.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
You're like, I caught you off guard here.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Oh, here.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Here's different.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Here's a question.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
My dad's birthday is Saturday.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
What should I get him?

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Because I've not bought anything.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Send him something perishable.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Okay.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Go on.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Like, go to Martha's Country Baker.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
And get the Napoleon with berries.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Ship it to him.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Hmm.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
He has something cookies.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Oh, that's something cookies for my birthday from...

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Bird cookie company in Savannah.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
What are some great interests, Marika?

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Uh, you know, cooking.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Well, water.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Uh, rice.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Ha ha ha.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
What about you?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
He's a big gift card.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Ha ha ha.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
It's a place all the way across the country

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
that doesn't even exist anymore.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
I should.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
I should, honestly, buy him an exactly rice t-shirt.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Oh, that's right.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
I didn't want to understand it at all.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Because what does it even mean?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Uh, yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Yeah.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
He's, you know, he's gardening a lot.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Oh, wow.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
You know what might have that a special touch?

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Let's know that you really know him and care about him.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
It's a Starbucks gift card.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Hmm.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
That's so standard.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Five dollars.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Starbucks iTunes.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Can't get the biggest size.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Yeah.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Frenty.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Do you guys have any friends that don't know their parents birth this?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Hmm.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
No.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
It's a very specific thing that's come up a few times

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
where I've talked to somebody.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
I mean, I don't know.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I keep forgetting if my dad's birthday is like

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
the 23rd or the 24th of January.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
And I always think that's really fucked up.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
I did have some friends that didn't remember their parents

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
birthed this, but it was because they're like,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
they didn't celebrate birthdays for their religions.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
What religion is that?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Uh, Christian science?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
No, birthday celebration.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
That's a bad one to have that.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
You can take medicine or have happiness on your day.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
But instead of your toe that give you a cake.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
I think it was really at least on their family left.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Oh, Ben, like the kids still celebrate a birthday.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
The parents.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Daniel, back at it again with the work.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
So loud.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
So loud.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
Can you guys accurately say what your parent's anniversary is?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
I can't.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Because it's insane.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
What makes it so insane?

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Well, they got married on 9-11.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
So that's a big one.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
And then it was all 2001.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
No, but it did happen during a tragedy in their lives.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
They got married in 1972 the week of like the Munich Olympics.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Like Israeli wrestler assassinations.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Oh, like they got married during like already a terrible tragedy.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
And then it became an even more localized version of that tragedy when they moved to America.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
And then yeah 9-11.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
So yes, there's parents birthday 9-11.

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
You don't think that they were sort of the first dominant of all.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
And if they hadn't have wed, those two things would have happened.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
I'm sorry to even ask.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
You're like fucking rock hard thinking about the fact that the butterfly effect

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
actually started with my parents and ended with 9-11.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
It's also, there's no way.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
The correlation is so non-existent that it literally could have been any day.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Like, yeah.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
It's so far removed.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
They could have been your anniversary.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
You could have been like in January.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
And I would have been close to it.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Right?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Yes, yeah.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I'm all bricked up.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
No, I'm hard.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
There it is.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
What?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
You're all what?

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Was that supposed to do it again, actually?

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Was that moment where we spoke over you?

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Was that worth losing the ad revenue on YouTube channel?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Because it's out the window now, God.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
This is going to be a whole waste of day.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I'm all bricked up.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
That's not really hell.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
It was like a, it was a cover or something.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Yeah.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
It's a karaoke thing with a backing track.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
And I really was hoping to find one without the backing track.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
But instead of I'm all shook up.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
I'm all bricked up.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
I'm hard as a rock and have nowhere to go.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
I've been kind of tucking the little thing into my belt loop.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Move on.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Move on from whatever you're doing right now.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
No.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
I know.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
I didn't.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
I have like, I've been 45 minutes.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I got like 45 minutes.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Can't wait to turn your seconds.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
I'm not.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
A major killer milk everything for what it's worth.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I don't say milk after that.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Oh God.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
I lost my voice a little.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Jeff, you text me.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
She a lot.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
And I want to be.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
I want to put this on record right now.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Stop.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
You stop.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Like, I don't.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
I told them here.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
I told, I'm not a she guy.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Not a big group of the sheep.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
I don't.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
I don't care.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
If my friends do it, they seem to be having fun with it.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Yeah.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I've tried in various ways via text being like,

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I don't understand what that means.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Don't send that to me.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Now I'm on screen.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Locked in.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Telling you.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Stop sending me.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
She.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Not interested.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
There it is.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
On record.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Thank you.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
I started.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Right.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Right.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Right.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Um, there's been a slew of new hires at headgum.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Billy, can you speak to that?

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Uh, yeah.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
We've got Jenny, uh, who is, uh,

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
type in a way.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.960
I'm all bricked up

13:44.240 --> 13:49.600
Nice, that's good. Yeah, why is it good with Billy does it hey? It was the time when I was

13:50.640 --> 13:54.880
The time here is the fact that Billy did it and you can hear it clearly. Yeah

13:56.800 --> 13:58.800
I'll continue to fill this

14:00.080 --> 14:06.240
Silence of Maria can you explain to me? We all saw it on your Instagram stories recently

14:06.240 --> 14:12.240
You bought a $14 something at a farmer's market. It looked like a mushroom and it looked like it could have ruined your day

14:12.240 --> 14:18.400
What happened? Yeah, thank you. You were kind of the woods on toast. Can you mute yourself for a second? I want to hear the answer

14:18.880 --> 14:26.000
Jeff Roon the story. Yeah, so I I walked to my local green market on Sunday

14:26.640 --> 14:31.200
With the goal of buying mushrooms and bread to make mushrooms on toast and

14:32.960 --> 14:38.400
And I got there. I went to the mushroom guy. I was like what's your friend car?

14:40.800 --> 14:44.800
What's your credit card minimum? He was like six dollars. I was like great. I will find a

14:45.600 --> 14:48.000
I assume small mushroom

14:48.960 --> 14:52.400
That will be worth that picked one out gave it to him

14:52.960 --> 14:57.040
He was like that'll be $14 and I could not say

14:58.080 --> 15:00.080
No, thank you

15:00.080 --> 15:06.080
Could you like weigh it to find out or you just will get the mercy of the moment? No, it was like I weighed it

15:06.960 --> 15:08.960
Yeah Jeff can you

15:09.600 --> 15:11.600
Riga don't let him in that I don't let him in

15:14.240 --> 15:17.840
It was a situation where I didn't feel comfortable enough like

15:18.320 --> 15:24.000
Taking the mushroom and putting it back in the bin for sure and it was like could I rip it into a piece?

15:24.000 --> 15:27.120
Probably not I don't know what but I don't know what the like

15:28.400 --> 15:31.040
That'll be a bonus if you snap it

15:32.480 --> 15:34.480
Not off I guess right yeah

15:34.720 --> 15:39.200
So then I'm getting close to the minimum so yeah, I had to I had to take it on the chin and

15:40.080 --> 15:48.320
And how did it tie the by the $14 mushroom by some bread and then I went home made it

15:48.480 --> 15:53.920
I did a little what is it other than mushroom on to like is there butter involved is there all the oil

15:54.560 --> 15:58.320
What's butter involved yes, so I I had some leftover

15:59.680 --> 16:02.880
Like white beans that I had made a while ago

16:03.840 --> 16:07.680
So those were like very really like erby white bean

16:08.240 --> 16:14.800
Lemonese situation I turned that into a little spread I put that on the toast

16:15.440 --> 16:18.400
I cooked the mushroom I like crisped it in a cast iron

16:19.280 --> 16:24.720
Did a little steak type thing where you like down so with the butter the time

16:25.920 --> 16:29.280
Shit got crispy spread on my bean

16:30.240 --> 16:36.000
Where did you come up with this idea like I've never even heard of this food is this like something that you saw on a television show

16:36.400 --> 16:39.680
I feel like I saw someone recently cooking

16:40.560 --> 16:47.520
Mushroom toast I've like made it before in multiple variations and it like reminded me I was like oh that's a thing I can eat

16:48.880 --> 16:53.840
And then the I put did the little put the toast in the same pan with the butter

16:55.120 --> 16:58.320
But on the bean spread

16:59.520 --> 17:01.520
Put on the mushrooms

17:01.760 --> 17:06.560
Is that still a little lemon zest on top use me get a little a little touch

17:07.280 --> 17:12.560
Like holy shit, I'd be intrigued and then you have leftover mushrooms

17:12.880 --> 17:16.160
I did not I put them all in the bread and I ate it all so I

17:16.880 --> 17:21.920
All the worth of homemade mushroom toast my god. Yeah, I was looking at a

17:22.080 --> 17:26.320
$20 bright fist at that point plus the apple cider that I bought at the

17:27.280 --> 17:31.920
Not to mention the labor again. It's supposed to be cheaper when you do it at home

17:32.400 --> 17:38.320
Yeah, and I certainly was not so I won't be buying mushrooms from the farmer's market again. That's what I learned

17:38.320 --> 17:43.920
I'm in shop local by all means, but it couldn't be me for a $14 my talkie

17:45.360 --> 17:48.000
So yeah, that was my weekend fortunately

17:48.960 --> 17:56.480
All right, let's stop. Yeah. How are you gonna edit out video man? Are you gonna edit that it? We'll tell we'll tell grace

17:56.480 --> 17:58.480
Yeah, yeah

17:58.480 --> 18:06.560
That's the best part of somebody else the worst part is the barricut just gave us this full lesson in how she kind of like stumbled into learning that

18:06.560 --> 18:10.640
She didn't know what the price of this thing was she stole it and it kind of put her in this position

18:10.800 --> 18:14.160
That is exactly when you're supposed to drop major keelert

18:14.480 --> 18:17.200
Yeah, and then say don't buy something without knowing the price

18:17.280 --> 18:22.880
But you are so busy with this stupid notes app gag that you try to make it out of itself and yes

18:23.360 --> 18:32.480
100% and we actually missed the first opportunity probably in headgump podcast history to hit major keelert and drop some sort of lesson

18:32.960 --> 18:34.960
Yeah, no, no, it's in the searway

18:36.880 --> 18:38.880
And now that's also

18:39.440 --> 18:41.440
Yeah

18:41.440 --> 18:45.920
Obligation for grace and I was gonna say all right commercial back I guess yeah

It is English

28:23.120 --> 28:24.320
A

28:24.320 --> 28:27.280
You can't deal with the thing that's actually gonna be

28:28.080 --> 28:32.720
Points on the front and back and for Billy and Marika because I'm here interrupt I guess not a question

28:32.720 --> 28:35.360
I guess it's got it right the correct answer was a hey

28:36.400 --> 28:41.760
All right quickly back to team of me or the Taj Mahal was constructed as the tomb of the wife of which mughal emperor

Mughal and nothing

28:54.480 --> 29:00.080
I don't know a general emperor, and then maybe I'll stumble into a mughal fact that you forgot you knew an emperor

29:01.920 --> 29:09.280
Well, I'm watching the great. That's about a Russian emperor. Yeah, so you like you should have gotten the question about a place and necklace

Your thing into this hole, but yeah, you should have gotten that one

29:14.320 --> 29:19.360

Correct answers potassium sulfide. Yeah, yeah sulfate. So it's why I got to sound it out

32:45.760 --> 32:51.440
This bit was supposed to be that I was giving a mirror the harder questions and there's got progressively easier

32:51.440 --> 32:56.160
But I'm freaking Billy new all five of the ones I threw at a mirror. No

32:56.160 --> 33:01.440
This is unbelievable. I don't think so. I think that's the end of the game we won

There's no there's no points for Dan's just bragging rights for yeah

33:14.320 --> 33:18.320
I don't already heard this song in this episode. Yeah. Yeah. We're closing out this segment

33:18.320 --> 33:21.280
That is going to be another game show. You can just kill it just kill the song

33:26.480 --> 33:31.760
No song over this part. Welcome to

33:32.400 --> 33:34.400
Cartier or arbor day

33:35.040 --> 33:41.200
So this is one of the games that you said you're we're not gonna play on this episode. Yeah, variety versus drooled right

33:43.040 --> 33:47.840
You started to give us false hope that this person hosts the prices right wrong

33:48.640 --> 33:51.280
Yeah, wrong yeah

33:51.920 --> 34:00.080
$800 so it's Cartier what are party be why not Cartier or Carty be that's really good. No, it

34:00.720 --> 34:08.240
Shit really that's I'm like A or B answer also what's our like when is our birthday is the topical at all to do that

34:09.280 --> 34:11.280
It's the last Friday in April

34:12.720 --> 34:14.720
It's awful

34:15.280 --> 34:21.280
All right, let's just play and then I'll I'll come up with something else do flowers and plants gets

34:22.000 --> 34:25.200
Looped into the whole arbor day celebration or such straight tree

34:25.920 --> 34:32.480
It's three. It's just tree dang. Okay. Yeah, it's cold. All right blank has been around since 1872

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
This one already

34:37.360 --> 34:39.360
Arbor day

34:39.680 --> 34:41.680
Cartier is 1847

34:44.720 --> 34:50.640
Unlike distant relative FDR Teddy Roosevelt did not see the importance of blank

34:52.560 --> 34:54.560
Arbor day

34:55.120 --> 35:01.440
In correct Teddy wrote his about was actually one of the biggest proponents of arbor day in as U.S. President

35:02.160 --> 35:09.680
FDR on the other hand was gifted a Cartier and wore it almost every day and Teddy Roosevelt wasn't much for displays of wealth

35:10.160 --> 35:12.160
Fucking idiot

35:16.000 --> 35:20.240
Gifting your spouse and item blank is a common display of affection

35:30.080 --> 35:32.480
You can't read it my screen says this is boring

35:33.360 --> 35:36.880
Gifting your spouse and item from blank is a common display of affection

35:40.640 --> 35:41.680
You

35:44.240 --> 35:50.720
You know I capitalized born and I kind of want to get them all wrong. All right, Cardi B

35:51.600 --> 35:54.720
That's not one of the answers, but it's wrong still

35:55.440 --> 36:01.920
Maybe we can give him the satisfaction of being wrong. I haven't been paying attention to Arbor day just arbor day. Yeah, correct

36:02.240 --> 36:04.880
Imagine giving your wife a fucking oak

36:05.760 --> 36:10.720
Man, I was not paying attention ever you hear you just say that that random ass sentence

36:12.800 --> 36:16.480
Are you kidding me a weird term video gone? I think this is a good game

36:17.440 --> 36:20.960
This is crazy Andy Warhol loved blank probably

36:22.560 --> 36:24.560
Saturday some shot yeah

36:25.760 --> 36:27.360
Cartier

36:27.360 --> 36:33.760
I mean he's famously voted as saying that he wore the Cartier tank watch not because he set the timer used it

36:33.760 --> 36:37.840
But because it was the watch to wear so he probably loved Cartier

36:39.200 --> 36:43.600
I can use can you send the quote where he said it was the watch to wear

36:44.640 --> 36:49.680
Send it wear like you just you don't trust lack. Yeah, it's a sentence

36:50.240 --> 36:56.160
Only you would say and I just want confirmation. No, he 100% I mean I can find it

36:56.480 --> 37:02.080
Yeah, yeah, I mean you know just like after or something just a confirm

37:03.760 --> 37:06.880
I mean, I'm sure he also like trees probably so in a way

37:07.680 --> 37:09.680
Think we're all right

37:10.400 --> 37:15.360
I don't wear a tank watch to tell the time actually I never even wind it

37:15.360 --> 37:18.400
I wear it because it's the watch I wear a tank because it's the watch to wear

37:21.200 --> 37:22.720
Hmm

37:22.720 --> 37:26.800
This is interrupted the flow and I think it was going really well no way

37:27.760 --> 37:31.120
One way to celebrate blank is to plant a tree

37:32.080 --> 37:35.840
Love going full screen on just obvious a day screaming no way

37:36.720 --> 37:38.720
Yeah, the fog sliding up

37:41.840 --> 37:44.880
One way to celebrate blank is to plant a tree

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Cartier

37:50.000 --> 37:53.520
Imagine fucking putting into soil a

37:54.160 --> 38:01.360
Spruce to celebrate how fast and elusive you played with cash to get a Cartier crash

38:02.480 --> 38:08.000
So one way to know when someone doesn't know when they're going to say something is the second word they say is fucking

38:08.720 --> 38:13.440
And they use that as a little bridge like a tube beat like okay

38:13.440 --> 38:19.140
I'm gonna say something after this and he said imagine fucking and then he just started sweating

38:19.460 --> 38:25.460
Talking and to be honest, I chose that because I thought he was gonna say it was right and then have to make up something

38:25.860 --> 38:31.220
And I just wanted to put the pressure on him to do so a successful trap. Thank you

38:31.780 --> 38:34.020
You welcome Jeff go to the next segment

38:34.900 --> 38:36.900
No, I have to finish this one out

38:39.140 --> 38:42.980
You know what do we cool if you went to the next segment try something new this is a dud

38:43.620 --> 38:50.500
Plank is closely tied to nature

38:51.700 --> 38:53.700
Fucking arbor day

38:56.260 --> 38:58.260
Cartier

38:58.820 --> 39:01.460
In 2020

39:01.460 --> 39:08.900
Cartier founded Cartier for nature a fun dedicating to preserving biodiversity and healthy ecosystems

39:13.940 --> 39:15.940
Nice

39:19.060 --> 39:21.060
Nice

39:21.220 --> 39:25.380
Blank job eight's one of Jeff's favorite watch watch straps

39:26.900 --> 39:29.860
We could be talking about so many more interesting things right now

39:30.900 --> 39:35.060
Still dragging this stupid segment through the stupid mud

39:36.580 --> 39:38.580
Cardinal care the listeners don't care

39:42.980 --> 39:49.140
Because if you think about it the more trees that are planted the more it that oxygenates the atmosphere

39:49.620 --> 39:55.940
Which also helps cows from which their hides are turned into swayed and made by

39:56.740 --> 40:00.260
To Theo and here is watch straps door my favorite strap

40:02.340 --> 40:04.340
Okay

40:04.340 --> 40:06.340
Oh

40:06.340 --> 40:08.340
Yeah

40:13.460 --> 40:18.500
That sucked and it wasn't because of me

40:22.340 --> 40:26.340
Yeah, that's half true. It was a bad idea executed worse

40:28.420 --> 40:32.180
You mean even if I had done it straight it would have been better than when I did yes

40:33.780 --> 40:39.460
Baroness, let's talk about it. What's our version of that? Are you kidding me? What's

40:39.780 --> 40:41.780
What do you mean

40:43.300 --> 40:48.500
Baroness said fair enough. Let's talk about it. Let's not it's old

40:49.540 --> 40:54.980
Sure, there's that like movie coming out or whatever who cares who caranos

40:56.260 --> 40:57.780
No

40:59.780 --> 41:05.700
That we need help head gum needs a fair enough because meaning what does that mean because when I tell people

41:05.700 --> 41:11.300
Oh, like I work in podcasting. They're like, oh like how so and I'm like a kind of work at this padcast

41:11.300 --> 41:15.780
Never called head gum nobody fucking knows what I'm talking about just say you have a podcast

41:16.340 --> 41:19.460
No, that's not interesting. It's the same thing

41:20.500 --> 41:26.420
Traverse some podcast that's all you have to say I'm a comedian who hosts a podcast. No, because then they're like, oh, be funny

41:27.700 --> 41:32.740
And they say you're a comedian then okay, I say I work in podcasting

41:33.620 --> 41:36.740
Great usually people don't have follow-ups, but when they do they don't know where

41:37.140 --> 41:41.860
Head gum is or what it is and we need to get controversy. We need a controversy

41:41.860 --> 41:45.380
Okay, for the for the record. I don't know what Theranos is so I mean

41:45.380 --> 41:48.420
Theranos was a fraudulent blood testing startup

41:48.980 --> 41:53.060
Basically Elizabeth Holmes founder a CEO said that she could

41:53.300 --> 41:57.780
Revolutionize medicine with at home blood testing and it she didn't have any technology to back about

41:58.340 --> 42:02.260
Nice, okay cool and so what do what can we over promise and under

42:02.340 --> 42:04.900
Deliverers what I'm saying because we already have a bunch of E.C. interests

42:09.140 --> 42:13.220
Yeah, and his gum ball already fraudulent is I guess my question to him

42:13.220 --> 42:17.620
That's not it's an active thriving marketplace that's working

42:19.860 --> 42:21.460
All right

42:21.460 --> 42:27.700
All right, I'm just saying you don't see us on the fucking front page of the New York Times when Theranos has been the subject of much

42:28.100 --> 42:30.100
malice do you see any

42:30.660 --> 42:35.700
Podcasts on the front page of the New York Times. I don't but I do see podcaster

42:35.700 --> 42:38.500
I'm your blooming felt occasionally in the New York Times. Thank you

42:39.780 --> 42:44.100
Stabbing do not put on the love of God. Yeah, I'm man, my man

42:45.380 --> 42:48.260
I was the lead of a pretty

42:48.580 --> 42:50.580
Condition

42:51.140 --> 42:55.620
Yeah, these exact words on three different podcasts. That's right. I'll get basically

42:56.100 --> 42:58.100
Showed about purchasing

42:59.620 --> 43:01.780
This is all wrap a test audio listeners

43:02.340 --> 43:09.940
As a as a as a secret Santa gift and I guess that sparked interest in the eyes of the journalist at the time

43:11.940 --> 43:14.100
It's not interesting. I think

43:15.220 --> 43:18.740
Technically this podcast is a scam

43:20.180 --> 43:22.180
So I think maybe

43:22.180 --> 43:24.900
Let's work to make it big

43:25.940 --> 43:27.140
Great

43:27.140 --> 43:30.900
Go on and then then there we have it

43:32.420 --> 43:34.420
That was slanderous thoughtless

43:35.140 --> 43:40.100
It's gonna leave me jobless if a mirror really takes it with a wrap. I don't like

43:42.660 --> 43:46.100
Landarist stop it. It's gonna leave me jobless

43:46.740 --> 43:48.740
My boss

43:51.780 --> 43:54.740
Through the cobblestone your body scarless

43:55.060 --> 43:56.740
You say you think I'm harmless

43:59.780 --> 44:02.900
You look gobble streets. You didn't come over the rhyme a

44:03.860 --> 44:07.300
Freaking the sheets in a nightmare with cheeks a joy

44:09.140 --> 44:16.100
Like a monologue, man. What a weird amount of time. You ruined it. I ruined it. Yeah

44:16.820 --> 44:18.820
This sucks

44:18.820 --> 44:20.820
This fucking blows

44:20.820 --> 44:25.860
That's another way that you know someone doesn't have something to say when they just yell at the sucks

44:31.460 --> 44:34.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're saying I was slanderous

44:34.900 --> 44:36.900
I don't leave me jobless

44:36.900 --> 44:40.900
All right, you know, I mean I feel like a lot of people are like how does this

44:41.540 --> 44:44.740
Show how I'm listening to this because I have jaundice

44:45.700 --> 44:50.900
Could you some work really yeah jaundice and

44:51.620 --> 44:53.620
jobless

44:53.620 --> 44:59.540
You're gonna be slanderous thoughtless and it's gonna leave me jobless call me Homer Simpson because I think I have jaundice

45:00.900 --> 45:02.900
It's pretty good actually

45:03.300 --> 45:04.660
I don't think it's a good

45:04.660 --> 45:10.500
Mine is gonna be like I think Jeff likes I think Jeff likes the word jaundice too much

45:11.140 --> 45:13.140
So it's a kind of a cop out

45:13.620 --> 45:17.860
We're like a grudge. We're like a minute away from him telling us about his friend named jaundice

45:18.500 --> 45:20.500
nice

45:20.820 --> 45:22.820
No seriously

45:22.820 --> 45:26.820
We're gonna local super good

45:26.820 --> 45:28.820
That's really good

45:28.820 --> 45:30.820
That's really good

45:30.820 --> 45:32.820
Yeah

45:32.820 --> 45:34.820
My fault

45:34.820 --> 45:41.060
Just pull the string from his yeah, they're sure that's the Jeff doll the talking Jeff doll that has seven quotes

45:41.060 --> 45:43.380
Don't hurt him say that's good. You pulled the string

45:43.460 --> 45:45.460
It's my fault

45:47.460 --> 45:51.860
No idea how much work I put into the shit and then one time you pull the string and it just goes

45:54.420 --> 45:57.460
Come up the sound every time yeah every other time. It's just

46:01.620 --> 46:04.740
They don't do that anymore the pull the string like go say

46:04.820 --> 46:09.620
Thing. I wonder if it's dangerous or kids were choking on it or some shit

46:10.980 --> 46:12.260
I mean

46:12.260 --> 46:19.220
Where are we as a society where you can't have simple toys anymore because we're afraid that one kid will take it the wrong way

46:19.940 --> 46:23.140
Speak on a baby. I'm with you. It's like what you

46:23.700 --> 46:30.260
Next you can't have puzzles because a baby wants chewed on it and got it caught in this throat like we got soft

46:30.580 --> 46:32.580
We got soft

46:33.140 --> 46:37.380
Some guy tries to blow up a plane with a shoe unsuccessful and we have to take them off

46:37.940 --> 46:39.940
Yes, thank you

46:41.140 --> 46:43.140
Take them off through secure the visa

46:43.700 --> 46:47.620
When I was a kid my parents used to feed me puzzle pieces. Me and my sister

46:47.620 --> 46:49.620
That's about five hundred

46:49.620 --> 46:52.100
That's that's that's a call on what you'll do

46:52.100 --> 46:54.100
But we had to eat in a weekend once

46:54.100 --> 47:01.460
Right, you should say that was the 90s that was the 90s. No, it wasn't that was that wasn't happening in the 90s

47:01.780 --> 47:04.180
It was a great post. It was a great post or puzzle

47:05.060 --> 47:12.020
I stepped on Legos daily in 2003 says Marika and now like that's a great pop punk band name

47:12.580 --> 47:15.220
Step on a Lego in 2003

47:17.700 --> 47:22.580
It sounds like a pump pop punk song where it's I stepped on a Lego in parentheses in 2003

47:22.580 --> 47:29.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks for the race. Thanks. Yeah

47:30.820 --> 47:32.820
This show you to be fun when we're all friends

47:34.020 --> 47:39.060
How do you know the way what are you most looking forward to what do you have your like faith in right now

47:39.860 --> 47:42.980
I'm sure both of those questions at the same time not possible

47:44.580 --> 47:47.940
There's traffic but it's all public transportation so like yeah

47:47.940 --> 47:51.140
That doesn't affect me obviously. That was a bad question. Yeah somebody lives in New York

47:51.780 --> 47:57.220
And then the other one one one looking forward to a traffic listeners shipped to the podcast. Oh, it's

47:57.220 --> 48:05.460
He doesn't now can ruin. He doesn't he doesn't he doesn't have access. It's a direct correlation

48:05.460 --> 48:09.460
Coralative relationship with my LDL cluster. Oh, so let's just say through the fucking room

48:11.460 --> 48:16.900
Sorry, Marika and I'm here for asking Jeff a question. No, it's okay, but I am I am curious what he's looking forward to

48:17.540 --> 48:23.060
Looking forward to well on a daily basis. I look forward to the end of the day so I can just sleep and get it over with

48:24.500 --> 48:26.900
My dream land is the only place that I tend to be accepted

48:28.340 --> 48:30.660
I feel you've been hanging out with people

48:31.220 --> 48:36.180
Daily so I don't say that right because yeah, I started an LLC and they're on the payroll

48:37.220 --> 48:42.180
Are you liking New York still like do you can you think that this trial has gotten well?

48:42.180 --> 48:50.580
Do you think that hey if I can make it through a overcron winter that it'll only get better from here or did it sort of sour you on the idea

48:51.460 --> 48:57.940
When you come back I love it, but I'm never happy right so it's like I'm here and I want to be an LA and

48:57.940 --> 49:00.740
When I'm and then as soon as I go back to LA, I'm going to want to come back to New York

49:00.740 --> 49:07.460
Do you know what I mean like I'll it's a it's an eternal what if right so it's not really like to find

49:08.420 --> 49:12.420
Longing in New York was sort of a travesty

49:13.060 --> 49:20.660
What I wanted was to find my place here and it still isn't enough and it never will be so you found your place and

49:21.380 --> 49:23.380
It's being bicostle

49:24.180 --> 49:27.300
Right the very least tricostle. What's the third coast?

49:28.100 --> 49:33.140
It's uh the warmth of trying so it's basically trying to be tricostle is to try to be bicostle

49:33.620 --> 49:38.820
So you're saying LA New York and the want of trying are the three places you live

49:39.460 --> 49:43.860
And I'm going to set up my like my main residence will be in the third one just for tax purposes

49:44.180 --> 49:46.180
Havenness

49:46.580 --> 49:49.700
You're going to pay your taxes to want of trying yeah

49:50.260 --> 49:54.820
Okay, good luck with spit which basically means I'm not going to file taxes, but I'm going to want to try to

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:15.000
Break is that co-op, a root beer, a diacoc.

00:15.000 --> 00:28.000
I'm spiraling.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
I'm spiraling.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Good for nothing type of Jeffrey.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
I'm not doing well emotionally.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
I'm kind of feeling lonely in New York.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
That's...

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Has to be the furthest from her.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Whoo!

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Fucking cares cause we're gonna get the party started.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Nobody cares nobody.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
This isn't your fucking vlog man.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Let's get the show started.

00:53.000 --> 01:07.000
That was really me reaching out.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
That was really me reaching out.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Absolutely not.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Don't do mustard in my hair.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
I'm falling apart.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Here and there.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
Don't know that one.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
That was an original.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
You'll play style.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Should we do a yogurt cast?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
What are you saying?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Interesting.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
We're gonna slay her to this.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
We're gonna slay her to this.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
We're gonna slay her to this.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
We're gonna slay her to this.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Get to be back.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Let's...

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Don't call it a prayer occasion.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Yeah.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Cause you never went...

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
You didn't go anywhere.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Up.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Go ball beside it.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
My first true experience with that sound clip.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
It's all the time.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
The amount of times I've heard that thing.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
That audio clip is like, you know that image that's...

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
It's of nothing but it's like, this is what stroke victims see or something like that.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
And you're like, what?

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Everything looks familiar but isn't anything?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
That's the audio equivalent.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Sounds like a word I would know but it's not.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
And every time you play it I think I'm gonna figure it out and I never do.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
It's something you'd hear the paramedic saying as you're having a stroke.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Right, exactly.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
And you're like...

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Come on.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Come on.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Come on.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Come on.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Come on.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
No, it really is an honor to have...

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
It's a honor really to have Monshi back on the show.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
It's been too long and here we are.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
You're on my day.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Namaste.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Namaste.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Wow.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
How are you...

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
How are you feeling?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
How are you doing?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
What's new and rife?

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
I meant to say strife or life and ended up being rife.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Which means you're rife with Monshi right now.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah, day and my life, day and the strife, if you will.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Not much, man.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
I guess the only new thing going on with me is I'm taking computer science courses.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
Which I never thought I'd be doing with my life.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
Do you guys think that you can become a math person like late in life?

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
I don't know, man.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I really don't think so.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
I think...

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I think you can.

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
It's not like late in life, but my roommate was an English major and now does coding.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
That's like her main job, so I feel like you can make a change.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
Speaking as a math person that decided to not become a math person.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Interesting.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
I wouldn't recommend it, but no feels feasible.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Can we make the discernment though?

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Did you enjoy math or did you just happen to be good at it?

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Because I feel like that's two different types of math people.

04:04.000 --> 04:13.000
It was both until I got to college when I took college math classes that didn't involve numbers at all.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
And then I was like, no, by this is excruciating.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
And also, like, all my roommates were math majors that were good and really cared about it.

04:23.000 --> 04:30.000
And I was like, bad and frustrated all the time and didn't want to do homework for seven hours a week.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Plus so.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
When the letters get involved, it does get a little choppy.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Yeah, but I did yesterday.

04:37.000 --> 04:50.000
I was writing a joke movie review and relearned set theory really quickly to try and make my review a proof.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Okay.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Okay, sir.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
The math never really leaves the heart, doesn't it?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Never leaves you.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
I am a nerd for shit.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
So that's what's up with me.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Math 15.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
Major killer sense when the conversation needs new direction.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
You know, like, I think we'll just see this a cautionary tale.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
It's for all, it's for the listener, but you're sort of the example of what not to do.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Does that make sense?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
No.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Thank you.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
Bonshi, how's that cock of yours?

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
How do you say I'm like, I should say it.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
And maybe it's a tamer way of asking.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Are you seeing anyone?

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
So start with the tamer way of saying it.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Don't go extra.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
It didn't pull back.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I, you know what?

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
I wanted to gauge the response because maybe maybe you guys would have loved the first way.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I said it.

05:51.000 --> 05:59.000
I do made us all uncomfortable to see you put Ferris and sort of a checkmate position to have to do something.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Oh, with that question.

06:01.000 --> 06:13.000
After you lambasted me, if we're talking about math, you decided to switch gears so drastically from bombasticly to drastically.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
That was easier.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Sorry, that was easy.

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
No, but no, but actually has your, has your romance.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
It's sector.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Let's call it.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Oh, God.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Well, he's taking computer science classes.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
So I think that answers it.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
It's quite as den answered.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Truly answered.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Well, it could be to get like a really high paying job.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
So that you can kind of get the woman in your dreams.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Is that really what it's for?

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
You think the woman of Ferris and dreams would only be with him if you had a programming job?

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
That's just something like that's not really a one-day trip.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
What's a ring in it?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
It's a challenge.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Let's bring it in.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
We've all had our fun, rising Jeff, but let's all get on the same posh.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
I don't know what to tell you, man.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
Um, I don't like dating apps.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
I gotta say.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
And everyone feels like,

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
I'm on none of them, man.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
I'm on the same.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
It doesn't like it.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Yeah.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
But it feels like that's,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
I don't know.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Maybe that's part of the problem is that everyone is on them.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
So it's just everyone's on them.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
But then that's why it's tough for everyone to get dates.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
I don't know.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I haven't even done it in a while.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
It's just.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
It's just dating time for people that don't like dating apps.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
You guys made a dating app though.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Yeah.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
I would try.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Try a lion out for a spin.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Try a lion.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
I think you'll like the results.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Jeff, have you been spoken about your recent

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Raya membership?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Oh my god.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
You know, you guys don't want to hear me talk about this.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Can you invite me to Raya?

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I can't.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Can I get an invite?

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
I fear that you'll get it sooner than I did.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
It just took me two years.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
And then like.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
It'll be made up of you two year.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
You applied once and then two years later,

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
they said you're in.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Or you kept applying every month for 25 months.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Either way, you're a fucking loser.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
So don't like Jeff.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Figure out which one is the right answer.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Did you apply once?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
It's like 20 times.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Worst face.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
You're anemic to hear that even.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Asked of you.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Spading fast.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
You look so pale.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Where are you losing blood?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Just sitting down.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I've applied once.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
I got friend passes from my friend Mariel.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
And from my friend Melanie.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Race well.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
She's been on the show.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
And no avail.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
And you know, that's sort of surprise.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Friend passes by the way.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Like we vouch for you.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
And nearly 100% acceptance based on just those two things alone.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Let alone two people.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
So you got those two things that they said.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
No.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
The tough thing.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
It's like you get one.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
You know, your chance of probably in the 80s.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
You know, 80%.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
You get two.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
You should be on with that week.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Two hours.

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
That's what's hard in my life.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
So, but you're on it.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
So it's not hard.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And you could vouch for me, right?

09:46.000 --> 09:52.000
Look how amazing this content is on my fucking Instagram.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
Like, how did this not get me on?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Oh, yeah.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
You're leaning over for a fart.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Is that on your profile?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Got him.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Dot AIFF.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
That's what's here.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Let's hear it.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
This is the worst.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Got it.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Got it.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
All right.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
We haven't done this in a while, but it is time for Bond of the week.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
My pick this week for the next James Bond is Leslie Phillips.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
It's age 96.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Wait, nevermind.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
I was thinking of Leslie Jordan.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
The name's Bond.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Geriatric Bond.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
They wouldn't say that, right?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Who is Leslie Phillips?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
I don't know.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
Let's be pitching like a super ballad in the world.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
All this working British actor in the world.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Leslie Phillips, man.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Let's take it.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Doctor, who's style?

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Let's go old as fuck to combat ages and let's say.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I assume Leslie was a woman.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
And I was going to say that's an interesting, interesting idea.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Leslie's a man.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Bond.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
The voice of the story.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
He's an old guy.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Yeah, he's in Harry Potter.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
No, it's cool for me.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
And Renee.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
My band of that shit.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Right?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I love that shit.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
There's no way that didn't peek.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Screaming in the right.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I am last.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
How does he let anyone know?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Let's have Bond.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
She take the fucking floor then, all right?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I'm just trying to save her down.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Hold her down.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Hold her down.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Nope.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
I'm going to just keep talking.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
And I'm choosing my bond of the week is Charlie Cox.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Daredevil himself.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
British man.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
What way more popular currently than Leslie Phillips will ever be.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
Daredevil has been charting on Netflix for weeks.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I mean, you could have a look.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I can see that.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
How about a Charlie day?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
That's really fun.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
That's fun.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
He's a lovely Charlie Niji.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
He's going to be in the Super Mario Brothers movie.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
What?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
He's the first brat.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Is Mario?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
He seems like more of a Mario.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Like Luigi's kind of tall and slender.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
Before the podcast fair is like so excitedly wide eye.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
It was like, did you know that there was this Beatles documentary?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
That came out like a month ago.

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
And you just don't know that with the Mario four months ago.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
You got to get on dating apps, man.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
This is all anyone's ever talking about.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
I'm on a five month delay guys.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
I'm serious.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
It's really bad.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
I'm sorry.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
The person added context fair is that when that Mario movie was cast.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
Kevin Porter, host of Go Mark guys and good Christian fun.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Started tweeting that he cast.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
He was the casting director for it.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
And everyone believed him.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
And he got a ton of tweets about how bad it was.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
He gathered a bunch of hate tweets.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Like he brought that apart.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
That's really Kevin Porter does some fun stuff on the internet.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
He's true.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
He does some.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
He's a funny guy.

13:28.000 --> 13:39.000
He's good at stunt casting his life creating fun situations for him to get publicly lambasted for the low-slash cloud.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
It's almost a performance art.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
I'm jealous.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
What would you do to get lambasted, I'm here?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Me?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Yeah.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I don't know.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
I'm trying to like, you know, for me there is.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
Sorry Jeff direct message me.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
You suck.

14:00.000 --> 14:06.000
It's a fine line because like I would love to get publicly shamed in a way.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
But at the same time I don't want to take anybody else down with me.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Like I hate for that residual hate to land on.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
Other headgummers and then suddenly you have to start making a statement and be like,

14:16.000 --> 14:22.000
why are you friends with somebody that treated their support of X, Y or Z, you know?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Don't acknowledge this message.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
It like covers the screen so I almost have to read it.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Yeah.

14:31.000 --> 14:39.000
You got to assume at this point in your career anything you do is going to affect Jake and

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
anything Jake does will affect you.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Yes.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Right.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
That's right.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
The goal is to be the last person that has to distance themselves for the other.

14:50.000 --> 14:56.000
Would you ever even if it ruined if it takes your career, would you have a

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
prank him by destroying his?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
That would be kind of interesting.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
Sort of like, you know, I'm taking you down with me style.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Yeah.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Flash mob in a way.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Yeah.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Be quite a turn.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Right.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Like a yield turn.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Yeah.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
It's like a dodgy building isn't good, but then it's like at the very least I'm feeling something

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
new again.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Feeling something is the point.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Yes.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Exactly.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
As we like enter years three of this pandemic, like even just the idea of being like

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
turned into an enemy amongst many people's eyes.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
Like, oh, that's a new, exciting feeling that I can sort of try to navigate.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
That would make this march feel a little bit different than the last two.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
It's true.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
At least you wake up with something to, you know, not know about what's today.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
You're going to be like exactly.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Otherwise you're just waking up, you're like, oh, god.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
What time is it?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
How many hours until I can go back to sleep?

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
I still have a successful career with that guy.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I really like and I'm best friends with.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Exactly.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
But at what cost?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Right.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
They're just doing me a litany of text at this point.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
There's a bump bump.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
There's a gift of something.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
It's a point when you bump something too much.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
It's like you can't even go back to it.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Right.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Right.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
It becomes the purpose.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Right.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Up to bump for something.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
No.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
My bond of the week.

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
Are we there yet?

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
I'd say go for it.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Because Jeff messed up perfect at it.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
If you will.

16:35.000 --> 16:42.000
I've been watching the Hulu show of the Pam and Tommy show, which is kind of a new step for me.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
I'm usually not on top of the latest television shows and I'm definitely not watching them live.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
But I was able to watch the first three episodes of this one as it came out.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
So I feel like I'm on the cutting edge of something.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Just kind of neat.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
And I was really impressed with it.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Yeah.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I'm really impressed with that guy who plays Tommy Lee.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Yeah.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
I guess he's a famous guy.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Yeah.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
He's still.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
I still get.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
One of my favorite actors actually.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Yeah.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
He's great.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I'm excited to see more of him.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
He's really good at Tommy Lee.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
I don't know if you've seen that.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
I haven't watched it yet.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
I keep forgetting that.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
I feel like it's a thing that I've been waiting for for so long and then it came out.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
And I just forgot.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
It was a thing.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Yeah.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
There's literally just a lot of things.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Yeah.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
What is that?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Yeah.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
This is big time.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
So you suck a big time.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
I don't know if that is though.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Um, Sebastian Sims great.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
So he might want.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
If he could do that, he could do anything.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
I think he could.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
I think he could.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Are you talking?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Dude.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Jeff.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Call of us at this point.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
It's a Kurt Angle reference.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
And like.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
It's a Kurt Angle reference.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
It's a Kurt Angle reference.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
You got it.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
You got it.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I hope that made people happy.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
People were complaining that we haven't done a bond of the week in like a month.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
So shout out.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
It made me uncomfortable.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
But yeah.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Sure.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Sure.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Like on the spot.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
I'm trying to put more effort into these episodes.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
You know, not take the listenership for granted.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
And part of that means having some talking points for the wax segment.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Not just having it be just nonsense, you know.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
So I have a bill of point.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
What?

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
What?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Bless you.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
What?

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Wow.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Bless you.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Ah, epic.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Let's take a break, actually.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
You keep doing what I was saying.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Forget it.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Oh my god.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Yeah.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Yeah.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Yeah.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Yeah.

18:47.000 --> 18:54.000
Yeah.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Ferris, should we do this thing?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Yeah.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Well, means.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Daddy, chill.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
All right.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
That last one was in the accident.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I'll round it out with.

19:04.000 --> 19:11.000
Let's do one that we haven't done in a while.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Ah.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
So concerned, all the wrinkles in your body are between your two eyebrows right now.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
It's unbelievable to see it.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
Thousands of wrinkles in one square inch, like God.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
The rest of your body is probably literally skin tight as it furrows.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
Feet and feet of excess skin right there in between your two eyebrows.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
I mean, my God, look at you.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
It's like gripping a partially deflated balloon, just.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Exactly.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Squeezing to the knot.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
I think six months ago,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Ferris, why don't you kind of intro this?

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
So I did mention I'm on a five month delay.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
About five months ago, I said I would do this.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
USS our National Anthem cover.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
And I chose an insane time of my life to commit to something like that.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
But y'all kept me going.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
And I chipped away at it little by little.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
And it's been an absolute blast.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
And by the time you're hearing this,

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
you should be out on all platforms, accept apparently iTunes.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Because when I selected language, I selected Russian.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
And it said sorry apple and iTunes are not currently accepting

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Russian language.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
So maybe try Spotify.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
But also that has its own issues.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Not accepting the Russian link.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
I mean, look at that.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
We're already international fairs is ruining the art.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
All right.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
So this is a cheese or I believe Ferris.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
Yeah, it's a little minute or so.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
All right.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Flip of what's to come.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
You're cover of the USS our National Anthem.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Here we go.

21:41.000 --> 21:56.000
Oh, you shit.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Oh, shit.

21:57.000 --> 22:12.000
Oh, shit.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Laughing in the record.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Yeah.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
Oh, shit.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
Oh, shit.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
Oh, shit.

22:27.000 --> 22:36.000
Oh, shit.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
Oh, shit.

22:40.000 --> 22:50.000
Wow, did you learn Russian for me?

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
I definitely learned the words to the anthem, yeah.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Wow, that was easy.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
No, no.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
No way more work than I expected.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
That was incredible.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Yeah, that was crazy.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Thank you.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
That's easy.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
It seems like a real song, like a real, a song you hear in an elevator in Moscow or some shit.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
I appreciate that.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
I could only dream of being in an elevator in Moscow someday.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
How many hours do you think?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
How many hours do you think went into that altogether?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Oh my god.

23:24.000 --> 23:34.000
I mean, just last week I spent four hours recording vocals because I really, really, really needed to have a 24-man choir.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
You'll have to listen to the rest of the track to hear that part.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
And that's all you, man.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Like, yeah, just me.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
It's just me like yelling in my room 24 times in a row.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
My god.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
I did this weird saxophon stuff.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
You'll just have to hear it.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
But can people find that under your personal Spotify?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Is it fair to punchy?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Just my full name.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Yep.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Hell yeah.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
And a good plug for your music, which is also pretty fire.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I appreciate that.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Appreciate that.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
As a side note, I don't think I will be ever going to Moscow.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
I think I may get in some...

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
That was it.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Hot water with this.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
I don't know.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
It's an upgrading their national anthem.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
There's a...

24:16.000 --> 24:23.000
There's a secret message in the song too.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Oh my god.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
You can hear it during the saxolo.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
It's more of a cry for help than anything else.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
But keep it, keep an ear out for it.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Do we have to know Russian to hear what it is?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
No, that's actually in full English.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Okay.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
If you can full English breakfast.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
We'll put the link in the description.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Absolutely.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
We will appreciate that.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Unacceptable work, Ferris.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Thank you, guys.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
I really...

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
It wouldn't exist without that show.

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
I mean, this show is the kind of creative impetus for a lot of this weird shit I do.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
It is cool that somebody is working hard on the show.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Yeah.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
It's nice to see that.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I mean, definitely fair.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
It's a fun crazy thing.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
Sorry, I had to get everybody to shut the fuck up for a second.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
So I could say, welcome to...

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
I worked really hard on it too also.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Yeah.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
A bunch of people do.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Yeah.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Go for it.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Truck at the...

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Let me guess.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
We have to hear a noise of a thing.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
See there.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
Truck or somebody's saying truck it or fuck it.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Yeah, absolutely like that.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
Do you guys want to take like a 20 minute break?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
So then I could also be told this.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Oh, no.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Oh, no.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Yeah.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Yeah.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
It's still late.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
That's that Monchi shit.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
Because he's the only one who hears it as much as I do.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Yeah.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Yeah.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Yeah.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
I think you would stand for it.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Yeah.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
You know, let's get fucking serious here for truck it.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
The New York Times recently we're going to story about how America is low on truckers.

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
Due to the stress, physical deprivation and loneliness that comes with the job.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
We're seeing...

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Thank you, Ferris.

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
We're seeing high driver turnover at rates of above 90% thank you, Marguer,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
for actually listening and appreciate it.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
I do the same fucking thing.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Stop.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
You got mad at me.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Or he wasn't active listening.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
She was laughing at you.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
I was actually inquiring to hear more.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
But yeah.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Neither here nor there, I guess.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Not enough truckers.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Yeah.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
In America.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Very sad.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Very good.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Thank you so much for paying attention.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Ferris same thing.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Can I speak a mirror?

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
I guess I mean, four.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Four.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Man.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
The sooner we finish, the sooner we can get the fuck out of here.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
We're seeing high driver turnover at rates above 90%.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Okay.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Thank you.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Okay.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Who gives...

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Are you kidding?

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Now I have to start that sentence over.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Why?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
I finished it.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
You finished it.

27:03.000 --> 27:09.000
We are seeing rates above 90% of driver turnover for trucks.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Okay.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Where's sentence?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
This is all supply chain.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
There's not lack of interest.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
There's just a lack of good jobs.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Are you reading a fucking essay?

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
What are you doing?

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
There's no way that this is a very good, not a mistake.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
That's a supply chain.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
So much.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Scrolls three paragraphs down.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Yeah.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
And it's not because there is.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Yeah.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
A lack of job.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
It's...

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I have to quit access.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
So I have an ad.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
Actually, hold on.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
No.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
There's low pay.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
There's lack of respect.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
There's poor working conditions.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
There's the harsh demands.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Physically of the job.

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
And that's not going to get truckers on the road.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
So I thought what we could do, Ferris and Maria could thank you so much for...

28:06.000 --> 28:13.000
To get truckers back on the road is kind of pitch some ideas to, you know,

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
shipping companies really of how to get interest back.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
How to make the jobs good to have.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Is that cool?

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
And...

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
What happened?

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Where are you on a fucking drone?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I touched nothing.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
And that's fucking going haywire on my ass.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
What the fuck was that?

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
All right.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Where are you?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I'm in an apartment.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
The usual spot that you've been in.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
I had to move.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Why?

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
There he goes.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
It was always the plan to move.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
I don't know why you're reacting this way.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
The plan was to move.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
Yeah, for February, for these last couple weeks.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Not the fucking point.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
Thank you so much, Maria, and Ferris, for your...

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Civility.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
I'm here.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
There's room to grow in that regard.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Let's talk about...

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
How do we get truckers back on the road?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I'd love an example.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
All right.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
You're thinking about it.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Yeah.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
So I was thinking we could make the trucks awesome, right?

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
So maybe like imagine a fucking big rig with a jacuz.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
How sick is that?

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Can the driver use it?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Yeah, because here's the thing.

29:26.000 --> 29:34.000
There's actually limits on how many hours truckers can drive to limit, you know, injuries, accidents, etc.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
So they can't drive more than I think it's 10 hours.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
It might be 11 per day.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
So what do you do with, you know, the downtime before you go to sleep?

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Soak.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Yeah.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
I feel like you would take up a lot of space in the cargo area.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Water's really heavy.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
So that's not going to consider to your carrying on, like, sloshing water.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
That could actually affect the truck's movement.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
It could suit you.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
It could cause an accident.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
What's your next idea?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Seven figure salaries.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Can't afford that.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Who would drive for a millie?

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Right.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
A millie?

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
A millie?

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
A millie?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
A millie?

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Yeah.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Yeah.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
You know, no truckers.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
I would truck for a million.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Yep.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Just for a year.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Yeah.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
I think maybe, like, safer rest stop locations.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Yeah.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Free hotels.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Oh, that's what I'm going to do.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
Like, more hotels along highways that maybe have fewer stops.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
I like that.

30:35.000 --> 30:42.000
I think, like, you know, but I'm assuming it's still the case that fewer female drivers exist.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
True.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Correct.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Because of safety.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
That's correct.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
That's correct.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
But I'm wondering maybe if maybe either in addition to our ideally instead of that celebrity visits.

30:53.000 --> 30:59.000
So you know how like celebrities will go to like, you know, visit sailors in the army.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
The Murray.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Yeah.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Mark Ronson could meet a bunch of-

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Oh.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Oh.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Oh, there's punching Jeff.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Where the screen.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Well, those of you listening at home.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
What if Mark Ronson could eat a bunch of truckers?

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Why, Mark Ronson?

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
You're not going to get fucking Madonna.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
You're not going to get Harry Styles out there.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
You should get Harry Styles out there.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
That should be the goal.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I think you could get a Mark Ronson.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
They're not in the air.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Uh, that sounds like fun.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Yeah.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Oh, yeah.

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
You think truck drivers care about a music producer visiting them?

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Fine.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Forget that one.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
What do you guys have?

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
How do we get trucked?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Where we can list it off.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
Sort of off the top of our head.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Five awesome ideas.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Yeah.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
And actually pretty knowledgeable about the trucker industry.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Surprisingly.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Really?

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Oh.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
I didn't clear that.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
I said it was like a said.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
He said.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Open water and a truck.

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
What if we could reroute the trucks to awesome cities?

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
So instead of like West Texas border towns.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
Like, you know, the driver would be in Miami.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Where?

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
I'm sorry.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Where?

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Miami.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Have you ever been to Miami?

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Once, yeah.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
That was it.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
It's stuck.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
I hated it.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
But that's true.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
I don't like Mark Ronson either.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
But we're talking about truckers.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
Not me.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
They don't like it.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
They wouldn't like it.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
How about some augmented reality?

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
So the truckers can still truck to where they're actually supposed to go.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Yeah.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
It can look like Miyami.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
That's really good.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
Now we're thinking, what if instead of augmented reality, though, it's augmented reality.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
So it's basically like it's AR, but they're just driving through Ogden, Utah.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
The entire time.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Mmm.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
That's really good.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
That's really good.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
That's really good.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
All right.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
I mean, my last idea.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Do you guys even want to hear it at this point?

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Sure.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
It's really good.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Yeah.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
What about?

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
You know, like, do you guys have Chase?

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Do you guys make with Chase?

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
I do.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
You know how like, or no, I just have a credit card with them.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Yeah.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Do you have the Sapphire?

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Does that change things?

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Yeah, the Sapphire.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
You know how about getting to certain lounges.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Because you have the Chase Sapphire card.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Do you guys have the Chase?

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
I have the Chase freedom.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
So I wonder if that.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
The freedom I'm talking about.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
That might not get you into Sapphire lounges.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
But let's just say that you get certain VIP access with certain

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
credit cards.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
I want to get a 1% cashback.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
So I'm not sure.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
I've got it.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Maybe it makes sense.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Yeah, you got to get the Sapphire.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
I don't have the checking and savings that you're asking us if we have.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
And I don't either.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
But you can get, you know, three points on dining or travel with the truck.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
You know, it's not going to get truckers back on the road.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
This horse shit that just happened for the last 20 seconds.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Or you guys are waxing about credit card rewards.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
So you started there.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
I just want to make sure we're on the way.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
We're on the way.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
We're pointing out the lounges.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
Locers only VIP access.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
Where?

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Motor Coach Ella.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
So that would be a whole artist that's saying about highways,

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
rascal flats, AC DC, et cetera.

34:03.000 --> 34:08.000
Life is a hyuait that I learned about the rascal flats was a cover corresponded

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
to that.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
I didn't know hated when I learned that.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
The truck dance film festival.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
It's all movies about trucks like dual份,

34:17.000 --> 34:24.920
Why is this good, why, like, we're trying to get them jobs and you just want them to have

34:24.920 --> 34:29.960
reward, why did you sign up for the chase afire card? Because of the rewards. I see.

34:29.960 --> 34:33.240
You're not just going to sign up for a credit card that has no rewards. I'm not going to get a job

34:33.240 --> 34:38.440
choose to go into a fucking field that's dangerous, depriving. Why can't they just go to regular Coachella?

34:38.440 --> 34:41.720
Why does that have to be a trucker specific event?

34:41.720 --> 34:49.720
So you're saying like a, like a trucker's VIP lounge at an already existing event?

34:49.720 --> 34:55.400
Yeah, right, because then it's not VIP if everyone at the event is the same status.

34:57.720 --> 35:06.360
You make me a bad guess, which I've never said about any host work. You're more bad than I can

35:06.360 --> 35:12.520
possibly add to the show. You come in here with a negative attitude and it just sort of

35:12.520 --> 35:18.440
you spend an hour poisoning us. And then you leave another guy. I do so much work to like actually

35:18.440 --> 35:26.040
make sense of what you say on an any day basis. You feel great. It makes me feel crazy and

35:26.040 --> 35:29.960
you're going to somehow get those easily the benefit of doubt,

35:29.960 --> 35:37.800
right, which I can't, I have to imagine is exhausting. It's hard. I leave with fatigue.

35:39.800 --> 35:52.840
You tire me because you are a tire. T-Y-R-E. The truck B-A finals. What's that? It's an all-trucker

35:52.840 --> 36:06.040
basketball championship. What about the traskers? The traskers. We can't play this music over with

36:06.760 --> 36:13.720
that was gold, man. Again, Marika. The traskers. No, the buzzer. I don't see how that's

36:13.720 --> 36:19.720
ever than the truck dance film festival. Let's hear it. You want me to say why it's better?

36:19.720 --> 36:23.560
It's self-evident. Forget it. The traskers.

36:49.800 --> 36:57.560
I don't like seeing your garage band open. Do you guys remember? Do you guys know

36:57.560 --> 37:06.360
wordle? Of course. We all all know. Got a two today. Wow. You got a two. Got a two.

37:06.360 --> 37:09.080
You got a two on wordle, right? Got a two on wordle, right? Got a two on wordle today.

37:10.040 --> 37:19.720
Well, this is blurred. So for the listener's Jeff has his screen up to a custom wordle

37:19.720 --> 37:26.680
and it's just covered the block part with a preview window of a gray square.

37:26.760 --> 37:40.760
Oh, really? Hi, Lordle. You guys want to play? Sure. Yes. Sure. Nice. I have three

37:40.760 --> 37:45.880
combinations of this. So let's start with Marika. This is your, this is your blurredle. So basically it's

37:45.880 --> 37:50.520
wordle, but you cannot see what you're guessing or even what you're typing. Can you see the results?

37:50.600 --> 37:57.800
Right, not. Okay. So you just have five random guesses to get a word. Yeah. And then after you

37:57.800 --> 38:04.680
guess all six, then you get to see if you got anything correct. All right. I'm going to go first word.

38:07.480 --> 38:14.680
Great. Fuck. What was your first word today when you got to? It was black.

38:14.840 --> 38:25.880
Um, uh, sort of interesting because I can't type on here. Yeah, you can't do without us seeing it.

38:25.880 --> 38:31.320
Okay. What do you guys do? What you could do is just a shutter screen. Yeah. Exactly.

38:32.520 --> 38:38.280
All right. So you shared your screen and that sort of defeated the purpose of the game.

38:38.280 --> 38:42.440
And you had to create a second layer on top of the shared screen. All right. Here we go. Great.

38:42.520 --> 38:45.880
If you just didn't do anything, it's your EAT or GRAT.

38:47.720 --> 38:55.880
GRAT. All right. But now the problem is that I, well, I guess I can just guess whatever

38:56.920 --> 39:03.640
word that I want, but it's hard for me to keep track of what I've already guessed. Do you want any hints?

39:05.480 --> 39:12.200
What? Oh, it doesn't have to feed the entire purpose of this game. The goal is to get the word

39:13.400 --> 39:23.080
but I can't write. I can't write. What words or letters are correct. So why is hard? Are you going to give me that was a good guess.

39:23.080 --> 39:26.520
That's all I was going to say was the hint was great was a good guess. Okay.

39:28.760 --> 39:41.240
I'm going to go with. Oh, boy. Um, that actually works. Oh boy. Um,

39:43.000 --> 39:53.240
Master. Tread. TREAD. Interesting. All right. Um,

39:55.320 --> 40:03.240
going to go. Great. GRIP. The great. Okay. Interesting. This is crazy.

40:03.400 --> 40:24.360
I'm going to go grips. GRPS. I'll take it home with a grits. GRAT. T. S. You have one more guess.

40:25.800 --> 40:31.880
Do you want one more hint? Sure. In the last five, you have guessed all the correct letters.

40:32.760 --> 40:35.400
In the right places, but not in the right word.

40:38.840 --> 40:44.760
Not in the right word. I understand what he means. Like, that's exactly the board horizontally.

40:44.760 --> 40:50.360
You have a green thing in all five things, but not all at once, obviously. Sure.

40:50.360 --> 40:56.840
What? Just show the board. That would be nice. It's brutal. It's like a grand reveal at the

40:56.840 --> 41:00.840
end where she could try to figure out what the word is. You might want to do your sixth answer.

41:00.840 --> 41:09.480
Where are my words? Your words are great. Bread. Gripe. Grips. Grits. That's funny.

41:14.600 --> 41:20.280
All right. Here's my question. Can can I take a second to think about this? Because this could

41:20.280 --> 41:26.280
be this would be crazy. If I get this right. Yes. Yes. You can't. So can someone else do theirs?

41:26.360 --> 41:31.560
Can we circle back to me? Yeah. All right. Here we go. Ferris, you're up. My man.

41:35.560 --> 41:42.840
Those smallest token of esteem to hear you say that meant nothing. You're also going to regret

41:43.960 --> 41:48.840
calling me that because I'm going to be an awful guest for this. I've never actually said.

41:48.840 --> 41:53.640
So this is the board. This is the board. I kind of get. I have to find it. Yeah. I kind of get the

41:53.720 --> 42:00.680
concept. I guess five letter words really. Yeah. Yeah. That's one way to do it. But yeah.

42:00.680 --> 42:04.520
I noticed what based on what Marie could do, though, you kind of want some similarities in the

42:04.520 --> 42:08.680
words. I don't know. We'll see. Only if you get letters right, which I cannot. Which we don't

42:08.680 --> 42:17.960
know for me. Yeah. Oh, my goodness. All right. Five letter word. Solid. Solid.

42:18.120 --> 42:26.200
Did. Let's say. I will your first hint there is that solid was anything, but

42:27.160 --> 42:33.160
all of those were wrong. I didn't say. Oh, well. Yes. Oh, I see what you're saying. Maybe it's

42:34.360 --> 42:40.360
maybe they were all right. Maybe they weren't. But let's try. Let's try water. I think I'm picking up

42:40.360 --> 43:04.680
what you're putting down. Better. Okay. Let's say. Let's say waste. Let's do wacky. This is tough to see.

43:04.920 --> 43:13.640
So it's going poorly. I'm using sort of the brownly method here from whatever I could pick

43:13.640 --> 43:24.600
up from what she was doing. It's completely blind. That's nothing. There's no good or bad. That's why it's

43:24.600 --> 43:31.240
hard. That's why it's hard. And it's also like to not be a real word, right? Like this is right. Jeff,

43:31.880 --> 43:37.640
we're at the whim of the map. No, it's real words. That's the other fucking hint. You guys suck.

43:38.840 --> 43:45.080
Ferris and Mariek are the only people giving me anything today. Let's try. Let's try. I'm doing pretty well.

43:45.080 --> 43:55.560
Jeans. Yeah. I'm trying to get in your head space, man. Jeans. You have one more guest. You want to do the

43:55.560 --> 44:02.760
Mariek style or give it some thought? I would say that mean. You haven't told him anything.

44:02.760 --> 44:06.760
Yeah, of course I have nothing to go off of, right? Then let's not do it the Mariek style. Because

44:06.760 --> 44:13.960
Mariek is fucking close. It'll be only I only know where one letter for Ferris. That's the

44:13.960 --> 44:21.160
promise. You're nowhere close to it. So you might as well guess one more time. I just I might as well go

44:21.160 --> 44:32.920
fully random. No way. He gets it. This is crazy. He's going to say it. I'm sending it to him.

44:33.880 --> 44:37.640
You're basically like saying I'm thinking of a number between one and five thousand.

44:39.960 --> 44:50.360
All right. Bumps was the closest you had. It was B and you. It was burnt.

44:51.240 --> 45:04.280
Oh. Nice. That went pretty bad. Yep. So yeah. I'm going to guess. Okay. Here it is. Are you sure you

45:04.280 --> 45:13.960
want to guess right now? Do you want one final hint? Do you want one final one? Sure. And we'll

45:13.960 --> 45:19.960
go to a mirror and then we'll go to you. Last hint is there is a double letter. All right.

45:20.600 --> 45:28.840
Or rather there's a repeat letter in this word. Okay. All right. You're smart.

45:31.720 --> 45:42.520
All right. Amir. Are you ready for a turtle? Sucky. Sorry. Give me one fucking second.

45:42.840 --> 45:52.440
Because this weird thing happened where the custom word will recognize my IP address.

45:52.440 --> 45:57.800
And this was the one that I tested it out on. So it says that you already got it right,

45:57.800 --> 46:03.320
which is incorrect. So I need to think of right now a custom word here. Okay. Give me a second.

46:03.320 --> 46:09.400
All right. I got it. All right. Now are you ready? Yeah. Let me just hang on.

46:10.200 --> 46:18.440
This is this is your board and I give them all the same board you don't care. All right.

46:19.160 --> 46:21.800
What's your first word? Sucky. Badly.

46:28.600 --> 46:29.240
Toxic.

46:29.560 --> 46:40.360
Mereka's by the way, Marieka's going to fucking get this just based on your facial. It's like you're

46:40.360 --> 46:45.320
seriously figuring this thing out. You're going to get it. I feel like even if you know that once you

46:45.320 --> 46:49.320
see this board you're going to be impressed with yourself. Amir keep it going. Come on.

46:52.280 --> 46:57.720
Phone as in phone it in you don't do any work on this show.

46:58.600 --> 47:03.640
I don't like that some of these are I feel like tires and a code message for you are

47:03.640 --> 47:14.040
tired and we grow tired of your games, which is my last word games. I need one more how about loser.

47:20.040 --> 47:25.640
And that's that, right? It was theirs. Nice.

47:27.720 --> 47:36.200
Well, I think I made my message, right? Badly. I'd just say badly because this is how this

47:36.200 --> 47:43.400
sequence going. Then toxic because I see you are. Phone because funny it in. Yep.

47:43.400 --> 47:47.720
I already said that one. Tired because I look at the audience grows tired of you. Yeah.

47:47.720 --> 47:54.600
Games seems positive to me. Games will find but ultimately you're a loser at games. Yeah.

47:54.680 --> 48:04.840
And life in that games. Damn. That was ultimately a tough pill to swallow but I think I'm

48:04.840 --> 48:08.840
going to go forth into the world and with this show week to week with that knowledge.

48:11.800 --> 48:15.400
We love you for it, dude. Yeah.

48:16.120 --> 48:21.720
Maria, are you ready for this final guess? I think you might get it.

48:23.720 --> 48:29.160
Do you want your final hint? I don't even even you like for hints but I like this word could

48:29.160 --> 48:33.880
have been definition wise. It could have been in one of them yours guesses.

48:39.000 --> 48:39.720
Is it right?

48:40.040 --> 48:46.360
What do you guys think based on Jeff's face when you said something? I got her.

48:46.360 --> 48:57.080
Oh, that's true. Very nice. Wow. That's really close. This is like someone actually

48:57.080 --> 49:03.560
playing. Yeah. Yeah. Because you could if you just knew that the E was in it, you know,

49:03.560 --> 49:08.200
Jeff made the game a little better. Yeah, I was looking at all of the words or all of the words

49:08.200 --> 49:12.440
like lined up and trying to I knew that the R had to be there because it was in every guess.

49:13.880 --> 49:19.560
And then when he said there were two letters or repeat letter, I knew it could only be a T

49:19.560 --> 49:28.360
repeating or an E repeating. All right. That's nice. It's kind of like a burners English sedoku.

49:28.360 --> 49:35.400
Yeah. And I assumed it wouldn't be treat because I would have gotten that like it would have been like

49:36.280 --> 49:43.640
tread was so close or whatever. He would have freaked the fuck out. Yeah. Yeah. And so guys is the actual

49:43.640 --> 49:51.640
game of wordle more like mentally fulfilling satisfying than Blurdle? Yeah. Because he was like

49:51.640 --> 49:57.640
actually this or something. Yeah, this would kind of made me feel bad while playing it in the worst

49:57.640 --> 50:04.680
after. I feel good because I did get it right and like not about it a lot, but for you guys who didn't

50:04.760 --> 50:11.400
really have hints. Yeah, I can I can see it when Maria had hints because you were already so close.

50:11.400 --> 50:17.880
Yeah, I'd be able to have guessed it. Yeah. Was this meant to be kind of like an art piece like a

50:17.880 --> 50:23.000
challenge Jeff? Like is that what you wanted to get across was pain for the user?

50:24.680 --> 50:30.120
Is that's like a valid artistic decision, right in your in your game design. But so if it's that it was like a

50:30.120 --> 50:36.840
cool art piece when you mentioned it. Yeah, I feel. Then yes, but we know you do. But I think that's kind of how

50:36.840 --> 50:46.200
Jeff approaches a lot of things, right? Pain for the user is kind of his MO. This is true. This is true.

50:48.120 --> 50:56.680
It worked. I mean you're just wrinkles are back so wrinkly so many. How how do you have

50:56.680 --> 51:01.080
that many muscles in your. Yeah, like at most I can get one here. I can't.

51:02.920 --> 51:08.520
In my house growing up, you had to get good at being angry. Jesus.

51:13.560 --> 51:23.480
Sad beginning to a one-man show. I love to see Jeff's one-man show. Could you imagine that? I think this is it.

51:27.640 --> 51:33.240
What about Carson? Like late or the tonight show starring Johnny Carson? But every time instead of the

51:33.240 --> 51:38.520
him walking out to hear Johnny, it was him like kind of revealing a not even darker corner of his past.

51:41.720 --> 51:46.280
There's a small town in Reno that I'm never allowed back in.

51:46.680 --> 51:59.320
I owe Alemonie to two other women other than my wife and she doesn't know.

52:01.720 --> 52:02.360
That's good.

52:05.080 --> 52:07.640
For age nine to twelve, I lived under water.

52:07.880 --> 52:10.120
Oh my god.

52:14.760 --> 52:17.240
I don't know how I got these kurt.

52:24.520 --> 52:26.760
Johnny Carson is a fish

52:27.480 --> 52:29.480
for that.

52:29.480 --> 52:51.760
Oh man, yeah, Ferris Monchi on Instagram and yeah, look up for the USSR cover, probably

52:51.760 --> 52:58.600
everywhere you listen, but apparently maybe not Apple iTunes, but yeah, basically everywhere.

52:58.920 --> 53:04.680
Check it out. It should be out by the time of by the time you're hearing this. Oh, yeah. Ferris Monchi across platforms.

53:06.280 --> 53:06.760
America.

53:09.080 --> 53:13.160
Follow me on Twitter, Instagram and letter box at Marie Gailon.

53:14.680 --> 53:20.440
Some new had gun podcasts are coming out slash have already come out enemies. Please a trigger.

53:21.160 --> 53:28.040
That's out early fun. Check it out. I think I think when this comes up at the very least,

53:28.120 --> 53:32.440
the confronting demons trailer with Meg Stalker and her brother,

53:34.360 --> 53:43.160
will be up. So, what, or listen to that? Yeah fun, fun stuff. She's funny, but

53:43.160 --> 53:48.920
productivity has never been in her strong suit. I don't like speak to her character, right?

53:50.440 --> 53:55.800
Just took a while to get the show off the ground as well. I don't know anything about the

53:55.800 --> 54:08.920
production stuff. The show. Yeah. You never will be. She bodies me on the retreat again.

54:10.120 --> 54:13.720
Yeah, I would love, I hope, but this one's Bob's Ask of all court.

54:17.640 --> 54:22.680
Mira, what are you going on? Not much. The jam is back. I was on an episode and they let me punch

54:22.680 --> 54:30.920
off the jam with them. I'm wrapping like a beastie boy in a parody of Brass Monkey.

54:31.800 --> 54:36.200
Nice. I love that. That's awesome. Check it out. It's at the end of my episode.

54:37.480 --> 54:42.920
That's a weird owl on an episode. Correct. And the complete guide to everything another

54:42.920 --> 54:49.320
gun podcast they're on. Great show up back. deja vu by Olivia Rodrigo. Nice.

54:50.200 --> 54:56.520
Um, we'll end it with a Super Bowl picks in two days from now. Who do we think one?

54:57.720 --> 55:04.040
Who is playing? Maria without that knowledge. Sort of like blurred. Why don't you just guess a team?

55:05.000 --> 55:11.080
A Seattle Seahawks. Interesting. Oh, I'm here.

55:12.520 --> 55:17.960
Give me the bangles to not only cover, but upset the Los Angeles Rams.

55:19.800 --> 55:24.920
Bangles 33. Rams 20. Throughout the Rams are Los Angeles now.

55:26.680 --> 55:31.640
Ferris. Pitsburg Steelers, man.

55:34.840 --> 55:43.720
I'll take uh, bangles in five. There's only one game. I didn't mean in a five game series.

55:43.800 --> 55:50.280
What do you mean? Who's performing at the high. Doctor J, M&M, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar.

55:50.280 --> 55:53.480
Incredible. That's going to be interesting. I'll tune in the bat for sure.

55:54.600 --> 55:56.840
Probably see some new movie trailers. That's fun.

55:58.760 --> 56:03.720
Aced to do my taxes during the Super Bowl. That's my tradition. That's a fun tradition.

56:03.720 --> 56:06.520
I'm actually going to keep behind that. Yeah. Recommend it.

56:07.160 --> 56:11.080
Great. Faith. Jeff's face is a back. That's like me going to the DMV on Christmas.

56:11.800 --> 56:17.560
Jeff, do you have anything to plug? He's drooling or crying or something. You're leaking, man,

56:17.560 --> 56:25.000
and the show. He's bloodletting. He released the forehead muscles and all the fluid

56:25.000 --> 56:33.880
juices. He's getting at coming out. He's getting at ketane. My plug is uh, fire plugs.

56:34.760 --> 56:41.720
Oh, come on, man. Everyone knows. You can see it received.

56:59.320 --> 57:01.080
That was a hit-dum original.

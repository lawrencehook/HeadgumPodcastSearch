00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:02.000 --> 00:14.000
I like you.

Copyright WESNN

00:28.880 --> 00:39.360
If you have to do it regardless of how mad you are, something we're working on and

00:39.360 --> 00:44.840
couples therapy that in order to break any tension, Jake has to, or Jeff has to call

00:44.840 --> 00:51.840
in response, my cheese with a similar cheese.

00:51.840 --> 00:56.840
Anyway, I just don't think that.

00:56.840 --> 01:00.840
I have this really isn't working out communication.

01:00.840 --> 01:08.840
My fear is that things are getting lost and translation.

01:08.840 --> 01:15.840
It's getting made so far.

01:15.840 --> 01:16.840
We're back.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.840
On Wednesday, all right, no segments prepared.

01:19.840 --> 01:24.840
I said, let's run it back with as many segments as probable.

01:24.840 --> 01:25.840
And that's what I've done today.

01:25.840 --> 01:37.840
So this is an episode I'm calling segment mania.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.840
It's at wax free there.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.840
Like we're not going to catch up because we already did that.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.840
Absolutely not.

01:43.840 --> 01:45.840
Let's get into the first segment.

01:45.840 --> 01:46.840
Yeah.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.840
What we should say, we have Ali Khan.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.840
Killer Moriarty and a mere Blumenfeld.

01:50.840 --> 01:51.840
Yet again.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.840
Is this the first back-to-back?

01:54.840 --> 01:55.840
No.

01:55.840 --> 01:58.840
There's definitely been like a lot of weeks where it's you, me, Marica.

01:58.840 --> 01:59.840
Graces.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.840
Yeah, or some shit.

02:01.840 --> 02:02.840
Yeah.

02:02.840 --> 02:03.840
Any head gum historians?

02:03.840 --> 02:04.840
Let us know.

02:04.840 --> 02:06.840
This is the first full four for four.

02:06.840 --> 02:08.840
Back-to-back.

02:08.840 --> 02:09.840
Yeah.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.840
Well, Ali, did you get a haircut?

02:11.840 --> 02:13.840
No, but I did my hair today.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.840
I just had to make an effort.

02:15.840 --> 02:16.840
Thank you.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.840
I haven't showered since Sunday.

02:18.840 --> 02:19.840
Okay.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.840
Y'all said you woke up 12 minutes ago.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.840
I woke up 17 minutes ago.

02:24.840 --> 02:25.840
Still.

02:25.840 --> 02:26.840
All right.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.840
Good morning.

02:28.840 --> 02:32.840
I've been up and I showered.

02:32.840 --> 02:34.840
But thanks for noticing.

02:37.840 --> 02:41.840
That was good timing.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.840
Welcome to Supermarket Chee!

02:44.840 --> 02:47.840
Chee!

02:47.840 --> 02:52.840
You guys know, Supermarket Sweep.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.840
How's the bed Leslie Jones?

02:54.840 --> 02:55.840
Very sure.

02:55.840 --> 02:58.840
But like a bunch of stuff in your shopping cart or something.

02:58.840 --> 03:02.840
Yeah, but there's also like many game shows, quizzes, and stuff.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.840
So this is Supermarket Chee!

03:05.840 --> 03:06.840
So the following.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.840
It's really just questions about grocery items.

03:09.840 --> 03:11.840
Multiple choice style.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.840
Are we ready?

03:13.840 --> 03:14.840
Why not?

03:14.840 --> 03:16.840
I think it's a question one.

03:16.840 --> 03:21.840
Which salad is the best seller at Safeway?

03:21.840 --> 03:22.840
A.

03:22.840 --> 03:23.840
Henn.

03:23.840 --> 03:24.840
B.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.840
Other.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.840
Usually there's like a title screen.

03:28.840 --> 03:30.840
You didn't do like the Photoshop stuff with like, yeah.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.840
There's, we have so many segments.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.840
I didn't have time to Photoshop it.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.840
Wait, so the options are Henn and other.

03:38.840 --> 03:42.840
I guess other other salad.

03:42.840 --> 03:43.840
Yeah, other.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.840
I don't know what a Henn's salad is.

03:45.840 --> 03:46.840
That's correct.

03:46.840 --> 03:52.840
Well, it's like chicken, but it's basically from females.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.840
Yeah.

03:55.840 --> 03:59.840
What is the official cheese of joy?

03:59.840 --> 04:03.840
Camembert or other?

04:04.840 --> 04:05.840
Other.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.840
Well, I guess what you have.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.840
Correct.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.840
I can not bear that.

04:11.840 --> 04:12.840
Nice.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.840
That's really good.

04:14.840 --> 04:22.840
I don't know if I want to totally make the judgment call, but I think it'd be like.

04:22.840 --> 04:23.840
Good.

04:23.840 --> 04:24.840
Because it's good.

04:24.840 --> 04:29.840
Is string cheese a type of cheese or is it like just mozzarella that can't be strong?

04:29.840 --> 04:31.840
I think mozzarella.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.840
Would they still have a string cheese as a kid?

04:33.840 --> 04:36.840
I haven't had it in probably 30 years.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.840
I was going to say, do you guys sleep?

04:38.840 --> 04:39.840
Is that okay?

04:39.840 --> 04:43.840
We can wax a little bit, like, or string cheese.

04:43.840 --> 04:46.840
I think it's string cheese at the office, actually.

04:46.840 --> 04:47.840
Really?

04:47.840 --> 04:49.840
Do you can break this cycle?

04:49.840 --> 04:50.840
Do you indulge?

04:50.840 --> 04:54.840
I'll need a string cheese, but I won't pull it apart when I think it's because it's not an animal.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.840
Just jump into it.

04:56.840 --> 04:57.840
Oh, interesting.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.840
So you're going to argue jumping into it is more unrealistic.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.840
I don't want to play with my food.

05:02.840 --> 05:03.840
I want to eat it.

05:03.840 --> 05:09.840
That's what I like about string cheese is that it is interactive.

05:09.840 --> 05:10.840
Oh, wow.

05:10.840 --> 05:12.840
There's a ritual.

05:12.840 --> 05:13.840
Yeah.

05:13.840 --> 05:14.840
I should have a string cheese.

05:14.840 --> 05:15.840
It's been so long.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.840
What about kick cats, Kayla?

05:17.840 --> 05:19.840
Are you fighting into all four at the same time?

05:19.840 --> 05:22.840
Are you giving a break?

05:22.840 --> 05:24.840
Once again, I'm not an animal.

05:24.840 --> 05:25.840
I would never do that.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.840
But I also don't really eat a lot of candy.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.840
You're eating a ton of sour candy.

05:29.840 --> 05:30.840
I don't eat chocolate.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.840
But if I gave you a kick cat, that's four bars.

05:33.840 --> 05:38.840
If it'll make you happy, I'll put all four in just as a bit.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.840
She likes that.

05:40.840 --> 05:41.840
That's a bit.

05:41.840 --> 05:42.840
I feel like that.

05:42.840 --> 05:43.840
Okay.

05:43.840 --> 05:44.840
You won't go.

05:44.840 --> 05:49.840
With a $5.49 cent coupon, what could you get for free?

05:49.840 --> 05:51.840
Briar's ice cream.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.840
Garlicky pea tendrils.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.840
Garlicky wafers.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.840
Or cookies in lime pocky.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.840
Really wafers.

06:00.840 --> 06:03.840
That's not a thing.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.840
Pocky?

06:05.840 --> 06:08.840
I'll go with option A.

06:08.840 --> 06:12.840
Alley is correct.

06:12.840 --> 06:16.840
Briar's ice cream is 549.

06:16.840 --> 06:20.840
What month is Garlick month?

06:20.840 --> 06:22.840
A January.

06:22.840 --> 06:23.840
A.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.840
D.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.840
Oli.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.840
B.A.Prol.

06:29.840 --> 06:33.840
C.June D. December.

06:33.840 --> 06:37.840
They really tough one.

06:37.840 --> 06:42.840
I was thinking June, but I don't know why.

06:42.840 --> 06:44.840
Hot garlic.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.840
103.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.840
I got a garlic of 103.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.840
I'm sorry.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.840
Are we boring, you Jeff?

06:55.840 --> 06:58.840
You are.

06:58.840 --> 07:03.840
Just singing's not enough.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.840
Okay, that was right.

07:05.840 --> 07:06.840
It was April.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.840
What's that?

07:09.840 --> 07:19.840
That was my guess because that's when like a lot of bold flowers can be planted.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.840
Garlick is a bold.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.840
Oh, that was smart.

07:23.840 --> 07:24.840
Garlick.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.840
I'm hot garlic.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.840
I'm hot garlic.

07:29.840 --> 07:34.840
Well, April is national garlic month and you can celebrate it in two ways in the garden and the kitchen.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.840
Thank you.

07:37.840 --> 07:40.840
Um, doesn't really say why.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.840
That's okay.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.840
Okay.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.840
Um.

07:46.840 --> 07:50.840
What snack do you think lies in Manelli always stalks?

07:58.840 --> 08:01.840
Rules or D. Cookies and lime pockies.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.840
It's the same answer, choice.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.840
That's the last one.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.840
A.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.840
I think you're right.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.840
This one's subjective, but I do think you're right.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.840
That it's the Petee biscuits.

08:16.840 --> 08:20.840
Um, with a $7.49 coupon, what can you get for free?

How many paper towels?

08:31.840 --> 08:33.840
Uh, a single roll.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.840
Let's go double roll.

08:35.840 --> 08:39.840
$7 is a lot for two paper towels, so.

My wife and D. Well salad.

08:54.840 --> 08:55.840
Yeah.

What meat is usually most expensive?

Corn beef.

Correct.

09:15.840 --> 09:16.840
Corn beef.

09:16.840 --> 09:17.840
Corn beef.

09:17.840 --> 09:18.840

09:18.840 --> 09:19.840

09:19.840 --> 09:21.840
Corn beef.

09:21.840 --> 09:22.840

All right. That was, uh, um,

09:52.840 --> 09:55.840
supermarket cheese.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.840
All right.

09:59.840 --> 10:03.840
Welcome to, this is the wrong song for it, but

10:20.840 --> 10:22.840
Oh, that's terrible.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.840
Welcome to Are We Sad.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.840
Um, Queen Elizabeth is dead.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.840
Um, and here's how we play the game.

10:30.840 --> 10:33.840
I'm just going to second.

10:33.840 --> 10:34.840
Which one?

10:34.840 --> 10:35.840
Junior.

10:35.840 --> 10:36.840
Yeah.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.840
Queen Elizabeth.

10:39.840 --> 10:43.840
We're going to go down the line here and just say yes or no.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.840
Are you sad?

10:45.840 --> 10:46.840
Ali, are you sad?

10:46.840 --> 10:48.840
No.

10:48.840 --> 10:51.840
Kayla, are you sad about the Queen day?

10:51.840 --> 10:52.840
No.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.840
I'm here.

10:54.840 --> 10:56.840
I'm not personally sad though.

10:56.840 --> 10:59.840
I understand it is sad to lose a family member.

10:59.840 --> 11:03.840
So I'm sure some people are sad.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.840
Uh, I had nothing.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.840
No personal relationship.

11:07.840 --> 11:08.840
No professional.

11:08.840 --> 11:12.840
I mean, we dated back in the day, but like other than that.

11:12.840 --> 11:13.840
What?

11:13.840 --> 11:14.840
What?

11:14.840 --> 11:16.840
Okay. So you turned 18 and what?

11:16.840 --> 11:17.840
2000.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.840
One. Yeah.

11:19.840 --> 11:20.840
2001.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.840
So you dated her in her 70s?

11:23.840 --> 11:25.840
I didn't ask.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.840
Friends set us up.

11:28.840 --> 11:31.840
Just said, where did you go?

11:31.840 --> 11:33.840
London.

11:33.840 --> 11:36.840
This is my friend Liz.

11:36.840 --> 11:43.840
My buddy Charles was like, would you ever be with an older woman?

11:43.840 --> 11:46.840
So your friends with the current king?

11:46.840 --> 11:47.840
No way.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.840
Not the more.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.840
The son was setting up his marry mother with you.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.840
It sounds insane.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.840
You heard these games before.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.840
They're all kind of crazy.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.840
The game is not.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.840
No, that's not why this is crazy because you're saying that.

12:05.840 --> 12:06.840
Yeah.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.840
You have T like, what did you talk about?

12:08.840 --> 12:09.840
Yeah.

12:09.840 --> 12:10.840
Nothing in common.

12:10.840 --> 12:11.840
Exactly.

12:11.840 --> 12:12.840
We tried.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.840
I guess she attended a football game in the 50s.

12:14.840 --> 12:17.840
So I was like asking her about that, but she had no fucking clue.

12:17.840 --> 12:18.840
What was going on?

12:18.840 --> 12:19.840
Yeah.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.840
She went to like a Marilyn football game in like 1957 or something.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.840
Asked her who won.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.840
Did you know who you were?

12:26.840 --> 12:27.840
Right.

12:27.840 --> 12:29.840
No, Jake and him hadn't even happened yet.

12:29.840 --> 12:30.840
Yeah.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.840
She had like read my weird like live journal in high school.

12:33.840 --> 12:34.840
But that's it.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.840
There's no way.

12:36.840 --> 12:37.840
Why?

12:37.840 --> 12:39.840
You don't think she was online?

12:39.840 --> 12:42.840
I don't think she was on your live.

12:42.840 --> 12:45.840
Yeah.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.840
I mean like she was also 96.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.840
Kind of a miracle.

12:51.840 --> 12:52.840
She's still alive.

12:52.840 --> 12:56.840
What do you guys think the age is where after you die,

12:56.840 --> 12:58.840
it's like not that sad.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.840
It's kind of like, well, yeah.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.840
Is it 85?

13:03.840 --> 13:04.840
Go.

13:04.840 --> 13:05.840
I'll go 90.

13:05.840 --> 13:08.840
I don't know how to answer that question.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.840
110.

13:12.840 --> 13:13.840
Wow.

13:14.840 --> 13:15.840
Thank you.

13:17.840 --> 13:18.840
Up.

13:18.840 --> 13:19.840
Go.

13:19.840 --> 13:20.840
All right.

13:20.840 --> 13:21.840
That was.

13:21.840 --> 13:22.840
Are we sad?

13:39.840 --> 13:42.840
How did you find that off beat?

13:44.840 --> 13:48.840
This just in a recent article from consumer reports titled,

13:48.840 --> 13:52.840
Is Deodorant ever saved to wear down there?

13:52.840 --> 13:55.840
Begs the titular question.

13:55.840 --> 14:00.840
So let's put together a list of things to put near your grundle.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.840
And then I'll comment it on the article.

14:06.840 --> 14:12.840
Let's put together a list of things to put on your grundle.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.840
And you'll comment it on the article.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.840
Consumer reports.

14:17.840 --> 14:18.840
Yeah.

14:18.840 --> 14:21.840
They have comments under the article that you could leave.

14:21.840 --> 14:26.840
And you're just going to leave a list of things that we come up with to put near your grundle.

14:26.840 --> 14:27.840
Yeah.

14:27.840 --> 14:28.840
Okay.

14:33.840 --> 14:37.840
I mean, just to start things off, garlicy pee tendril.

14:37.840 --> 14:38.840
Sure.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.840
Could be some lime pocket.

14:40.840 --> 14:41.840
Yeah.

14:43.840 --> 14:44.840
Yeah.

14:44.840 --> 14:45.840
Be Dallas.

14:47.840 --> 14:48.840
It's not even April.

14:48.840 --> 14:49.840
It's not garlic.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.840
But it would be garlic.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.840
Does it maybe some kind of fragrance?

14:59.840 --> 15:00.840
Yeah.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.840
Like an artificial one.

15:02.840 --> 15:03.840
Like a.

15:03.840 --> 15:07.840
Mezzon Ludi movie number four.

15:07.840 --> 15:08.840
That long.

15:08.840 --> 15:11.840
That's the.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.840
The scent that I.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.840
And Maddie Healey wear.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.840
Nice.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.840
I found that out years after I started using an alley.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.840
It's still kind of fucking cool.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.840
No, I think that was cool.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.840
It's fun to be clone twins.

15:30.840 --> 15:31.840
Yeah.

15:33.840 --> 15:34.840
Yeah.

15:37.840 --> 15:40.840
I mean, or what do you put in, you know.

15:42.840 --> 15:43.840
You put it down there.

15:43.840 --> 15:44.840
Nothing.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.840
I don't really feel comfortable asking anyone else.

15:53.840 --> 15:54.840
That's correct.

15:54.840 --> 15:55.840
Yeah.

15:57.840 --> 15:58.840
Wow.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.840
You're finally sort of.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.840
Becoming self alert.

16:02.840 --> 16:03.840
Yeah.

16:03.840 --> 16:06.840
Well, I think so, man.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.840
Sorry.

16:09.840 --> 16:10.840
No.

16:10.840 --> 16:11.840
Nothing.

16:11.840 --> 16:12.840
Garlic.

16:12.840 --> 16:13.840
Yeah.

16:13.840 --> 16:14.840
Nothing.

16:14.840 --> 16:15.840
No peace.

16:15.840 --> 16:16.840
No sauce.

16:16.840 --> 16:17.840
Nothing.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.840
I do wonder what would happen if you put vanilla extract.

16:20.840 --> 16:21.840
Somewhere.

16:21.840 --> 16:22.840
You know.

16:24.840 --> 16:27.840
Do you want to smell like hot dessert?

16:29.840 --> 16:30.840
Okay.

16:30.840 --> 16:31.840
Yeah.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.840
That sounds pretty good.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.840
I don't know why this one.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.840
Maybe that would do a halt.

16:38.840 --> 16:39.840
End of less.

16:39.840 --> 16:40.840
Maybe that's all in comment.

16:40.840 --> 16:41.840
Okay.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.840
Ask everyone how their coffee is and make it better.

16:44.840 --> 16:45.840
Yeah.

16:45.840 --> 16:46.840
I'm here.

16:46.840 --> 16:47.840
How's your cock?

16:47.840 --> 16:48.840
It's fine.

16:48.840 --> 16:49.840
Moving on.

16:49.840 --> 16:50.840
We did this.

16:50.840 --> 16:51.840
This is a real question.

16:51.840 --> 16:52.840
When was the last time you had sex?

16:52.840 --> 16:54.840
Don't need to get in.

16:54.840 --> 16:55.840
Last night.

16:55.840 --> 16:56.840
This morning.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.840
Two weeks ago.

16:58.840 --> 17:02.840
I'm just trying to nail down your libido.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.840
So I can help you.

17:05.840 --> 17:06.840
With what?

17:10.840 --> 17:12.840
Okay.

17:12.840 --> 17:13.840
All right.

17:13.840 --> 17:14.840
So what was the list?

17:14.840 --> 17:17.840
The list was olive oil and sides.

17:17.840 --> 17:20.840
The vanilla garlic spheres.

17:20.840 --> 17:23.840
Oh, vanilla extract.

17:23.840 --> 17:25.840
And garlic.

17:25.840 --> 17:26.840
He's getting batteries.

17:26.840 --> 17:27.840
Right.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.840
Garlic pea tendrils.

17:29.840 --> 17:30.840
Right.

17:30.840 --> 17:31.840
Yeah.

17:31.840 --> 17:32.840
I think that's it.

17:32.840 --> 17:33.840
I think that's a good list.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.840
I think that's complete.

17:36.840 --> 17:37.840
Yeah.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.840
It's sort of like a chart.

17:39.840 --> 17:40.840
Yeah.

17:40.840 --> 17:44.840
It's like a Harvard class of like things to put on your.

17:44.840 --> 17:50.840
Ask like because there's diversity amongst the class.

17:50.840 --> 17:53.840
You know, the best of everything.

17:53.840 --> 17:54.840
All right.

17:54.840 --> 17:55.840
I'm the best snack.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.840
Just going to the best fragrance.

17:57.840 --> 17:58.840
The best oil.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.840
The best extract.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.840
For the editor.

18:03.840 --> 18:07.840
All right.

18:07.840 --> 18:08.840
We have to take.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.840
Well, no, I mean, like we can wax for like two seconds.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.840
You know, if you want to have a little bit of waxing, but we do have to take a break very soon.

18:14.840 --> 18:22.840
I just don't end it on this note of me sharing my screen commenting things to put.

18:22.840 --> 18:27.840
In and around your sort of downtown area.

18:27.840 --> 18:31.840
How many segments have we done and how many segments do we have?

18:31.840 --> 18:34.840
Do we have to look forward to?

18:34.840 --> 18:39.840
We've done three and we have three more.

18:39.840 --> 18:41.840
Okay.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.840
All right.

18:43.840 --> 18:48.840
Would you say they're more fleshed out than the.

18:48.840 --> 18:52.840
Coming up with things to comment on the consumer report.

18:52.840 --> 18:53.840
Of course.

18:53.840 --> 18:58.840
About what to put on your grundle or is that sort of level.

18:58.840 --> 18:59.840
Going forward.

18:59.840 --> 19:06.840
It's hard because when that was a set that was one of the six segments that you came up with.

19:06.840 --> 19:07.840
Right.

19:07.840 --> 19:08.840
Yeah.

19:08.840 --> 19:14.840
Because the thing is if I, you know, two segments, I put the same amount of work I put into two segments into six.

19:14.840 --> 19:18.840
So I've spread that effort across six so they're all half baked.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.840
But this is not what you wanted.

19:20.840 --> 19:21.840
Yeah.

19:21.840 --> 19:24.840
Third baked.

19:24.840 --> 19:26.840
Which is not baked, really.

19:26.840 --> 19:29.840
Well, yeah, but sometimes you find it the dough.

19:29.840 --> 19:30.840
All right.

19:30.840 --> 19:34.840
But you can get really sick if you have the chicken.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.840
Take it out after four minutes.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.840
Let's take that break.

19:40.840 --> 19:41.840
Yeah.

19:41.840 --> 19:44.840
That's right.

19:44.840 --> 19:49.840
Now a word from our sponsor better out.

19:49.840 --> 19:55.840
Guys, it can be tough to train your brain to stay in problem solving mode when faced with a challenge in life.

19:56.840 --> 20:01.840
But when you learn how to find your own solutions, there's no better feeling.

20:01.840 --> 20:08.840
And a therapist can help you become a better problem solver, making it easier to accomplish your goals no matter how big or small.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.840
I go to therapy every week.

20:10.840 --> 20:16.840
It makes life much more easier to navigate much more easy.

20:16.840 --> 20:23.840
You know, again, I say this every time we do this at read, but you know, if you have access to it financially.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.840
I think everyone should be in therapy.

20:26.840 --> 20:32.840
Just so you can show up for those around you, if not for yourself as the best version of yourself you can be.

20:32.840 --> 20:38.840
I've seen it pay dividends, definitely in my relationships romantically.

20:38.840 --> 20:42.840
If you're thinking of giving therapy a try, better help is a great option.

20:42.840 --> 20:47.840
It's convenient, accessible, affordable, and entirely online, and you can get matched with a therapist after filling out a brief survey.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.840
And you can switch therapists at any time.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.840
So when you want to be a better problem solver, therapy can get you there.

Thanks, better help.

21:22.840 --> 21:29.840
Welcome to Future Zaddy.

21:29.840 --> 21:39.840
So there are like zaddies in the world right now, like Jeff Goldblum.

21:39.840 --> 21:46.840
I guess George Clooney still.

21:46.840 --> 21:50.840
Conan, if you have freak.

21:50.840 --> 22:06.840
So I thought it'd be fun to sort of postulate on who could be a future zaddy based on who's around now and young and hung.

22:06.840 --> 22:10.840
Tom Holland, what do you think?

22:10.840 --> 22:14.840
Who will be an attractive like 53-year-old?

22:14.840 --> 22:19.840
60-year-old.

22:19.840 --> 22:20.840
Yeah.

22:20.840 --> 22:21.840
What's the second call?

22:21.840 --> 22:24.840
Future zaddy.

22:24.840 --> 22:27.840
Got it.

22:27.840 --> 22:32.840
So you just basically were coming up with people who are in their 20s and hot.

22:32.840 --> 22:37.840
No, yeah, well, sure.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.840
But do you think they're going to age like a fine one?

22:39.840 --> 22:43.840
I don't know if he will be or not.

22:43.840 --> 22:49.840
I'm more loving up the name so we can discuss.

22:49.840 --> 22:55.840
Do you guys think he'll be zaddy?

22:55.840 --> 22:58.840
I'm not exactly convinced.

22:58.840 --> 23:01.840
I don't know if he will be or not.

23:01.840 --> 23:06.840
I'm more loving up the name so we can discuss.

23:06.840 --> 23:10.840
I don't know if he's hot now.

23:10.840 --> 23:16.840
I was always under the impression that to be a zaddy you had to be Jewish.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.840
Interesting.

23:18.840 --> 23:20.840
I've never heard that.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.840
I've also never heard that.

23:22.840 --> 23:24.840
That was maybe just my own assumption.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.840
Go ahead, JD.

23:26.840 --> 23:27.840
Why did you think that?

23:27.840 --> 23:32.840
Well, because I thought it was like an off of zaddy, like a zaddy zaddy.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.840
And that zaddy.

23:35.840 --> 23:39.840
Yeah, and that daddies are not Jewish.

23:39.840 --> 23:44.840
They're glam and that zaddies are Jewish daddies.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.840
That's kind of, that's what I always thought.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.840
So that's why I paused at the Tom Holland because I was like,

23:48.840 --> 23:50.840
I don't think he's Jewish.

23:50.840 --> 23:55.840
So you think a zaddy is a Yiddish grandfather's wife?

23:55.840 --> 23:57.840
Hot man.

23:57.840 --> 24:01.840
I think that a zaddy is a Jewish.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.840
A Jewish version of daddy.

24:04.840 --> 24:07.840
That was my impression.

24:07.840 --> 24:11.840
Guys, I just looked up the definition of zaddy.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.840
Wow.

24:13.840 --> 24:14.840
Okay.

24:14.840 --> 24:15.840
Wait, wow.

24:15.840 --> 24:16.840
How could that be?

24:16.840 --> 24:19.840
That that that's in the Oxford dictionary.

24:19.840 --> 24:22.840
They used your team as you can see.

24:22.840 --> 24:24.840
Oh.

24:24.840 --> 24:25.840
Okay.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.840
That was amazing.

24:27.840 --> 24:30.840
I'm realizing that I'm wrong and that was an assumption that I've made

24:30.840 --> 24:33.840
that it was unchecked until this moment.

24:33.840 --> 24:34.840
That's good.

24:34.840 --> 24:35.840
But that's what we're doing here.

24:35.840 --> 24:39.840
We're sort of learning, growing, changing, evolving.

24:39.840 --> 24:40.840
Yeah.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.840
It is like, why does he at all?

24:43.840 --> 24:44.840
What is that?

24:44.840 --> 24:46.840
Where did that come from?

24:46.840 --> 24:48.840
A little pizzazz to their daddy.

24:48.840 --> 24:49.840
Yeah.

24:49.840 --> 24:55.840
You assume it's like this portment toe where they grab something else.

24:55.840 --> 24:57.840
What was that?

24:57.840 --> 25:02.840
Daddy, chill.

25:02.840 --> 25:03.840
Sorry.

25:03.840 --> 25:07.840
I'm still soaring from being the dictionary definition of zaddy.

25:07.840 --> 25:15.840
Well, I don't think we can move forward, I think.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.840
It would just be taking something away from you.

25:17.840 --> 25:19.840
It wasn't the definition.

25:19.840 --> 25:20.840
Right.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.840
It was the exam.

25:22.840 --> 25:25.840
You're so pleased with yourself.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.840
It is clear that it spelled the way your name.

25:28.840 --> 25:29.840
Yeah, you never see that.

25:29.840 --> 25:31.840
I think that's why I'm forward.

25:31.840 --> 25:32.840
But Tom Holland.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.840
Do we think he'd be his daddy?

25:34.840 --> 25:35.840
Sure.

25:35.840 --> 25:36.840
I don't know.

25:36.840 --> 25:37.840
I think he is.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.840
Yeah.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.840
Gating Madarazo.

25:43.840 --> 25:46.840
They kid from Stranger Things.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.840
Which one is that?

25:49.840 --> 25:51.840
He's like the stockier.

25:51.840 --> 25:52.840
The kid.

25:52.840 --> 25:54.840
We're not going to discuss whether it kid.

25:54.840 --> 25:59.840
It's 19.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.840
Here's my thing.

26:01.840 --> 26:04.840
I don't know if it's Asia or Asa.

26:04.840 --> 26:08.840
For this purpose of this segment.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.840
Asa Butterfield.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.840
A hundred percent.

26:12.840 --> 26:13.840
Yeah.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.840
A hundred percent.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.840
He's already like unbelievably attractive.

26:18.840 --> 26:22.840
I think it's weird because he's his main thing is sex education.

26:22.840 --> 26:24.840
And so like he doesn't.

26:24.840 --> 26:29.840
He's not sexualized in that because he's a kid in the pit show.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.840
He's in a fully adult man.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.840
But he is like at great eyes.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.840
I'm sorry to say.

26:36.840 --> 26:37.840
Never apologize.

26:37.840 --> 26:38.840
Yeah.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.840
That's okay to say.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.840
Where was the photo of him that I saw.

26:42.840 --> 26:43.840
That was like, oh yeah.

26:43.840 --> 26:48.840
That's of course.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.840
Would you say?

26:50.840 --> 26:55.840
We didn't speak.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.840
Can you show this photo, please?

26:57.840 --> 26:58.840
I can't find it.

26:58.840 --> 26:59.840
I don't know.

26:59.840 --> 27:00.840
Oh, here it is.

27:00.840 --> 27:07.840
Okay, here we go.

27:07.840 --> 27:08.840
Right?

27:08.840 --> 27:09.840
Oh, yeah.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.840
His eyes are wild.

27:11.840 --> 27:12.840
Yeah.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.840
He looks like they Martin has a blonde.

27:15.840 --> 27:18.840
He does look like me Martin.

27:19.840 --> 27:26.840
That's the same dude.

27:26.840 --> 27:36.840
Um.

27:36.840 --> 27:42.840
We'll polter.

27:42.840 --> 27:47.840
New segment or this is still part of the same.

27:48.840 --> 27:50.840
I don't know who that is.

27:50.840 --> 27:52.840
Do you mind if I answer some slacks?

27:52.840 --> 27:53.840
Yeah.

27:53.840 --> 27:54.840
You do.

27:54.840 --> 27:55.840
Yeah, you mind.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.840
No, you can.

27:57.840 --> 28:02.840
Will polter's the guy from where the millers.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.840
Mid some some arm.

28:04.840 --> 28:05.840
Mid summer.

28:05.840 --> 28:06.840
How do you say it?

28:06.840 --> 28:07.840
Whatever.

28:07.840 --> 28:08.840
Yeah.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.840
So we died.

28:10.840 --> 28:13.840
I heard he had a glow up.

28:13.840 --> 28:14.840
He did.

28:14.840 --> 28:15.840
That's the guy.

28:15.840 --> 28:16.840
Yeah.

28:16.840 --> 28:17.840
That's crazy.

28:17.840 --> 28:18.840
Just friends.

28:18.840 --> 28:19.840
Okay.

28:19.840 --> 28:22.840
Then if he had a glow up from 18 to whatever.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.840
26, I think it's going to continue.

28:24.840 --> 28:27.840
I think he's going to be a Zaddy.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.840
The trajectory.

28:29.840 --> 28:30.840
Yeah.

28:30.840 --> 28:33.840
Although there's highs and lows, you know.

28:33.840 --> 28:36.840
You don't want to you don't want to peek too early.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.840
That's true.

28:39.840 --> 28:40.840
That was a lot.

28:40.840 --> 28:43.840
I mean, I'd say you did a Zaddy art.

28:44.840 --> 28:48.840
I think in 10 years, you might be there.

28:48.840 --> 28:49.840
Yeah.

28:49.840 --> 28:54.840
I mean, my hair is getting grayer, which is one of the requirements almost.

28:54.840 --> 28:55.840
Yeah.

28:55.840 --> 28:57.840
The very least, half and half.

28:57.840 --> 29:00.840
Yeah.

29:00.840 --> 29:01.840
Oh, yeah.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.840
Had gum live show.

29:17.840 --> 29:22.840
Jeff's hosting a comedy show for us on the.

29:22.840 --> 29:23.840
Sorry.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.840
27.

29:25.840 --> 29:28.840
Um.

29:28.840 --> 29:31.840
Skylar, just on, though.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.840
Who is that?

29:33.840 --> 29:34.840
You know his face.

29:34.840 --> 29:35.840
Yes.

29:35.840 --> 29:36.840
Yeah.

29:36.840 --> 29:40.840
I think he's attractive now in like a weird way.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.840
Skylar, just on, though.

29:43.840 --> 29:46.840
He's the guy who's in like, agreed.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.840
Oh, sure.

29:52.840 --> 29:56.840
He's in the right to stem stones.

29:56.840 --> 29:59.840
He really is in everything.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.840
But he's like.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.840
Cut up.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.840
That's pretty shredded.

30:05.840 --> 30:08.840
Yeah, that's nice.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.840
He's good for him.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.840
He's, he's such a funny face.

30:13.840 --> 30:14.840
Um.

30:14.840 --> 30:15.840
This?

30:15.840 --> 30:16.840
Yeah.

30:16.840 --> 30:18.840
Let's move on.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.840
Let's.

30:34.840 --> 30:37.840
Welcome to Current Zombie.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.840
Um.

30:40.840 --> 30:41.840
Okay.

30:41.840 --> 30:42.840
That was.

30:42.840 --> 30:43.840
You're a zombie.

30:43.840 --> 30:44.840
Yes.

30:44.840 --> 30:45.840
So we're nothing.

30:45.840 --> 30:47.840
Zombie.

30:48.840 --> 30:50.840
Search zombie on Google.

30:50.840 --> 30:53.840
Because I think you coined that.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.840
Are you in the exam for that, too?

30:55.840 --> 31:00.840
Uh, it's not an addictionary.

31:00.840 --> 31:03.840
But it is on Urban Dictionary.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.840
It's on me.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.840
This is the definition.

31:07.840 --> 31:14.840
A tall, tan, hot woman who makes salary to cash and has her crap together.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.840
Salary cash?

31:17.840 --> 31:20.840
She can't have passive income and has to be from an active job.

31:20.840 --> 31:24.840
Oh, we should have added salary to the final run-to-thing.

31:24.840 --> 31:29.840
Because then it could have been salary to cash or salary to cash.

31:29.840 --> 31:42.840
That was easy.

31:42.840 --> 31:44.840
Julia Roberts.

31:44.840 --> 31:45.840
No.

31:45.840 --> 31:46.840
There's only one.

31:46.840 --> 31:47.840
It's not a discussion.

31:47.840 --> 31:48.840
It's not up for discussion.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.840
Why do they have to be tall and tan?

31:51.840 --> 31:55.840
SE Cup.

31:55.840 --> 31:58.840
So this is your tweet that you sort of bump.

31:58.840 --> 32:02.840
This is my thought that I bump everyone's in a while.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.840
What was we supposed to do?

32:05.840 --> 32:09.840
She's a CNN anchor.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.840
Every like three months.

32:11.840 --> 32:14.840
Jeff tweets is SE.

32:14.840 --> 32:16.840
Do you tag her by the way?

32:16.840 --> 32:17.840
Are you just right?

32:17.840 --> 32:18.840
Is SE.

32:18.840 --> 32:20.840
It's not a tiger.

32:20.840 --> 32:23.840
Is SE Cup Zami?

32:23.840 --> 32:31.840
Okay.

32:31.840 --> 32:33.840
And how does the tweet do?

32:33.840 --> 32:35.840
Not well.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.840
Most people don't know who that is.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.840
Or what Zami is.

32:40.840 --> 32:42.840
I guess because most people...

32:42.840 --> 32:43.840
Yeah.

32:43.840 --> 32:44.840
No.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.840
That is the equivalent of Jeff Goldblown.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.840
In some way.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.840
Sure?

32:51.840 --> 32:54.840
Yeah.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.840
That segment was supposed to take five minutes.

32:57.840 --> 32:58.840
How?

32:58.840 --> 33:00.840
Oh, you didn't mean to.

33:00.840 --> 33:03.840
We were starting to discuss and you cut us off.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.840
And you said, no, there's only one answer.

33:05.840 --> 33:06.840
SE Cup.

33:06.840 --> 33:07.840
Nobody knew who that was.

33:07.840 --> 33:08.840
You showed the picture.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.840
90 seconds later we're out.

33:10.840 --> 33:11.840
We're done.

33:11.840 --> 33:13.840
That was supposed to take five minutes.

33:13.840 --> 33:14.840
I thought you would have thoughts.

33:14.840 --> 33:17.840
I thought maybe we were talking about SE Cup.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.840
We're talking about the conversation.

33:19.840 --> 33:20.840
I'm not gonna lie.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.840
Really.

33:22.840 --> 33:24.840
No.

33:24.840 --> 33:27.840
This is somehow worse than the laxing episode.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.840
It's weird how that happened.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.840
So actually episode was good.

33:32.840 --> 33:33.840
Yeah.

33:33.840 --> 33:34.840
Thanks.

33:34.840 --> 33:36.840
I'm into discussing SE Cup.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.840
If you want to discuss SE Cup,

33:38.840 --> 33:41.840
I just want you to be honest with what you want.

33:41.840 --> 33:42.840
Because if you...

33:42.840 --> 33:43.840
You know, you slid that in there.

33:43.840 --> 33:46.840
Like a sneak subject.

33:46.840 --> 34:01.320
subject. Yeah. Let's talk about the C-Cope. Okay. What's the name for show? It's like

34:01.320 --> 34:11.080
the power hour or something. You don't really know. I don't want to see it then. It should

34:11.080 --> 34:20.280
be like the T with Cope or something like that. Yeah. Getting a C-Cope. I didn't know she was a

34:20.280 --> 34:29.720
Ripple with Cope. Then not a zombie. What about the SE? What does that stand for? Salt eggs. I heard

34:29.720 --> 34:38.520
she wrote the outsiders. Oh god. This is two reasons why she can't be zombie to me at least.

34:38.520 --> 34:46.840
She has the same first in middle name as my sister. Wow. Sarah Elizabeth. Yeah. It's called

34:46.840 --> 34:57.720
SE Cope Unfiltered. It's pretty good. Is that a lackluster video, shirt? Where did you get that? How did you

34:58.760 --> 35:05.720
have that? Billy sent it to me. They made merch for us at just short window of time. It's a good

35:05.800 --> 35:13.160
shirt though. Yeah. It says that she went to NYU in Cornell. I don't understand why she's a Republican.

35:16.680 --> 35:21.800
Because she wants to NYU you can't understand why she's a Republican. And Cornell.

35:26.280 --> 35:35.560
I just meant like she's educated. Yeah. I guess a lot of Republicans are edited. She identifies as

35:35.640 --> 35:46.840
a log cabin Republican. Party of Lincoln. Yeah. Yeah. But she wrote it for Biden.

35:48.200 --> 35:54.120
It's nice. Well, Lincoln's Republican party is more similar to the Democratic party of today. That's true.

35:55.160 --> 36:00.440
Cope gets that. She has to understand if she's truly a zombie. She's educated. Remember.

36:01.320 --> 36:13.240
Cornell and Ivy. What about the zombies instead of the zombies for a band name?

36:16.600 --> 36:25.800
Could be like a modern take on the classic. Maybe. Jeff, do you like the zombies? Nope.

36:26.760 --> 36:35.000
This could not be our year. That's a zombie sort of. I love that song. I do love that song.

36:36.040 --> 36:44.040
The bell is a song. Sorry. I was just going to ask about zombie by the cranberries. Oh, that's good.

36:45.000 --> 37:01.560
In your head, zombie, zombie, zombie. I saw it. Corn be corn be corn be corn be. I'm begging of you.

37:01.560 --> 37:05.560
Please don't make a hash.

37:06.280 --> 37:19.240
Last segment. Headgums got talent. What do you guys got?

37:21.960 --> 37:27.560
Don't lean back. Now we don't want to show it to you. What does it mean?

37:28.520 --> 37:36.520
What talent do you guys want to share today? This one's the one that I can do, ready?

37:41.880 --> 37:46.360
Whoa. All right. That's some witchcraft.

37:47.320 --> 38:00.840
Mori, are you ready? I mean, I can tap dance. Wow. Will wait? No. I'll have my shoes here.

38:00.840 --> 38:07.720
And also no. Where are they? Rhode Island. All right. You guys want to hop back on at like

38:08.680 --> 38:16.680
three, four hours. Eastern. Yeah. Well, Friday traffic. So it'll be longer. Okay.

38:17.560 --> 38:25.720
So yeah, we could do 8 p.m. Eastern and then just insert of Kayla tapped into. Sure. Do some

38:25.720 --> 38:35.720
shuffleable changes for you. All time steps. I can do a split. Also not showing you that. That's

38:36.040 --> 38:43.640
like straight back or like full sideways. Both pieces still. And a cartwheel and a handstand and a

38:43.640 --> 38:50.840
back bend. Wow. Do you like stretch a lot? Like how do you stay alive? I would never if I could get

38:50.840 --> 38:56.760
to a place where I could do this split. I wouldn't be able to sustain it. Well, I grew up dancing competitively.

38:56.760 --> 39:03.320
And then in my adult years, I take a lot of yoga and I'm taking a, I mentioned this on the last

39:03.320 --> 39:10.760
podcast. We're taking a contortion 101 class online. That's true. Stay flexible. Jesus. Staying live.

39:10.760 --> 39:32.200
Staying live. Staying live. Live. Live. I don't know if I have, I don't have the talent show

39:32.200 --> 39:39.080
talent and it's something that I think about almost every day. You can do cross stitching. I mentioned

39:39.080 --> 39:47.080
that. Oh, yeah. I was going to say. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, yeah. That's true. I got into like Victorian

39:47.080 --> 39:53.480
era hobbies over the pandemic. Yeah. I can cross stitch. I'm like, good. Like I can like read by

39:53.480 --> 40:00.440
Campbell. I. How do you know, let me see your room, panting out of the room. The same thing.

40:00.440 --> 40:07.880
couch. That's good. Oh, I would love that. I would love a little chase lounge. No, I actually just

40:07.880 --> 40:12.280
finished one the other day, but it's far away. So I don't, I feel like it's no, I don't think it's like

40:12.280 --> 40:17.480
worth the journey to show you, but yeah, I can. It's shorter than what Kaylee would have to do.

40:18.120 --> 40:24.440
Sure. Yeah. Okay. I'll show you. Oh, my wall. I know. I just, now I'm just becoming towards

40:24.440 --> 40:34.920
my apartment. Jeff, do you have a towel? Oh, that's great. That's so good. It's really fun to do

40:34.920 --> 40:42.280
while you watch TV. That's very much a talent. Oh, hold on. Just trying to make a noise or something.

40:43.000 --> 40:49.720
I'm very dehydrated right now, so it's not going to work really. It's pretty good.

40:49.720 --> 41:02.360
Oh, that's cool. Very Allen Rockovio. Very Allen Rock. What else can I do?

41:04.120 --> 41:09.480
In third grade for a talent show, I memorized the presidents in order. So it's just like an eight-year-old

41:09.480 --> 41:17.000
me being like George Washington, John Adams, and I know about 80% of them still. So I don't know if

41:17.000 --> 41:25.480
you guys want to toss out a number between 145. I can hit you with a president. 187. So one is Washington.

41:25.480 --> 41:33.240
That's an easy one. 18. I know as Ulysses S Grant, Jeff, you can verify. 37 is tough. Kennedy,

41:33.320 --> 41:40.200
Nick's. Who is 17? Because he was 17. Yeah, I want to say Gerald Ford was 37.

41:41.720 --> 41:47.320
What was the first one? 18? Yeah, that's Grant for sure. That's Grant. 37.

41:48.040 --> 41:52.520
Gerald Ford. Nixon. Nixon was 37. Wow.

41:52.600 --> 42:03.160
24. 24 was the same as 22, which is Grover Cleveland. This is very aggressive. That's cool.

42:03.960 --> 42:08.600
Thanks. Yeah. The trick was to memorize five a day for about a week and a half. And then

42:09.880 --> 42:16.200
plug, have it. What do you guys have going on with 30 years ago? So that's been kind of

42:17.240 --> 42:20.600
locked in there. Obviously not perfect. What was Nixon being wrong with.

42:21.560 --> 42:27.240
That's how I memorized Jabber Walkie, my Lewis Carroll. See? Still in here.

42:32.840 --> 42:38.040
The head comes show. We're doing a comedy show, Katie's of sorts.

42:42.840 --> 42:48.680
Getting a phone call from mentor Ohio. Jeff, have you ever heard of that? Who is that? Oh, yes.

42:48.680 --> 42:57.160
mentor Ohio. Yeah, headgum.com slash live live show in LA at our office. Holy shit.

42:57.880 --> 43:08.600

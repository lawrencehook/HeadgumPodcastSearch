00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.480
Guys, this episode of our show is brought to you by the Jordan Harbinger Show.

00:10.480 --> 00:14.240
You want a new podcast to look forward to each week, one that's entertaining, informative,

00:14.240 --> 00:17.640
and packed with action, and we'll come on.

00:17.640 --> 00:18.640
Of course you do.

00:18.640 --> 00:22.680
The average podcast listener has six shows and rotations, so you're most likely not just

00:22.680 --> 00:27.640
listening to the head-gum podcast, which is fine, that's totally fine.

00:27.640 --> 00:31.960
In fact, I'd love to share this show with you to add to your list.

00:31.960 --> 00:37.320
The Jordan Harbinger Show is a top-shelf podcast named Best of Apple in 2018, so don't

00:37.320 --> 00:40.720
just ignore my suggestion to listen to this one, like you probably do with your other friends

00:40.720 --> 00:43.040
and tell you to listen to shows.

00:43.040 --> 00:46.040
Jordan dives into the minds of fascinating people.

00:46.040 --> 00:53.360
From athletes, authors, scientists, mobsters, spies, hostage negotiators, I mean, it's unbelievable

00:53.360 --> 00:55.400
the guests see-get, gets.

00:55.400 --> 01:00.240
But he has an undeniable talent for getting his guests to share never before heard stories

01:00.240 --> 01:02.440
and thought-provoking insights.

01:02.440 --> 01:07.240
Without fail, he pulls tactical bits of wisdom, and you know how much I love wisdom, guys.

01:07.240 --> 01:12.200
In each episode, all with the noble cause to make you a more informed, critical thinker

01:12.200 --> 01:15.200
to better operate in today's world.

01:15.200 --> 01:19.200
There's really not a better podcast to listen to casually, or seriously, to expand your

01:19.200 --> 01:20.480
world view.

01:20.480 --> 01:25.360
Jordan's also got a strangely relatable, weekly segment feedback Friday where Jordan covers

01:25.360 --> 01:31.240
advice on everything, from escaping a cult, or psycho-family situations to relationships

01:31.240 --> 01:35.160
and networking to asking for a raise, and honestly, I'm a fan too.

01:35.160 --> 01:40.600
Jordan is a goat when it comes to the airwaves, the podcast waves, and he's got one of

01:40.600 --> 01:44.720
the most highly rated self-development shows out right now.

01:44.720 --> 01:48.280
Point blank, Jordan Harbinger is smart, funny, and easy to listen to.

01:48.280 --> 01:53.160
You'll be pressed to find an episode without excellent conversation a few laughs and actionable

01:53.160 --> 01:57.080
advice that can directly improve your life.

01:57.080 --> 01:59.960
You can't go wrong with adding the Jordan Harbinger Show to your rotation.

01:59.960 --> 02:03.080
It's incredibly interesting, and there's never a dull episode.

02:03.080 --> 02:11.600
So search for the Jordan Harbinger Show that's H-A-R-B as a boy, I-N as a Nancy, G-E-R on Apple

02:11.600 --> 02:31.000
podcast, Spotify, or wherever you listen to your shows.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.960
First in studio LA episode, ever.

02:34.960 --> 02:35.960
Wow.

02:35.960 --> 02:36.960
Wow.

02:36.960 --> 02:37.960
This is big.

02:38.040 --> 02:44.400
I mean, I'm almost willing to risk the losing the ad revenue.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.400
Should we get it started?

02:45.400 --> 02:47.200
Yeah, I mean, you're going to play it song.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.200
Yeah.

02:48.200 --> 02:52.840
Because usually it over Zoom, you can sort of cut out the unnecessary, like, searching.

02:52.840 --> 02:57.320
So it's cool to see how, see it live like this.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.240
And you also know the soundboard inside and out.

02:59.240 --> 03:02.920
So I don't know why I added a couple new ones, and they're all colored kind of

03:03.000 --> 03:03.920
into currently.

03:03.920 --> 03:07.920
So everybody, everybody, let's get it right.

03:07.920 --> 03:08.920
Yeah.

03:08.920 --> 03:09.920
Yeah.

03:09.920 --> 03:10.920
Yeah.

03:10.920 --> 03:11.920
Yeah.

03:11.920 --> 03:12.920
Yeah.

03:12.920 --> 03:13.920
Yeah.

03:13.920 --> 03:14.920
Yeah.

03:14.920 --> 03:15.920
Yeah.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.920
So no ad revenue now.

03:17.920 --> 03:18.920
YouTube's going to flag that.

03:18.920 --> 03:19.920
Yeah.

03:19.920 --> 03:20.920
Yeah.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.920
We shouldn't introduce our guest, special guest Sally D'Argriff and from TikTok.

03:23.920 --> 03:24.920
You know her from the internet.

03:24.920 --> 03:25.920
You know her from offline.

03:25.920 --> 03:26.920
If your friends are watching her.

03:26.920 --> 03:27.920
Yeah.

03:27.920 --> 03:28.920
I'll send it to him.

03:28.920 --> 03:29.920
Yeah.

03:29.920 --> 03:30.920
Um.

03:30.920 --> 03:31.920
I mean, what a ride it's been.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.920
I was in New York for four months.

03:33.920 --> 03:34.920
I'm back in Los Angeles.

03:34.920 --> 03:35.920
We're in studio.

03:35.920 --> 03:36.920
It feels good.

03:36.920 --> 03:37.920
Yeah.

03:37.920 --> 03:38.920
Feels great.

03:38.920 --> 03:39.920
We have a lot to get to.

03:39.920 --> 03:40.920
Yeah.

03:40.920 --> 03:41.920
We do.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.920
But before that, do you want to plug your stuff up top?

03:44.920 --> 03:45.920
Sure.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.920
My name is Sally D'Argriffin.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.920
Is D'Argriff in your last name?

03:49.920 --> 03:50.920
Or is D'Argriff in your middle?

03:50.920 --> 03:51.920
Yeah.

03:51.920 --> 03:52.920
It's an interesting line.

03:52.920 --> 03:53.920
So it's a double name.

03:53.920 --> 03:54.920
I'm from Tennessee.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.920
So I'm a big southern thing.

03:55.920 --> 03:56.920
Knoxville?

03:56.920 --> 03:57.920
No.

03:57.920 --> 03:58.920
Chattanooga.

03:58.920 --> 03:59.920
Yeah.

03:59.920 --> 04:00.920
Literally met like three people from Chattanooga in Colorado last weekend.

04:00.920 --> 04:01.920
Oh, interesting.

04:01.920 --> 04:02.920
Everybody's cool from there.

04:02.920 --> 04:03.920
Yeah.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.920
They're both like outdoorsy and like makes sense to be there.

04:06.920 --> 04:07.920
Um, no.

04:07.920 --> 04:08.920
I mean, a few people do.

04:08.920 --> 04:09.920
But not everyone.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.920
And so you're, well, somebody asks you your name.

04:11.920 --> 04:12.920
You say Sally D'Argriff.

04:12.920 --> 04:13.920
Mm-hmm.

04:13.920 --> 04:14.920
It's like married Catherine or like.

04:14.920 --> 04:15.920
I see.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.920
The dog just throws a bill because like who's ever heard of that.

04:17.920 --> 04:18.920
Right.

04:18.920 --> 04:19.920
D'Argriff is a unique one.

04:19.920 --> 04:20.920
Yeah.

04:20.920 --> 04:21.920
Also, do you have a middle name?

04:21.920 --> 04:22.920
Or is it just two first names in the last?

04:22.920 --> 04:24.920
It's, if I felt filled out in application,

04:24.920 --> 04:26.920
it would be first name Sally, middle name D'Argriffin.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.920
So dark technically is my middle name.

04:28.920 --> 04:29.920
But I go by the.

04:29.920 --> 04:30.920
I got it.

04:30.920 --> 04:31.920
Okay.

04:31.920 --> 04:32.920
I'm caught up.

04:32.920 --> 04:33.920
Yeah.

04:33.920 --> 04:34.920
Where'd you go to college?

04:34.920 --> 04:35.920
I went to Tulane and New Orleans.

04:35.920 --> 04:36.920
Tulane.

04:36.920 --> 04:37.920
Yeah.

04:37.920 --> 04:38.920
No.

04:38.920 --> 04:39.920
Rutgers.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.920
It really doesn't matter.

04:41.920 --> 04:42.920
Yeah.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.920
We have to get to know each other on air.

04:44.920 --> 04:45.920
Right.

04:45.920 --> 04:46.920
You know, there's no intimacy.

04:46.920 --> 04:47.920
Yeah.

04:47.920 --> 04:48.920
Yeah.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.920
But, you know what?

04:50.920 --> 04:55.920
Let's just get into some waxing here and it'll come up naturally.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.920
Nothing is coming up naturally.

04:57.920 --> 04:58.920
So far.

04:58.920 --> 04:59.920
I'm excited.

04:59.920 --> 05:00.920
Yeah.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.920
Natural use is middle name AK.

05:02.920 --> 05:03.920
He is second name.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.920
So it's Jeff naturally James.

05:05.920 --> 05:06.920
Yeah.

05:06.920 --> 05:07.920
Is it actually?

05:07.920 --> 05:08.920
No.

05:08.920 --> 05:09.920
I don't know.

05:09.920 --> 05:10.920
I mean, my name's James.

05:10.920 --> 05:11.920
Anything is false.

05:11.920 --> 05:12.920
Yeah.

05:12.920 --> 05:13.920
Anything.

05:13.920 --> 05:14.920
Let's talk about your rise to start.

05:14.920 --> 05:17.920
Was it post COVID lockdown?

05:17.920 --> 05:22.920
Um, so TikTok was my main thing that got me going for those who don't know.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.920
Um, I was posting on TikTok a little bit before the pandemic.

05:25.920 --> 05:29.920
But March 2020 and through the summer is like when I really blew up on TikTok.

05:29.920 --> 05:30.920
Wow.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.920
Um, so would you say the pandemic is the best thing that's ever had to be personally.

05:33.920 --> 05:34.920
Yeah.

05:34.920 --> 05:35.920
Like I don't.

05:35.920 --> 05:36.920
I'm not trying to be sensitive.

05:36.920 --> 05:37.920
Obviously it's real.

05:37.920 --> 05:38.920
But I was talking about.

05:38.920 --> 05:39.920
The year of dark.

05:39.920 --> 05:40.920
Really?

05:40.920 --> 05:42.920
I was talking about it with like my friends.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.920
They're like, yeah, like the pandemic, like really like, I hate to say it.

05:45.920 --> 05:46.920
But like it was kind of good.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.920
Like we met all of our friends, whatever.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.920
And I was like, no, it's actually.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.920
It's the best thing that ever happened to me and like a very horrible way.

05:54.920 --> 05:55.920
Yeah.

05:55.920 --> 05:56.920
Yeah.

05:56.920 --> 05:57.920
You became a Hollywood star.

05:57.920 --> 05:58.920
Yeah.

05:58.920 --> 05:59.920
A darling.

05:59.920 --> 06:00.920
Yeah.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.920
Actually, I joined TikTok during the pandemic as well.

06:02.920 --> 06:08.920
Didn't quite go viral slash famous slash live in a hype house for it.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.920
But I do have a hundred thousand followers on there.

06:10.920 --> 06:16.920
So I would say that yes, it to change the trajectory of my self esteemed slash career.

06:16.920 --> 06:17.920
But I'm curious.

06:17.920 --> 06:18.920
Howly not for ear.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.920
Nothing strange in your career.

06:21.920 --> 06:22.920
Yeah.

06:22.920 --> 06:23.920
Oh, I don't know.

06:23.920 --> 06:24.920
There's a lot of fun things.

06:24.920 --> 06:25.920
But that's not because of you.

06:25.920 --> 06:26.920
No, that's because of Marty.

06:26.920 --> 06:27.920
Yeah, business.

06:27.920 --> 06:28.920
Yeah.

06:28.920 --> 06:29.920
And Japan.

06:29.920 --> 06:30.920
Jake did a lot.

06:30.920 --> 06:31.920
So you had TikTok before the pandemic.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.920
But it kind of blew up during the pandemic.

06:33.920 --> 06:34.920
Yeah.

06:34.920 --> 06:35.920
Like I was posting, but not consistently.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.920
And I didn't really know what I was doing.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.920
And then when I was.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.920
So I moved home to Tennessee for like X amount of months.

06:41.920 --> 06:42.920
So I was living with my parents.

06:42.920 --> 06:43.920
Didn't have anything to do.

06:43.920 --> 06:44.920
Yeah.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.920
And so I was just like posting every day.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.920
Which is why you're supposed to do.

06:48.920 --> 06:49.920
Right.

06:49.920 --> 06:50.920
Which is the hardest thing to do.

06:50.920 --> 06:51.920
But it worked.

06:51.920 --> 06:52.920
Yeah.

06:52.920 --> 06:53.920
Here I am.

06:53.920 --> 06:54.920
And did you move out to LA because of TikTok?

06:54.920 --> 06:55.920
No.

06:55.920 --> 06:58.920
I originally moved out here August 2019 for film school.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.920
And then was here until March 2020 moved home.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.920
What moved back August 2020.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.920
So I don't really count that first bar because I like wasn't.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.920
Didn't really do anything in LA.

07:07.920 --> 07:08.920
Didn't move the needle.

07:08.920 --> 07:09.920
Yeah.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.920
A lot of people can hack it and holly weird during their first summer.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.920
I remember considered leaving as well.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.920
But you grew up in the casino.

07:17.920 --> 07:18.920
Right.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.920
I guess what I was going to ask you are getting to ask you.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.920
Is do you remember your first viral clip on TikTok?

07:24.920 --> 07:26.920
And then how big are we talking?

07:26.920 --> 07:27.920
Million?

07:27.920 --> 07:28.920
Ten million?

07:28.920 --> 07:29.920
Here's the thing.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.920
I've made a lot of friends through TikTok and a lot of them are like,

07:32.920 --> 07:35.920
Oh, this one video is what like project like propelled me.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.920
Right.

07:36.920 --> 07:37.920
For me, it wasn't a certain video.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.920
It was just like a series of videos.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.920
I used to make all of these videos sitting in the bathtub.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.920
And it was just those back to back to back.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.920
And they all kind of had like a through line.

07:45.920 --> 07:46.920
Yeah.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.920
Is it none of those like you on purpose, Jeff?

07:48.920 --> 07:49.920
Or did you just, no.

07:49.920 --> 07:50.920
Sorry.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.920
My son is texting about whether or not she wants to move to Washington DC.

07:53.920 --> 07:54.920
Yeah.

07:54.920 --> 07:55.920
No.

07:55.920 --> 07:56.920
No.

07:56.920 --> 07:57.920
No.

07:57.920 --> 07:58.920
Yeah.

07:58.920 --> 07:59.920
But yeah.

07:59.920 --> 08:00.920
It wasn't one video that did it.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.920
Like obviously there were some that were better than others.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.920
But it was really just like the whole like bathtub series that I was known for.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.920
And like some of them had a hundred thousand views.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.920
And they had like a million or whatever.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.920
But it was just that whole time.

08:11.920 --> 08:12.920
But it was comedy.

08:12.920 --> 08:13.920
Yeah.

08:13.920 --> 08:14.920
It wasn't like dancing singing.

08:14.920 --> 08:15.920
No.

08:15.920 --> 08:16.920
But no shade to that.

08:16.920 --> 08:17.920
Love it.

08:17.920 --> 08:18.920
Get your bag.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.920
But I cannot dance for my life.

08:20.920 --> 08:21.920
Yeah.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.920
You've a lot of dancing ones in your drafts that you showed me.

08:23.920 --> 08:27.920
I can't build up the gumption to pull the trigger and post these things.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.920
I think that one would go viral.

08:29.920 --> 08:30.920
Really?

08:30.920 --> 08:31.920
Yeah.

08:31.920 --> 08:32.920
I do.

08:32.920 --> 08:33.920
Yeah.

08:33.920 --> 08:34.920
Because I got one to wop where I'm sort of humping the ground.

08:34.920 --> 08:38.920
I have a few to ratchet, bougie, catchy.

08:38.920 --> 08:40.920
And I'm sort of humping the ground.

08:40.920 --> 08:41.920
Right.

08:41.920 --> 08:42.920
Yeah.

08:42.920 --> 08:43.920
We're just humping the ground in all these.

08:43.920 --> 08:44.920
Yeah.

08:44.920 --> 08:45.920
But it's to completion.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.920
And I feel like TikTok would like definitely.

08:47.920 --> 08:48.920
Of course.

08:48.920 --> 08:49.920
Yeah.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.920
That's what I'm going to say obviously.

08:52.920 --> 08:53.920
Right.

08:53.920 --> 08:54.920
So don't ever pull the trigger.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.920
Don't have the gumption.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.920
Don't ever post it.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.920
Major dealer.

09:00.920 --> 09:01.920
Self-sensor.

09:01.920 --> 09:02.920
Right.

09:02.920 --> 09:03.920
There's no way that has to be.

09:03.920 --> 09:07.920
The audio of your drops are so loud in our ears.

09:07.920 --> 09:11.920
Well, I want him to not normalize that.

09:11.920 --> 09:12.920
Right.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.920
We feel, which is it being at a nine.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.920
And then us talking at a three.

09:16.920 --> 09:17.920
That's going to be that for audio.

09:17.920 --> 09:18.920
Exactly.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.920
But I want everyone else to experience what it feels like to sit across from you.

09:21.920 --> 09:22.920
And hear your poison.

09:22.920 --> 09:26.920
Uh, I don't know if you haven't heard enough of the show to know one of the three lines,

09:26.920 --> 09:29.920
which is that I'm trying to get wise.

09:29.920 --> 09:33.920
Which, you know, can manifest in various audio books on to.

09:33.920 --> 09:37.920
Can manifest in me having a heart to heart with my friends.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.920
Trying to get to know one another on a higher plane of consciousness.

09:40.920 --> 09:44.920
And so that also lends itself to talking about the news in an interesting way.

09:44.920 --> 09:47.920
We sort of abandoned the TikTok thing.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.920
Because like she said that she started posting,

09:50.920 --> 09:52.920
but I didn't really get to understand how salary like,

09:52.920 --> 09:55.920
Sally made it out here and what she ended up doing on TikTok.

09:55.920 --> 09:56.920
That's not bad.

09:56.920 --> 10:00.920
You sort of, you sort of inserted yourself and through the conversation away.

10:00.920 --> 10:04.920
And then made it about you becoming wise.

10:04.920 --> 10:05.920
Yes.

10:05.920 --> 10:09.920
Which is very, it's an unnot wise thing to do is steam roll the show like that as though.

10:09.920 --> 10:12.920
No, I was going to talk about the Amazon MGM merger.

10:12.920 --> 10:13.920
Right, who cares?

10:13.920 --> 10:14.920
Right, who cares?

10:14.920 --> 10:15.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:15.920 --> 10:16.920
Relive it.

10:16.920 --> 10:17.920
So TikTok first.

10:17.920 --> 10:18.920
Right.

10:18.920 --> 10:19.920
Yeah.

10:19.920 --> 10:20.920
And then what was kind of the next big thing?

10:20.920 --> 10:21.920
Right.

10:21.920 --> 10:22.920
Yeah.

10:22.920 --> 10:24.920
So I, after the pandemic, like I moved back August 2020,

10:24.920 --> 10:27.920
kept posting on TikTok and then January 2021,

10:27.920 --> 10:31.920
I met like moved in with some of my internet friends and kind of not high-piles quite.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.920
So more like creative, collective.

10:34.920 --> 10:35.920
Yeah.

10:35.920 --> 10:36.920
And that, we made some videos.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.920
It was more fun than it was productive.

10:38.920 --> 10:42.920
But met a lot of people through the internet, some of my best friends.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.920
And really since then, just been posting.

10:44.920 --> 10:45.920
I mean, I post everywhere.

10:45.920 --> 10:46.920
Like, I mean, I tweet.

10:46.920 --> 10:47.920
I make vlogs.

10:47.920 --> 10:48.920
I post on Instagram.

10:48.920 --> 10:50.920
That TikTok is what started at all.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.920
And now I'm full-time content creator, I suppose.

10:53.920 --> 10:54.920
That's awesome.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.920
And it's mostly on TikTok that you, uh, you're source of.

10:57.920 --> 10:58.920
Yeah.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.920
If I didn't have TikTok, I wouldn't be full-time.

11:00.920 --> 11:01.920
Wow.

11:01.920 --> 11:02.920
Right.

11:02.920 --> 11:03.920
Yeah.

11:03.920 --> 11:04.920
And you're rep by CA.

11:04.920 --> 11:05.920
Yeah.

11:05.920 --> 11:06.920
I'm still on stream.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.920
I used to have a, which is sort of a boutique agency.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.920
I used to have an agency as well.

11:10.920 --> 11:11.920
What's that?

11:11.920 --> 11:13.920
I used to have an agent as well.

11:13.920 --> 11:14.920
Is all.

11:14.920 --> 11:15.920
But you find them.

11:15.920 --> 11:16.920
They dropped you.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.920
It was sort of a mutually agreed upon.

11:19.920 --> 11:22.920
Parting of ways slash distancing.

11:22.920 --> 11:27.920
Ghosting in a way where they sort of take longer and longer to respond to your emails and text.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.920
And so they don't respond at all.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.920
I think it's like a big flex to not have an agent or a manager.

11:32.920 --> 11:33.920
Right.

11:33.920 --> 11:34.920
Yeah.

11:34.920 --> 11:35.920
I think it is.

11:35.920 --> 11:36.920
People don't have your successful.

11:36.920 --> 11:37.920
Yeah.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.920
But you haven't had an audition in three years.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.920
And you haven't stopped ever.

11:41.920 --> 11:46.920
So like, I'm doing the secret style where I'm like, let's put out there the shit that I want

11:46.920 --> 11:51.920
to like flex to the world without necessarily the means of being able to flex it.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.920
So like buying a car that I cannot afford.

11:54.920 --> 11:55.920
I have that.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.920
And now it's, it'll get like whatever compounded default to taking away from me.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.920
I don't have representation, which is kind of a cool move.

12:03.920 --> 12:06.920
Like, you know how Bill Murray's like, I don't have an agent just call me.

12:06.920 --> 12:07.920
Right.

12:07.920 --> 12:08.920
But they don't do the calling me part.

12:08.920 --> 12:09.920
Right.

12:09.920 --> 12:10.920
And yeah.

12:10.920 --> 12:11.920
And I'm ruining your life by the way.

12:11.920 --> 12:12.920
You know what I mean?

12:12.920 --> 12:13.920
Yeah.

12:13.920 --> 12:14.920
I'm on Zilla right now.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.920
Your home just popped up pre foreclosure.

12:16.920 --> 12:17.920
Yep.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.920
That's all sort of tied into the same situation.

12:19.920 --> 12:20.920
Yeah.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.920
Let's talk dating in LA for a second.

12:22.920 --> 12:23.920
I feel like a big part of your brand.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.920
What's one of my favorite talks that you've done?

12:25.920 --> 12:26.920
Talks.

12:26.920 --> 12:27.920
Talks.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.920
You pretend to have a boyfriend.

12:29.920 --> 12:30.920
Got.

12:30.920 --> 12:31.920
Are you talking about Ted Cruz?

12:31.920 --> 12:32.920
No.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.920
They were like, say, like, it just completely sounds unnatural.

12:35.920 --> 12:36.920
Like, baby.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.920
And then like, all your friends crack up.

12:38.920 --> 12:39.920
Right.

12:39.920 --> 12:40.920
Yeah.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.920
I don't know why that became a thing.

12:42.920 --> 12:45.920
I think that there are like certain things that sell very well online.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.920
People love to know about dating.

12:47.920 --> 12:48.920
Yeah.

12:48.920 --> 12:51.920
And like, that's why you see these like cringey relationship videos that do well.

12:51.920 --> 12:52.920
And you're like, why are these doing well?

12:52.920 --> 12:53.920
Yeah.

12:53.920 --> 12:54.920
I don't get it.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.920
But it's because people like knowing that.

12:56.920 --> 12:59.920
The thing that like I would never share that online, but the people that do.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.920
It's like, oh, I'm going to eat that up because I kind of hate watch it.

13:02.920 --> 13:03.920
Yeah.

13:03.920 --> 13:07.920
So like, I think I do that because I know that people kind of like that.

13:07.920 --> 13:08.920
But I would never tell the truth.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.920
So I just like make up something.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.920
That's the comedy angle of it.

13:12.920 --> 13:13.920
Yeah.

13:13.920 --> 13:17.920
So I pretended to like date Ted Cruz and some people like genuinely thought that I was like the sidepiece.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.920
And I was like, no, it was a joke.

13:19.920 --> 13:20.920
Yeah.

13:20.920 --> 13:25.920
If we show that you're clip to enough people, like you'll just get morons in the in the lot as well.

13:25.920 --> 13:30.920
So like, like here's 10 million people like a thousand of them will think you dated Ted Cruz.

13:30.920 --> 13:31.920
Yeah.

13:31.920 --> 13:32.920
And that's fine. Hey.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.920
If they're interacting with my content, I'll take it.

13:34.920 --> 13:35.920
You think Ted saw it?

13:35.920 --> 13:37.920
I don't know.

13:37.920 --> 13:38.920
Well, his job.

13:38.920 --> 13:43.920
What's interesting is that his daughter joined TikTok and then people started tagging me in one of her videos.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.920
And I was like, I feel like if anyone seen it, it's probably her.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.920
But like I made those videos like a few months ago.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.920
And then she joined like, I don't know.

13:50.920 --> 13:51.920
Maybe three months ago.

13:51.920 --> 13:52.920
She have to know.

13:52.920 --> 13:53.920
So I don't know.

13:53.920 --> 13:54.920
What do you say?

13:54.920 --> 13:55.920
I don't think so.

13:55.920 --> 13:56.920
It's awesome.

13:56.920 --> 13:57.920
Yeah.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.920
It's awesome that she doesn't have two names.

13:59.920 --> 14:00.920
Are you paying attention?

14:00.920 --> 14:01.920
Or no.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.920
I honestly saw a flock.

14:04.920 --> 14:05.920
Yeah.

14:05.920 --> 14:09.920
We kind of, we wax dating on this show a lot, but I'm way too honest.

14:09.920 --> 14:10.920
Yeah.

14:10.920 --> 14:11.920
You are way too honest.

14:11.920 --> 14:12.920
Yeah.

14:12.920 --> 14:13.920
How's your love life?

14:13.920 --> 14:15.920
I don't have to talk about it.

14:15.920 --> 14:16.920
It's just.

14:16.920 --> 14:17.920
Please.

14:17.920 --> 14:18.920
I'll be told.

14:18.920 --> 14:20.920
Still as that sidepiece, right?

14:20.920 --> 14:21.920
Speaking of.

14:21.920 --> 14:22.920
Yeah.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.920
That's not even a throbble technically.

14:25.920 --> 14:32.920
It's just like my partner is dating someone else that I'm not too fond of right now.

14:32.920 --> 14:33.920
Right.

14:33.920 --> 14:34.920
He's a personal trainer.

14:34.920 --> 14:35.920
Yep.

14:35.920 --> 14:36.920
Six four.

14:36.920 --> 14:37.920
Six four.

14:37.920 --> 14:38.920
Yeah.

14:38.920 --> 14:39.920
Absolutely jacked.

14:39.920 --> 14:40.920
Yes.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.920
My ribs like hurt from trying to surf three weeks ago.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.920
But his are fine.

14:45.920 --> 14:46.920
Right.

14:46.920 --> 14:47.920
And he serves all the time.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.920
I think it's a.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.920
When you work out enough, nothing necessarily.

14:51.920 --> 14:58.920
penetrates the muscles and gets to the bone bruising that I deal with on a near constant basis.

14:58.920 --> 15:01.920
Like even laying down hurts at this point.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.920
It was the last time you saw your girlfriend or your partner weeks ago.

15:04.920 --> 15:05.920
Yeah.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.920
Todd's taking her all around the world.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.920
But I see them on Instagram stories and Instagram live.

15:11.920 --> 15:12.920
Yeah.

15:12.920 --> 15:13.920
Take still the stories there.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.920
I'm I have a finsta because she.

15:16.920 --> 15:17.920
Yeah.

15:17.920 --> 15:18.920
Blocked you.

15:18.920 --> 15:19.920
Oh, Sean.

15:19.920 --> 15:20.920
What's my name on there?

15:20.920 --> 15:21.920
I'm here.

15:21.920 --> 15:22.920
I think it is just out of the area.

15:22.920 --> 15:23.920
Yeah.

15:23.920 --> 15:24.920
So I guess.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.920
That's also kind of a cool flex.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.920
So my Instagram name is just my first name.

15:28.920 --> 15:29.920
It is.

15:29.920 --> 15:30.920
That's cool.

15:30.920 --> 15:31.920
Yeah.

15:31.920 --> 15:32.920
You got on like very early.

15:32.920 --> 15:33.920
When was Instagram?

15:33.920 --> 15:34.920
Was it like 2011?

15:34.920 --> 15:35.920
Yeah.

Yeah.

15:38.920 --> 15:39.920
Yeah.

15:39.920 --> 15:40.920
Yeah.

15:40.920 --> 15:41.920
Yeah.

15:41.920 --> 15:42.920
Yeah.

15:42.920 --> 15:43.920
Yeah.

15:43.920 --> 15:44.920
Yeah.

15:44.920 --> 15:45.920
Yeah.

15:45.920 --> 15:46.920
Yeah.

15:46.920 --> 15:47.920
Yeah.

15:47.920 --> 15:48.920
Yeah.

15:48.920 --> 15:49.920
And it's our super hip hurt.

15:49.920 --> 15:53.920
It's time for Bond of the Week.

15:53.920 --> 15:54.920
Couldn't hear you because it was too loud.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.920
It's time for Bond of the Week.

15:56.920 --> 16:00.920
I said it'll be mixed down.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.920
So Daniel Craig is out as the new Bond, as the old Bond.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.920
And we don't know who the new Bond is.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.880
So every week on this show, we cast our choice for the next double of the

16:07.880 --> 16:08.920
same the next James.

16:08.920 --> 16:12.920
And this week, my pick is Melissa Urban.

16:12.920 --> 16:13.920
Nice.

16:13.920 --> 16:14.920
Yeah.

16:14.920 --> 16:15.920
He created a whole 30.

16:15.920 --> 16:21.180
It's like 30 who cares. Yeah, you don't you don't hold 30 no, I don't you don't a whole 30

16:22.220 --> 16:28.220
Who cares? It's like 30 day diet and you're like no sugar. It's a new trick. It's a

16:28.580 --> 16:34.280
That one people like eat brosos sprouts for breakfast. It's not Ryan. It's like you can't have any the only sauce

16:34.280 --> 16:36.280
You can have

16:36.280 --> 16:38.280
amino acids and mustard

16:38.600 --> 16:41.080
But you can have ghee. You know about ghee

16:41.240 --> 16:46.880
Uh-huh clarified butter. Yeah, you know about ghee and let me clarify that this butter sucks

16:46.880 --> 16:50.560
And you're nutritionist picked to be the bond of the week. It's never gonna fly

16:50.560 --> 16:54.080
There's no way she could pull off the action. She's already at the top of the fitness industry

16:54.240 --> 17:00.720
Now she has to branch out. It's about having multiple streams of income. Right? Yeah, bread ghee. No, haven't really

17:03.240 --> 17:07.360
You must not know about ghee. You must not know about ghee

17:07.360 --> 17:10.640
Take some cream and sure in that fish

17:10.640 --> 17:14.040
Matter of fact you might even clarify it baby

17:14.040 --> 17:19.560
You must not know about ghee. You must not know about ghee. I guess you can eat it

17:19.560 --> 17:25.360
She's been on hold 30 so don't you ever for a second get to thinking

17:26.120 --> 17:28.120
Butter's healthier

17:29.520 --> 17:32.320
That was good. No, you don't have to lie. It was pretty bad

17:32.880 --> 17:40.080
I see so bond of the week was a way into

17:41.080 --> 17:45.720
Talking about the whole 30 creator which was a way into ghee

17:46.360 --> 17:53.400
Which you wrote because you ran out of words that rhymed with me for that specific beyond say song

17:54.400 --> 18:00.360
Is the walk you can say however long this die tribe is gonna be I'm gonna edit it out. Yeah. I'm done

18:02.840 --> 18:06.840
We should probably take a break

18:08.840 --> 18:15.560
No, the energy sourd after that. Yeah, yes, right we agree. We agree actually. We a ghee

18:17.320 --> 18:19.320

Welcome back

22:32.140 --> 22:38.540
Guys with Olympus kit. I'm aware of them. Yeah, I know the name. That's cool. Well

22:38.700 --> 22:40.700
This is a segment I like to call

22:53.500 --> 22:58.380
It's gonna keep going on. It's a long long. Yeah, it's a way over. I should trim it down

23:00.060 --> 23:03.340
There's no way you can't control the volume. I can't hear you. Yeah

23:06.380 --> 23:08.380
It's starting to wrap up

23:08.940 --> 23:10.940
You

23:14.940 --> 23:16.620
I like to call this segment Durst traps

23:17.740 --> 23:23.860
Now you can talk because again. It was too loud even during the applause. Yeah, let's hear it. It goes on too long. Yes

23:23.860 --> 23:26.460
Yes, yeah, we agree. We talked to you about this

23:27.660 --> 23:31.820
I'd have to download it. Oh, we met the entire show. I wasn't talking about that

23:32.540 --> 23:37.820
Yeah, I meant the run of the podcast. So you want to be like a daily show like the day I wanted to be over

23:37.980 --> 23:41.100
Have run it's course and now we're doing something else

23:45.340 --> 23:47.340
This is Durst traps

23:47.580 --> 23:53.020
You guys are familiar with thirst traps. Yeah, yeah, were you post a photo for those who don't know of you when you look kind of hot

23:54.300 --> 23:58.140
Fred Durst to me to my eyes are is not that an attractive of a man

24:00.140 --> 24:06.620
But used in the mid 90s you guys were bored in the 90s, but I was sort of coming of age during this time

24:06.620 --> 24:12.620
Yeah, and as a teenager, he was considered very cool and yes indeed quite hot

24:12.620 --> 24:19.340
Yeah, okay. Well, I've pulled up a couple photos of Fred Durst and I thought we could kind of come to a consensus vote

24:19.340 --> 24:23.420
Whether or not it's a thirst trap or not whether it's hot enough to call it a Durst trap

24:24.140 --> 24:30.220
Okay, all right. This is cool. We're using the live medium. Yeah, we have a lot of tech that we can play with now. That's cool

24:30.700 --> 24:36.700
Also, usually I have the defense mechanism of being on zoom where the ambient awkwardness doesn't affect me

24:36.700 --> 24:42.860
But now I feel like genuinely bad as a person. Yeah, that's interesting. That's a fun little new dynamic slash wrinkle of the show

24:43.340 --> 24:45.900
And then we also have Narraganset beer if anybody wants to can

24:46.860 --> 24:48.860
Sorry for sell that as like branded content

24:49.820 --> 24:53.340
You've mentioned a beer right now. That's not like an ad that had come to sold

24:54.620 --> 25:00.060
It's a brand ambassador for Narraganset so they sent me beer right

25:00.780 --> 25:02.780
Or I buy it and they reimbures me

25:04.780 --> 25:10.620
Here we go. This is the first one. What do I think is this a durst beer now? I feel like it is look at his eyes

25:11.900 --> 25:17.260
Lights in his eyes and he has big hands and cool tattoo right you only has big hands so because it's like the

25:17.260 --> 25:22.220
Fish right. Yeah, yeah, that's right. No, if anything you probably is small hands if you have to use that

25:23.260 --> 25:27.340
Wow, yeah, also I feel it's a mention we all have to come to an agreement

25:27.420 --> 25:33.420
I see you so it's not I think it's not we're to split down the middle. Wow. How do we do a tiebreaker of who's who?

25:33.420 --> 25:37.260
Did you genuinely think this is a sexy photo of Fred Durst? Yes

25:38.780 --> 25:44.940
In a vacuum though not for Durst if you're ranking it from worst to Durst this is closer to the latter for sure

25:44.940 --> 25:48.460
I think it gets worst for Durst going for worse

25:49.900 --> 25:54.860
Look at him Casey our in-house producer sort of be the type rate. Yeah, Casey. What do you think hot or not?

25:55.820 --> 25:59.020
Not oh, all right. Very good

26:02.300 --> 26:09.660
All right, number two still in that Anna I'm angels hat wearing what appears to be motocross gloves

26:10.380 --> 26:17.260
And an under armor under a baggy t-shirt also he's snarling the shooting symbol. Yeah, that's just one

26:17.980 --> 26:20.860
He kind of looks like Mark Wahlberg meets Drake

26:20.940 --> 26:22.940
Yeah

26:24.380 --> 26:31.820
He's not in a can where his like that should be his happy place, but he looks angry. Yeah, he's looking cool slash hard of it

26:32.620 --> 26:38.940
I'm gonna go know no, he looks like someone I'd meet at a local barn my hometown. Yeah, very good

26:39.660 --> 26:45.420
Didn't yeah, what's that didn't get to vote for that? Yeah, but it's already consensus, but yeah, if you want to throw in your

26:46.860 --> 26:49.500
God, it's tough to say you don't have to be contrary in either

26:49.500 --> 26:53.900
It's just fast you can do everything so we got no no no no then it comes down to me

26:54.060 --> 27:01.020
Right, yeah, that's not it already has come. I'll say yes because of the beard is full and good the beard is unkempt and ungrimmed also I'm a huge

27:01.980 --> 27:06.380
Anna I'm angels why of Anna I'm fan yeah

27:06.700 --> 27:10.460
I think it's something about Tim Sam and their old start player that

27:11.020 --> 27:15.180
gets me intrigued slash turned on when I see this picture of Fred Durst

27:16.060 --> 27:21.180
Next one, so you're just in viewing the player onto him and he's not the player

27:21.180 --> 27:26.620
I just want to think of a quick shout out because I don't know if we've referenced Tim Sam and we have not we haven't and probably

27:26.620 --> 27:29.660
Tim Sam and Rushdie. That's really good. Let's see the next picture

27:32.300 --> 27:37.180
Obviously not who is that is there no other no shirtless ones is that Tony Clifton?

27:37.740 --> 27:43.180
Yeah, this is not Fred Durst. No, it is Fred Durst. I think it's it might be him dressed up as Robert Durst

27:43.500 --> 27:44.860
Oh

27:44.860 --> 27:50.540
Who's that he's a serial murderer are they related? I think they are vaguely related. Yeah, that's great

27:50.540 --> 27:55.260
I love to hear that my manager reps Fred Durst so maybe we should have gotten to call in

27:55.900 --> 28:00.780
Yeah, this is not absolutely actually you know what I might say yes to this one because there's that dirt bag

28:00.780 --> 28:04.540
Sheek thing that some guys do for Halloween and I'm like that's that's pretty good

28:04.540 --> 28:08.460
I'm the most thirst trap out of all these is the first one now I'm regretting my decision

28:08.460 --> 28:11.580
What I told you guys I didn't know if you're gonna get dressed up for your first

28:11.580 --> 28:15.820
They all are in a vacuum you can't do it relative to the other ones. Here we go now. This one's no

28:18.220 --> 28:20.220
See no small hands

28:21.500 --> 28:25.980
Yeah, it also doesn't look like he knows how to ride the board

28:27.260 --> 28:33.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't think he's more of a musician than a producer obviously right I deal you're both like Johnny

28:34.620 --> 28:36.620
Okay, no

28:36.620 --> 28:38.140
I don't think so

28:38.140 --> 28:42.460
I'm not on these are doing it for me. I mean, I think in his eyes. This is a Durst trap

28:42.460 --> 28:49.740
Right, I think all the public yeah, the public sphere. No, but again his eyes are nice and blue in this photo and his go-ty

28:50.300 --> 28:54.300
Or a soul patch situation it goes down to become a throaty interest

28:54.300 --> 28:58.780
And then it comes a blue tee that he's wearing sort of becomes a hair shirt

28:59.500 --> 29:03.020
I'll give this one a yay as well. Oh, wait. Yes, wait

29:03.660 --> 29:05.660
y'all

29:06.460 --> 29:11.340
Okay, now he's acting a little bit. I think this is the new Durst and he's thick. He loves gloves

29:12.060 --> 29:13.340
Absolutely

29:13.340 --> 29:15.340
Do you guys know what that goes on? No

29:16.300 --> 29:20.540
You guys are going off the bucket hat. I think he you can see his eyes that he's less angry

29:21.100 --> 29:22.700
He's might this is Durst and therapy

29:23.740 --> 29:27.580
Yeah, he's currently holding up a mic to his better health therapist

29:27.980 --> 29:31.420
I'm sorry. I can't hear you. I think your zoom is frozen

29:32.620 --> 29:36.700
That's a bow Jackson jersey. So I guess he's from California. He's constantly ripping

29:37.340 --> 29:39.340
California sports. You know

29:39.900 --> 29:42.860
It's a cool sleeve. It's a fun hat and

29:43.100 --> 29:51.340
Again his beard is full of his eyes are blue. I'm gonna give it to Durst. Let's give him one fucking thirst trap. Yeah, I'll give him that one too. Yeah

29:52.860 --> 29:53.900
All right

29:54.860 --> 29:58.940
I'm saying no to all of them unfortunately. I think this one's a quick no he's angry

29:59.180 --> 30:03.420
He's a bad boy. You know what I think my issue is before I move further is that I think that will thirst trap

30:03.660 --> 30:05.340
Obviously is like a or you can get it in action

30:05.980 --> 30:08.620
Thirst trap is like a more modern term

30:08.620 --> 30:11.020
But thirst trap implies that it's like an intentional thing

30:11.020 --> 30:15.340
Maybe they're you're taking them or you're giving you're found being like no take a hot photo of me

30:15.340 --> 30:17.580
Yeah, and some of these like he doesn't even know they're being taken

30:17.580 --> 30:23.020
Brian so it doesn't feel intentional. I think this one does he's being taken and I do I think he's actually hot in this one as well

30:23.900 --> 30:25.900
You said yes to every single one

30:27.100 --> 30:32.300
No, I'd sort of wasn't too fond of the Robert Durst one the one where he looked like Andy Kaufman's altar

30:32.300 --> 30:37.900
You got Tony Clifton. He isn't as some sort of weird suit. This one I think isn't attractive photo of a man

30:37.900 --> 30:41.900
I like face looks good. I like that he's in a void like we don't really know where he is

30:42.460 --> 30:46.620
Lala Palusa 2003. This was shot in a TRL studio somewhere

30:47.980 --> 30:49.980
So yeah

30:49.980 --> 30:53.660
I'm sorry guys. I'm saying no. I'll say I'll say no to this one

30:54.540 --> 31:01.980
I'm gonna have to say yes. Oh, oh, we got another tie. I'll just say yes, then so we can move on. Well, what about Casey? We'd like to have a tie breaker

31:04.940 --> 31:06.940
No, because I think it's rude

31:06.940 --> 31:10.460
I flipped it for me because his face looks good but he looks like I don't want to hang out with that

31:10.460 --> 31:15.740
But I like the flipping of the bird where the the second and fourth finger are like writing

31:15.740 --> 31:19.660
Those like that because some people go like that and that's too now that we have a video

31:19.660 --> 31:24.220
We can show this is just the middle bird yeah, and my my fingers are sort of you see

31:24.220 --> 31:29.500
I think like a bowling pin a little bit like thin at the middle and why didn't you face or something like that?

31:29.900 --> 31:34.540
You worked on your new job for like a couple of months to get fit and then you just kept getting your hands stuck in

31:34.540 --> 31:36.540
I just got my hands thinned

31:37.420 --> 31:42.780
Backfired, but that's a good looking bird. Oh, that's an attractive guy. This is this is what I was excited to get to

31:42.780 --> 31:45.740
This is a zaddy face. Exactly. I'm I'm

31:46.460 --> 31:51.660
Four months away from being this man. I'm almost entirely gray. I can't quite pull off the food man chew

31:51.660 --> 31:56.220
But I'm ready for it. Yeah, see this one makes sense because it's like obviously intentional like he is he

31:56.940 --> 32:02.140
He thinks this is a thirst drop. Is it doing anything for me? No, but like I think that it is a thirst trap

32:02.780 --> 32:07.980
Because he he's trying to make it a thirst trap. So I'm gonna say yes. We finally got a yes at a sale

32:07.980 --> 32:11.820
I know what I'm gonna have to agree. It is a thirst trap. It's a thirst trap

32:12.460 --> 32:16.620
You Durst not know about traps you Durst not know about ghee

32:21.820 --> 32:23.020
Scary

32:23.020 --> 32:26.540
Oh, and then our last one here we go. This is classic Durst

32:28.540 --> 32:33.180
I can't even power through yeah, he's definitely related to Robert based on the

32:34.860 --> 32:38.460
The last thing is victim saw he's like he's putting a hex on me. Yeah

32:39.100 --> 32:45.820
So no, all right, I think we did. Yeah, we need not say

32:52.860 --> 33:01.900
Oh, that was Durst traps. That was good. That was good. Johnny has prepared an amazing segment. Wow

33:01.900 --> 33:07.580
I've been excited for since he touched down at Burbank smart in the Burbank. I marked him off

33:08.540 --> 33:13.180
On Monday, Johnny. Do you need some time do we need to bam? Do we need to wax?

33:14.220 --> 33:21.900
I think that I'm good. All right, so I also brought a laptop just like Jeff. Yeah a smaller one though. Yeah, because I'm

33:22.700 --> 33:24.700
Pretty much his mini

33:27.340 --> 33:30.380
His mini so wait, let me give you a little intro

33:33.500 --> 33:37.820
This is not a little intro. I've heard this audio before it's really long

33:38.780 --> 33:40.780
It goes on too long

33:40.780 --> 33:42.780
But again

33:46.140 --> 33:52.860
It's getting old. Yeah, the stick is getting old. Yeah, two long sounds two loud sounds. It's like

33:53.740 --> 33:56.060
We're hemorrhaging listeners and advertisers

33:57.580 --> 34:00.380
I know I did this all out so people don't know how bad things are

34:02.460 --> 34:04.460
Okay

34:04.620 --> 34:08.220
By the way the vibrate now is like a four year old in a six year old like want to put on a

34:08.300 --> 34:10.300
Play

34:10.940 --> 34:12.620
Where should we stand? All right, do it ready

34:13.260 --> 34:14.780
Here's come on give me the cord

34:16.620 --> 34:19.020
Yeah, well, this is the time for laughs. I get it

34:19.900 --> 34:21.900
I'm all for a laugh and I'm all for laughs

34:22.460 --> 34:25.260
Probably this is not the time for a business deal. Oh

34:26.620 --> 34:32.220
You're a TikTok star at Sally Dar Griffin, correct? We can agree on that everybody

34:32.940 --> 34:36.780
And I'm somewhat of a star as well on today, but that is big a start for

34:36.780 --> 34:45.260
Unfortunately, I'm sorry half a million. Oh, through you. Yeah, half a million. Yeah, you have half a million fans. That's correct. Yeah. Yeah, I'm right behind you 63

34:55.820 --> 34:57.580
Yeah, follow me back. I kept texting you

34:59.020 --> 35:04.220
I'd like to think of myself as a valuable business associate in the realm social media

35:04.940 --> 35:07.820
My team at my personal company pretty wack industry is

35:09.180 --> 35:14.380
We want to make your fan count even larger, you know, it's bigger than 500 half a million

35:15.260 --> 35:16.780
Tell me a million

35:16.780 --> 35:20.300
Okay, yeah, it's gonna get even bigger than that. You're like 650

35:21.580 --> 35:23.180
Sounds like

35:23.180 --> 35:29.740
I audited the platform on my own time. I'm not much of an avid user of TikTok, but uh to prepare for the segment

35:29.740 --> 35:36.460
I really dive deep into it and I realized that audio is what makes a tick

35:37.260 --> 35:39.260
Talk

35:39.260 --> 35:41.260
Explosion

35:43.820 --> 35:51.100
I come to you miss Griffin with an opportunity that will change your digital footprint

35:51.660 --> 35:53.900
Does that sound like something that you're interested in?

35:53.900 --> 35:56.700
Of course. Great. So instant no

35:57.980 --> 36:02.860
Yeah, I'm a computer. We could do sweet greens for lunch

36:04.140 --> 36:08.460
I've created a few uh different audios and these are completely original compositions

36:08.620 --> 36:13.420
That no one else has heard before up until this point and I'm giving you Sally Dar

36:13.900 --> 36:16.380
Peter Griffin the chance to go away

36:17.500 --> 36:23.660
The next viral audio in your TikTok and you're given actual full permission to use this in your future videos

36:23.900 --> 36:28.460
And whatever red the revenue streams that you may have so let's get right into it

36:28.460 --> 36:33.500
I have lyric cards so viewers can follow along Jeffrey it can you play

36:34.060 --> 36:36.140
Tudal time. That's what this one's called Tudal time

36:40.860 --> 36:42.860
Is this

36:54.860 --> 36:59.340
That's it. Well, that's one. That's one. Okay

37:00.060 --> 37:06.860
So what do you imagine she's gonna use that audio for? Okay, you're gonna be okay hang on. Could you to find a Tudal for me?

37:06.860 --> 37:10.380
Yeah, yeah, so that's you that's put an annoyed by that

37:10.380 --> 37:12.060
That's a really

37:12.060 --> 37:14.540
It's already not going well nice question that

37:15.660 --> 37:17.020
So

37:17.020 --> 37:21.980
Yeah, I'm sure everybody even at home is asking what is Tudal time

37:22.460 --> 37:25.980
But that's the beauty of it. You are getting in on the ground floor to

37:26.540 --> 37:32.300
Embue whatever kind of definition that you want Tudal time to be it could be positive it could be negative

37:33.580 --> 37:35.820
Not only are you starting a social media trend?

37:37.180 --> 37:40.220
I can honestly foresee a Webster's entry

37:40.220 --> 37:44.620
No way for Tudal time. Yeah, we still haven't defined it you think there's gonna be an eight episode

37:44.620 --> 37:49.980
Are okay fine. What do we think Tudal time could be I don't know it seems like it's some dance

37:50.620 --> 37:55.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're like waltzing down the street or yeah

37:58.060 --> 38:00.620
It can be a series you just don't you obviously

38:00.620 --> 38:05.500
We're the videos there. What would you do with Tudal time? I guess it's like a are we doing like an eight episode arc

38:05.500 --> 38:08.460
Is that what we're doing now? We don't have to do an eight episode arc. You could do a single

38:08.460 --> 38:09.500
Do you attend episode?

38:09.500 --> 38:11.500
It could be a lot longer than that

38:11.500 --> 38:14.300
I'm thinking big year. Yeah, a amusement park

38:15.420 --> 38:19.820
At least we at the very least we have to get it off the ground pilot it. Do you have other ideas or that

38:20.300 --> 38:23.420
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Yeah, it's a lot because let's hear the

38:23.420 --> 38:27.900
Mal and then because it might we like the Durst one and we might come back and realize Tudal time was

38:27.900 --> 38:33.180
Accidadolly the best. Okay, yeah. Well actually, um so you have the freedom to think whatever Tudal time is gonna be

38:33.820 --> 38:42.860
So I went ahead and purchase the Dota the domain Tudal time dot com T O o D l e time dot com for one year

38:43.020 --> 38:45.340
Which will redirect you or Tic-tock profile

38:45.340 --> 38:48.340
We did do actually do that.

38:48.340 --> 38:49.340
Yeah.

38:49.340 --> 38:50.340
This is no way.

38:50.340 --> 38:54.340
This contract is an agreement that you,

38:54.340 --> 38:57.340
Oh, I'm so much.

38:57.340 --> 39:00.340
He's wearing a wire on my interest level.

39:00.340 --> 39:02.340
This is a real thing.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.340
So what does that say?

39:03.340 --> 39:04.340
Funny.

39:04.340 --> 39:05.340
Yeah.

39:05.340 --> 39:06.340
It's the total time agreement.

39:06.340 --> 39:07.340
Wait, so what does this mean?

39:07.340 --> 39:08.340
What am I signing?

39:08.340 --> 39:13.340
It means that I'm giving you a beautiful permission to use this word that I've created.

39:13.340 --> 39:14.340
Okay.

39:14.340 --> 39:15.340
All of your content.

39:15.340 --> 39:16.340
So she's so pretty.

39:16.340 --> 39:17.340
And she owns the domain.

39:17.340 --> 39:18.340
Ah, yeah.

39:18.340 --> 39:19.340
She also owns the domain.

39:19.340 --> 39:21.340
So you can sign at the bottom right there.

39:21.340 --> 39:22.340
That's insane.

39:22.340 --> 39:23.340
That's just the first one.

39:23.340 --> 39:24.340
Okay.

39:24.340 --> 39:25.340
Yeah.

39:25.340 --> 39:27.340
You should actually read contracts but in this scenario.

39:27.340 --> 39:28.340
I'm not going to.

39:28.340 --> 39:29.340
Send it to left.

39:29.340 --> 39:30.340
Ginsburg for the first time.

39:30.340 --> 39:35.340
I'm just going to send this clip to my agent and just be like, I signed something live on.

39:35.340 --> 39:36.340
I don't know what to say.

39:36.340 --> 39:39.340
And she's going to be like, I think somebody owns my TikTok now.

39:39.340 --> 39:40.340
Yeah.

39:40.340 --> 39:42.340
I just signed over all of my rights.

39:42.340 --> 39:43.340
That's great.

39:44.340 --> 39:45.340
You can't do it.

39:45.340 --> 39:47.340
If you're listening, go to TudalTime.com.

39:47.340 --> 39:49.340
And then go to my TikTok and then follow.

39:49.340 --> 39:50.340
That's really good.

39:50.340 --> 39:53.340
This girl is all fine.

39:53.340 --> 39:55.340
TudalTime is now yours.

39:55.340 --> 39:56.340
All right.

39:56.340 --> 39:57.340
Okay.

39:57.340 --> 39:58.340
The end of the road.

39:58.340 --> 39:59.340
I can't get better than that.

39:59.340 --> 40:00.340
Okay.

40:00.340 --> 40:01.340
So, yeah.

40:01.340 --> 40:03.340
Well, no, it's going to get better.

40:03.340 --> 40:06.340
My private investigator actually let me know that you're a human.

40:06.340 --> 40:08.340
When you get this money.

40:08.340 --> 40:10.340
That huge Carly Simon fan, right?

40:10.340 --> 40:11.340
Of course.

40:11.340 --> 40:12.340
Right.

40:12.340 --> 40:13.340
Okay.

40:13.340 --> 40:14.340
Okay.

40:14.340 --> 40:16.340
And you swell sweaters at SDG Nits.

40:16.340 --> 40:17.340
Correct.

40:17.340 --> 40:18.340
Okay.

40:18.340 --> 40:19.340
Yeah.

40:19.340 --> 40:20.340
Everyone.

40:20.340 --> 40:21.340
These are handmade sweaters.

40:21.340 --> 40:22.340
Great.

40:22.340 --> 40:23.340
Is that not sweater?

40:23.340 --> 40:24.340
This is one of them.

40:24.340 --> 40:26.340
I normally do words, but this is a blue dog.

40:26.340 --> 40:27.340
See, look at that.

40:27.340 --> 40:28.340
It's great.

40:28.340 --> 40:30.340
So let's combine your biggest passions.

40:30.340 --> 40:33.340
Carly Simon and sweaters.

40:33.340 --> 40:37.340
And make a TikTok audio that's unique to you and you only.

40:37.340 --> 40:40.340
I gave the Carly Simon song,

40:40.340 --> 40:41.340
but he does it better.

40:41.340 --> 40:42.340
A complete overall.

40:42.340 --> 40:46.340
And it's going to get the attention of the untapped market.

40:46.340 --> 40:47.340
I see.

40:47.340 --> 40:48.340
You know where this is going.

40:48.340 --> 40:49.340
Jeff, can you play?

40:49.340 --> 40:58.340
Nobody does it sweater.

40:58.340 --> 41:07.340
There we go.

41:07.340 --> 41:16.340
Carly Simon is.

41:16.340 --> 41:23.340
Okay.

41:23.340 --> 41:26.340
Carly's word that's too big to like, Liz.

41:26.340 --> 41:28.340
We went to staples last night.

41:28.340 --> 41:29.340
Johnny said I need a few things.

41:29.340 --> 41:31.340
I heard that.

41:31.340 --> 41:33.340
Yeah, you guys want to go to staples now.

41:33.340 --> 41:35.340
And I thought you meant like a statement.

41:36.340 --> 41:38.340
You went to an office supply to get that.

41:38.340 --> 41:41.340
If I did go to the arena, I would have said crypto.com.

41:41.340 --> 41:42.340
Crypt smart.

41:42.340 --> 41:43.340
Who was saying that?

41:43.340 --> 41:44.340
Who was that?

41:44.340 --> 41:45.340
Who's that singing?

41:45.340 --> 41:46.340
That was me.

41:46.340 --> 41:47.340
Really?

41:47.340 --> 41:48.340
That was great.

41:48.340 --> 41:49.340
That was great.

41:49.340 --> 41:52.340
Much better that you must not know about ghee, of course.

41:52.340 --> 41:53.340
The bars low.

41:53.340 --> 41:56.340
That can go over any sweater video that you may produce.

41:56.340 --> 41:57.340
Yes.

41:57.340 --> 41:58.340
Or it can be played a birthday party.

41:58.340 --> 42:00.340
You have full permission to do that.

42:00.340 --> 42:02.340
It's ever green and loved by all.

42:03.340 --> 42:04.340
Here is a.

42:04.340 --> 42:05.340
No way.

42:05.340 --> 42:06.340
Come on.

42:06.340 --> 42:07.340
You gotta be.

42:07.340 --> 42:08.340
Out of the original contracts.

42:08.340 --> 42:10.340
Make it all monster.

42:10.340 --> 42:11.340
Why are you the next.

42:11.340 --> 42:12.340
Great.

42:12.340 --> 42:13.340
Right.

42:13.340 --> 42:14.340
You.

42:14.340 --> 42:16.340
Sign the next two.

42:16.340 --> 42:18.340
Let's do the second page of the first music.

42:18.340 --> 42:20.340
No, just the first.

42:20.340 --> 42:25.340
So that contract will give you full licensing and distribution rights for that song.

42:25.340 --> 42:26.340
Which is a pair.

42:26.340 --> 42:27.340
How many pages do you have?

42:27.340 --> 42:28.340
I think there's a few.

42:28.340 --> 42:29.340
It's a stack.

42:29.340 --> 42:30.340
This thing.

42:30.340 --> 42:31.340
This isn't three.

42:31.340 --> 42:32.340
You make a million dollars.

42:32.340 --> 42:33.340
Right.

42:33.340 --> 42:35.340
And for the next one.

42:35.340 --> 42:36.340
I heard.

42:36.340 --> 42:40.340
One of her TikToks and it had the Kim Kardashian audio of.

42:40.340 --> 42:41.340
They took it off.

42:41.340 --> 42:42.340
They took it off.

42:42.340 --> 42:43.340
Yeah.

42:43.340 --> 42:44.340
They removed the audio.

42:44.340 --> 42:45.340
Oh, that's such a shame to hear.

42:45.340 --> 42:46.340
Which one are you talking about?

42:46.340 --> 42:48.340
The one where she's talking about.

42:48.340 --> 42:50.340
You should get your ass up at work.

42:50.340 --> 42:51.340
Right.

42:51.340 --> 42:52.340
Okay.

42:52.340 --> 42:53.340
So that one stayed.

42:53.340 --> 42:54.340
But I made a parody of that.

42:54.340 --> 42:55.340
But they took down.

42:55.340 --> 42:56.340
Oh no.

42:56.340 --> 42:57.340
That was very lucy.

42:57.340 --> 42:58.340
I know it was going viral.

42:58.340 --> 42:59.340
And I was getting followers.

42:59.340 --> 43:00.340
Yeah.

43:00.340 --> 43:01.340
Borderline sex tapes on there.

43:01.340 --> 43:02.340
I know.

43:02.340 --> 43:05.340
Oh, they took down my video saying you should might be able to try mushrooms.

43:05.340 --> 43:06.340
So let's try this again.

43:06.340 --> 43:07.340
So what's the difference?

43:07.340 --> 43:08.340
I don't know.

43:08.340 --> 43:09.340
They took it down.

43:09.340 --> 43:10.340
Anyways.

43:10.340 --> 43:11.340
Keep going.

43:11.340 --> 43:12.340
Yeah.

43:12.340 --> 43:13.340
Yeah.

43:13.340 --> 43:14.340
Like, obviously we're talking about it.

43:14.340 --> 43:17.340
It seems like it did numbers on your TikTok profile.

43:17.340 --> 43:18.340
Like it or not.

43:18.340 --> 43:20.340
Kim Kardashian is a hot topic.

43:20.340 --> 43:21.340
And I like that you use her audio.

43:21.340 --> 43:23.340
It was brilliant from a content standpoint.

43:23.340 --> 43:24.340
We get it.

43:24.340 --> 43:26.340
She has a good clip.

43:26.340 --> 43:27.340
What are you bringing?

43:28.340 --> 43:29.340
It's not danceable.

43:29.340 --> 43:30.340
It's what I'm trying to say.

43:30.340 --> 43:31.340
It's not danceable.

43:31.340 --> 43:33.340
And TikTok is talking.

43:33.340 --> 43:34.340
Yeah.

43:34.340 --> 43:35.340
It's not big for dancing.

43:35.340 --> 43:36.340
And I look.

43:36.340 --> 43:38.340
I can't shake my ass to it.

43:38.340 --> 43:41.340
And I shake my ass to a lot of things.

43:41.340 --> 43:48.340
So what I did was I made a sound that gives you the virality of Kim Kardashian with the

43:48.340 --> 43:51.340
Densibility of Cotton I Joe.

43:51.340 --> 43:52.340
Jeff.

43:52.340 --> 43:53.340
Can you play work?

43:53.340 --> 43:55.340
It seems like nobody wants to work these days.

43:55.340 --> 43:56.340
Get your fucking ass up and work.

43:56.340 --> 44:04.340
Get your fucking ass up and work.

44:04.340 --> 44:05.340
Get your fucking ass up and work.

44:05.340 --> 44:06.340
Got a work.

44:06.340 --> 44:11.340
Get your fucking ass up and work.

44:11.340 --> 44:19.340
Get your fucking ass up and work.

44:19.340 --> 44:21.340
It's you grip walking to that.

44:21.340 --> 44:22.340
Yeah.

44:22.340 --> 44:23.340
I think it's just that.

44:23.340 --> 44:24.340
That would actually go by.

44:24.340 --> 44:27.340
And I really want to sound.

44:27.340 --> 44:28.340
There we go.

44:28.340 --> 44:30.340
That was for sale.

44:30.340 --> 44:33.340
I just want to show you I can do it.

44:33.340 --> 44:34.340
Yeah, there's not a contract with that.

44:34.340 --> 44:37.340
See, that one's for the girls in the gaze.

44:37.340 --> 44:38.340
Not optional.

44:38.340 --> 44:39.340
Not optional.

44:39.340 --> 44:40.340
You got a vote.

44:40.340 --> 44:41.340
Okay.

44:41.340 --> 44:44.340
Since we already have your signature for music licensing,

44:44.340 --> 44:47.340
this the next contract.

44:47.340 --> 44:49.340
Turns out you're like this.

44:49.340 --> 44:50.340
Yeah.

44:50.340 --> 44:52.340
That's really.

44:52.340 --> 44:55.340
Let's be be your indentured choreographer for this.

44:55.340 --> 44:58.340
I'm sort of a sort of a sort.

44:58.340 --> 44:59.340
Right.

44:59.340 --> 45:02.340
I'm signing away my human rights to be a choreographer for this.

45:02.340 --> 45:05.340
My last indentured choreographer didn't work out.

45:05.340 --> 45:06.340
Okay.

45:06.340 --> 45:07.340
This is a great deal.

45:07.340 --> 45:08.340
Yep.

45:08.340 --> 45:09.340
Wow.

45:09.340 --> 45:11.340
That one actually was really like that would go viral.

45:11.340 --> 45:12.340
Truly.

45:12.340 --> 45:14.340
All we need is one influencer.

45:14.340 --> 45:15.340
Yeah.

45:15.340 --> 45:16.340
To make the plan.

45:16.340 --> 45:18.340
We need one stally dark riff.

45:18.340 --> 45:19.340
Yeah.

45:19.340 --> 45:20.340
Great.

45:20.340 --> 45:21.340
And now.

45:21.340 --> 45:22.340
This is amazing.

45:22.340 --> 45:25.340
I'm seeing a lot of solid traction with this partnership already.

45:25.340 --> 45:26.340
I'm very excited.

45:26.340 --> 45:27.340
I hope you are too.

45:27.340 --> 45:28.340
Yeah.

45:28.340 --> 45:32.340
What if Jeff's like, we ran out of time before you got to any of this.

45:32.340 --> 45:35.340
Did you go next week?

45:35.340 --> 45:37.340
I'm not looking.

45:37.340 --> 45:40.340
I'm not only thinking of what's going to go viral now.

45:40.340 --> 45:43.340
Obviously, Kim Kardashian, two, three weeks down the line.

45:43.340 --> 45:44.340
She's underwater.

45:44.340 --> 45:47.340
She doesn't know where we're not talking about Kim Kardashian anymore.

45:47.340 --> 45:48.340
Not true.

45:48.340 --> 45:49.340
Okay.

45:50.340 --> 45:54.340
I'm thinking of a future business opportunities and prospects.

45:54.340 --> 45:57.340
I can see your name and screens everywhere.

45:57.340 --> 45:58.340
Times Square.

45:58.340 --> 45:59.340
A lot of screens there.

45:59.340 --> 46:00.340
Yeah.

46:00.340 --> 46:01.340
Muscreens.

46:01.340 --> 46:02.340
Modern Hollywood.

46:02.340 --> 46:03.340
Right.

46:03.340 --> 46:04.340
Scott.

46:04.340 --> 46:07.340
In five to ten years, I want you to actually answer to your genuinely.

46:07.340 --> 46:09.340
Where do you hope to see yourself?

46:09.340 --> 46:10.340
Genuinely.

46:10.340 --> 46:11.340
Yeah.

46:11.340 --> 46:12.340
Genuinely.

46:12.340 --> 46:16.340
I hope to not be relying on the internet as much as I currently have to.

46:16.340 --> 46:21.340
So something in the more quote unquote traditional Hollywood space, whether that's like TV.

46:21.340 --> 46:26.340
But not fully abandoning the internet and then also small business of selling my sweaters.

46:26.340 --> 46:27.340
Me, great.

46:27.340 --> 46:28.340
That's great.

46:28.340 --> 46:30.340
And I'm glad you said that.

46:30.340 --> 46:34.340
I want listeners right now to root for you and follow your five to ten year trajectory.

46:34.340 --> 46:38.340
And I'm glad you said something that's more traditional.

46:38.340 --> 46:42.340
What I have is an idea for a Sally dark riff and rock musical.

46:42.340 --> 46:44.340
That would be a huge hit.

46:45.340 --> 46:46.340
It's relating to sweaters.

46:46.340 --> 46:47.340
I think rent.

46:47.340 --> 46:52.340
But instead of following the life and times of artists in New York, it's about sweaters.

46:52.340 --> 46:54.340
Pretty easy.

46:54.340 --> 46:59.340
Obviously, you're going to assist in writing the book and music and lyrics.

46:59.340 --> 47:01.340
And obviously, now choreography.

47:01.340 --> 47:05.340
Are going to be my for me and my team at Pretty Wack.

47:05.340 --> 47:09.340
I put together a demo of a song from that musical.

47:09.340 --> 47:11.340
Jeffrey, can you play the final audio?

47:12.340 --> 47:15.340
What's the do with all the frees in the world?

47:15.340 --> 47:17.340
I need a swimmer.

47:17.340 --> 47:19.340
Oh.

47:19.340 --> 47:21.340
I'll be so fat.

47:21.340 --> 47:24.340
I have to run my skin on and out the bed on.

47:24.340 --> 47:26.340
There we go.

47:26.340 --> 47:28.340
No, no, no, no, no.

47:28.340 --> 47:32.340
Can't get enough more shots.

47:32.340 --> 47:35.340
Okay.

47:35.340 --> 47:39.340
Give me all of your sweaters and quench my thirst.

47:40.340 --> 47:44.340
It's like next to normal.

47:44.340 --> 47:45.340
Yeah.

47:45.340 --> 47:47.340
Kind of very sexual.

47:47.340 --> 47:48.340
Very, very sexual.

47:48.340 --> 47:49.340
I like that.

47:49.340 --> 47:50.340
No more khakis.

47:50.340 --> 47:52.340
Yeah, no more khakis in the sweater.

47:52.340 --> 47:53.340
Huh?

47:53.340 --> 47:54.340
Never mind.

47:54.340 --> 47:57.340
What's the least of your concerns, I guess.

47:57.340 --> 48:01.340
So as you can see, your angle can be realized post-haste.

48:01.340 --> 48:04.340
I want you to sign the final page.

48:04.340 --> 48:08.340
And your plan will be realized with the help of Pretty Wack in five to ten years.

48:08.340 --> 48:09.340
Right.

48:09.340 --> 48:13.340
This is an actual contract from the cherry lane fee.

48:13.340 --> 48:16.340
I'm a 40 day run.

48:16.340 --> 48:17.340
Can I count you in?

48:17.340 --> 48:18.340
Yeah.

48:18.340 --> 48:19.340
Cool because.

48:19.340 --> 48:20.340
Yeah.

48:20.340 --> 48:23.340
My signature is getting progressively less and less logical.

48:23.340 --> 48:24.340
Can't count me in.

48:24.340 --> 48:25.340
Yes.

48:25.340 --> 48:26.340
I will count you.

48:26.340 --> 48:27.340
All right.

48:27.340 --> 48:28.340
You won't be disappointed.

48:28.340 --> 48:31.340
My private investigator will be in contact with you.

48:31.340 --> 48:34.340
I love how you need a PI to do that.

48:34.340 --> 48:36.340
The check the internet.

48:36.340 --> 48:37.340
All right.

48:37.340 --> 48:40.340
Jeffrey, thank you for letting me see my god.

48:40.340 --> 48:43.340
That was unbelievable Johnny.

48:43.340 --> 48:45.340
So what did Johnny tell you?

48:45.340 --> 48:46.340
Yeah.

48:46.340 --> 48:50.340
I'll wait till.

48:50.340 --> 48:53.340
What did Johnny tell you when he landed that you're like, this is a great idea.

48:53.340 --> 48:56.340
I just know Johnny has a creative genius.

48:56.340 --> 48:57.340
I see.

48:57.340 --> 49:00.340
I tried not to tell him anything about what was going to happen.

49:00.340 --> 49:03.340
We should say Johnny flew out just for this record.

49:04.340 --> 49:05.340
He's only in LA for me.

49:05.340 --> 49:06.340
Did he know that?

49:06.340 --> 49:07.340
Wait.

49:07.340 --> 49:08.340
That's true.

49:08.340 --> 49:09.340
Oh my god.

49:09.340 --> 49:10.340
Wow.

49:10.340 --> 49:13.340
I love the idea of you like thinking of me as you're like landing and burbank.

49:13.340 --> 49:14.340
Very romantic.

49:14.340 --> 49:16.340
That was so cool.

49:16.340 --> 49:17.340
All right.

49:17.340 --> 49:18.340
We have one last segment.

49:18.340 --> 49:19.340
Here we go.

49:19.340 --> 49:20.340
Let's get a good intro.

49:20.340 --> 49:21.340
Okay.

49:21.340 --> 49:24.340
Oh my god.

49:24.340 --> 49:25.340
No.

49:25.340 --> 49:27.340
This is a plug for SDG Nits.

49:27.340 --> 49:29.340
I like to call this segment.

49:29.340 --> 49:30.340
Nitches.

49:30.340 --> 49:31.340
Knit pitches.

49:31.340 --> 49:34.340
So I love your stuff.

49:34.340 --> 49:41.340
But I want to know, how do you come up with the sayings or two words or letters or designs?

49:41.340 --> 49:42.340
What's the inspiration for that?

49:42.340 --> 49:46.340
So this one was custom for my friend Courtney, average fashion blogger.

49:46.340 --> 49:47.340
She wanted one.

49:47.340 --> 49:50.340
She's always doing self tapes and she thought it would be funny.

49:50.340 --> 49:52.340
If she like did a self tape wearing this.

49:52.340 --> 49:54.340
So this one was custom.

49:54.340 --> 49:55.340
Did it work?

49:55.340 --> 49:56.340
I don't think it's worked.

49:56.340 --> 49:57.340
It will though.

49:57.340 --> 49:58.340
She's a star.

49:58.340 --> 49:59.340
Yeah.

49:59.340 --> 50:00.340
But yeah, this one was custom.

50:00.340 --> 50:04.340
But the other ones, I just think, I mean, I like the big letters and I like them to be like four to five letters.

50:04.340 --> 50:06.340
And it's kind of like a little bit of a.

50:06.340 --> 50:07.340
How does this take?

50:07.340 --> 50:09.340
This is very impressive.

50:09.340 --> 50:10.340
These are great.

50:10.340 --> 50:12.340
It depends on how focused I am in general, like a week.

50:12.340 --> 50:14.340
I just finished one that took like two weeks.

50:14.340 --> 50:15.340
I would have seen like a month.

50:15.340 --> 50:16.340
Yeah, Jesus.

50:16.340 --> 50:17.340
Um, no.

50:17.340 --> 50:18.340
Well, I do when I like watch TV.

50:18.340 --> 50:19.340
So like that.

50:19.340 --> 50:21.340
I think about how much you watch TV.

50:21.340 --> 50:24.340
Are you mostly looking down when you're knitting or you're like looking up the TV and blindly.

50:24.340 --> 50:25.340
It depends.

50:25.340 --> 50:27.340
It depends on I can do it without looking.

50:27.340 --> 50:28.340
I'm always checking.

50:28.340 --> 50:29.340
Wow.

50:29.340 --> 50:33.340
This one, I literally have in the same way that people have ideas in their notes for like videos

50:33.340 --> 50:34.340
or like tweets, whatever.

50:34.340 --> 50:37.340
I have ideas for phrases for knitting.

50:37.340 --> 50:39.340
Um, and like I just, this one's funny.

50:39.340 --> 50:41.340
Like I think the phrase Tommy went as hilarious.

50:41.340 --> 50:44.340
Have you sold any of these or you just have them to show people?

50:44.340 --> 50:45.340
No.

50:45.340 --> 50:46.340
I'm in the weird fit.

50:46.340 --> 50:47.340
I like to keep some of them for myself.

50:47.340 --> 50:49.340
And I'm like, I want to keep that for myself.

50:49.340 --> 50:50.340
But I'm starting to sell.

50:50.340 --> 50:51.340
So like selling to Courtney.

50:51.340 --> 50:52.340
She was the first one I really sold to.

50:52.340 --> 50:55.340
And then when I just finished, it's for my friend named.

50:55.340 --> 50:59.340
Uh, bug girl 200 is her username and she has a brand called bug girl 200 brand.

50:59.340 --> 51:00.340
Yeah.

51:00.340 --> 51:03.340
So I'm selling her one because she's like a fellow like fashion girl.

51:03.340 --> 51:06.340
Um, so I'm selling to very few people that are like friends.

51:06.340 --> 51:07.340
I'm selling to friends first.

51:07.340 --> 51:08.340
Yeah.

51:08.340 --> 51:09.340
See how it goes.

51:09.340 --> 51:13.340
Um, well, so I, it must be hard to come up with these.

51:13.340 --> 51:16.340
Uh, and I thought that maybe we could add to your list of inspiration.

51:16.340 --> 51:17.340
Okay.

51:17.340 --> 51:18.340
Come up with a little bit.

51:18.340 --> 51:19.340
She's a couple niches rather.

51:19.340 --> 51:22.340
Uh, you did say you like to keep it to five to six letters so you might not like.

51:22.340 --> 51:23.340
Oh, no.

51:23.340 --> 51:24.340
Hey, I can change the pattern.

51:24.340 --> 51:25.340
All right.

51:25.340 --> 51:26.340
Uh, Bruce Mangostein.

51:26.340 --> 51:27.340
Meaning.

51:27.340 --> 51:29.340
Just walk me through that.

51:29.340 --> 51:30.340
Yeah.

51:30.340 --> 51:32.340
Because that's not like spring is a bed fruit.

51:32.340 --> 51:35.340
So I don't understand if this is a play on spring with mango.

51:35.340 --> 51:36.340
Bruce Springsteen.

51:36.340 --> 51:37.340
But Bruce Mangostein.

51:37.340 --> 51:38.340
Yeah.

51:38.340 --> 51:39.340
It's quirky.

51:39.340 --> 51:40.340
It's a reverent.

51:40.340 --> 51:42.340
People are going to look twice at the sweater and be like, what did you get that?

51:42.340 --> 51:43.340
Right.

51:43.340 --> 51:44.340
What is it?

51:44.340 --> 51:45.340
They're going to be accusatory.

51:45.340 --> 51:46.340
More like not really curious.

51:46.340 --> 51:48.340
Who would buy a Bruce Mangostein sweater?

51:48.340 --> 51:49.340
Right.

51:49.340 --> 51:50.340
It feels to nobody.

51:50.340 --> 51:52.340
Also, I think they should be on three lines, right?

51:52.340 --> 51:55.340
Because the scene is almost going to the back of the.

51:55.340 --> 51:56.340
Well, I ran out of space.

51:56.340 --> 51:57.340
Yeah.

51:57.340 --> 51:58.340
So she will definitely run out of space.

51:58.340 --> 51:59.340
Yeah.

51:59.340 --> 52:03.340
Because you can actually make it digitally a lot smaller than she could.

52:03.340 --> 52:04.340
Yeah.

52:04.340 --> 52:05.340
And obviously, you know how to do that.

52:05.340 --> 52:06.340
You tilted the text.

52:06.340 --> 52:08.340
So you can resize and make it a little bit smaller.

52:08.340 --> 52:10.340
Well, now I'm getting nervous and shutting down.

52:10.340 --> 52:12.340
Because if you didn't like this one, you're not going to like any of these.

52:12.340 --> 52:14.340
Well, actually Sally didn't weigh in on that one.

52:14.340 --> 52:15.340
Okay.

52:15.340 --> 52:16.340
I think it's great.

52:16.340 --> 52:18.340
I have a similar idea in my phone.

52:18.340 --> 52:21.340
I think it's Stanley 2G 8 my child or something like that.

52:22.340 --> 52:23.340
So like a similar energy.

52:23.340 --> 52:24.340
Yes.

52:24.340 --> 52:25.340
People look twice.

52:25.340 --> 52:26.340
Yeah.

52:26.340 --> 52:27.340
That's funny.

52:27.340 --> 52:29.340
This one is like Bruce Mangostein.

52:29.340 --> 52:30.340
It's a fun of nothing.

52:30.340 --> 52:31.340
Yeah.

52:33.340 --> 52:34.340
Here we go.

52:34.340 --> 52:35.340
Crab rangoon afternoon.

52:35.340 --> 52:36.340
That's good.

52:36.340 --> 52:37.340
That one.

52:37.340 --> 52:39.340
I do like a crab rangoon.

52:39.340 --> 52:40.340
Perfect.

52:40.340 --> 52:41.340
So I've been thinking about like,

52:41.340 --> 52:42.340
Drunch alternatives.

52:42.340 --> 52:44.340
Because I've been trying to drink less.

52:44.340 --> 52:45.340
Just for, you know, health.

52:45.340 --> 52:47.340
And, you know, and maybe instead of

52:47.340 --> 52:50.340
Drunch with, you know, with all the gang on Sunday after night out.

52:50.340 --> 52:52.340
You go out and you just got a couple crab crab rangoons.

52:52.340 --> 52:53.340
Yeah.

52:53.340 --> 52:54.340
In the afternoon.

52:54.340 --> 52:55.340
That's perfect.

52:55.340 --> 52:57.340
I like that when you said crab rangoon afternoon,

52:57.340 --> 53:01.340
our producer Casey had to look up in this movie.

53:01.340 --> 53:03.340
That's a lot of street.

53:03.340 --> 53:04.340
All right.

53:04.340 --> 53:05.340
So that one might go.

53:05.340 --> 53:06.340
Here we go.

53:06.340 --> 53:07.340
Eat lamb.

53:07.340 --> 53:08.340
Not meat.

53:08.340 --> 53:09.340
Oh.

53:09.340 --> 53:10.340
I'm actually.

53:10.340 --> 53:11.340
I'm like in this one.

53:11.340 --> 53:14.340
I have a cookbook that has a lamb hummus that I want to make.

53:14.340 --> 53:15.340
Yeah.

53:15.340 --> 53:17.340
And so like this is really fitting in with my life personally.

53:17.340 --> 53:18.340
Awesome.

53:18.340 --> 53:20.340
And then you can take it out of lamb's wool.

53:20.340 --> 53:21.340
What's that?

53:21.340 --> 53:22.340
That's good.

53:22.340 --> 53:26.340
My picture would be eat veal not meat because veal is probably the worst kind of thing.

53:26.340 --> 53:27.340
I have.

53:27.340 --> 53:30.340
It's literally cows that are killed as adolescent.

53:30.340 --> 53:31.340
Right.

53:31.340 --> 53:32.340
Yeah.

53:32.340 --> 53:33.340
So nobody would actually think that.

53:33.340 --> 53:34.340
Right.

53:34.340 --> 53:35.340
That one's good to eat lamb meat.

53:35.340 --> 53:36.340
Here we go.

53:36.340 --> 53:38.340
It's okay to least a hat.

53:38.340 --> 53:39.340
You tweeted that.

53:39.340 --> 53:40.340
Yeah.

53:40.340 --> 53:41.340
Yeah.

53:41.340 --> 53:42.340
This is trying to make it.

53:42.340 --> 53:43.340
Somebody likes to get on that.

53:43.340 --> 53:45.340
That one got kind of like 200.

53:45.340 --> 53:46.340
Okay.

53:46.340 --> 53:47.340
But it is okay to least a hat.

53:48.340 --> 53:49.340
It is not illegal.

53:49.340 --> 53:50.340
Exactly.

53:50.340 --> 53:51.340
It's not against the rules.

53:51.340 --> 53:52.340
You can, yeah.

53:52.340 --> 53:53.340
No, not at all.

53:53.340 --> 53:54.340
You can least a hat.

53:54.340 --> 53:56.340
You can have a fedora that you make monthly payments on.

53:56.340 --> 53:57.340
Right.

53:57.340 --> 54:00.340
And then so this sweater is like you could wear it with the hat that you're renting.

54:00.340 --> 54:02.340
Yeah.

54:02.340 --> 54:08.340
Personally, this doesn't spark joy for me because it doesn't.

54:08.340 --> 54:13.340
Give me an interesting sentence or sentiment that I want to put out in the world.

54:13.340 --> 54:14.340
So you would Marie condo this.

54:14.340 --> 54:15.340
You'd get it out of time.

54:15.340 --> 54:16.340
Okay.

54:16.340 --> 54:17.340
Put it in the to go box.

54:17.340 --> 54:21.340
Donate it to somebody who would ever think that this is a good idea.

54:21.340 --> 54:25.340
And I think it's just you because you tweeted it and it didn't resonate with anybody.

54:25.340 --> 54:26.340
I don't believe.

54:26.340 --> 54:27.340
Right.

54:27.340 --> 54:28.340
200 people.

54:28.340 --> 54:31.340
Well, the yellow reason 200 people liked it was because they saw a mirror's reply.

54:31.340 --> 54:33.340
So which was it.

54:33.340 --> 54:35.340
So like it boosted it a lot more.

54:35.340 --> 54:38.340
I think if we didn't do anything interact, it wouldn't have gotten.

54:38.340 --> 54:40.340
It's like that old.

54:40.340 --> 54:41.340
I think it was it.

54:41.340 --> 54:42.340
One of the earliest TikTok.

54:42.340 --> 54:43.340
It's like stop.

54:43.340 --> 54:44.340
He's boosted in minds.

54:44.340 --> 54:46.340
Skinny guy like doing that dance.

54:46.340 --> 54:47.340
Anyway.

54:47.340 --> 54:49.340
Who's got your smile and like that?

54:49.340 --> 54:51.340
Who's got your least in love?

54:51.340 --> 54:53.340
Leave me to die.

54:53.340 --> 54:54.340
That's good for fall.

54:54.340 --> 54:55.340
Yeah.

54:55.340 --> 54:56.340
Yeah.

54:56.340 --> 54:57.340
Love a fall sweater.

54:57.340 --> 54:58.340
Yeah.

54:58.340 --> 54:59.340
Imagine Daniel Craig in that.

54:59.340 --> 55:02.340
It'll sound like it'll look like the new bond movement.

55:02.340 --> 55:03.340
No time.

55:03.340 --> 55:04.340
THYME.

55:04.340 --> 55:05.340
To die.

55:05.340 --> 55:06.340
That's good.

55:06.340 --> 55:07.340
All right.

55:07.340 --> 55:09.340
There's no crying and chats worth.

55:09.340 --> 55:10.340
Huh.

55:10.340 --> 55:12.340
That one is going on to the set.

55:12.340 --> 55:13.340
Oh, yeah.

55:13.340 --> 55:14.340
I don't know.

55:14.340 --> 55:15.340
Do you know where chats worth is?

55:15.340 --> 55:16.340
No.

55:16.340 --> 55:17.340
I'm feeling like I should.

55:17.340 --> 55:19.340
It's deep in the valley.

55:19.340 --> 55:20.340
Gotcha.

55:20.340 --> 55:22.340
And we shot Lonely and Horny up there.

55:22.340 --> 55:23.340
That's right.

55:23.340 --> 55:24.340
Yeah.

55:24.340 --> 55:25.340
There's a lot of space over there.

55:25.340 --> 55:27.340
And do you know what that's the quote is referencing?

55:27.340 --> 55:29.340
Uh, there's no crying in.

55:29.340 --> 55:30.340
Uh, I don't know.

55:30.340 --> 55:31.340
Baseball.

55:31.340 --> 55:32.340
Um.

55:32.340 --> 55:34.340
So the reference is lost.

55:34.340 --> 55:37.340
And then also it's at about a place that Sally's never heard of.

55:37.340 --> 55:38.340
Yeah.

55:38.340 --> 55:40.340
And it also sounds very similar to where I'm from.

55:40.340 --> 55:41.340
Right.

55:41.340 --> 55:42.340
I should have done more research.

55:42.340 --> 55:44.340
It's all the things that you're going to do.

55:44.340 --> 55:45.340
Yeah.

55:45.340 --> 55:46.340
Yeah.

55:46.340 --> 55:47.340
Yeah.

55:47.340 --> 55:48.340
You guys did a lot of research.

55:48.340 --> 55:49.340
You're going to know about that.

55:49.340 --> 55:50.340
All right.

55:50.340 --> 55:51.340
Here we go.

55:51.340 --> 55:52.340
Offline ceramics.

55:52.340 --> 55:53.340
Oh.

55:53.340 --> 55:54.340
That one's good.

55:54.340 --> 55:55.340
I know that reference.

55:55.340 --> 55:56.340
And I'm like a mount one.

55:56.340 --> 55:57.340
Yeah.

55:57.340 --> 55:58.340
You have a hat.

55:58.340 --> 55:59.340
That's like that, right?

55:59.340 --> 56:00.340
Yeah.

56:00.340 --> 56:02.340
I almost interned for them in like 2017.

56:02.340 --> 56:03.340
Nice.

56:03.340 --> 56:05.340
Uh, because I was really into tie dye.

56:05.340 --> 56:07.340
Um, and I was living in tie dye.

56:07.340 --> 56:09.340
And uh, you weren't seeing that.

56:10.340 --> 56:12.340
I had a, what's the opposite of a pen.

56:12.340 --> 56:14.340
I guess a basement at the US bank tower.

56:14.340 --> 56:15.340
You have an opposite of a penthouse.

56:15.340 --> 56:16.340
Yeah.

56:16.340 --> 56:17.340
Okay.

56:17.340 --> 56:18.340
Be a basement.

56:18.340 --> 56:20.340
I do live at the basement right now.

56:20.340 --> 56:23.340
Um, but anyway, I thought that'd be kind of quirky in a reverent.

56:23.340 --> 56:24.340
Yeah.

56:24.340 --> 56:25.340
No.

56:25.340 --> 56:26.340
I like that one.

56:26.340 --> 56:28.340
I mean, I don't own an online ceramic shirt.

56:28.340 --> 56:29.340
So this would be a good alternative.

56:29.340 --> 56:30.340
Um, yeah.

56:30.340 --> 56:32.340
You might get a season to sit, but it'll be worth it.

56:32.340 --> 56:33.340
Probably.

56:33.340 --> 56:34.340
I mean, I might get a new one.

56:34.340 --> 56:35.340
Oh, my god.

56:35.340 --> 56:36.340
Oh, my god.

56:36.340 --> 56:38.340
I get it again with the white band.

56:39.340 --> 56:42.340
Somehow it's just like small looking even more small complaint.

56:42.340 --> 56:45.340
But you chose the worst color to add on to.

56:45.340 --> 56:50.340
They do that's kind of a style of online ceramics, but good note.

56:50.340 --> 56:51.340
That's right.

56:51.340 --> 56:52.340
Green on dark gray.

56:52.340 --> 56:53.340
Yeah.

56:53.340 --> 56:54.340
Sox to see.

56:54.340 --> 56:55.340
Yeah.

56:55.340 --> 56:56.340
That's fair.

56:56.340 --> 56:57.340
Yeah.

56:57.340 --> 56:58.340
Um, all right.

56:58.340 --> 56:59.340
And this might be the last one.

56:59.340 --> 57:00.340
Let's see.

57:00.340 --> 57:01.340
When's the beef?

57:01.340 --> 57:02.340
Oh, that's nice.

57:02.340 --> 57:03.340
Do you know what that's a reference to?

57:03.340 --> 57:05.340
Instead of when it's where's the beef?

57:05.340 --> 57:06.340
Yeah.

57:09.340 --> 57:11.340
So we're speechless.

57:11.340 --> 57:12.340
Yeah.

57:12.340 --> 57:13.340
No, it's good.

57:13.340 --> 57:15.340
It's similar to like, tell me when where it's like,

57:15.340 --> 57:17.340
What is this leading to?

57:17.340 --> 57:18.340
Like, I don't know.

57:18.340 --> 57:20.340
Who's what would you answer this sweater with?

57:20.340 --> 57:22.340
You probably answer it with crab ring.

57:22.340 --> 57:23.340
All right.

57:23.340 --> 57:24.340
Of course.

57:24.340 --> 57:25.340
Yeah.

57:25.340 --> 57:26.340
Just like the wrong question.

57:26.340 --> 57:27.340
Yeah.

57:27.340 --> 57:28.340
Yeah.

57:28.340 --> 57:29.340
That is on the front.

57:29.340 --> 57:30.340
Crab ring.

57:30.340 --> 57:31.340
Good afternoon on the back.

57:31.340 --> 57:33.340
When's the beef, though?

57:33.340 --> 57:34.340
Um, so I think that's it.

57:34.340 --> 57:35.340
Let's.

57:35.340 --> 57:36.340
Yep.

57:36.340 --> 57:37.340
Oh, wait.

57:37.340 --> 57:39.340
This is yummy.

57:39.340 --> 57:40.340
This is exclusive yours.

57:40.340 --> 57:41.340
Yeah.

57:41.340 --> 57:42.340
This is using me as well.

57:42.340 --> 57:43.340
CNN anchor.

57:43.340 --> 57:45.340
So now I, do.

57:45.340 --> 57:47.340
Well, the question is, is she's on me?

57:47.340 --> 57:48.340
What is on me?

57:48.340 --> 57:50.340
It's like, is it that easy?

57:50.340 --> 57:51.340
Oh, yeah.

57:51.340 --> 57:55.340
Every two months, Jeff tweets this, or I told him to tweet it.

57:55.340 --> 57:56.340
And he always do.

57:56.340 --> 57:58.340
He never does well.

57:58.340 --> 58:01.340
I'm going to throw it a like next time.

58:01.340 --> 58:02.340
Yes.

58:02.340 --> 58:03.340
Go up.

58:03.340 --> 58:04.340
I love you.

58:04.340 --> 58:06.340
God, that's good stuff.

58:06.340 --> 58:12.420
This is just in Jared Leto 50 response to buzz about his pupil appearance. It doesn't matter

58:15.100 --> 58:18.620
Like just end on this just kind of wax about it if you guys don't need thoughts

58:18.620 --> 58:20.620
It does seem like he's not responding

58:20.620 --> 58:24.460
That's what I said. I was like this isn't an article. He didn't get a response

58:25.140 --> 58:29.860
He said words to you in an email. It doesn't matter. What a scoop

58:30.860 --> 58:36.140
This is that this is people magazine. That means like a group of like five editors was like send it out

58:36.140 --> 58:40.900
Right my impression of this was like the writer just like had a deadline at midnight was just like

58:42.340 --> 58:47.100
Send yeah, it's like Jared Leto 50 response to his useful appearance

58:47.700 --> 58:49.700
What question mark?

58:49.700 --> 58:51.700
That's fine. What do you say?

58:51.940 --> 58:53.940
What's that we got it?

58:54.580 --> 58:56.580
We just need a headline. Thanks Jared

58:57.380 --> 59:01.220
You walking walking out of a pop a johns or something pop up johns

59:02.420 --> 59:04.420

Have you ever do you get paparazzo coming up to you? Oh my god. How famous do you think I am?

59:14.020 --> 59:18.740
No, no, never as you're no one to ask for a picture with you. Yeah, okay

59:20.100 --> 59:22.100
Yeah, well, what was that gonna happen to me

59:22.660 --> 59:26.020
It's funny though it happens less than LA and more like if I'm home and chat and you're gonna

59:26.100 --> 59:29.940
Happens more but because like LA of people rag and they were just like oh whatever your hometown hero

59:30.340 --> 59:34.980
I suppose yeah, and I we actually wanted to talk to you about that. What are you doing for the community of chat a new girl?

59:35.220 --> 59:36.820
Because you have this one now

59:38.820 --> 59:43.620
What they have a meme account that I throw a few likes. I think that's like a really good thing for the community

59:45.620 --> 59:47.620
I go back like twice a year

59:49.060 --> 59:54.100
That's like nice the month my presence and over more a day weekend every six months I grace with my present

But well the the reddit show is dead in the water. Yeah, it was in

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:51.940
The game shows that development hell, as they say, yeah, sort of but two pilot seasons of past

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:57.220
These lawyers get involved in everything slows these PIs get in me

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:41.860
And then secondly

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:45.060
I wore shorts today. I'm not sure if they're like front and center in the frame

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:50.980
I look forward to seeing what they look like Casey said to us super that was in your ring pants great. Yeah, yeah

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:56.340
I was like it's a warm day out. I didn't think about the camera aspects of it all but like now that I

01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:01.700
Imagine what previous podcast that I shot here there's a lot of like jeans in it

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:05.620
It's like right now. It's just gonna be bare leg in it and I'm wondering if that's

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:09.220
An issue not that I want like every comment to be about that

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:12.100
But if you casually think about it way in below yeah

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:16.260
I could go shorter longer. I can make sure that I'm wearing fucking

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:22.180
Jeans next time as it gets hotter. It's just gonna. Yeah, I could be round. I could be the

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:27.940
That's guy. It's a thing from TikTok as well. I am on TikTok

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:31.860
Thanks for bringing it up. Okay, Blumer

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:37.140
Which is sort of a a pun on okay boomer friend Billy thought of it

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.540
Because I felt old on the trail

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:44.180
It's crazy

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:47.220
Yeah, follow me and Sally on

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:49.940
TikTok is where

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:52.740
Probably gonna co-labs soon or I'm gonna

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:54.740
We should know the dance to

01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:59.940
Or the work one. I think that that one will actually yeah

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:03.940
It's been worth it. If we dance to that, I think it would go viral. Yeah, they're really bloody

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:09.540
You're really like the sweater one man. I do like like the song and then yeah

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:15.620
I mean, I can make you a sweater in any case. I was gonna ask what your price was for a commissioned piece

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.380
Yeah

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:21.940
You probably don't have time. No, well, it's like kind of hard because like with Courtney like she was promoting it

01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:24.500
So I was like okay, why don't charge you as much but like they take so long

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.500
I'm like a charge like a hundred dollars

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:31.140
It's kind of like an NFT should charge crypto because people like yeah, what's one of the

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.060
Thearium it's fine people are paying you

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:37.220
It's hard to charge like a lot though because I'm like, I feel like an asshole like no one wants to pay three hundred dollars for sweat

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:41.860
Or if you charge a lot then it's like holy shit that person can afford that sweater like that's how watches work

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:43.620
Right, they tell time just as well

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:46.980
But like holy shit that guy has that specific one so your sweaters like oh my god

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:48.500
That's a Sally-dara original

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.460
Those were like

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.260
$1,200

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:52.260
Are there Sally-dara knit uh flippers

01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:55.060
Flippers, what do you mean they buy from you for?

01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:56.900
Oh, they sell for 37

01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:00.740
Oh, that would be more of a disease. No, I'm not that important yet. Yeah

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:05.620
I don't know right now probably like two hundred three hundred because I'm like I sell to I sell to friends too

01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:10.660
So I'm just like I'm not gonna charge you a lot. I think you can upcharge because our audience is a bunch of like and

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:12.580
Freak

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:17.060
If it was a total stranger, I would charge more though because I'm like that's my baby which my friends I get to see my

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:22.820
Sweat. Yes, right. Yeah. I don't have to fully let him go. Yeah. Well, uh I have a I might they up my credit limit

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:27.620
So I also I'll drop 250 on an SDG. Okay, but what would you say? I think it would

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.580
I might have to go

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:35.300
Probably something rice really. Oh, rice would be good. Yeah, rhythm of the rice. That's yeah, okay

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:37.780
We were I was gonna do Darpool karaoke

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:43.940
Maybe if we have you a back-on ever will do that. That would be fun. Yeah, but I felt too bad making you sing

01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:49.700
I did aqua Paladin high school. I could say that's my friend that I said lives like next door

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:52.500
We did aqua Paladin I got it. Oh, yeah, all right

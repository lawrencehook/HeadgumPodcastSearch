WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:05.000 --> 00:26.000
Music

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
Monday, June 27th, we're all happy and healthy.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
We're all fatty and wealthy.

00:35.000 --> 00:46.000
We all make money from doing this show and it's okay to explore sexuality.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Can we start over?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Yeah, let's start.

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
Music

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
Monday, June 27th, we're all happy and healthy.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
We're all fatty and wealthy.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
So we didn't need to redo it.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Yeah, we did.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
I thought it was like an audio issue.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
We don't have to do it a third time at all.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
We can really power it through at this point.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Okay.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
These are the updates I know about each of you.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Amir, you got a horrible haircut.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
You said I think it looks fine.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Yeah, it's fine.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
I think it's, came out well.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
It's my best haircut yet.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Loki fishing for compliments.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Do you really think it's just fine?

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
You've got like a thing sticking up in the back.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Yeah, that's more of the headphones.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
It's sort of like a David Young haircut.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
I would say.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Was that supposed to mean short on the side a little longer on top?

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Millions of people have that haircut.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Why specifically David?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
I don't know.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
He sort of salt and pepper to what you have.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Okay, that's not a haircut.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
We're just aging.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah, what is it about all you college humor guys?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
We're like, we're all 40.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
I thought you were 39.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Yeah, but I'm sort of easing my way into it by calling it home right now.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Sort of like, um, I'm telling you all the guys.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
I'm telling all you guys all the bad things about me so that you can't

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
resty all about it later.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Hmm.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Kind of like how Jeff like constantly makes one of his thin angles.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
It's like, yeah.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Not like it's the mic.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Tell these guys something they don't know about me.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
You know.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Grayson.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Uh, it didn't gray.

02:55.000 --> 03:11.000
No, this is some bitter sweet news.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Sad news for fans of Ferris.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Ferris has to, has decided to step away from the show.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
But instead is going to be Grayson-wise editing not only the video,

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
but the audio.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Huge.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
We should like exit an audio visual.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Oh.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
It would have been good to have him on this episode.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
I invited him.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
He didn't respond.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
He's busy.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Uh, and then Marieka, you have.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
You have the clap.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
No.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I have NBC's The Slap.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Slow media.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
No.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
You girl got COVID.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
I'm currently has it.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Which is why I'm hiding in my room.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I'm trying so hard.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
How's your timeline been like from the day you were symptomatic until today?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Boy, boy.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
Uh, symptomatic day one tested.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Negative with a home test.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
Second day tested negative with a home test was about to leave to go to physical therapy.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
And I was like, I think I have a fever.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Uh, I took my temperature.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I did have a fever.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Went to get a PCR test.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
That was positive.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
And then the next day I was positive with a home test.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Interesting.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
So it took the PCR to sort of make the home test aware enough to.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Yeah.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
So the viral load wasn't high enough yet.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
So the PCR caught it.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
And then what day was the worst in relation to those?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Did it get worse after that?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
That that PCR test day was the worst.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
And then it's been better ever since.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Oh, yeah.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
I was like two days bad.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Like feverish and that sort of thing.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
But my symptoms have been pretty mild.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Otherwise.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
And I'm I'm glad.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
I guess that it happened right after I got home from my trip.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
I was too during it.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Wow.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I would have been.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:19.000
And the like I left anticipating that I would have to test to get back into the US.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
And then on the trip they got rid of that thing.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
So that's good.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Yeah.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
I guess I'm not good.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Glad it all.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
I can't do it.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
By the way, Morgan anything you need.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Anything you need at all.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I'm your guy.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Okay.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
She's pretty much feeling better.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Yeah.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I'm pretty.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Yeah.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
It is really thoughtful.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
I, you know, I've a roommate that she went and got me some candy yesterday.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
So she needs her out.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I can arrange that.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
I don't think so.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Okay.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
I don't know how you would arrange it or why.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
But I'm pretty good.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
Set them up with someone irisistable.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
Suddenly they have to go over to their house.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
They're having a great time.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
She could have second and second and second and second.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
She's scared.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
And they're very yeast in fiction otherwise.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
They're away from you.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
And I think so.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Great.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
It's in Credgeless.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Yeah.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Like deep.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
This book in Gray Center.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
No, absolutely not.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
This is all going out.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
And I could take this.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Exactly.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Executive decision.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Yeah.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Now it's.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
It's Grayson cut this out.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
They add school.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Yeah.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
That doesn't really have a good ring to it.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
It doesn't.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
But I didn't want to say that.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
We've got a lot to get to today.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
First of all.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
What about the Sheesh audio.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
But yeast.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Could be something to add to the summer.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Remember the yeast.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Sure.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
That's definitely still on sale.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
From.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Where.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Drawful game.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
It's like the drawing of Barney.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
What the fuck is wrong with us.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
This is actively in the store.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
You're saying people can buy this.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
And they have.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
They for sure.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Oh, it's on sale.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Yeah.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I had to mark it down at this point.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Yeah.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
When was the last time someone bought that?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Can you verify that?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Yeah.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
I'll look.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
You talk Jeff.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
I'm doing this.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Yeah.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
I guess the first thing to talk about.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Specifically a mirror.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
But everybody I'd love you guys to thoughts.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Uh.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
What uniform is carrier?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Been going to be in.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Come.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
September.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Marika.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Uh, yeah.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
I saw that Instagram post.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Uh.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
And I assumed it meant he was going to be in a.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
A Portland.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Beautiful.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Okay.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
That's a solid guess.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I mean, it's definitely not happening.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
And I think you're thinking of something else.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
But it's an interesting theory.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Cool.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Yeah.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Yeah.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Oh, I was thinking of.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
David Miller.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Yeah.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Yeah.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Um, I think he suits up for the leaders.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Yeah.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Just because you you're a huge Kyrie fan.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
You also want him to be on the lake.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
Or so you're just sort of willing it into existence or something.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Uh, well, woe was reporting this morning.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Specifically that this will be outdated by the time the episode comes out.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Obviously.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
We'll be notified by the time it comes out.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Yeah.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
But let's hear this week-old.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Pregnostication.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
So you guys can hold this accountable.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
I feel like well, woe said that Kyrie's now trying to get his way to the lake.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Right.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
And I.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
I don't know, man.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
It's just sort of a gut feeling.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
He'd have to take a 30 million dollar pay cut.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
He doesn't care about cash.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
He's selling his deal with Nike.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Uh-huh.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
He's sourd his relationship with the nets.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Leaving $17 million on the table.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Right.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
He's someone bought the shirt on Friday.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
No.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Ha ha ha.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
Three days ago somebody bought that yeast shirt.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
A shout out of it.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Actually, I'm Alan John.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Congrats.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Wow.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Congrats.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
A crown owner of a yeast tea.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
I cut so deep.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Not even eye.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I understand the reference.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
So I'm here.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Do you think he sticks with the nets?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
I do.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
I think he's just threatening to leave.

09:45.000 --> 09:55.000
So that they give him the most amount of money and ultimately he'll stay.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Okay.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
This was in the news today.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Kim Kardashian.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
Why does her skims body suit crutches for sister Chloe?

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Quote your lucky day.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
It's so rude.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Chloe, you would be so proud.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
I'm in a full skim's shapewear meeting.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
And guys, we're making the vagina part in the body suit thicker.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Wider.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Good for her.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
But don't this is a weird way of,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
uh, yeah, just for you, Chloe, widening it.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
This is so rude.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
It was really funny.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Maybe she's been complaining about it for a while.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
So it's not like, hey, you're just a wider vagina girl

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
that I know.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Yeah.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Hold on.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
So you know you guys make fun of me for having a bigger vagina than most.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Question mark.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Nobody replies to that.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Anyway.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
And it's amazing.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
But it's just a sliver.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
The vagina needs a little bit more fabric, just a little wider.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.000
Um, Grace, and what are your thoughts in terms of

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
volvic width?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Yeah.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Why?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Yeah.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Great.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Honestly, my first thought.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
My first thought was, uh,

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
do you actually use Apple news?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Okay, boomer.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Nice.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
God.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Everybody.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Everybody.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
God.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
God.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
God.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
I.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
I started using Apple news because Google knows.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
You're so loud.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
You're yelling.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
Either lower the mic, relax a little bit.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
I did turn my volume down right as you said that.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
You feel threatened or something.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
It's an aggregate.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
So I don't have to scroll through all the separate news stories and

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
sites to find nonsense for this show.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Um, remember RSS aggregators.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
That was like a big thing in the early odds.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Remember when Jake and in your videos got millions of views?

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Oh, my God.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
What are the numbers like on a fire for you now?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Don't tell them.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Yeah, well, I mean, less than a million.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Obviously, just.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
It's not really fair to compare.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Podcast of video.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
All right.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Well, you do a video podcast.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Yeah.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
No way.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
No way.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
It's just that these were, you know,

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
it's like early TV, like even like the,

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
the fourth show got 30 million viewers per episode.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Like Murphy Brown or something.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
You can't compare that to today because there's just so many options.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Remember, and back to the future, too.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
And if it's like, let's go to channel 600 and 11, 126.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
And everyone's like, holy shit.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Imagine having that many channels in the future.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Yeah, we're here.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
We have that many channels.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
If I want to watch Spectrum sports.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
And I have to go to three 18.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Like that's just.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
We're over saturated.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
So to say that podcast doesn't get a million views.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
No.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
And you're right.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
I mean, I get that like it goes with that saying that we're in a

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
changing media landscape.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
But I'm trying to say is there still must see TV.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
You know what I mean?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Like everybody wants to see succession.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Everybody wants to see you for yet.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
You're not it.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
You're not it.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
So that's all I was saying.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Yeah.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Yeah.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Neither you must see.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Yeah.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
But you're musty.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Yeah.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
That was nice.

13:53.000 --> 14:00.000
You just sort of you talked about Chloe Kardashian's vagina.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
And then made fun of me for a little bit.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Oh, this is interesting.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Been getting into a morrow recently.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Nice.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
What is that?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
That was good.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
I said nice.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Amarrow's good.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
This is a morrow, no, no, no.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Which I believe is derived from hazelnuts.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
It's sort of a sweeter thing.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
That's cool, man.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
It's great.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
You obviously have an open the bottle.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
So you're not getting into it.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
So it's a give you a gift.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
This is the first episode where I've genuinely felt uncomfortable.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
I've forget that word recording.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
I will eat your ass.

14:49.000 --> 14:58.000
Grayson, let's get an update on your cock.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
What did I just say?

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
You said you're uncomfortable.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
So I was trying to laugh.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Yeah.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Okay.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Let me rephrase.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
When was the last time you thought to yourself?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I'm about to die.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Never.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Really?

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
When was the last time you thought that to yourself?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Friday.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Is that you're going to die?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Dive into that.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Yeah.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Sorry.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
But Grayson, can you edit in Brad Singh?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Was he?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Four weeks ago.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Yeah.

15:41.000 --> 15:48.000
What is your guy's favorite memory year-to-date?

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
That's what I have written here.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Like, since January 1st.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
Yes.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
How about top golf with the homies?

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Going fucking yard.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
Look at this stroke.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Great.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
Here's referencing us playing top golf on the headgum retreat in May.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Oh, no.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
I went again with my cousins last weekend.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
That's what I was.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
It was really awesome.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
It was fun.

16:26.000 --> 16:33.000
Because it wasn't any of the nasty competition that kind of created this black cloud over the entire

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
All-ance.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Katie, I must push you off the edge.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Yes.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
On the top row.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
She sort of was urged to tackle me off the third story of the top golf.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
And she did it like in a fake way, but I almost slipped off.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
And so when I went with my cousins, we did the bottom row.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
And it felt stable emotionally, physically.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
And my stroke felt the lot better.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
So I would say that was my highlight.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
My low light.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I don't know if we're doing that yet.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
And yeah.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Sure.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Yeah.

17:15.000 --> 17:22.000
A lot of times during the oxide I felt uttered.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Let's leave it at that.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
But I was alienated to a fault.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
I feel like.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Mom's gone.

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
Hard for an off site for your own company to feel.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Yeah.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Just like separated.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Oftentimes you guys would go places.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
And I would have to over like trailing behind the bus.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
The party bus.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Just no, a lot of time in your room.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Darken there.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Yeah.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
And we saw right.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
We all want to get snacks.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
We just saw you sitting in the hot tub at 3 a.m.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.800
Yeah, alone. It was off. It was you're wearing a rash guard

18:02.720 --> 18:08.120
Attached to a buggy board that was in the pool just in case a party

18:09.560 --> 18:17.240
Also your bold vision we did this workshop where we wrote our bold visions which is like, you know goals that you have in a paragraph format

18:17.240 --> 18:19.240
You're just really dark

18:20.240 --> 18:22.240
Your goals are so low

18:22.240 --> 18:27.280
I did a bold vision. I did an underlined vision. I did an italicized vision

18:27.280 --> 18:31.560
I did visions of all sorts of upper and lower case

18:31.560 --> 18:37.080
I just went sort of stream of conscious than slash ham on that shit and some of it

18:37.080 --> 18:39.960
Yeah, it was sort of the bar was low like I just wanted to

18:40.960 --> 18:45.600
Sleep once a day. Yeah, you said you wanted to try key. You should give it another chance

18:47.240 --> 18:49.240
easy come easy go

18:49.680 --> 18:53.200
What I'm curious what

18:54.880 --> 19:00.240
What your guys is highlights of the year have been feel like I'm co-opting the entire segment. I don't mean

19:03.800 --> 19:05.800
Grayson

19:05.800 --> 19:18.960
I haven't thought of a joke answer yet, so my just honest sincere answer is my friends wedding that I went to on January 15

19:20.240 --> 19:25.480
That's nice, but that was really early in the year. So it was it was in Ohio in January

19:25.760 --> 19:29.720
Wow, they must have gotten a great deal. I'm looking that was a Tuesday, right?

19:36.120 --> 19:41.040
That's fun how is Cincinnati in the winter he's from Columbus

19:42.600 --> 19:43.880
What's sorry?

19:44.840 --> 19:49.840
Taking your headphone off won't make you hear me more. What's weird is that I actually

19:49.840 --> 19:55.320
I had said Ohio, but I was in Cincinnati, so it is weird to you knew that

19:57.880 --> 20:04.920
Hey, hey to give him a little wind for that. Yeah, um, my

20:06.920 --> 20:12.160
What was what was the wording of the question? What was your highlight of the of the

20:12.240 --> 20:17.760
Okay, highlight of the year to date. I lit of the year to date. My highlight of the year to date. Probably

20:18.480 --> 20:21.760
vacation I just got back from which no one has asked me about

20:23.920 --> 20:25.920
Which is fine

20:27.920 --> 20:29.920
Oh

20:33.440 --> 20:41.840
That was really fun. So we all know I successfully went to the 24 hours of Le Mans as I said that I would

20:42.800 --> 20:47.200
Um, had a great time just watching cars

20:49.040 --> 20:56.160
They're very loud and when you camp close to the track they just go around all night and are super

20:56.160 --> 20:58.160
super loud, so that's fun

20:58.720 --> 21:04.160
Did you sleep? I did sleep. I slept a little bit on the actual race day

21:05.200 --> 21:09.040
And then what I did not know about Francis that it gets

21:10.000 --> 21:15.840
Dark at 11 p.m. for some insane reason. Is that true? Like yes

21:16.720 --> 21:18.720
It's very far north

21:19.120 --> 21:21.760
But like I don't know. I guess like I've been to

21:22.640 --> 21:27.200
London as further north and I don't feel like I've experienced that there

21:27.760 --> 21:30.720
But I guess you were the longest day of the year

21:31.600 --> 21:36.720
Yeah, that's true, but it got dark at like 11 and got light at like

21:37.600 --> 21:40.320
530 in the morning and in a tent

21:41.360 --> 21:48.240
It that meant as soon as it hit like midnight it was freezing cold and then I seen as it got light out

21:48.400 --> 21:54.000
The sun was just beating down on the tent and it was super hot, so that was fun, but I did manage to sleep

21:55.280 --> 21:57.280
And it was a pretty nice tent

21:57.840 --> 22:03.520
And Michael Fassbender didn't die, which was great. So happy for him. He finished the race

22:03.520 --> 22:05.520
And finally that he did race

22:07.040 --> 22:09.040
So like the

22:09.040 --> 22:15.840
Drivers or in teams of three basically and on his team he's like the bronze drivers like the lowest level

22:16.320 --> 22:22.880
And bronze drivers were required to do six hours in the car and he did six hours in one minute

22:22.880 --> 22:24.880
And they were like everybody else

22:27.120 --> 22:33.200
So he didn't actually like he wasn't the one that crossed the finish line, but he didn't die, which is great

22:33.840 --> 22:39.760
I did what or I kind of witnessed him crash in a way that was not as small

22:39.760 --> 22:45.280
So when crashed into him and like a corner that I was by so I like ran over there to see

22:46.320 --> 22:51.360
But he had like already escaped the gravel trap by that point and gone back to the pit lane

22:51.680 --> 22:57.520
You were on for a couple weeks. It felt like the majority of majority of it was you like testing the limits on how close

22:57.520 --> 23:02.400
You could get to the track. You were on the grid at one point. I was doing the grid

23:03.600 --> 23:11.920
Yeah, I'm Friday at Le Mans. They had a pit walk so you could like walk through the pit lane

23:12.480 --> 23:17.920
Which is really cool and then they also just like open up the entire track and so people were like biking

23:18.320 --> 23:22.560
The eight miles around it and I saw some people running when they're crazy for that

23:24.640 --> 23:26.640
But then at the end of the race

23:26.640 --> 23:30.560
You could go on and watch the podium ceremony. So I friend and I like

23:31.120 --> 23:37.920
Got to a gate in time and got like a pretty good spot watching podium ceremony and then we were like

23:38.560 --> 23:42.880
Before we got there we were talking to the people that ran our campsite and we're like so

23:43.840 --> 23:48.560
Do you guys have buses running back to the campsite after the race and they were like no

23:48.880 --> 23:50.880
We were like how are we supposed to get back

23:52.720 --> 23:59.840
Because it's like a 45 minute walk like out of the like main park area back to the campground

24:00.560 --> 24:04.880
And then they were like you can just walk along the track and back to the campsite

24:04.880 --> 24:06.880
So like our campsite was on

24:07.680 --> 24:13.120
One of the like viewing points in the track and so we truly just like walked backwards

24:13.440 --> 24:18.160
That's cool. Yeah, it was fun and it was like the part of the track we hadn't seen so that was cool

24:19.120 --> 24:24.560
Yeah, I got pretty close to the tire wall. I found some pieces of car on the ground

24:26.240 --> 24:27.600
Yeah, I took one

24:27.680 --> 24:29.680
Like weird carbon fiber

24:29.680 --> 24:31.680
I took an entire wheel

24:33.120 --> 24:39.280
Someone I think so that basically the same thing happened at the formula one race and it was like someone

24:40.960 --> 24:46.960
I think truly took some piece of a car like they found a really large like

24:47.600 --> 24:52.880
I don't know like axel type thing. I don't know. I just saw someone carrying like a huge piece of

24:53.840 --> 25:01.040
And legal yeah people were like ripping off signs like an exit sign from the track. This was a riot

25:02.240 --> 25:04.240
It was like truly insane

25:05.200 --> 25:12.880
I don't have any pictures but like at the podium ceremony for the Canadian grimpe people were like climbing on the fence

25:14.320 --> 25:16.000
To watch

25:16.960 --> 25:21.360
But they were just like sitting on this like super tall fence and like a super crowded

25:23.200 --> 25:25.200
Find the photo

25:25.200 --> 25:32.880
Do you say you like the crowd France more French Canada more? I think I like French Canada more

25:34.320 --> 25:40.640
Wow, that's crazy. Yeah, like French Canada more. I don't know. I I

25:41.600 --> 25:42.640
I

25:42.640 --> 25:50.320
I got really tired of France really fast. I didn't have a good time eating in France because I don't eat red meat and I don't like raw cheese

25:51.680 --> 25:59.200
I unmelted cheese so that really puts a damper on a lot of French cuisine and

26:01.920 --> 26:03.920
That was rough

26:03.920 --> 26:06.720
No, I mean Paris was fine. I was

26:06.720 --> 26:08.720
Was fine

26:09.440 --> 26:11.440
It's no luxury

26:11.440 --> 26:13.440
Paris is fine

26:15.040 --> 26:21.920
A lot of it was a lot of fun. I just the last day I was there. I was definitely my worst day and I got

26:23.440 --> 26:30.000
I got ridiculed by two people about my drink orders, which was what were your drink orders?

26:30.400 --> 26:32.400
All right, so I weigh a lot here

26:32.720 --> 26:34.720
And why

26:34.720 --> 26:38.080
Here's what this is the day you got COVID. Do you think that lasted no?

26:39.200 --> 26:48.320
This was and this was in Paris and then I was and I think I got COVID from Montreal airport because of flight delays and having this at there for seven hours

26:49.840 --> 26:52.800
But so on our last day in Paris

26:53.760 --> 27:02.160
I went to a coffee shop that I saw I had one iced coffee to oat milk rare to find in a coffee shop in Paris

27:02.240 --> 27:08.000
So I was like great. I will ask for an iced coffee with oat milk and they won't be mad at me or confused

27:08.960 --> 27:11.040
And so I did I paid for it sat down

27:11.600 --> 27:13.600
Lady brought

27:13.600 --> 27:20.560
iced coffee without it was oat milk in it over to me and said something really fast kind of in French about the coffee

27:21.600 --> 27:25.360
I tasted it it was fine. I was like can I get that oat milk?

27:26.320 --> 27:33.200
The barista turned around to me. He was like I can give you the oat milk, but it's going to cover up the flavors of the coffee

27:36.160 --> 27:43.360
Yeah, that's the point. I'm from America. I know how to drink. It's like I'd still like it, please

27:43.920 --> 27:47.520
But then I was like I definitely can't put sugar in this which I would have done

27:49.040 --> 27:52.720
How tell you ruin these these beautiful bitter flavor

27:53.680 --> 27:56.000
So that was crazy

27:57.360 --> 28:07.200
And then the end of that day I told my friend that I would eat Indian food or Italian food because we'd been eating like a lot of like Asian cuisine

28:08.560 --> 28:15.440
And for some reason he picked a french restaurant so it was french restaurant where I could have two items on the menu

28:15.840 --> 28:22.560
And I ordered an apparel spritz and the way truss was like oh, we don't have that

28:22.560 --> 28:28.720
Like we don't have touristy drinks like that on the menu. I could look to a compari soda and it's like looking at an

28:29.360 --> 28:35.600
Entire full bar and I was like do you have anything new drink and then and she was like no, like we don't make cocktails and I was like

28:36.560 --> 28:39.920
I can see sharp truss behind you. What do you mean?

28:40.720 --> 28:43.920
Also compari soda is basically an apparel spritz

28:44.960 --> 28:51.760
Okay, so you just don't have apparel. You have a line seller so clearly you probably have pressed that kind of like don't be mad

28:53.600 --> 28:55.600
It was nuts

28:55.600 --> 28:58.560
And I like joking. It was like I can't wait to get up this country

28:59.040 --> 29:01.040
My friend took me very seriously

29:02.960 --> 29:07.120
But yeah, so that was that was my last date France so I had had enough with them in there

29:07.440 --> 29:09.120
Tudes

29:09.120 --> 29:13.200
Otherwise everyone was perfectly lovely. How close did you get to drivers?

29:13.920 --> 29:15.920
I got pretty close

29:16.720 --> 29:18.720
There was a drivers parade

29:20.160 --> 29:25.840
On the Friday before the race where they like sit in old cars and get driven around the town of Laman

29:26.960 --> 29:28.960
And so my friend and I went to that

29:30.240 --> 29:33.040
And we're like standing by the route

29:33.840 --> 29:40.160
Pretty close to Michael Fassbender didn't it's crazy. They also like threw things at people like they

29:40.160 --> 29:43.440
You're like little souvenirs and stuff and like t-shirts

29:44.480 --> 29:48.160
And hats like a fast-bender corner and you and throwing a tire

29:52.160 --> 29:55.440
Did they ever call a Michael Fender bender because of the

29:56.240 --> 30:02.080
Car accidents city was rear ended at one point also said he wasn't that bad was he Michael fast-bender

30:02.640 --> 30:09.200
Nice very good. Here's here's some good by far by the way. That's like a is that a Dodge Challenger

30:11.840 --> 30:13.840
It's a Volkswagen jetter

30:14.640 --> 30:18.320
It's a much it's absolutely a Mustang so chill out

30:18.960 --> 30:20.960
Holy shit

30:22.800 --> 30:24.800
We have to take a break on that note

30:25.200 --> 30:28.800
I was this is just for ads. It's not for anything else. Yeah, oh

30:34.640 --> 30:39.840
Guys lately I've been listening to a lot of French rock from the 60s

30:40.400 --> 30:46.640
All right, it's been great and one of the reasons why it's been great to listen to is because I listen to it on my

30:46.640 --> 30:49.360
Raycon wireless earbuds

30:50.320 --> 30:56.160
Raycon's every day earbuds look feel and sound better than ever with optimized

30:56.240 --> 31:01.920
Gel tips for the perfect in-ear fit these earbuds are incredibly comfortable and they will not budge

31:01.920 --> 31:08.640
All right trust me. I've started putting them in under my helmet on my new moped scooter and they haven't fallen at least

31:08.720 --> 31:10.720
They haven't fallen at all

31:10.720 --> 31:16.160
Raycon's offer three sound profiles to match whatever you're listening to plus noise isolation and awareness mode

31:16.240 --> 31:23.200
So you can choose to be immersed in sound or be able to hear your surroundings when you need to i.e. riding a scooter

31:24.320 --> 31:27.360
I have used other wireless earbuds these do not

31:28.000 --> 31:32.800
They don't even come close to Raycon's Raycon's are unbelievable. They're also much cheaper

31:33.200 --> 31:37.040
I don't know about you guys, but I lose things all the time sunglasses ear buds

31:37.040 --> 31:44.560
It's at or anything small and loose. I'm gonna lose them and Raycon's offer better audio quality for less

31:45.120 --> 31:49.840
Money Raycon's give you eight hours of playtime and a 32-hour battery life

31:50.080 --> 31:53.840
Then when you need to charge it. It's super easy. You can even charge it wirelessly

31:54.400 --> 32:00.160
And this is a huge selling point again as message mentioned Raycon's give you the same

32:00.880 --> 32:04.000
Audio quality as other premium brands at half the price

32:04.560 --> 32:10.000
Literally again. I've lost other ear buds and I've also lost my Raycon's and

32:10.320 --> 32:13.360
Replacing them doesn't hurt as much with Raycon

32:14.080 --> 32:17.520
But that doesn't mean they won't last all right. I've seen people talking about their Raycon's

32:17.840 --> 32:23.200
Falling three stories getting lost in rain and snow storms and still working afterwards

32:23.520 --> 32:29.040
It's no wonder why Raycon's every day earbuds have over 49,000 five-star reviews online

32:29.280 --> 32:34.080
So check out Raycon's wireless earbuds. My guess is gonna leave them a five-star review too

32:52.160 --> 32:54.160
How's that

32:55.840 --> 33:02.800
Rico is just telling us that she was in Paris at the same time as Riley in the same cemetery at pair of shoes

33:03.360 --> 33:05.360
But you didn't see each other

33:06.320 --> 33:08.320
And we I think like I

33:09.040 --> 33:17.440
Because she was on vacation with her mom and I was like I think I'm going to the cemetery and some other places and she was like oh, I think I'm going there too

33:18.800 --> 33:24.640
But then we only found out after that we were there the same time but it would have been

33:25.200 --> 33:32.400
Definitely would have been really hard to find someone in there. It's like super the map was bad and it was confusing

33:33.360 --> 33:38.880
But it would have been adorable if we had like turned with a corner at a grave and then saw each other

33:38.880 --> 33:41.760
That would have been crazy. Yeah, little Adam Rafe

33:43.280 --> 33:45.280
You're in grave danger

33:45.520 --> 33:47.520
Welcome to late debates

33:48.480 --> 33:53.200
This is a new series that I'm thinking of starting where we debate things that have already been settled

But the answer is not a question and shouldn't be a question, you know, I mean

38:49.040 --> 38:52.160

It's a little too broad

40:09.120 --> 40:12.560
What is how Grayson gets to his date at the 10-minute museum?

40:13.440 --> 40:15.440
Um

40:15.440 --> 40:18.960
I'm your run-it-you get an answer and then the closer one I'll give it to one of you guys

40:19.680 --> 40:24.000
What is the way Grayson began one of his fallies?

40:24.880 --> 40:28.880
I'll give it to a mirror. It's what does Grayson do when he has a little too much wine?

40:32.560 --> 40:35.360
Sorry, I'll do a lake

40:36.480 --> 40:41.280
No, I'll do Grayson's fallies for 300 since we're in this near the 10-minute museum

40:44.400 --> 40:48.320
Where does Grayson vomit from drinking too much wine?

40:49.600 --> 40:51.600
You're overthinking it

40:52.160 --> 40:56.720
I'm adequately where does Grayson want to live?

40:57.280 --> 41:01.280
That's correct. Wow. Where did Grayson initially try to move?

41:02.000 --> 41:06.960
Nice. Uh, Maria can control the board Grayson. You're really bringing up the rear here.

41:07.600 --> 41:10.000
Oh, I thought I was team one. Your team too.

41:13.280 --> 41:18.640
Let's go, cook outside. It's for 200. Cook outside. It's for 200 board gravy.

41:22.240 --> 41:24.720
What is the optimal sauce?

41:26.480 --> 41:30.960
I'll give you that one. It's what Thanksgiving side is primed for a summer resurgence.

41:31.920 --> 41:37.440
Maria can control the board pulling away with 700. Yeah, let's go cook outside. It's for 100.

41:37.440 --> 41:40.320
Potatoes all that home. Jesus.

41:45.600 --> 41:49.600
What would be a bad cook outside? Because they're too high.

41:49.920 --> 41:58.240
She's almost the inverse of the correct answer. What is the perfect side? Correct. What hot

41:58.240 --> 42:03.920
Yam dish is perfect for summer days? Not a Yam dish. Spud then, whatever.

42:03.920 --> 42:08.880
Ricky can control the board. Whatever. 800. Whatever is right. What you did is wrong.

42:09.440 --> 42:21.760
Wow. Wow. Let's go. Lake getaways for 200. Lake getaways for 200. No.

42:24.480 --> 42:31.680
What is my answer when Jeff asks if I want to go to Lake Tahoe for the summer?

42:39.360 --> 42:49.440
Ah, sucks. Lake getaways. No. What would, um, why is it good to see a lake?

42:52.160 --> 42:58.320
What would I just see a lake? What are these answers?

43:00.560 --> 43:06.720
Well, the answer is no, which is really broad. Real question is what question is no?

43:09.200 --> 43:20.560
Why? What is a sea getaway? A lake getaway. I'll give you that one. Is silver lake the

43:20.560 --> 43:29.600
neighborhood in LA? A lake getaway. Grayson controls the board. Lake getaways for 100.

43:29.600 --> 43:44.000
Lake getaways for 100. San Diego. What is an impossible place to have a lake getaway? Correct.

43:44.000 --> 43:50.240
What Southern California wet metropolitan is not a lake getaway? A mere controls the board.

43:51.280 --> 43:53.520
I somehow feel worse when I get it right.

43:53.840 --> 44:03.280
That being said, I'm absolutely ready to dominate Sunning your asshole for 100.

44:04.160 --> 44:08.880
Spreading your cheeks beneath the daylight. What is Sunning your asshole?

44:11.120 --> 44:16.560
Correct. More specifically, what is the best way to absorb vitamin D? Amir?

44:17.120 --> 44:24.640
Let's go. Sunning your asshole. Positive. Five, forty, four am. What is the earliest time to start

44:24.640 --> 44:31.840
Sunning your asshole? That's correct. A mere answer. Yeah. Wow.

44:33.680 --> 44:38.800
When is the absolute? In France, you could do earlier. That's right. That's why the

44:38.800 --> 44:44.800
French are so well healthy. Let's finish it up for the full sweep. Sunning that ass.

44:46.240 --> 44:58.480
Sun his asshole. What did Grayson do at a lake retreat? Getaway forever.

44:59.120 --> 45:08.560
Dye. My only guess is that Amir is in the answer. Oh.

45:11.920 --> 45:18.400
I bet this will have something to do with the Supreme Court. What did Jeff do at the beach?

45:18.480 --> 45:22.800
Wow. It's what is Jeff going to do at the office tomorrow?

45:23.920 --> 45:32.080
That's not. Marie can't believe the 1100 amir in second place with 700 still time and Grayson,

45:32.080 --> 45:40.320
you're pretty much out of the game. But he won many on the board. Marie. Let's go somewhere

45:40.320 --> 45:45.680
night with your boo for 300. Summer night with your boo for 300. Watching the fireworks on the

45:45.680 --> 46:08.160
4th of July. What is a bad way to stay? What is a good way to spend? What can't you do

46:08.160 --> 46:18.080
in France with your boo? Because they don't celebrate American Independence Day abroad. Final answer.

46:19.520 --> 46:24.480
The great answer is what will Jeff be doing the next time he experiences erectile dysfunction?

46:25.040 --> 46:31.360
Why do you have the date planned? It's not that I have the date planned. It's just that fireworks

46:31.360 --> 46:36.080
really make me nervous. They put me in my head for sure. Grayson controls the board.

46:36.480 --> 46:42.160
Lake getaways for 300. Lake getaways for 300. Tahoe. What's a lake?

46:44.160 --> 46:51.520
What's more? He was so certain you said it's so fast. I was really eager.

46:52.400 --> 47:12.400
What is the... What is the... Where did Jeff sun his ass and have a wet day at?

47:14.960 --> 47:17.520
I'll come on the other question. The other answer for Jeff.

47:17.520 --> 47:20.480
Where is Jeff going to be watching fireworks?

47:21.760 --> 47:25.280
Correct answer is what Chevy SUV is reminiscent of a lake getaway?

47:25.280 --> 47:30.880
Looking great. Crazy that I didn't get those points. Last one. Drive up to make out point.

47:32.640 --> 47:37.680
Where? Make out point. That was my answer.

47:38.320 --> 47:48.400
I'll just... Hmm. That's close. Wow.

47:48.960 --> 47:57.280
Don't yon. Is that a taming socks? It's suck. It's impossible to win or lose.

47:58.800 --> 48:02.800
I'm winning though. Yeah. It is possible to win.

48:03.120 --> 48:07.440
I'm a plus side at least. He's not doing negative points for wrong answers,

48:07.440 --> 48:13.680
which is how the game jeopardy works. That's your... See that cabby art tab again.

48:15.600 --> 48:20.800
Yeah, I'd love to know what we're planning on ordering. I was considering... Anassai.

48:21.760 --> 48:28.240
Actually, I hadn't looked at all. Listen, there's only one left. I don't know why you guys are dragging

48:28.320 --> 48:33.440
your face. I answered. What did you say? I said a way or question.

48:36.320 --> 48:42.640
What's a weird place for Jeff's parents to drive him on his birthday?

48:45.680 --> 48:50.480
I'll give you that one. I guess we're looking for what's something Jeff won't do this summer.

48:52.800 --> 48:58.000
Holy shit. This is interesting. Mariko one. Why is that interesting?

48:58.400 --> 49:04.800
Thank you. Thank you. That was Jeopardy!

49:08.000 --> 49:09.760
Instantly happy about how it went.

49:14.800 --> 49:19.600
As long as timeless, absolute banger.

49:29.200 --> 49:32.400
Plugs. What do you guys have going on? What do you want to point the people to?

49:32.400 --> 49:33.920
Mariko, let's start with you because you have to leave.

49:37.200 --> 49:42.320
Follow me on social media, on Twitter, Instagram, letterboxed, at Marie K-Lon.

49:43.920 --> 49:53.120
We've got a new show on the head commit work, which is taking Cheryl's true story. Check it out.

49:53.120 --> 49:58.640
Love Cheryl Heinz. Yeah, really exciting. Happy to have them aboard.

50:00.480 --> 50:04.400
Obviously, it's a show that are existed so you can listen to a bunch of episodes already.

50:04.400 --> 50:10.160
Are they going to record out of the office? I don't think so, but I don't know for sure.

50:10.160 --> 50:16.480
Maybe occasionally. He's so sick. I'd love to. Is Cheryl Heinz single?

50:17.440 --> 50:20.000
We don't have time for this, but that's all.

50:20.000 --> 50:29.440
She's dating a very to a Kennedy. You are probably the polar opposite.

50:30.560 --> 50:37.840
I mean, that's a good thing. She's a scaredist. Pull a caveat again.

50:38.160 --> 50:42.880
But yeah, that's my, that's my plug.

50:45.600 --> 50:47.360
There's no way this guy's good in bed.

50:49.840 --> 50:51.680
Jeff is like a girl.

50:55.680 --> 50:57.200
I mean, there's just no way.

51:02.240 --> 51:02.880
Grayson?

51:08.800 --> 51:19.040
What? There's no way this guy's. Grayson, come on. Are we going to have two recording files now?

51:19.040 --> 51:21.760
Yep. There'll be, where it is one.

51:22.640 --> 51:31.600
All right. Yeah, plugs just Google search the name Grayson and follow whatever link comes up first.

51:32.640 --> 51:34.080
I'd love to know, actually.

51:34.720 --> 51:35.360
We wouldn't fall.

51:36.480 --> 51:40.640
Been working on a new smile, bottom teeth only. Bad.

51:44.320 --> 51:49.360
Sort of elongates my face in a way that it's more traditionally handsome.

51:50.240 --> 51:54.400
What do you want people to do with that information? Oh, follow me on Twitter.

51:55.760 --> 51:57.360
Of course. With it.

51:58.320 --> 51:59.360
Get away.

52:01.840 --> 52:05.040
You can follow me on Twitter at Jeff Boyardee. We'll see you guys again next week.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.200
Until next Mr. Potato Head.

52:14.640 --> 52:15.360
And cetera.

52:15.840 --> 52:17.840
Yeah.

52:21.840 --> 52:23.040
We should probably cut the um,

52:25.440 --> 52:26.400
not part of the end there.

52:28.560 --> 52:29.760
Which part of it?

52:30.720 --> 52:32.880
Yeah, from the beginning of Jeopardy on.

52:35.840 --> 52:36.880
Jeff, it is pretty good.

52:46.160 --> 52:48.160
Oh, he froze. No, I didn't.

53:08.480 --> 53:10.160
That was a hit dumb original.

53:15.360 --> 53:17.360
You

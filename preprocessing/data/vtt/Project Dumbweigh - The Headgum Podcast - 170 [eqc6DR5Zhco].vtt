WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
No songs?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
Yeah.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Eyes up.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Attention here.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
Yep.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
I'm back from behind the desk.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Why?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
What's that?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Why?

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
I don't know.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
I just thought that it was missing a sort of like...

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Sheen.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Okay.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
I didn't see you touch the cameras at all.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Are you sure we're all in frame?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
We're in frame.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
We're in focus.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
I did all of this before everybody walked in.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
I was on time.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
It was already to go 12 minutes ago.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
And that's when Marieco decided to be late.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I decided to be late because a mirror was late.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
And I thought I had time.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
You let her know that you were late.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
We could have started without you.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
That was the plan.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah, I slept.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah, I slept.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Where did this come from?

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
I slept on in Marieco because I was the only correspondence I had about this show.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
So you didn't know this was happening?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
I did.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
But I forgot.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
And then I got a 10 minute warning.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
And I was in line somewhere else.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
I'm like, oh shit.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Let me slack.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Who slapped me about this show, which was on in Marieco.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
And then I raced over here.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Well, thanks for being here.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Look how nice that was.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Are you recommending yourself?

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
No, I'm saying, look how nice that was that I said thanks for being here.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Oh, yeah.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Because I could just be like, where were you?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
What are you doing?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Well, you could just not address it at all.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Right.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Really?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
So the fact that you're calling it out.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
And then say, look how nice you have to pat.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
You know, I have to pat ties.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Do you think time?

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Do you think the listeners when they start the show,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
they're like, I could tell this started 12 minutes late.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
No, they can't.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
And you feel like you need to address it?

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Well, sometimes we start early.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Okay.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Wow.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Marieco coming in with the heat.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
We also never start early.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
We're always running late.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Just a little bit.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm always here physically, but the shit's not set up.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
So I thought I had like 10 minutes of natural wiggle room,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
but I thought I'd be nice by saying like in LA,

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
if you're five minutes late, you'd be like,

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
if we don't say anything.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
That's just like baked into the DNA of the city.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
I also found that Lanya was on this episode.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
And I was talking to her.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
And that's why I was late.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Because I was like, oh, she's not in there.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
So I shouldn't have to be.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Well, you know, it's all about checking the calendar.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Right?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Because then you know who's going to be where and when and why.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
And how?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Well, I trust her more than you.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Anything to do with the show.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
I don't send the calendar, but she sends the calendar.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
You want to trust her?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
I need to go to trust the calendar.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
We're starting to really understand how the machine gets going.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
We're starting to see the inner workings of the show,

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
the planning of that.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
We've kept it in the gun.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
Casey and I was out of the movie three minutes before I walked out.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
I was walking out of the studio and Jeff said,

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
do you want to be on the show?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Which Casey's like, you shouldn't.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
We should say that.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Casey's icing on the cake.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Yeah.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Allie was supposed to be on the calendar.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Because on you said, what about the return of calm?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Allie's the cake.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Oh, is that what happened?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
That's what the right.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I understand to have happened.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
But I like that.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I'm not the most reliable narrative.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm only asking because on you said I was requested by me.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
I think she says that to every guest.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Because she said that to me won't.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
It's also the only way to be requested.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
It's the only way to be requested.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
That's not true.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
We could be like, what about that one staffer who's like,

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Why do you say smile?

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
You called me a staffer on the Ian Carme.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
I like to think of this fucking network like a political campaign.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Right?

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
And guess who the fucking who's the candidate?

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Me?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
No.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Right.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
It's either me or Cohen.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
And I think that I'm more front facing.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
And I feel like I have a good handshake.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yeah.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
You have a good handshake.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Are you saying it's between you two to be the candidate?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Actually, you're running against it.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
His campaign manager, I think, is Peter.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Who?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Peter MacArthur.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
I guess.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
You guess?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Yep.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I said I guess.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Because I do.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Amir's pissed because I pulled him away from tennis to do this.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
No, I finished tennis.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
I-I-I-I-I-I.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
He's on the calendar.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm on the crew.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
That's true.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
It's not my bad that you forgot.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Yeah.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
In my, like, when this was scheduled, I'm like, okay, I have tennis to ten,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
and then I'll come over here and I'll have plenty.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Did you do that on purpose, tennis to ten?

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
If it was baseball, would you do it at base?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Basis?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
No.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
No.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
I usually play at nine, actually.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Okay.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
You know, yeah.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Tennis, anyone?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
That's pretty good.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
No.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
What about, um, let me a second here.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
We're going to really bring it home.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Um, name a couple of baseball.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Like, you're sorry.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Tennis.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Now you got me saying it.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Uh, maybe a couple of tennis ball brands.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
I know there's prints.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Uh-huh.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I know that there's pen.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
It's the big one.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
We'll send Wilson.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Okay.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
So, what, you know, Kiraeal?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
No.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
You don't Kiraeal?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
No.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Meryka, you got to know Kiraeal, right?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I don't know what that is.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
It's, uh, it didn't even ask Casey.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
No, you wouldn't know.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
I know.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
What is Kiraeal?

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
The number one brand of everywhere.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
What?

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
They're number one in what they do.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Kiraeal is a cocktail.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Yeah.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Uh, champagne and cremdicacese.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Don't, don't, don't.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I can't.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
I can't.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Say that.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
So I'm wondering if there would be uh,

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
cremdicacese and it's champagne and cremdic tinies.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
He keeps crying and things that I say and do.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
The, the US Open already has it.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Let's go to cocktail.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
The honey juice.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
What's the honey juice?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
She's right.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
It's actually been around for 15 years, but for whatever reason,

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
everyone's talking about it this year.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
As if it's like been a week forever and it's like the,

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
yes, gold standard.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
But I haven't heard it before.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
What is it?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
What's in it?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
It's like vodka, honey do.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Two things cremdicacese.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
cremdicinies.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Two honey juice.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Honey do is the worst.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
I like honey do.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
I like honey do.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
It's my favorite.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Melon.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Yeah.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
It's always the one left over.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Oh, really?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Yeah.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
It's always left in the bowl.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
You know, you like, you prefer a cantaloupe.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Don't you do?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
I guess, yeah, but it's like,

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
there are needs to be the astroscope.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
It's good cantaloupe.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Yeah.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
So much of it is made.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
It's filler fruit.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Interesting.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
The cantaloupe is better than most honey do.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Yes.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
I agree.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
But the thing is disagree.

07:01.000 --> 07:01.500
What's that?

07:01.500 --> 07:02.500
I feel like you have coven.

07:02.500 --> 07:15.500
I feel like we're having a game night, and you're zooming in.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.500
I mean, you're like, what did you say?

07:17.500 --> 07:19.500
We can barely hear you.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.500
It's not my fault.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.500
When you send an edible arrangement,

07:23.500 --> 07:26.500
it's often pineapple canaloupe and honey do.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.500
And people go for the pineapple first.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.500
And then if they're still hungry, they'll have the cantaloupe.

07:31.500 --> 07:34.500
And then they'll leave the honey do.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.500
They'll try one honey do to see if it's good honey.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.500
And it never, it never is.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.500
What's good honey do?

07:40.500 --> 07:41.500
Water?

07:41.500 --> 07:42.500
Yeah.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.500
What?

07:44.500 --> 07:46.500
I like honey do.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.500
So I will actually stand for this shit.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.500
Let's hear about why you like honey do.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.500
I also said I like honey do.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.500
And you told me I look like I have coven.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.500
Why are we still talking about it?

07:57.500 --> 07:58.500
Fine.

07:58.500 --> 07:59.500
Let's move on.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.500
I'm fine with that.

08:00.500 --> 08:03.500
Every view of what he says is a weakness.

08:03.500 --> 08:04.500
Okay.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.500
Honey do does not have a weakness.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.500
I think it's weak and flavor.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.500
Yeah.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.500
It's fine.

08:09.500 --> 08:10.500
It's good and flavor.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.500
It's often like, relax and flavor.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.500
It has and juice.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.500
Honey juice.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.500
I just wanted flavorless juice.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.500
I drink water.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.500
That's what I'm saying.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.500
Water is also good.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.500
Water is really good.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.500
Yeah.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.500
Honey do often feels like I'm eating a piece of wine.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.500
Yeah.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.500
That sounds delightful.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.500
I was in the wine.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.500
It's fine.

08:35.500 --> 08:36.500
You know what?

08:36.500 --> 08:37.500
This is good.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.500
Next time I'm with either of you.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.500
You can have my honey do and I won't care.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.500
Exactly right.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.500
Well, we did the shows at Grammar Sea on your birthday.

08:44.500 --> 08:47.500
I did bring you those cookies like we talked about the other week.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.500
And you were pissed that it wasn't rind.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.500
Sure.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.500
It was the rhythm of the rhyme.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.500
The rhyme.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.500
Oh, dude.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.500
I had a ball of rhyme.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.500
I'm housing honey do.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.500
We opened up a new Pandora's mom.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.500
We might have to go with rhymes for the soft MoriP.

09:09.500 --> 09:12.500
I think one more rice song and then I'll record the ten.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.500
I think it's been like nine.

09:14.500 --> 09:15.500
Interesting.

09:15.500 --> 09:16.500
Interesting.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.500
Are you going to pay for three or two?

09:18.500 --> 09:19.500
I want to be.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.500
What's that?

09:20.500 --> 09:21.500
Can I write one?

09:21.500 --> 09:22.500
Sure.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.500
I think you should host another episode because I need a fucking week off.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.500
And don't say, oh, you know, it's the easiest job in the world.

09:28.500 --> 09:33.500
I'm fucking torn apart in front of the public eye every week.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.500
Whether I prepare or not.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.500
Whether I bring something to the table or not.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.500
Sometimes I prepare out the wazoo.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.500
People, you know, kind of shut down in the studio.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.500
Get mad at me for a doxing their address.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.500
Right.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.500
Yeah.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.500
Sometimes I don't prepare anything and it's a hit.

09:49.500 --> 09:52.500
So I think Brink can take the reins for him and tell me.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.500
I wanted to write a song that you would have to sing.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.500
Like you did to me with rice.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.500
So I still have to show up.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.500
Yeah.

09:59.500 --> 10:00.500
Yeah.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.500
All right.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.500
I'm less interested, but we can still do it.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.500
All right.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.500
We talked about this for the same.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.500
Do you guys see this?

10:06.500 --> 10:08.500
I think it's Papa John's commercial.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.500
Or no, little scissors or some shit.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.500
It's one of the main pizza things.

10:11.500 --> 10:12.500
Do you not see this?

10:12.500 --> 10:13.500
I don't know.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.500
That's a commercial for me.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.500
What is it about pizza things?

10:19.500 --> 10:22.500
Have you seen a commercial for a pizza?

10:22.500 --> 10:24.500
I know what he's talking about.

10:24.500 --> 10:25.500
He's talking about a commercial.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.500
Jersey Mike.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.500
Jersey Mike.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.500
Listen to this.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.500
Listen to this.

10:30.500 --> 10:31.500
It is a rhythm.

10:31.500 --> 10:34.500
This is a rhythm by the size.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.500
The size.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.500
Wow.

10:38.500 --> 10:39.500
Wow.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.500
It's like straight in front of you.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.500
Did Jersey Mike's been?

10:42.500 --> 10:44.500
Oh, Danny Davidos in there.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.500
Wow.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.500
Good ear.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.500
Do you hear that?

10:48.500 --> 10:51.500
I mean, do you guys think that they ripped us off?

10:51.500 --> 10:52.500
Yeah.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.500
We got to get Danny in here.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.500
Let's do a deep dive on this.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.500
Talk amongst yourselves.

10:57.500 --> 11:00.500
I'm going to figure out which ad agency did this.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.500
How?

11:01.500 --> 11:02.500
What's that?

11:02.500 --> 11:03.500
How would you possibly?

11:03.500 --> 11:06.500
I think there's that IMDB for commercials, right?

11:06.500 --> 11:07.500
I spot.tv.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.500
Okay.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.500
And then we should be able to figure out who produced it.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.500
And who the?

11:11.500 --> 11:12.500
Hi, dive advertising.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.500
Interesting.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.500
I did that number crunch in 20 seconds.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.500
You said how?

11:17.500 --> 11:18.500
You're such a naysayer, man.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.500
You're like, if it isn't tennis or basketball or like.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.500
Can't include that.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.500
Can't include that.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.500
Can't include that.

11:26.500 --> 11:27.500
Like, not included.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.500
You just aren't interested in seeing what's possible.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.500
Meanwhile, me and Ania are trying to shoehorn in the best.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.500
I never have it.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.500
Now what?

11:34.500 --> 11:35.500
You know who made it.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.500
And what's your plan?

11:37.500 --> 11:39.500
I said, give me a second.

11:39.500 --> 11:40.500
And talk amongst yourselves.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.500
I got advertising.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.500
Great.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.500
Googling that.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.500
Talk amongst yourselves.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.500
It was not this pressure.

11:48.500 --> 11:52.500
This should have all been done offline before I got here.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.500
We had the time.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.500
Yep.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.500
Yeah.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.500
You did.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.500
And you didn't take advantage of it.

11:59.500 --> 12:02.500
Do you guys not have enough in common amongst the four of you

12:02.500 --> 12:04.500
to not just wax amongst yourselves?

12:04.500 --> 12:06.500
We only have in common and talk all the time.

12:06.500 --> 12:07.500
So that's what we said.

12:07.500 --> 12:08.500
Silent.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.500
I said, we have plenty in common and we talk all the time.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.500
We said everything that we need to say to each other.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.500
Yeah.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.500
This is so not how I want it.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.500
This is like, oh, here we go.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.500
Oh, here we go.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.500
Oh, here we go.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.500
It's not a clickable link.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.500
Who sent you this?

12:23.500 --> 12:26.500
People posted it in the discord or on the subreddit or something.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.500
And tag me on Twitter.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.500
I mean, there's outrage amongst the head.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.500
Listener ship.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.500
Yeah.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.500
This is, this is, um,

12:33.500 --> 12:34.500
egregious.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.500
Should we call them?

12:35.500 --> 12:36.500
Call.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.500
Jimmy.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.500
I died advertising.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.500
Oh.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.500
Are they looking at us like?

12:40.500 --> 12:42.500
Is this for a,

12:42.500 --> 12:46.500
Olivia Roud Rigo Taylor Swift royalties conversation?

12:46.500 --> 12:47.500
I think it goes.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.500
You know, and I wish it was just as simple as that.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.500
But I feel like it goes deeper.

12:51.500 --> 12:54.500
I feel like they're like going to start, you know,

12:54.500 --> 12:57.500
continuing on with this trend of stealing my ideas.

12:57.500 --> 12:58.500
Mm-hmm.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.500
And like the next jersey mix spot might be like,

13:00.500 --> 13:01.500
fucking jeffery.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.500
There's no way.

13:02.500 --> 13:03.500
I'm, I fear that.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.500
I'm not saying that that's a reality yet.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.500
But I'm just saying, like, where does it stop?

13:07.500 --> 13:09.500
Because you start with rhythm of the slice.

13:09.500 --> 13:10.500
And that's two years ago.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.500
Yeah.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.500
I feel like they're like, oh, they forgot they did that.

13:13.500 --> 13:14.500
I didn't forget.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.500
Mm-hmm.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.500
It's top of mind.

13:16.500 --> 13:17.500
Jokes on him.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.500
I'm not going to ring tone.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.500
Yeah.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.500
You remember?

13:20.500 --> 13:21.500
Um, here we go.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.500
Office hangs.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.500
I'm on the high dive.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.500
Uh, at H&C Instagram.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.500
And they have a highlighted story of office hangs.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.500
Mm-hmm.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.500
Um,

13:30.500 --> 13:33.500
The new office is coming together.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.500
We're in Chicago, aren't I?

13:35.500 --> 13:37.500
Uh, I don't want to dox them.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.500
Well, town town.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.500
I don't think you'd be very happy if I said, you know.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.500
It's also like not hard for people to find that out.

13:43.500 --> 13:48.500
If you found it in, it looks like Lincoln Park.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.500
No.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.500
That's cool.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.500
Alley's from Chicago actually.

13:51.500 --> 13:54.500
I mean, we're bringing our resident Chicago correspondent.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.500
Where does that look?

13:55.500 --> 13:56.500
Yeah.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.500
Where's that building?

13:57.500 --> 13:58.500
Oh, wait.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.500
There is a street sign.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.500
Ohio Avenue.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.500
Yeah.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.500
Wait.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.500
Actually, you know what?

14:03.500 --> 14:04.500
They had their address.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.500
Are you from Chicago proper?

14:05.500 --> 14:07.500
I was born Chicago proper.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.500
Yeah.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.500
So, well, do you have Chicago pride?

14:11.500 --> 14:12.500
I think so.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.500
Interesting.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.500
And I've been told that I have a Chicago accent.

14:15.500 --> 14:16.500
You do.

14:16.500 --> 14:17.500
Yeah.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.500
River North.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.500
For sure.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.500
River North confirmed 320 West Ohio streets.

14:21.500 --> 14:22.500
So if you guys want to.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.500
That's where the buyer is.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.500
Don't want to wish ill on the office.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.500
Environment of high dive.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.500
But like if you want to send a strongly worded complaint.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.500
Shouldn't, uh,

14:30.500 --> 14:32.500
Either written and printed out.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.500
Be half.

14:33.500 --> 14:34.500
Yeah.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.500
Just be like, hey, you know,

14:35.500 --> 14:36.500
I know what you're up to.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.500
Uh, and if you ever steal another idea from the headgum podcast.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.500
Don't instigate things.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.500
Info at highdive us.com.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.500
Oh, don't get the rest.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.500
Dead.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.500
Dead.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.500
Yeah.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.500
So many, so many.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.500
I don't want to dock them.

14:51.500 --> 14:52.500
Good God.

14:56.500 --> 15:02.500
This just in high dive stealing our ideas.

15:05.500 --> 15:17.500
Not a match-in, but if we hadn't used the same song website, like imagine if you were responsible for delivery, then you used to be so.

15:17.500 --> 15:22.500
So it wouldn't be like the onion or you're saying truly it's like me and on your writing articles.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.500
Yeah, it's that one.

15:23.500 --> 15:27.500
Can I be like a fucking op-ed opinion writer?

15:27.500 --> 15:28.500
Sure.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.500
You can be an op-ed opinion.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.500
Okay.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.500
News.headgum.com.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.500
That's not bad at all.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.500
I'd actually love that for my guys.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.500
No, but definitely reach out to that.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.500
It's like the spicy salad you would write.

15:46.500 --> 15:47.500
That's a good question.

15:47.500 --> 15:51.500
What opinions can you possibly have that you would care about?

15:51.500 --> 15:54.500
So like, what's the headline that's going to get shared around?

15:54.500 --> 15:56.500
It has to be like, you see this?

15:56.500 --> 15:57.500
Wait, baby.

15:57.500 --> 16:01.500
The might influence some sort of like, let's put it on.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.500
More than ideology throughout the nation.

16:03.500 --> 16:04.500
Perhaps.

16:04.500 --> 16:05.500
Okay.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.500
Well, do you guys want to know what?

16:08.500 --> 16:11.500
I had a conversation about what I would do to fix the country.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.500
If I was president and had five executive orders.

16:13.500 --> 16:14.500
Okay.

16:14.500 --> 16:15.500
Do you want to know what they were?

16:15.500 --> 16:16.500
Yeah.

16:16.500 --> 16:17.500
Sure.

16:17.500 --> 16:20.500
So the op-ed title would be, how I would fix the country.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.500
Yeah.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.500
An open letter from a...

16:25.500 --> 16:27.500
Fucking say the list.

16:27.500 --> 16:28.500
Dude.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.500
You tripping over your own fucking thoughts.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.500
Out with it.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.500
Okay.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.500
Well, the first order of actions now going to be.

16:37.500 --> 16:40.500
And by the way, this is going to be pulling funds away.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.500
And executive orders away.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.500
From things that could have actually, like,

16:43.500 --> 16:47.500
I don't know, changed the structures of our country that oppressed people in color.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.500
And, you know, the LGBTQI plus community.

16:50.500 --> 16:53.500
First executive order is your gone.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.500
Oh, wait.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.500
That's so...

16:55.500 --> 16:57.500
That's patriotic.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.500
Where do you want to go?

16:59.500 --> 17:00.500
You can go anywhere you want.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.500
We're going for that.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.500
Probably not that.

17:02.500 --> 17:03.500
Second order you're gone.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.500
Portugal then.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.500
Portugal?

17:05.500 --> 17:06.500
Yeah.

17:06.500 --> 17:07.500
Portugal or Senegal?

17:07.500 --> 17:08.500
Portugal.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.500
You don't want to be in the car.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.500
Don't want to be in the car or the club.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.500
Yeah.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.500
You guys are fucking listed.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.500
I would...

17:17.500 --> 17:21.500
Basically eradicate public education being funded by localized income tax.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.500
So it all would be pulled together at the state level and then redistributed equally.

17:24.500 --> 17:27.500
So every high school in the state gets the same amount of funding.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.500
So you don't have like rich areas of getting better education.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.500
That's good start.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.500
Okay.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.500
And that goes for like all low income areas.

17:33.500 --> 17:34.500
But what?

17:34.500 --> 17:36.500
First one is I'm in fucking Portugal.

17:36.500 --> 17:39.500
Second one is actually a little like public finance.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.500
Here we go.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.500
Third one is a mirror has to get a tattoo of my name on his eye.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.500
You're wasting that.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.500
You're wasting that.

17:45.500 --> 17:46.500
You're wasting them.

17:46.500 --> 17:50.500
To the first three are me having a tattoo in Europe.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.500
The fourth is that the old office is now around.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.500
It already is around.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.500
A theater in the round.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.500
Let me fucking finish.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.500
I think we need more transparency in government.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.500
I think that there should be a fucking...

18:02.500 --> 18:03.500
It should be like a fucking wrestling.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.500
Yes.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.500
And outdoor amphitheater.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.500
I don't care if it's winter in DC.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.500
A wrestling ring is a square by the way.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.500
It's a square circle.

18:11.500 --> 18:12.500
It's a square circle.

18:12.500 --> 18:13.500
Thank you.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.500
And the last one is reparations.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.500
Let's go to commercial.

18:17.500 --> 18:18.500
Thank you.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.500
Our next partner is athletic greens.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.500
I take AG one by athletic greens literally every day.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.500
And you know what?

18:31.500 --> 18:36.500
I gave it a try because I was before on an entirely inconvenient supplement routine.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.500
I mean, I was taking magnesium, glycinate.

18:39.500 --> 18:46.500
I was taking vitamin D, vitamin C, B12, Bcomplex, etc.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.500
It ended up being like 12 different pills.

18:49.500 --> 18:53.500
And you know, I don't know about you guys, but I don't like doing things that are boring.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.500
And it's boring to take that many.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.500
They don't taste like anything.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.500
You know, you really feel them going down some of these.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.500
I mean, the vitamin C and the vitamin E's were like that big.

19:02.500 --> 19:03.500
I found it inconvenient.

19:03.500 --> 19:07.500
So I started to give AG one a try because it has all those things and more.

19:07.500 --> 19:10.500
All immune supporting, good for your gut health.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.500
And it makes me feel unstoppable.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.500
I wake up every day.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.500
I have a cup of water.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.500
I have math.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.500
I have electric greens.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.500
And then I have coffee.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.500
And I'm off to the races.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.500
It really gets my mental right.

19:20.500 --> 19:23.500
And I can't recommend it enough.

19:23.500 --> 19:28.500
It's really helped me have improved digestion and also better sleep quality.

19:28.500 --> 19:32.500
I feel like I wake up each morning better rested.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.500
And there've been also, there've been times that I've traveled.

19:34.500 --> 19:37.500
And I haven't been able to take my AG one with me.

19:37.500 --> 19:40.500
And during those times, I do feel like I'm getting worse sleep.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.500
And then I'm not as alert.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.500
I'm always looking for life hacks.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.500
And AG one is absolutely a life hack.

19:46.500 --> 19:51.500
Because it's an all in one formula that makes it easy to cover your nutritional bases every day.

19:51.500 --> 19:59.500
Every scoop is packed with 75 vitamins, minerals, and whole-foods, food sourced ingredients of the highest quality that give me major benefits.

19:59.500 --> 20:04.500
And I definitely see the results in the way that my skin looks.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.500
There's no downside.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.500
I don't know what else to say.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.500
I mean, it's delivered to me every month.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.500
So it's super easy to make it a daily habit.

20:11.500 --> 20:17.500
And it's the one good thing that you can do to look out for your health each and every day that kind of has...

20:17.500 --> 20:20.500
What's the opposite of diminishing returns?

20:20.500 --> 20:24.500
Just a bunch of benefits that compounding benefits, let's say.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.500
So if you're looking for an easier way to take supplements,

20:26.500 --> 20:32.500
athletic greens is going to give you a free one-year supply of vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.500
Just go to athletic greens.com slash what's that?

20:34.500 --> 20:37.500
Again, that's athletic greens.com slash what's that?

20:37.500 --> 20:38.500
Check it out.

20:38.500 --> 20:39.500
Thanks athletic greens.

20:39.500 --> 20:40.500
And we're back.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.500
Oh, come on.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.500
Farting in a dusty hallway.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.500
Scott Con.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.500
Oh, I like it.

20:56.500 --> 20:57.500
All these brothers.

20:59.500 --> 21:00.500
No.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.500
Scott Con from Hawaii 50.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.500
James Con's son.

21:05.500 --> 21:06.500
Yeah.

21:06.500 --> 21:07.500
Is that true?

21:07.500 --> 21:08.500
Yeah.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.500
Noah Con.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.500
Is that your brother?

21:10.500 --> 21:12.500
Music in a relation.

21:12.500 --> 21:13.500
Got it.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.500
I'm here.

21:14.500 --> 21:15.500
Fast.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.500
Say it fast.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.500
Overlapping dialogue.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.500
Like I always say.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.500
Don't take a pause.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.500
Just think about it.

21:21.500 --> 21:22.500
Just the first thing that comes to your mind.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.500
First of all, best.

21:23.500 --> 21:24.500
David Con.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.500
Is that real person?

21:25.500 --> 21:26.500
Thank you.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.500
Is the GM of the two rules?

21:28.500 --> 21:29.500
Marinka.

21:29.500 --> 21:33.500
Uh, but I don't think Comber Batch is Con from the Star Trek movie.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.500
Not bad.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.500
We got through it fast.

21:37.500 --> 21:38.500
Here's another op-ed.

21:38.500 --> 21:41.500
Open letter to the casting at Sony Pictures Studios.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.500
Just fucking decide.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.500
You know it's Aaron Taylor Johnson.

21:44.500 --> 21:45.500
Okay.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.500
Just like fucking cast his ass.

21:47.500 --> 21:48.500
Bad decision, by the way.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.500
He's not going to do a good bond.

21:49.500 --> 21:50.500
I want it.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.500
I want it.

21:51.500 --> 21:52.500
I want it.

21:52.500 --> 21:53.500
I want it.

21:53.500 --> 21:54.500
I want it.

21:54.500 --> 21:55.500
Okay.

21:55.500 --> 21:56.500
All of my op-eds will be dictated by the way.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.500
Yeah.

21:57.500 --> 21:58.500
I only do get you.

21:58.500 --> 21:59.500
What's that?

21:59.500 --> 22:00.500
I think he'll do a good job.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.500
Why don't I think he'll do a good job?

22:02.500 --> 22:03.500
Yeah.

22:03.500 --> 22:04.500
I mean, I'm sure he'd do fine.

22:04.500 --> 22:05.500
I just think it's boring.

22:05.500 --> 22:07.500
He looks basically the same as Daniel Craig.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.500
So visually there's nothing there.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.500
He's a fucking same thing.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.500
He's a cradle robby.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.500
So unless they're going to plan on having the bond,

22:14.500 --> 22:16.500
the girls be bond women in their 50s,

22:16.500 --> 22:18.500
which I think would be interesting,

22:18.500 --> 22:19.500
which they're not going to do.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.500
Then I ended discussion.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.500
Let's give it to Daniel Caluia.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.500
Sure.

22:24.500 --> 22:25.500
Okay.

22:25.500 --> 22:26.500
Oh, yeah.

22:26.500 --> 22:27.500
I mean, I love you.

22:27.500 --> 22:28.500
Yeah.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.500
Compelling argument.

22:30.500 --> 22:31.500
I'm on board.

22:31.500 --> 22:32.500
Yeah.

22:32.500 --> 22:38.500
I wanted to sort of fix your guys' problems.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.500
Because you're in therapy.

22:40.500 --> 22:41.500
No.

22:41.500 --> 22:42.500
It's a prized.

22:42.500 --> 22:43.500
You're not.

22:43.500 --> 22:44.500
You would never.

22:44.500 --> 22:45.500
Are you in therapy?

22:45.500 --> 22:46.500
Yeah.

22:46.500 --> 22:47.500
How's that?

22:47.500 --> 22:48.500
Maria, you're in therapy.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.500
Yeah.

22:49.500 --> 22:50.500
All right, great.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.500
So y'all, let me fix your problems.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.500
Free of charge.

22:52.500 --> 22:53.500
Okay.

22:53.500 --> 22:54.500
What's the most pressing issue

22:54.500 --> 22:56.500
that you feel comfortable sharing on air

22:56.500 --> 22:57.500
that I can kind of help you with?

22:57.500 --> 22:58.500
Casey, do you have one?

22:58.500 --> 22:59.500
You?

22:59.500 --> 23:00.500
Yeah.

23:00.500 --> 23:01.500
I think I'm okay.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.500
All right.

23:02.500 --> 23:03.500
Yeah.

23:03.500 --> 23:04.500
All right.

23:04.500 --> 23:05.500
I feel like I'm, yeah.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.500
Is it because of your stay at the cottage?

23:07.500 --> 23:08.500
Yeah.

23:08.500 --> 23:09.500
My stay at the cottage.

23:09.500 --> 23:14.500
I finally used to give card that Jeff gave me five years ago.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.500
You gave.

23:15.500 --> 23:16.500
All right.

23:16.500 --> 23:17.500
You gave card five years ago?

23:17.500 --> 23:18.500
Yeah.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.500
And I saved it.

23:19.500 --> 23:20.500
And what was it a gift card for?

23:20.500 --> 23:21.500
Airbnb.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.500
So was an Airbnb.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.500
Anywhere you want gift card?

23:25.500 --> 23:26.500
Yeah.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.500
It was.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.500
And I almost spent it a couple of times

23:29.500 --> 23:32.500
on the OJ Simpson tour of LA as a bit.

23:32.500 --> 23:33.500
Hi.

23:33.500 --> 23:34.500
Hi.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.500
Hi.

23:35.500 --> 23:36.500
Hi.

23:36.500 --> 23:37.500
Hi.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.500
Yeah.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.500
On the OJ give the tour?

23:40.500 --> 23:41.500
No.

23:41.500 --> 23:42.500
No.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.500
But you go around and you see the spots in a white bronco.

23:44.500 --> 23:45.500
Wow.

23:45.500 --> 23:46.500
You get to ride in a bronco.

23:46.500 --> 23:47.500
Yeah.

23:47.500 --> 23:48.500
You get to ride in a bronco.

23:48.500 --> 23:51.500
You're traversing the streets of Brentwood and a bronco.

23:51.500 --> 23:54.500
But I couldn't find anyone who thought it was funny enough to be with me.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.500
The gift certificate covered the entire trip.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.500
No.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.500
I had to throw down a little.

23:58.500 --> 23:59.500
But it helped.

23:59.500 --> 24:00.500
And I went to Japan.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.500
We got a good state in a little tiny house.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.500
Can you send me that listing?

24:04.500 --> 24:05.500
Yeah.

24:05.500 --> 24:06.500
I've been wanting to go.

24:06.500 --> 24:07.500
It was really nice.

24:07.500 --> 24:08.500
It looked amazing.

24:08.500 --> 24:09.500
How many people did you go with?

24:09.500 --> 24:10.500
Just one.

24:10.500 --> 24:13.500
And it was their aromas and sheep and goats.

24:13.500 --> 24:14.500
Next door.

24:14.500 --> 24:15.500
I love her, her friend.

24:15.500 --> 24:16.500
My girlfriend.

24:16.500 --> 24:17.500
Oh.

24:17.500 --> 24:18.500
What?

24:18.500 --> 24:23.500
I want to hurt.

24:23.500 --> 24:28.500
This is a bomb drop.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.500
This is just in.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.500
You want to talk about news?

24:31.500 --> 24:32.500
Yeah.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.500
They just broke up because of those fucking sound effects.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.500
Yeah.

24:35.500 --> 24:36.500
Yeah.

24:36.500 --> 24:38.500
The girl with the Doc Martins and the moon a shirt has a girlfriend.

24:38.500 --> 24:39.500
Can you believe that?

24:39.500 --> 24:40.500
Oh.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.500
Oh.

24:41.500 --> 24:42.500
Oh.

24:42.500 --> 24:43.500
Everybody.

24:43.500 --> 24:44.500
Oh.

24:44.500 --> 24:45.500
No.

24:45.500 --> 24:50.500
It's breaking news because we've talked about your dating life on the show.

24:50.500 --> 24:51.500
Yeah.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.500
So let's talk about this a perfect segue.

24:53.500 --> 24:54.500
Yeah.

24:54.500 --> 24:55.500
Dating it away.

24:55.500 --> 24:57.500
Or should we say dating it to Pango?

24:57.500 --> 24:59.500
Did you go to endless color?

24:59.500 --> 25:00.500
No, it's not.

25:00.500 --> 25:04.500
It's a pizza place that has natural wine in the canyon.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.500
No.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.500
That sounds nice.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.500
Did you bless the reins down into Pango?

25:08.500 --> 25:09.500
Oh.

25:09.500 --> 25:12.500
There is nothing that the Ranga days could have.

25:12.500 --> 25:13.500
A festival.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.500
Barry needs references.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.500
First and last name.

25:18.500 --> 25:19.500
No.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.500
Let's go.

25:20.500 --> 25:21.500
Wait.

25:21.500 --> 25:22.500
Let's go.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.500
Wait.

25:23.500 --> 25:24.500
Let's go.

25:24.500 --> 25:25.500
Wait.

25:25.500 --> 25:27.500
And what do they do?

25:27.500 --> 25:29.500
Which works in music.

25:29.500 --> 25:30.500
But.

25:30.500 --> 25:31.500
Warner.

25:31.500 --> 25:32.500
Look at me.

25:32.500 --> 25:34.500
Don't look at me.

25:34.500 --> 25:35.500
It's hard.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.500
I want to look at Ali.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.500
But I'm so used to being able to look forward from behind the desk.

25:39.500 --> 25:40.500
Right.

25:40.500 --> 25:41.500
I got into use to it.

25:41.500 --> 25:42.500
It's electric.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.500
Are we boring in America?

25:44.500 --> 25:45.500
Kind of.

25:45.500 --> 25:46.500
I mean.

25:46.500 --> 25:47.500
Yeah.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.500
I'm really excited to hear about.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.500
How long has it been?

25:50.500 --> 25:51.500
First date.

25:51.500 --> 25:52.500
Let's go.

25:52.500 --> 25:53.500
First date.

25:53.500 --> 25:54.500
Third date.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.500
And when you short a seal the deal.

25:56.500 --> 25:57.500
Oh my god.

25:57.500 --> 26:00.500
It's fine to talk openly about your personal life.

26:00.500 --> 26:01.500
No.

26:01.500 --> 26:02.500
Yes.

26:02.500 --> 26:03.500
I didn't work.

26:03.500 --> 26:04.500
And not on camera.

26:04.500 --> 26:05.500
This isn't work.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.500
This is a performance space.

26:07.500 --> 26:11.500
Everything we say here is taken with a great assault folks.

26:11.500 --> 26:12.500
Great.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.500
They're with a great assault folks.

26:13.500 --> 26:14.500
Amity.

26:14.500 --> 26:15.500
Amity.

26:15.500 --> 26:16.500
Amity.

26:16.500 --> 26:17.500
Um.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.500
Sorry.

26:18.500 --> 26:19.500
No.

26:19.500 --> 26:20.500
Okay.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.500
First and last name.

26:21.500 --> 26:22.500
When you met.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.500
I didn't want to give any of them.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.500
No.

26:25.500 --> 26:26.500
Okay.

26:26.500 --> 26:27.500
Then let's give her an alias.

26:27.500 --> 26:28.500
The franchise.

26:28.500 --> 26:29.500
Jennifer Gardner.

26:29.500 --> 26:30.500
Oh.

26:30.500 --> 26:33.500
You know what?

26:33.500 --> 26:34.500
Speaking of.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.500
I really like that she's still close with Victor Garber.

26:36.500 --> 26:37.500
Yeah.

26:37.500 --> 26:38.500
Yeah.

26:38.500 --> 26:39.500
Let's talk about that.

26:39.500 --> 26:40.500
Jennifer.

26:40.500 --> 26:44.500
I also had an open question to post to the room.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.500
Okay.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.500
That's right.

26:46.500 --> 26:47.500
So there's a story that has been a kind of story.

26:47.500 --> 26:48.500
There is a story that is just a story that has been a story that has been a story.

26:48.500 --> 26:53.500
If you could give a tour of any like cultural significance, what would it be?

26:53.500 --> 26:58.500
Oh, we got a for you show out man because it's like when it ends up at these dead ends.

26:58.500 --> 26:59.500
No.

26:59.500 --> 27:00.500
I have to have an answer.

27:00.500 --> 27:01.500
Okay.

27:01.500 --> 27:02.500
Yeah, we're okay.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.500
That's what we're talking about.

27:04.500 --> 27:06.500
That's for like it should be learned.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.500
Open question.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.500
You said.

27:08.500 --> 27:09.500
I gave an actual answer.

27:09.500 --> 27:10.500
And you said, no.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.500
That's boring.

27:11.500 --> 27:12.500
There's a.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.500
No.

27:13.500 --> 27:14.500
Sorry.

27:14.500 --> 27:17.540
I was also trying to continue my statement,

27:17.540 --> 27:20.620
but then you said that my question was bad.

27:21.820 --> 27:26.460
No, like, tour of something related to a movie

27:26.460 --> 27:31.460
or TV show or murder or cry in general.

27:32.060 --> 27:34.860
Like a breaking bad tour of Alba Curkey would be an exam.

27:34.860 --> 27:35.700
Can I speak?

27:35.700 --> 27:36.540
We don't know anything.

27:36.540 --> 27:37.540
Can I speak, Marker?

27:37.540 --> 27:38.380
Yeah.

27:38.380 --> 27:39.220
I can speak.

27:39.220 --> 27:40.220
You can talk.

27:40.220 --> 27:41.380
Yeah.

27:41.380 --> 27:42.980
Oh, my shit.

27:42.980 --> 27:45.020
Serendipity in New York.

27:45.020 --> 27:46.020
Yep.

27:46.020 --> 27:47.020
That's your tour.

27:47.020 --> 27:49.260
Oh, that movie's so bad, but it's very funny.

27:49.260 --> 27:51.460
And they use the word serendipity every other sentence.

27:51.460 --> 27:53.260
It's Joan Kusack in Capeck.

27:53.260 --> 27:55.220
John Kusack, not Joan Kusack.

27:55.220 --> 27:56.060
You're in great.

27:56.060 --> 27:58.420
I think Joan is another person.

27:58.420 --> 28:00.420
I think he's confused.

28:00.420 --> 28:01.700
No, it's John Kusack.

28:01.700 --> 28:02.900
Yeah, Joan.

28:02.900 --> 28:05.260
Yeah, Joan Kusack is another person.

28:05.260 --> 28:07.340
I know that's a different person, but she's not in a movie.

28:07.340 --> 28:09.300
It didn't seem like you knew that.

28:09.300 --> 28:10.140
Are you saying to her?

28:10.140 --> 28:11.300
You think Joan is in it?

28:11.300 --> 28:12.300
It's John.

28:12.340 --> 28:13.620
Oh, that's John.

28:13.620 --> 28:15.820
Every other scene they go, this is Serendipity.

28:15.820 --> 28:16.820
That's good.

28:16.820 --> 28:17.820
Yeah.

28:17.820 --> 28:20.220
One of my favorite movies.

28:20.220 --> 28:21.220
Yeah.

28:21.220 --> 28:24.420
It's like I lose a note in the wind, and if it comes back to you, then we

28:24.420 --> 28:25.420
were meant to be here something.

28:25.420 --> 28:26.420
Yeah.

28:26.420 --> 28:27.060
But Eugene Levy isn't it?

28:27.060 --> 28:30.060
And he plays the shoe salesman, and he's very funny.

28:30.060 --> 28:32.020
I think it's a great movie.

28:32.020 --> 28:35.420
One of my favorite rom-coms New York Upper East Side.

28:35.420 --> 28:37.380
I've never seen a New York Christmas.

28:37.380 --> 28:38.740
I don't think you'd like it.

28:38.740 --> 28:40.820
I'm not a rom-com guy.

28:41.580 --> 28:44.140
I'm not a rom-com guy.

28:44.140 --> 28:49.020
It might be Eugene Levy, and I'm sort of debating whether to call you out on it in my

28:49.020 --> 28:51.300
head, but I'm not 100% sure myself.

28:51.300 --> 28:52.300
I think it's lovely.

28:52.300 --> 28:53.300
Grace, cut that up.

28:53.300 --> 28:54.300
Oh, great.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.300
Actually, keep it in.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.300
No.

28:56.300 --> 28:57.300
No.

28:57.300 --> 28:58.300
No.

28:58.300 --> 29:01.780
The tour would start at Blooming Dales, then we go around the corner to Serendipity 3,

29:01.780 --> 29:03.300
Frozen Hot Chocolate.

29:03.300 --> 29:06.460
And then you fly to San Francisco, right?

29:06.460 --> 29:12.260
You're fucking walking through Chinatown, going to Buddhist shops, and then you're back

29:12.260 --> 29:20.620
to New York, getting a tour of the New York Times obituary, fucking archive, right?

29:20.620 --> 29:26.540
And then you're, I think, son of the tour, I don't know, you're leaving.

29:26.540 --> 29:31.260
I've never seen the movies, so I'm going to end it in the Waldorf story, I think this

29:31.260 --> 29:32.500
is the end of the tour.

29:32.500 --> 29:37.500
And then you end up at the Waldorf, and then you end on this ice skating central park.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.500
Maria, go what would yours be?

29:39.500 --> 29:41.500
Well, I want to hear everyone else's.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.380
I don't necessarily have one.

29:43.380 --> 29:46.940
My dad took me on one one, it's like I have me, self-made tour.

29:46.940 --> 29:51.580
There was in Chicago, there's all these black buses, and it's like the gangster tour of

29:51.580 --> 29:55.300
Chicago, and it shows you where stuff went down.

29:55.300 --> 29:58.940
And I said, I wanted to go on it, and my dad said, save your money and get in the car.

29:59.100 --> 30:01.700
And my dad got in the car, and he had a gun.

30:01.700 --> 30:06.860
And he drove around and he was like, that guy would die there, that guy died there, this

30:06.860 --> 30:08.980
happened there, he knew everything.

30:08.980 --> 30:12.620
He's a one in the race, Chicago or, well, baller.

30:12.620 --> 30:16.300
It was pretty interesting, so I think.

30:16.300 --> 30:25.660
I could give a tour of pulp fiction filming locations relative to where I lived, so I

30:25.660 --> 30:31.660
could be like, this scene from the movie, I lived down the street, that scene I lived

30:31.660 --> 30:32.660
down the street.

30:32.660 --> 30:36.660
I didn't live near the dining, so that's not on my tour.

30:36.660 --> 30:37.660
It's kind of famous.

30:37.660 --> 30:39.660
It's the man.

30:39.660 --> 30:40.660
I hear it.

30:40.660 --> 30:44.660
I'm pretty sure it's, it's an angle wood somewhere.

30:44.660 --> 30:45.660
I see.

30:45.660 --> 30:48.660
I could give a tour of places I smoked weed in high school.

30:48.660 --> 30:49.660
That's really cool.

30:49.660 --> 30:50.660
Around my town.

30:50.660 --> 30:51.660
The movie.

30:51.660 --> 31:03.460
White men can't jump, Venice Beach Street Basketball, the King in the Duck, Sydney Dean

31:03.460 --> 31:05.660
and Billy Hoyle.

31:05.660 --> 31:08.020
Yeah, they ruled these courts.

31:08.020 --> 31:11.940
There was also a vast, yeah.

31:11.940 --> 31:15.860
I felt like I was on the tour.

31:15.860 --> 31:17.660
This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.

31:17.660 --> 31:21.020
Guys, do you ever have racing thoughts that keep you up at night or wake you up earlier,

31:21.020 --> 31:23.620
just prevent you from being able to enjoy your life?

31:23.620 --> 31:28.020
Well, it turns out that a great way to get rid of those racing thoughts is to talk them

31:28.020 --> 31:29.020
through.

31:29.020 --> 31:32.020
And therapy gives you a place to do that, so that you can get out of your negative

31:32.020 --> 31:35.620
thought patterns and find some mental and emotional peace.

31:35.620 --> 31:37.020
I'm in therapy every week.

31:37.020 --> 31:42.020
Well, actually, my therapist canceled last week, which is why I'm kind of spiraling.

31:42.020 --> 31:45.740
And I just, I always feel better when I do have it, you know, I always feel like I'm

31:45.740 --> 31:51.900
able to get that layer of, of muck or confusion about how I feel or why I'm like stressed

31:51.900 --> 31:55.300
or anxious, et cetera, out in that hour.

31:55.300 --> 32:01.660
And it helps me go into the weekend with a pattern my step and more mental clarity.

32:01.660 --> 32:05.820
And a lot more space to kind of react to life as it happens to me.

32:05.820 --> 32:10.540
And if anything goes wrong during the week or even right, but I don't know how to categorize

32:10.540 --> 32:13.060
it in my mind as good.

32:13.060 --> 32:17.380
I know that every Thursday, I have my therapy appointment to look forward to.

32:17.380 --> 32:20.380

Defending, we loud.

32:46.100 --> 32:48.620
New soundboard, we auditioned in the last week.

32:48.620 --> 32:49.260
Marieka helped.

32:49.260 --> 32:51.060
Marieka, what's your tour?

32:51.060 --> 32:53.060
Marcus Frozen.

32:53.060 --> 32:54.780
No, I'm not really.

32:54.780 --> 32:55.620
No, I'm not.

32:55.620 --> 32:56.620
You're like freezing up.

32:56.620 --> 32:58.380
You don't have an answer.

32:58.380 --> 32:59.140
Oh my god.

32:59.140 --> 33:05.860
Yeah, I probably do like the locations from the first four seasons or something like that.

33:05.860 --> 33:06.860
Okay.

33:06.860 --> 33:15.100
Um, like I said, I didn't have one, and I wanted to see you, but let's go.

33:15.100 --> 33:16.100
How you found the best?

33:16.100 --> 33:18.100
You either in, or you're out.

33:18.100 --> 33:20.100
I mean, they're out.

33:20.100 --> 33:22.100
I will be caught dead in this close.

33:22.100 --> 33:23.100
Fasten with my life.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.100
Cool.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.100
We'll be the next big fashion designer.

33:25.100 --> 33:26.100
That's me.

33:26.100 --> 33:27.100
Bottom line.

33:27.100 --> 33:28.100
And the best.

33:28.100 --> 33:29.900
I will own the runway.

33:29.900 --> 33:34.660
But these 15 designers project runway is a chance of a lifetime.

33:34.700 --> 33:35.660
I watched this season.

33:35.660 --> 33:37.060
It's good.

33:37.060 --> 33:38.780
This isn't project runway.

33:38.780 --> 33:40.980
It's project done way.

33:40.980 --> 33:41.980
Okay.

33:41.980 --> 33:48.580
Um, we're going to be weighing how dumb each other's outfits are or not one by one.

33:48.580 --> 33:52.420
So I didn't tell you guys to dress for the occasion, but let's start with Casey.

33:52.420 --> 33:54.900
I think he took the, he understood the assignment.

33:54.900 --> 33:57.220
Um, Casey, you're looking fire.

33:57.220 --> 34:01.340
You have the green and yellow stripes on the socks.

34:01.340 --> 34:04.340
You have matching the green pants with the yellow shirt.

34:04.340 --> 34:08.140
And then you have the black graphic to you with the black graphic hat and the the vans

34:08.140 --> 34:13.180
that, uh, to match last boot, um, no notes for me.

34:13.180 --> 34:14.420
The only, actually, I wouldn't know.

34:14.420 --> 34:18.060
I think you could have worn a faded or tape T.

34:18.060 --> 34:19.060
Okay.

34:19.060 --> 34:21.060
And I think, I'll take that note.

34:21.060 --> 34:27.100
You should, you should get some thread bear basics.

34:27.100 --> 34:28.100
Basically, yeah.

34:28.100 --> 34:31.540
I, and I have a mouth guy if you need him, but basically set them free in your closet.

34:31.540 --> 34:32.860
See what happens.

34:32.860 --> 34:35.340
Set them off free in my closet in a way.

34:35.340 --> 34:36.340
Okay.

34:36.340 --> 34:38.020
You mean his shirts should be thinner?

34:38.020 --> 34:41.380
I think that they should be like, yeah, more patented patented.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.380
Yeah.

34:42.380 --> 34:43.380
Yeah.

34:43.380 --> 34:45.620
But that's like, that, again, you're the icing on the episode.

34:45.620 --> 34:46.620
Sure.

34:46.620 --> 34:51.380
That's that is, that is like, that's, um, that's like a real minor note.

34:51.380 --> 34:52.380
Sure.

34:52.380 --> 34:55.900
But I mean, you're running the runway.

34:55.900 --> 34:56.900
A minor.

34:56.900 --> 34:57.900
Sure.

34:57.900 --> 35:02.820
And if we're weighing dumb, you don't fall on that side of the scale.

35:02.860 --> 35:04.420
Thank you so much.

35:04.420 --> 35:06.020
Let's all give it up for Casey.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.020
Thank you.

35:07.020 --> 35:09.020
Thanks everybody.

35:09.020 --> 35:11.020
I'm sweating bullets.

35:11.020 --> 35:13.380
Who's next?

35:13.380 --> 35:16.380
Um, let's move on, Marieka.

35:16.380 --> 35:19.460
She has a striped shirt that's on too.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.860
Can, can you stand up and back up in friends?

35:21.860 --> 35:24.260
So we can see the pull out first.

35:24.260 --> 35:28.660
Because right now we only have shirt glasses hair to go off with, which we can do that,

35:28.660 --> 35:30.300
but I don't think it's going to work to your advantage.

35:30.380 --> 35:32.980
Uh, so let's go ahead and tune to be honest.

35:32.980 --> 35:35.380
Let's see those dockers.

35:36.500 --> 35:41.100
The problem is that I am bottom of this.

35:41.100 --> 35:46.500
I will, I will stand up, but I'm wearing the outfit.

35:46.500 --> 35:49.220
I'm going to wear later on my bottom.

35:49.220 --> 35:53.100
I'm wearing a jumpsuit that is around my waist.

35:53.100 --> 35:54.020
Marieka, let's see it.

35:54.020 --> 35:55.020
I need to be clear.

35:55.020 --> 35:56.700
It's not, it's supposed to match.

35:56.700 --> 35:58.020
I'm not going outside.

35:58.020 --> 36:01.460
No, Marieka, you're underestimating the coolness of that choice.

36:01.460 --> 36:04.700
Oh, yeah, you do, you're going to love what I'm about to say.

36:04.700 --> 36:06.780
You do look like Carlos signs.

36:11.780 --> 36:15.260
I'm going to an Arctic monkey sponsor after the recording.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.300
Arctic monkey.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.940
Marieka, I'm going to say, I didn't think anyone was going to be a case, eh?

36:19.940 --> 36:22.140
And you, it's your day.

36:22.140 --> 36:23.260
Oh, what does that mean?

36:23.260 --> 36:27.580
Jump suit around the waist with like a French mimes T.

36:27.660 --> 36:32.820
And did I mention the front braids down the side of the face to the brain?

36:32.820 --> 36:36.020
Did you see me taking out my hair at the beginning of the recording?

36:36.020 --> 36:39.180
Because I was like, I saw you signing into the Zoom late.

36:39.180 --> 36:41.100
I don't know if I saw you taking your hair out.

36:41.100 --> 36:43.660
But I'm going to get it on the beginning of that.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.780
I'm going to give Marieka an A as well.

36:45.780 --> 36:49.380
The only thing that I could, um, the only note would be like, maybe get that

36:49.380 --> 36:52.580
really pulley on that, uh, frail ass wrist.

36:53.020 --> 37:00.060
I'd love to see you in a vintage lady day just to tone Jubilee bracelet.

37:00.060 --> 37:07.260
Moving on, it's, um, right to me.

37:07.260 --> 37:15.340
Um, I guess you dressed knowing that we would look at and examine people's outfits

37:15.340 --> 37:16.340
so you're fine.

37:16.340 --> 37:18.020
I don't know if I dressed to make it out of it.

37:18.020 --> 37:20.780
I mean, you know, I would have worn this day at groceries.

37:20.780 --> 37:21.780
I don't know.

37:21.780 --> 37:24.140
It's just like you kind of like dress with a job you want in the job that I want

37:24.140 --> 37:25.540
to someone who is well dressed.

37:25.540 --> 37:26.540
Yeah.

37:26.540 --> 37:29.860
I feel like army rat or something.

37:29.860 --> 37:37.300
I feel like Jeff and I are, uh, we look like we are in a band, the same band.

37:37.300 --> 37:40.620
Uh, so I like it, man.

37:40.620 --> 37:42.100
We're wearing the army fatigue top.

37:42.100 --> 37:44.500
I'm wearing army fatigue bottles.

37:44.500 --> 37:46.060
What style of clothes is that?

37:46.060 --> 37:50.020
Like, can you, like, say, this is my style I want to go to this specific type of

37:50.020 --> 37:51.020
story?

37:51.020 --> 37:52.020
No.

37:52.020 --> 37:58.060
There's no working for the lady in the way, just give me a fucking letter grade.

37:58.060 --> 38:04.260
I honestly feel like we're all, like, we could all be the picture of a band with the way

38:04.260 --> 38:05.260
that we're currently dressed.

38:05.260 --> 38:09.620
I mean, it's like we're all the band's drama that always wears athletic wear.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.620
Yeah.

38:10.620 --> 38:12.620
Chad Smith, the type with the bathrooms.

38:12.620 --> 38:13.620
Yeah.

38:13.620 --> 38:14.620
Yeah.

38:14.620 --> 38:15.620
Yeah.

38:15.620 --> 38:16.620
Who's the frontman?

38:16.620 --> 38:17.620
Jeffrey James.

38:18.220 --> 38:22.620
Oh, my God, twist, time in the frontman.

38:22.620 --> 38:24.220
Ali is the right choice.

38:24.220 --> 38:29.380
Is that where you can, can you say the rest of our names, like you're introducing us?

38:29.380 --> 38:31.940
Or does it just say the rest of our names too?

38:31.940 --> 38:35.180
Just say all of our names, including yours.

38:35.180 --> 38:37.180
Jeffrey James.

38:37.180 --> 38:38.180
What, what, what?

38:38.180 --> 38:39.180
You know, that's fine.

38:39.180 --> 38:40.180
Just stop there.

38:40.180 --> 38:41.180
Stop there.

38:41.180 --> 38:45.460
Um, and then Grace, when I say who's the frontman, just take that audio from Rika and put

38:45.460 --> 38:46.460
it there.

38:46.460 --> 38:47.180
Um,

38:47.260 --> 38:48.420
you're the bassist, man.

38:50.420 --> 38:51.500
Man, that's generous.

38:51.500 --> 38:55.060
I was thinking triangle or strings manager.

38:56.060 --> 38:59.180
Well, Jeff is playing the bass, but it's not plugged in to anything.

38:59.180 --> 38:59.700
It's fun.

38:59.700 --> 39:00.180
Yeah.

39:00.180 --> 39:00.700
Yeah.

39:00.700 --> 39:01.820
And we're like, good job, man.

39:01.820 --> 39:05.300
He's my cousin that I promised to play with us in a band.

39:05.300 --> 39:07.620
Like Jamie Lee Curtis and Freaky Friday.

39:07.620 --> 39:08.140
Yeah.

39:08.140 --> 39:08.940
Like the frontman.

39:10.940 --> 39:13.340
I was just saying, yeah, the man.

39:13.340 --> 39:14.620
The roadie dude.

39:14.620 --> 39:15.620
We were the roadie.

39:15.620 --> 39:16.620
I'm going to drive our buzzer.

39:16.620 --> 39:20.620
You're the guy in the front of the, the whole of the front of the buzz driving.

39:20.620 --> 39:21.620
Yeah.

39:21.620 --> 39:22.620
I'm very true.

39:24.620 --> 39:26.620
This backfired.

39:31.620 --> 39:35.300
Ali, you're very East LA today.

39:35.300 --> 39:38.980
You have the, the loose fit relaxed fit denim.

39:38.980 --> 39:40.660
You have the docks.

39:40.660 --> 39:41.980
You have the moon assured.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.180
It's all on brand for 2023.

39:44.180 --> 39:47.620
The only note I would give is it's really hot for those socks.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.060
I don't know how you walk to here.

39:52.860 --> 39:54.140
Thank you for the feedback.

39:54.980 --> 39:55.700
B plus.

39:58.780 --> 40:00.620
He's just mad that he's not the frontman.

40:00.620 --> 40:01.340
Don't worry about it.

40:01.980 --> 40:09.100
Yeah, I can make my grades for Casey and Marie could be plus to be positive.

40:10.980 --> 40:13.220
I almost want to skip a mirror because I don't want to be mean.

40:14.420 --> 40:15.660
No, let's hear it.

40:15.660 --> 40:20.740
Oh, I should have worn a different shirt to fucking play tennis in or something.

40:20.740 --> 40:23.620
I didn't know we were getting critiqued on our fashion choices.

40:23.620 --> 40:26.820
Honestly, no, the tennis at part of the outfit is good.

40:26.820 --> 40:29.660
I just, I don't like the backwards hat.

40:29.660 --> 40:31.260
It isn't 2001.

40:31.260 --> 40:34.180
You're not Max Keibler making his big move.

40:34.180 --> 40:41.780
And the socks look like, um, you accidentally printed out your game results from a

40:41.860 --> 40:45.140
cron video game in the 1980s.

40:46.420 --> 40:52.100
On to a sock, I guess I printed out my game results onto a song.

40:52.100 --> 40:54.340
Yes, I don't know how you do that.

40:54.340 --> 40:55.060
I don't know how you do that.

40:55.060 --> 41:00.180
You didn't have enough ink, so the blues turned out yellow and the red turned out purple.

41:02.020 --> 41:04.900
Can I have a new pair of sneakers?

41:05.380 --> 41:06.260
I don't know, man.

41:06.260 --> 41:08.980
You've got the same one since I started interning here.

41:08.980 --> 41:09.700
That's not true.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.300
They're falling apart at the scenes.

41:11.300 --> 41:12.660
I don't care that they're comfortable.

41:12.660 --> 41:13.780
Beauty is pain.

41:13.780 --> 41:16.820
Let's get you in some stand smiths if you want to play tennis.

41:16.820 --> 41:20.020
Could never play tennis in such a flat arched.

41:20.020 --> 41:23.380
I actually wouldn't mind the return of the mustache.

41:24.660 --> 41:25.460
Okay.

41:25.860 --> 41:28.660
Maybe some, wow, let's throw back.

41:28.660 --> 41:32.500
So Casey's shirts should be thread bear and I think your face should be thread bear.

41:32.500 --> 41:33.620
Hmm, interesting.

41:33.620 --> 41:37.540
Interesting or, uh, no, not really that.

41:37.940 --> 41:42.420
Why didn't you grow out your hair in the pandemic?

41:42.420 --> 41:43.380
I didn't.

41:43.380 --> 41:45.620
No, like long.

41:45.620 --> 41:46.580
And what pretty long?

41:46.580 --> 41:52.260
And then eventually got to like coarse in my mouth and it was just uncomfortable.

41:52.260 --> 41:53.460
So I kind of, I get that.

41:54.500 --> 41:56.100
That's the first, what your hair type?

41:57.140 --> 41:57.940
My hair type.

41:57.940 --> 41:58.260
Yeah.

41:58.260 --> 41:59.140
Oh, negative.

41:59.140 --> 42:00.740
I didn't know there are types.

42:00.740 --> 42:01.860
I have pretty dry.

42:01.860 --> 42:03.220
You got to know your hair type.

42:03.220 --> 42:05.620
You got to know your hair type, so you know how to shampoo it.

42:05.620 --> 42:07.380
Yeah, I see what's your hair type.

42:08.100 --> 42:09.140
Really shampooed.

42:09.140 --> 42:10.980
We, it's like wavy curly.

42:12.180 --> 42:12.900
Uh, I think.

42:13.940 --> 42:22.980
See, you said hair type and my mind went to curly hair types, which are, uh, number and letter combinations.

42:22.980 --> 42:24.340
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

42:24.340 --> 42:29.140
Yeah, well, I, I, I think I'm, I think it's like two, something.

42:29.140 --> 42:29.620
Interesting.

42:29.620 --> 42:30.980
Yeah, that makes sense.

42:30.980 --> 42:33.540
You're sort of going through a hair journey right now.

42:33.540 --> 42:36.340
I saw you with a mini braid, sort of the, uh,

42:36.420 --> 42:37.300
pattern one again.

42:37.300 --> 42:40.100
Yeah, um, what's the eventual goal?

42:40.100 --> 42:41.300
Or is that the finished product?

42:42.500 --> 42:46.820
The braid or just growing my hair, the hair journey.

42:47.620 --> 42:49.220
Well, great question Jeff.

42:49.220 --> 42:52.820
I'm glad you asked, uh, I saw a picture of Timothy Shalamey.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.900
And I was like, this guy is great hair.

42:54.900 --> 42:58.100
And I think I have a similar hair type.

42:58.100 --> 43:00.820
I'm going to grow it out and see if that's true.

43:00.820 --> 43:01.300
Oh.

43:01.300 --> 43:04.020
And are you also trying to malnourish you?

43:04.260 --> 43:09.620
Uh, yeah, well, I do want to lose a couple pounds on the,

43:09.620 --> 43:12.180
I'm not talking about me and I think I grow the hair.

43:12.180 --> 43:13.780
I don't even know what I'm talking about.

43:13.780 --> 43:16.660
I'm saying not eating from now until you look like him.

43:16.660 --> 43:19.540
And you kind of have your sternum popping out of your skin.

43:19.540 --> 43:20.580
You have, I don't want to.

43:20.580 --> 43:22.340
You have the bony knees, you have the bony.

43:22.340 --> 43:26.580
I want, I want the Shalame hair and the grand gossling body.

43:26.580 --> 43:27.540
That's really good.

43:27.540 --> 43:27.780
Yeah.

43:27.780 --> 43:29.940
And Ken, I mean, in Barbie.

43:30.580 --> 43:36.580
More, oh, thinking they're, uh, drive or place beyond the pine.

43:36.580 --> 43:37.220
That's good.

43:37.220 --> 43:38.580
By the way, that's attainable.

43:38.580 --> 43:38.980
Yeah.

43:38.980 --> 43:41.060
Yeah, you're not far off from him and drive.

43:41.060 --> 43:41.700
Thanks.

43:41.700 --> 43:41.940
Yeah.

43:41.940 --> 43:43.220
I do have the jacket.

43:43.220 --> 43:43.620
Yeah.

43:43.620 --> 43:44.500
And the drive.

43:44.500 --> 43:44.820
And the drive.

43:44.820 --> 43:45.620
To be him and the drive.

43:45.620 --> 43:49.860
Would you die, would you die the hair for the full place beyond the pine's effect?

43:49.860 --> 43:53.700
Uh, no, I think I, I really love my hair color.

43:53.700 --> 43:55.540
Uh, I get a lot of compliments on it.

43:55.540 --> 43:56.900
So I think that's you.

43:56.900 --> 43:58.180
I wouldn't die it.

43:58.180 --> 44:00.660
D minus just because I don't want to have you in class again next year.

44:03.060 --> 44:04.660
Not a pleasure to have.

44:06.340 --> 44:12.020
That's actually a family file, uh, oh, I think I had your brother Ben two years ago.

44:15.620 --> 44:18.500
You guys remember those kids in school where it's like, oh my god, it's like a

44:18.500 --> 44:21.220
Weasely family where it's like every fucking three years.

44:21.220 --> 44:24.820
There was another like Donna Hugh and it's like the teachers remembered them.

44:24.820 --> 44:26.180
Was my family really?

44:26.260 --> 44:27.860
Yeah, me and my brother and sister.

44:27.860 --> 44:29.380
We all had the same Italian teacher.

44:31.380 --> 44:34.420
Wait, like they taught you Italian in school and high school.

44:34.420 --> 44:37.460
Yeah, you had to take a foreign language so you could take at our school.

44:37.460 --> 44:43.860
There was Spanish, Italian, French, Latin, I don't think Latin was one of them.

44:43.860 --> 44:46.900
But my older sister took it and then I took it two years later.

44:46.900 --> 44:48.980
And then my brother took it two years after that.

44:48.980 --> 44:50.260
Interesting, interesting.

44:50.980 --> 44:51.940
Uh, we have to move on.

44:52.900 --> 44:57.380
Let's all, it's a roundtable discussion of if each of us was an entree.

44:57.940 --> 44:58.980
What would we be?

44:58.980 --> 45:04.980
So it's analyzing essence, taste, um, and

45:08.660 --> 45:10.020
I don't know, cuisine.

45:11.380 --> 45:12.500
Fucking help me out here.

45:12.500 --> 45:14.180
I don't know, but you don't know.

45:14.180 --> 45:19.300
You, you're transitioning into this as a thing that we have to do.

45:19.300 --> 45:21.300
You have to speak and try ads.

45:21.300 --> 45:22.900
Okay. Okay.

45:22.900 --> 45:25.700
So when you wrote this down, did you write this?

45:25.700 --> 45:27.780
So you're coming up with this idea on the fly.

45:27.780 --> 45:30.260
Part of hosting is being malleable on the go.

45:30.260 --> 45:32.740
So what did you have planned for this episode?

45:32.740 --> 45:37.380
If you, like, just, let's get a real, I really don't want to nitpick.

45:37.380 --> 45:39.140
And this is actually a positive nitpick.

45:39.140 --> 45:41.220
That's a great example of overlapping dialogue.

45:41.220 --> 45:45.620
When I'm editing this later, I'll see the wave of like I'm starting to say on the go.

45:45.620 --> 45:47.220
I'm ending on the go as you say.

45:47.300 --> 45:48.740
So let me continue that trend.

45:48.740 --> 45:49.780
There it is.

45:49.780 --> 45:52.260
What did you have planned for this episode?

45:52.260 --> 45:56.980
The outline is intros, wax, bond of the week, Scott Khan.

45:57.780 --> 45:59.220
Project, dumb way.

45:59.220 --> 45:59.780
And that's it.

46:00.500 --> 46:01.540
This is a good episode.

46:01.540 --> 46:02.660
People are going to like the energy of this.

46:02.660 --> 46:06.740
So the, the food thing was just out of the blue because you see that we're a little short.

46:06.740 --> 46:07.940
And you want to talk to me.

46:07.940 --> 46:09.540
I see that you're a little short with me.

46:10.180 --> 46:11.780
I don't know if I appreciate it.

46:11.780 --> 46:12.820
I'm still deciding.

46:12.820 --> 46:13.300
I might.

46:13.860 --> 46:14.500
I'm not sure.

46:15.060 --> 46:18.260
Allie, I think you would be a lasagna.

46:22.660 --> 46:23.940
What do you guys think allie would be?

46:23.940 --> 46:25.140
I'm still thinking about it.

46:25.140 --> 46:25.860
I think you would be.

46:26.980 --> 46:27.780
Do you eat me?

46:27.780 --> 46:28.420
Yeah.

46:28.420 --> 46:29.060
Interesting.

46:31.140 --> 46:32.580
What about a Chicago hot dog?

46:32.580 --> 46:34.260
I almost said that, but that's two on the nose.

46:34.260 --> 46:35.700
You have to think outside the fucking bunch.

46:35.700 --> 46:38.500
No, allie, allie, allie, not a Chicago hot dog.

46:38.500 --> 46:41.300
Allie is light and fun.

46:41.300 --> 46:41.940
Yeah.

46:41.940 --> 46:42.660
I got it.

46:42.740 --> 46:43.780
Khan, candy.

46:43.780 --> 46:52.020
Neapolitan, thin crust pizza with vegetables on the side.

46:53.300 --> 46:56.580
I feel like a side salad that nobody eats.

46:56.580 --> 46:57.860
I think pizza plays.

46:57.860 --> 46:58.260
Cheats.

46:58.260 --> 47:00.020
Seria, Bianco pie.

47:01.060 --> 47:02.660
So instead of deep dish, which is.

47:09.700 --> 47:10.900
I think Allie.

47:10.900 --> 47:12.180
Yeah, that's worth it.

47:12.260 --> 47:16.100
As a sizzling fajita potter, brought to your table.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.300
Oh my god.

47:17.300 --> 47:19.060
This has been really insightful.

47:19.060 --> 47:19.620
Thank you.

47:21.220 --> 47:25.780
Oh, and on the side of mine is an orange wine with a thin lift glass.

47:27.220 --> 47:27.620
Okay.

47:27.620 --> 47:30.580
And you want to bite it just to see if it'll break in your mouth.

47:30.580 --> 47:31.220
Yeah.

47:31.220 --> 47:32.100
And it does.

47:32.100 --> 47:35.300
Chilled in a freezer so that when you get the orange,

47:35.300 --> 47:37.540
it's like, is that fucking vibe?

47:38.180 --> 47:38.980
It's you.

47:38.980 --> 47:41.300
I'm just thinking of you at that endless color.

47:41.300 --> 47:41.780
That's all.

47:42.340 --> 47:43.140
Which you didn't go.

47:43.140 --> 47:44.100
Which is an encodeo.

47:46.980 --> 47:47.460
Getter.

47:48.660 --> 47:49.380
Getter ass.

47:49.940 --> 47:50.580
What?

47:50.980 --> 47:52.820
You shouldn't go to endless color.

47:52.820 --> 47:53.540
I don't know what that is.

47:53.540 --> 47:54.500
Yeah, we don't know that.

47:58.580 --> 47:59.700
So like color remind.

48:01.940 --> 48:02.820
We can move on.

48:02.820 --> 48:04.980
Everyone was supposed to give an answer for Allie.

48:04.980 --> 48:06.180
I feel like every day.

48:06.180 --> 48:06.820
I think I did.

48:06.820 --> 48:07.780
I did lasagna.

48:07.780 --> 48:08.260
Lasagna.

48:08.260 --> 48:09.220
That's hurtful.

48:09.220 --> 48:09.460
Why?

48:09.460 --> 48:10.260
It's multi-layered.

48:10.260 --> 48:10.900
I think that hurt your feelings.

48:11.540 --> 48:13.060
I kind of thought it was a nice thing.

48:13.060 --> 48:14.820
Yeah, it was a thing with Italian.

48:14.820 --> 48:16.660
So of the three, which one did you hate the most?

48:17.700 --> 48:20.500
I mean, I hated when I thought you were going to tell me.

48:20.500 --> 48:22.340
I was a side salad at a pizza restaurant.

48:25.780 --> 48:28.420
There's onions in there and nobody ever touches.

48:28.420 --> 48:30.980
It's just mixed greens that are dry.

48:30.980 --> 48:36.020
And you know, they're seeing globs of Caesar dressing on there or none at all.

48:37.140 --> 48:39.460
Try roaming in a trash can.

48:39.460 --> 48:45.220
And this is the domain that Chipotle got people sick of in 2015.

48:46.020 --> 48:47.220
Casey, get her ass.

48:52.980 --> 48:55.140
He clearly does not want to drag her.

48:55.140 --> 48:56.100
Stop forcing it.

48:58.340 --> 48:59.140
Choose violence.

49:03.380 --> 49:07.700
You're like, uh, you're like, oh, oh,

49:07.860 --> 49:09.620
everybody's, everybody's checking their flow.

49:11.620 --> 49:12.740
That was a Jeffrey call.

49:12.740 --> 49:13.460
That was my mother.

49:14.260 --> 49:19.460
You're like, you're like, um, uh, you're like one of those salads that has like

49:19.460 --> 49:20.740
strawberries in it.

49:20.740 --> 49:21.940
Oh, that's nice.

49:21.940 --> 49:22.740
A summer salad.

49:22.740 --> 49:23.220
Yeah.

49:23.220 --> 49:24.500
That's really nice.

49:24.500 --> 49:25.700
Feta cheese, perhaps.

49:25.700 --> 49:26.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:26.580 --> 49:31.060
Something like really refreshing and like, oh, there's a lot I had this today.

49:31.060 --> 49:31.700
Yeah, definitely.

49:31.700 --> 49:32.420
Definitely.

49:32.420 --> 49:34.420
Oh, I'm so relieved you guys like me.

49:34.660 --> 49:35.300
Yeah.

49:37.300 --> 49:38.420
We're going to over to Casey.

49:39.220 --> 49:39.940
I'm thinking.

49:44.500 --> 49:47.220
I'm thinking like a hearty, diener breakfast.

49:47.220 --> 49:50.100
Yeah, like a real all American cup of sludge.

49:50.100 --> 49:51.620
Yes, hot cakes.

49:51.620 --> 49:52.980
Yeah, by the slice.

49:52.980 --> 49:54.580
I was talking to a whole.

49:55.140 --> 49:56.180
Edson a hole.

49:56.180 --> 49:57.540
Yeah, towed a hole.

49:59.060 --> 50:02.980
No, um, yeah, like those like not silver dollar full plate pancakes.

50:03.940 --> 50:08.020
Um, really good smoked bacon and like eggs up.

50:09.460 --> 50:10.820
You are what you eat, baby.

50:12.420 --> 50:15.140
I think Casey's like a really classic.

50:16.180 --> 50:16.820
Good.

50:16.820 --> 50:19.620
Good, uh, plate of chicken wings.

50:19.620 --> 50:22.340
I was thinking about that, too, but then I was classic.

50:22.340 --> 50:23.620
He's come up twice.

50:23.620 --> 50:27.140
I was going to say like a char broiled burger with like very good cheese.

50:27.140 --> 50:27.620
Sorry, a lot.

50:27.620 --> 50:28.260
Hold for sound.

50:29.220 --> 50:31.220
It's a sound you added.

50:36.020 --> 50:38.740
There's like a, there's like a private FBO around here.

50:38.740 --> 50:41.780
So like there's not a lot of plates, which is why that's good location.

50:41.780 --> 50:43.860
But sometimes it's a fucking asshole.

50:43.860 --> 50:45.060
What's FBO?

50:45.060 --> 50:48.500
I don't know what it stands for.

50:48.500 --> 50:50.500
Yeah, that's the name of any airport.

50:50.500 --> 50:51.460
Is it FBO?

50:51.460 --> 50:52.660
Yeah, the X is an FBO.

50:52.660 --> 50:54.660
Is it fly by over?

50:54.660 --> 50:55.700
That might be it.

50:59.220 --> 51:05.300
Um, I stand by what I said breakfast.

51:05.300 --> 51:06.900
I remember dinner breakfast.

51:06.900 --> 51:08.340
A lumberjack dinner breakfast.

51:08.340 --> 51:09.540
That's cool.

51:09.540 --> 51:10.340
Alley get his ass.

51:10.340 --> 51:11.700
I just said that.

51:11.700 --> 51:13.860
Yeah, I'm a burger cheeseburger nice.

51:13.860 --> 51:14.340
Yeah.

51:14.340 --> 51:14.900
I'm here.

51:16.900 --> 51:18.180
Not chose.

51:18.180 --> 51:18.900
Nice.

51:18.900 --> 51:19.860
All right.

51:19.860 --> 51:25.460
As in not show place to tell me what kind of food I'm going to be.

51:26.500 --> 51:27.380
All right, let's do a mirror.

51:27.620 --> 51:28.900
Oh my god.

51:30.100 --> 51:30.740
A soup.

51:30.740 --> 51:32.020
He's a soup of some kind.

51:32.020 --> 51:32.580
Oh, yeah, it's cool.

51:32.580 --> 51:33.620
I thought the such.

51:34.420 --> 51:38.100
I was going to say, I was like, I really got a ramen.

51:38.100 --> 51:39.620
Oh, I like ramen too.

51:39.620 --> 51:47.380
I think you're like a stainless steel aluminum bowl with heavy cream inside.

51:47.380 --> 51:50.820
That's someone tried and failed to whip into whipped cream.

51:50.820 --> 51:54.900
Oh, so it's like foamy, but it's not congealed enough to be whipped cream.

51:54.900 --> 51:56.340
They haven't discarded it yet.

51:56.340 --> 51:56.660
Yeah.

51:56.740 --> 51:59.300
It's sitting in the sink with a little bit of sink water in it too.

51:59.300 --> 52:00.100
Yeah.

52:00.100 --> 52:02.180
I'm like half man half amazing.

52:02.180 --> 52:07.220
No, you're like a bowl of sour and you're like a little sour cream.

52:07.220 --> 52:09.940
You're like, you're the spinning image of failure, yeah.

52:09.940 --> 52:14.500
I turned into butter, but they realized they over whipped it and we're going to have to abandon it.

52:14.500 --> 52:15.300
Yeah.

52:15.300 --> 52:18.260
But now every time they see it, that's good.

52:18.260 --> 52:22.100
It just makes them some coarse sense of that they even tried.

52:22.100 --> 52:23.060
Exactly.

52:23.060 --> 52:24.740
Make you a first bread and butter.

52:25.700 --> 52:28.500
The idea of someone wishing they hadn't even tried.

52:30.660 --> 52:32.020
Amir's kind of alley.

52:32.020 --> 52:34.340
You're a doctor, get his ass.

52:34.340 --> 52:35.300
Get his ass.

52:37.700 --> 52:38.660
No, I don't know.

52:38.660 --> 52:42.740
Maybe like, I could see, I could see you going a couple different ways.

52:42.740 --> 52:43.540
That's awesome.

52:43.540 --> 52:47.540
One is like an, I could see you being like a quality of mousse bush.

52:47.540 --> 52:48.740
Oh, that's cool.

52:48.740 --> 52:51.380
You're a burnt cheese, not a grilled cheese.

52:52.020 --> 52:54.660
You're a burnt to a crisp sound.

52:54.660 --> 52:58.580
Because part of me thinks that you would think it's funny to be like one good bite and that's it.

52:59.140 --> 53:01.700
You're a cold hot dog straight from the bun.

53:02.900 --> 53:04.980
Straight from the package, still in the oil.

53:06.420 --> 53:07.380
There's a bun in it.

53:07.380 --> 53:08.020
The oil.

53:08.020 --> 53:08.900
The oil, the oil.

53:12.500 --> 53:15.780
I could also see you being anything on the menu at needle.

53:15.780 --> 53:17.140
You're a surgeon.

53:17.220 --> 53:18.020
Child fun.

53:18.020 --> 53:19.220
You're a straight one.

53:21.220 --> 53:22.260
Child fun.

53:22.260 --> 53:24.020
With those questions, you're a child fun.

53:25.460 --> 53:26.660
The day's child.

53:26.660 --> 53:27.460
Child fun.

53:29.460 --> 53:32.820
After you're wetting, you're saying goodbye to all the guests.

53:32.820 --> 53:33.780
Did you child fun?

53:36.660 --> 53:38.100
Should have a child fun bar.

53:40.100 --> 53:41.140
Grace cut that out.

53:41.140 --> 53:46.180
Marica, I think you're like, um, um, I don't know, it's sort of interesting.

53:46.260 --> 53:50.340
I think you're sort of like an egg drop soup with a side of galby.

53:52.180 --> 53:52.580
What?

53:53.780 --> 53:54.340
Plugs.

53:54.980 --> 53:57.940
Did you guys have no idea what you want to point to people towards?

54:00.180 --> 54:02.180
Um, we have to move on.

54:02.180 --> 54:03.380
I have to get out of here.

54:03.380 --> 54:06.740
So, um, you have to make me something that's not egg.

54:06.740 --> 54:09.860
You're so, uh, uh, poutine.

54:09.860 --> 54:10.660
Oh my god.

54:10.660 --> 54:12.100
No, you're not poutine.

54:12.740 --> 54:16.100
So when you've been internalized by that, thank you so much.

54:16.740 --> 54:17.860
I love poutine.

54:17.860 --> 54:19.620
No, like a poutine dish.

54:19.620 --> 54:20.180
I was trying it.

54:20.180 --> 54:21.220
That was me trying to be nice.

54:21.220 --> 54:21.860
Fine.

54:21.860 --> 54:23.220
You're, you're, um,

54:23.220 --> 54:25.540
Marica's not gravy and fries.

54:25.540 --> 54:26.740
Fine.

54:26.740 --> 54:29.140
You're, um,

54:29.140 --> 54:31.860
fucking, uh,

54:31.860 --> 54:33.540
just a little bit.

54:33.540 --> 54:34.180
I'm so happy.

54:34.980 --> 54:37.220
Just I'm bugging out of his.

54:37.220 --> 54:37.620
Yeah.

54:37.620 --> 54:39.620
I'm so happy.

54:39.620 --> 54:40.900
I'm so happy.

54:40.900 --> 54:42.340
Marica, you're like,

54:42.340 --> 54:43.540
leading the triumphs.

54:43.540 --> 54:44.740
Begetty and meatballs.

54:44.900 --> 54:45.580
That's cool.

54:45.580 --> 54:46.580
Two nights are French.

54:46.580 --> 54:47.140
Yeah.

54:47.140 --> 54:49.380
Like really good, good play.

54:49.380 --> 54:50.420
Well, constructed.

54:50.420 --> 54:52.660
That's a little one little sprig abesal.

54:52.660 --> 54:55.220
I was, I was thinking like some kind of pasta.

54:55.220 --> 54:55.620
Yeah.

54:56.660 --> 54:57.460
Tagly a telly.

54:57.460 --> 54:58.420
I'll take it.

54:58.420 --> 55:00.420
Wild, bor, ragu.

55:03.060 --> 55:04.100
Kind of like,

55:04.180 --> 55:05.380
what's that?

55:05.380 --> 55:06.500
What's that?

55:06.500 --> 55:07.220
Horrible.

55:07.220 --> 55:08.980
The worst noise ever.

55:08.980 --> 55:10.020
It's so.

55:10.020 --> 55:11.620
That was smelling salt.

55:11.620 --> 55:12.340
The audio.

55:12.340 --> 55:14.020
Uh, okay.

55:14.020 --> 55:17.620
Marica, you are a, um,

55:18.820 --> 55:21.860
fucking, uh,

55:21.860 --> 55:23.620
it just could go so many ways.

55:23.620 --> 55:24.900
And I need to leave.

55:24.900 --> 55:26.740
So I'm fucking on the spot.

55:26.740 --> 55:29.780
I think you are a, uh,

55:29.780 --> 55:31.860
fucking, uh,

55:31.940 --> 55:33.220
it doesn't matter.

55:33.220 --> 55:33.940
The plugs.

55:35.620 --> 55:36.900
No, I think you're, um,

55:38.820 --> 55:40.020
a kale Caesar.

55:40.900 --> 55:43.860
I think he's a pretzel dog from auntie ends.

55:45.140 --> 55:45.620
Okay.

55:46.420 --> 55:47.460
I love you.

55:47.460 --> 55:51.220
I'm giving you the things that I like genuinely.

55:51.220 --> 55:53.140
Be fair to me for all of the things,

55:53.140 --> 55:54.820
our things that I personally can't eat.

55:55.620 --> 55:56.420
But okay, right.

55:56.420 --> 56:00.100
Yes, then I get the cinnamon pretzel from auntie ends.

56:00.100 --> 56:00.820
Thank you, thank you.

56:00.900 --> 56:02.980
With the ideal dipping sauce of your truth.

56:02.980 --> 56:03.620
Cheese.

56:03.620 --> 56:04.420
Ranch.

56:05.140 --> 56:06.740
Fucking cheese.

56:06.740 --> 56:07.140
Blue.

56:07.860 --> 56:09.380
Um, no, you know what you are?

56:11.220 --> 56:12.020
Okay.

56:12.020 --> 56:12.980
Here we go.

56:12.980 --> 56:14.420
One last attempt.

56:14.420 --> 56:16.020
For strikes in your ass.

56:16.900 --> 56:19.700
You are the spicy fish fillet.

56:19.700 --> 56:21.460
Birds of a feather in Williamsburg.

56:21.460 --> 56:23.220
Have you ever had that sort of a session?

56:23.220 --> 56:25.460
Yeah, you made me, you made me get that out of this good.

56:25.460 --> 56:26.180
It's really good.

56:26.660 --> 56:26.900
Yeah.

56:26.900 --> 56:28.340
That's my favorite dish in New York.

56:28.420 --> 56:30.580
So, plugs down the line real fast.

56:31.300 --> 56:32.100
It's almost got to you.

56:32.100 --> 56:32.580
Clovis.

56:33.380 --> 56:34.260
Jayce, you what you got.

56:35.140 --> 56:36.260
Listen to the pit wall.

56:36.260 --> 56:38.500
Me, Marika, Jeffs sometimes.

56:38.500 --> 56:39.620
Piles sometimes.

56:40.260 --> 56:41.140
Jake sometimes.

56:41.860 --> 56:42.260
I'm here.

56:42.980 --> 56:44.900
Go to your primary care physician.

56:45.700 --> 56:48.500
And ask for a full blood cavity.

56:48.500 --> 56:49.220
So, the animal.

56:50.260 --> 56:51.300
Who knows what you'll find?

56:51.300 --> 56:52.820
Let's find a get results.

56:53.940 --> 56:55.380
Alicolesterol.

56:55.380 --> 56:55.780
Alweigh.

56:55.780 --> 56:58.260
Alweigh, follow me on letter.

56:58.260 --> 57:01.300
Boxed at Alicon, the mummy,

57:01.300 --> 57:02.500
AlidashCon.

57:03.220 --> 57:04.580
I see you as a pilaf.

57:05.140 --> 57:07.060
Oh, yeah, we didn't really do Jeff.

57:07.060 --> 57:09.140
Don't like pilaf, but I think she's

57:09.140 --> 57:10.420
a little firm assell.

57:10.420 --> 57:12.020
You know, the fucking pilaf.

57:12.020 --> 57:12.660
That's it.

57:12.660 --> 57:15.060
Every game plan Instagram at Marika.

57:15.060 --> 57:16.980
I love the ribbon on all pilaf.

57:17.780 --> 57:18.420
Peel off.

57:18.420 --> 57:19.380
Kevin, don't peel off.

57:21.780 --> 57:23.060
Oh, right.

57:23.060 --> 57:23.380
Nice.

57:23.380 --> 57:24.020
Nice.

57:24.020 --> 57:24.900
Peel off.

57:25.540 --> 57:30.340
Oh, stalky grains in a plate.

57:33.300 --> 57:36.180
What's so loudly it's pale.

57:37.860 --> 57:41.220
As the rice is peeled off.

57:42.580 --> 57:46.340
And the peel off is gone.

57:46.340 --> 57:51.940
And the peel off is fried on it.

57:51.940 --> 57:54.100
It's good eating.

57:54.100 --> 57:57.780
V-P-Lop is fine now.

57:59.140 --> 58:06.980
It's a side on the rice next to a fish sauce.

58:08.180 --> 58:11.140
Marika, help me get out of here.

58:11.140 --> 58:11.940
Yeah.

58:11.940 --> 58:12.740
Yeah.

58:12.740 --> 58:13.300
Yeah.

58:13.300 --> 58:14.580
I already plugged your stuff, Marika.

58:14.580 --> 58:15.460
I love it.

58:15.460 --> 58:16.340
Oh, yeah, Marika.

58:16.340 --> 58:18.340
On on letter box, Stylist in the pit wall.

58:19.140 --> 58:20.260
Did you see talk to me?

58:21.220 --> 58:22.260
I didn't know.

58:22.260 --> 58:24.260
I'm scared.

58:24.260 --> 58:26.420
You know, they advertised it as a scariest move

58:26.420 --> 58:26.900
over the year.

58:26.900 --> 58:27.700
I was not.

58:27.700 --> 58:28.420
I didn't.

58:28.420 --> 58:30.100
I've seen scarier movies.

58:30.100 --> 58:30.420
Yeah.

58:30.420 --> 58:34.100
But here, I'm not going to say what was scarier.

58:34.100 --> 58:37.700
Uh, I thought infinity pool was scarier.

58:37.700 --> 58:39.700
I can't do body horror.

58:39.700 --> 58:40.500
Hmm.

58:40.500 --> 58:41.300
I love it.

58:41.300 --> 58:42.500
But they also never.

58:42.500 --> 58:43.700
They didn't do jump scares.

58:43.700 --> 58:44.500
Father son.

58:44.500 --> 58:46.740
Have you ever gone out for a body horror movie?

58:46.740 --> 58:47.700
I'd love to see that.

58:47.700 --> 58:48.340
I think we're.

58:48.340 --> 58:49.940
What's the body horror?

58:50.660 --> 58:51.620
Like gourd.

58:51.620 --> 58:55.700
Like small, but like it's like the horror of the body.

58:55.700 --> 58:56.980
The body is so.

58:56.980 --> 59:01.780
The human body is so horrific that you can make several kinds of movies.

59:01.780 --> 59:03.060
That's fine.

59:03.060 --> 59:03.700
Yeah.

59:03.700 --> 59:06.580
Yankeling things coming out and you do.

59:06.580 --> 59:08.980
It's like, oh, there's slime.

59:08.980 --> 59:09.620
It's great.

59:09.620 --> 59:12.420
Flush and fingernail, slowly being peeled off.

59:12.420 --> 59:12.900
Yeah.

59:12.900 --> 59:14.180
No, like that's right.

59:14.180 --> 59:15.140
My own eye.

59:15.140 --> 59:16.180
But that's fine.

59:16.180 --> 59:17.140
Bamboo's shoe.

59:17.140 --> 59:18.660
It's going under your toenail.

59:19.620 --> 59:21.540
Biting down on a fucking nail.

59:21.540 --> 59:22.340
So hard.

59:22.340 --> 59:23.620
Penetrate both.

59:48.660 --> 59:50.660
You

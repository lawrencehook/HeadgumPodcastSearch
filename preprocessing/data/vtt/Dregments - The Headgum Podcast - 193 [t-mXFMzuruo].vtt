00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
I didn't mean to insult the audience.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
I mean, this whole room is shit.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
That's crazy.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
I don't like the way they feel.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Which one would you like?

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
I don't know.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
What do you have in New York?

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Beats by Dre.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Sorry.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
I'm not going to stand for the studio G's slander.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Did we start?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
There's no way, because we didn't hear it.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
It's like a preamble.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Maybe we're starting something new

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
or there's like a cold open.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
I see.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
It's cold.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Very cold.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
We didn't hear the.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
I just turned on the against me.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Yeah.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
This is our first time on the show together.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
And you're starting out saying that the headphones feel cheap on your head.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
You can't.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
No, you heard me.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
We're not sitting at the reference that I've been begging for people to let me record

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
in studio G.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Okay.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Here we are.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
And the first words out of mirrors mouth is that the headphones are bad.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
I didn't say that.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
You didn't disagree.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I mean, they are incredibly cheap.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
And this whole place is suddenly designed.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
This is crazy.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
But you co-signed.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
You guarantee.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Jake's quote.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
I do have some qualms with the studio G.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
You want to get in here for such a long time.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I mean, you're instantly upset.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
My main thing is I feel like the walls could have been a salmon.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Or a coal.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
I don't know.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Maybe like an off-brown.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Off-brown?

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Let's get the main thing.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
I mean, look at the background behind a mirror.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
It's sort of halfway.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
I don't want to get ahead of myself between a salmon or a cola.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Are you?

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
And his part of the frame looks very cherry.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
That's just one simple question you can answer.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Oh.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
That was a cold open.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Nice.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
With the button that are you fucking kidding me?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
It took us way.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Five minutes to stop recording.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Sorry.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Okay.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
I don't like what headphones do you guys use in yours?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I don't know, but they're not this.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Where's my camera?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
It's there.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
You're on the single.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
You're on the single.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
No headphones.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
We're going to hear you out.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
You look like you're not.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
I mean, you're a fangirl.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Do you think you're going to use a fan?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
It wasn't the York, it really is wait to them.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
I'm going to hold them and you slap them in the nose.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Oh, yeah.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
That's the perfect time for the first ever on your brothers.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
That was the perfect time 30 seconds into the episode.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Yeah, because she said she was like where is my camera.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
She said, where's my camera?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
She said, look at the camera.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Look into this camera.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Okay.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Here's what I have to say.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Every, here's what I've learned over my first two years here at head gum.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
You cannot design, this is too loud.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
You cannot design a studio by committee.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Everybody has their fucking little opinions.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
There's not one thing that I brought into either one of these studios

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
that hasn't been remarked upon by either co-worker

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
or one of our beautiful and talented hosts.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I just got a text out of nowhere.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
He's adjusting the cameras, sort of done this earlier.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I just got a text out of nowhere that apparently

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
my friend Nick Wyger of the Do Bois

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
would just want to rant in the other studio

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
about the new timers I bought that I thought

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
were really cute and easy to use.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Here's what I have to say.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
If you can't come up with stuff to talk about

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
on your podcast, that isn't something

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
that's directly in front of you like you're playing

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
fucking I spy.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
You should not be in this business.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I should be in the studio to work.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
You shouldn't mean either studio,

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
most of the time.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
But you do use the parking lot outside

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
as your personal car garage,

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
even though I've told you many times that we...

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
I'm not a car board.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Yeah.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Are they over night?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Over night?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Is it over night?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Over night?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Okay, you come pick it up in the morning.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
All the next day.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Yeah.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
That was hung over.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Yeah.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
That's not my problem.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
It's not my car.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
If I'm over, I can't claim that

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
because I can't drive that

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
because you can still have, by the way,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
alcohol in your blood,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
the day after if you drink enough.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
You should drink a drink.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
You should drink a drink.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
You have a hand drink.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I have a concuss.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
So this is turned out from an unused

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
druthers to like, let's all just come,

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Jeff's room.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
All this to say,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
if you have a problem with something

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
in the studio, you can talk to me about it off air.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I can't even know what,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
I'm gonna go to the heckpill before.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
I'm even at the room.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
I feel like I've...

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I feel like I've...

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
I need this whole entire room.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
I'm just gonna try nothing.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
I'm just not getting any more money.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
I'm just gonna try nothing.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
I'm just gonna try nothing.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
I'm just gonna try nothing.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
I'm just gonna try nothing.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
I'm just gonna try nothing.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm just gonna try nothing.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
I'm just gonna...

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
I'm gonna shake on some people.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I look like a headphone.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
I look like a studio gig.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
You're ain't different stories.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm sorry, but I am by the way.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Yeah, you know, that one's really big.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Not nicer.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
These are nicer.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Really?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I love studio G.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
I like it better than studio A.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I want to hear that either.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
What do you mean there are both nice?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
You really don't know.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
You really don't know.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah, she did.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
At the beginning?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
When Jeff had a problem with the pain,

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
was the day we were painting?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
That's when he came to me with suggestions for other paincuffs.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
It would have to be sparkle on your skin.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I have a Sampler.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
I have the card.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
It has a free job here.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
This is a free.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
This is a free.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
This is a free job.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
This is a cold one.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
This is actually bad because we haven't finished designing it yet.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
But it will be nice.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Let's see.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Let's see.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
I love this studio.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
I love every part of the studio.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I just wish it was a child dream.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
I just wish it was a free part of the studio.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Why do you want to be?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
When will we stop playing this music?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
It's driving me insane.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Why do you want to have fun?

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Why do you want to have fun?

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Why do you want the headphones to be heavy on your head?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
It's good that they're like.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Because heavy is the head that wears the crown.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
I don't like how wide the studio jeff.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Should we can we start over?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
This is.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
This is not how I thought.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
I don't need to.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
We've only ever gotten along.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
I've been enjoying the day because we're in studio.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Cheers.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
You're a food poise.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Love it.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
You are.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Jardia.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
You're a Nora man.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Yeah.

06:07.000 --> 06:17.000
I was going to say because I was trying to get Mike in here as well.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Here in the ear.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
And then your wig.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Studio H is what it is.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
We had the we had the space to work with that.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
We had we maximized it.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Right.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
We.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
The colors weren't quite there there.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
The content followed suit.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
And now we pray.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
Studio G in which what we have Jake Johnson recording.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Right.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
We're here to help podcast.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Yeah, of course in studio H as well.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Yeah.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Right.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I think it's more about the amount of people that it is.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
The, you know, caliber of guests.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
We don't think one is better than the other.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
That's just.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
It's the quantity of guests.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
It's the quantity between studio H and G.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Similar to me.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Yeah.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Here's what I'll say.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Yeah.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I feel like I have some ground rules for this episode.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Okay.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
And I feel like if I had started with those.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
We wouldn't have gotten into this negative feedback.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
We hope this oroboros of poison.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
And that we've entered into this episode.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
We different from all the others.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
If we say these ground rules.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Go ahead.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Number one is overlapping dialogue.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
We did that a lot.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Right.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Obviously we've adhered to that.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Yeah.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
These are the same ground rules from the previous.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
No.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Okay.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
This is actually bending our relationships.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
So keep going.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Yeah.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Number two is let's not delve too much into the past.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Right.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
For example, the studios already been built.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
There's nothing we can do.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Like, well, that's a great example as well.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Let's delve too much into the,

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
I don't know how you've been talking about the colors of the studios for.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Well, with the colors and doors.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
The colors are in the present because they're right here.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Yeah.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
They're not saying.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
But I mean, it's been asked.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
You might need to roll out salmon.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
How's he been doing?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
He's rolling.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah, for sure.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
I, uh, that's so annoying.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
I agree that we should not dwell on the studios of your,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
the studios of now.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Yeah.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I also think, you know, you guys have, like, the

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
What's the ground rule three?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
This is ground rule two.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
I know.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
I know.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
We haven't gotten quite through ground rule two.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
We have the Jake and Amir watch Jake and Amir.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
I know that that's great.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
But that's your guys' patreon.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Right.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
This is the headgun bug.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
So let's not dwell on the past.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
We're not.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Let's not move.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I paid him to mention instead of dwelling so much.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Yeah.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Yeah.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Okay.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Let's create new stuff.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
By the way, I got that.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
You didn't need to hammer it home to that.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
It's past home.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Not just home.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Yeah.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Back to the dugout, basically.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Sure.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Number three is if possible.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
This, I thought we were in studio H, right?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Mm-hmm.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Yeah.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
If possible, let's move into studio G.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
So we're already, we are here.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
We're already nailing ground rule number three,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
which is to record in studio G.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Uh-huh.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Uh-huh.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
If, if, and this one, we didn't do great on.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Uh-huh.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Number four was if on your has gripes with me,

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
sprinkle them in throughout the episode.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
No, I'm not just burying me all at once.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Okay.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
That's hard.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Yeah.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
I mean, I actually, I think it's,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I, what we did is arguably better.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
I have a suggestion.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
I don't know what I said and kind of sprinkled in throughout the episode.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
That's good.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Maybe we could even make them soundboard buttons.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Five is jig.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Let's not, let's not talk about the kid.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Right?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
My daughter.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
You have a kid.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
You didn't invent them.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Yeah.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I, I also, I had, I didn't bring her up.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
I know, but you might later on.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Yeah.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
I'm so tired.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
You clearly don't.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Chema cracked up when she was in my lap.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Did she?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I thought she was either laughing or crying.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I think she wrote when it comes to her.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Try to remember.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
She might have smiled.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
She might have smiled.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
She had a little bit of joy.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
My point today.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
That's where we go, right?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
You brought her up.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
I'm saying from now on, head to your fourth.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Five.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Probably rules.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Really mean rule.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Fine.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
I won't do it.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
The last rule is to enjoy the ride.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Okay.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Can we all just agree to try to have a good time?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
We can try.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I appreciate that.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I didn't.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
You, I would say you killed the mood, but it also started bad.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
Jake in a minute, two guys that are fine.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
In 2010, Jake dated.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
And all these code-sittered.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
Their success is less than earned.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Now, here's a one-off podcast.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Show the code.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
It's a segment.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
It's really hard.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Great things.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
All the heck of podcasts.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Great things.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
It's just better than segment.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
It's the best double head comes show.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
Now then, meet you perfect brown host.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Good name.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Oh my god.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I have COVID.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
You made this art for you.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
I did.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Really?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Pretty good.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
It looks great.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Yeah.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
The one on a left leg school.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
So, Ferris made a theme song for you?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Ferris has COVID.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
And he made that.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
I texted him.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
And he said, hey, first episode ever tomorrow of

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Dregments.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Yeah.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Dregments is the new segment on the

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
Hebgum podcast called Dregments, which is basically the point of this, the crux of the short.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Is to prove once and for all that it's hard to

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Shit to come up with new segments every week.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Okay.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
People give me a lot of guff.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
They're like, you got to put more effort into this shit.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
This is me putting more effort into it.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Yeah.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
That's great.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
You guys have a show where you have to come up with new segments every week.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
It's hard.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Yeah.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Yeah.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
It is hard.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Okay.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
You can come up with shitty ones.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I thought it was going to take the whole episode to get you to admit that.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Oh, really?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
We don't have to do the rest of it.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
What about this?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Is there anything beyond that art?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Yeah.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Is there a segment?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Do you have segments?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
They're like Dregments.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
This is like bottom of the barrel.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Dregments.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
So, what's an example of a Dregment?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
I'm so glad you're out.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
Dregments.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Welcome to Who's 101.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Who is 100?

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
This is based celebrities that are 101.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Is this based on when we did?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Who's 58 or who's 55?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Exactly.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
It's different ages.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Okay.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Who's 101?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I don't know anybody that's 100.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
It's William Shattner up there, isn't it?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
No way.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
They're over 100.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
There's no celebrity that's over 100.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I think Shattner's maybe pushing 80.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Betty White died at like 99.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Who's the guy that created all the sitcoms?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Chuck Lori.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Chuck Lori.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
No.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
No.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
No.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Older.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
And he recently passed.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
What about celebrities that?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Carl Reiner.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Weathers.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
No.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
He did pass.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
All right.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
I think Carl Reiner.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I think he was 101.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
What is a Rupert Murdock?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
How old is he?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Should we get a number of crunch on that?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
101 is so beyond the pit.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Like 95 is almost too old.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Rupert Murdock is 92.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
That's where he's still nine years shy of Murdock.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Sure.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
These are people who are born in 1920.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
These are people who are born with a gift.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
And the gift was to age old.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
I guess this game is just named the oldest celebrity we could think of.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Yeah.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Does anybody have anybody?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
I don't know.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
How old is Mel Brooks?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
That's part of the game.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
You look it up.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
90.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
90.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Is that possible?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
It's possible.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
97.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Oh.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Is that true?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Wow.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Yeah.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
He's still valuable.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
That's incredible.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
But it takes to this, right?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
It's cash.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Mm.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Norman Lear.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
You googled it.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
No.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
I asked someone.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
No, you didn't.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
I swear to God.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Who did you ask?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Google.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Uh.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
On his disqualified for googling.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
You're not allowed to be on your phone.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Obviously you did.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Well that puts an is enormous.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I think Norman Lear recently passed.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
So that's another reason.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
And he was literally 101.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
He was 101.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
But he's tall.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Yeah.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
They're no work in three days.

14:10.000 --> 14:10.840
I don't know where I can throw that.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.840
He doesn't exist any more.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.040
He died in deceit.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.240
He died in deceit.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.320
He's to the cyst.

14:18.320 --> 14:21.160
I know he has deceit.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.680
He's cease to de-sists.

14:24.680 --> 14:25.680
That's good.

14:25.680 --> 14:26.680
Come on.

14:26.680 --> 14:27.680
Let's get to a moment.

14:27.680 --> 14:29.320
Oh, Jimmy Carter.

14:29.320 --> 14:30.320
Oh, yes.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.320
Yes.

14:31.320 --> 14:32.320
He's still alive.

14:32.320 --> 14:33.320
He's still in hospice.

14:33.320 --> 14:34.320
He just celebrated one year in hospice.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.320
Wow.

14:35.320 --> 14:36.320
Could be 99.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.320
New celebrate that?

14:37.320 --> 14:39.320
Jimmy Carter is 99.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.320
Oh, yeah.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.320
You have to go until you guys get it.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.320
We almost nailed it.

14:43.320 --> 14:44.320
Is there someone that you haven't mind?

14:44.320 --> 14:45.320
Oh, yeah.

14:45.320 --> 14:46.320
I know.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.320
You know one celebrity.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.320
Celebrities.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.320
Kind of producing in this capacity.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.320
I'm sort of the KC of these brothers.

14:51.320 --> 14:55.320
I mean, older than Jimmy Carter is really tough.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.320
Yeah.

14:56.320 --> 14:59.320
We need someone who was like 80 in 90.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.320
Can I narrow 101?

15:01.320 --> 15:02.320
No.

15:02.320 --> 15:03.320
Like the kind of person.

15:03.320 --> 15:07.320
Like his actor, comedian, celebrity politician, architect,

15:07.320 --> 15:09.320
stage actress, and widow.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.320
Oh, famous widow.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.320
Whose famous for having a dead husband?

15:13.320 --> 15:15.320
Well, it's a woman architect.

15:15.320 --> 15:16.320
There's three.

15:16.320 --> 15:17.320
I have three that I was probably going to say.

15:17.320 --> 15:18.320
Is Nancy Reagan alive?

15:18.320 --> 15:20.320
Is Nancy Reagan alive?

15:20.320 --> 15:22.320
Do you hear yourself when you're gusting?

15:22.320 --> 15:23.320
No, she's dead.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.320
She's dead, right?

15:24.320 --> 15:25.320
Yes.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.320
She's dead, right?

15:26.320 --> 15:27.320
She's dead, right?

15:27.320 --> 15:28.320
She's dead, right?

15:28.320 --> 15:29.320
She's dead, right?

15:29.320 --> 15:30.320
She's dead.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.320
She's dead, right?

15:31.320 --> 15:32.320
She's dead, right?

15:32.320 --> 15:33.320
She's dead, right?

15:33.320 --> 15:34.320
She's dead.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.320
She's dead, right?

15:35.320 --> 15:36.320
She's dead, right?

15:36.320 --> 15:37.320
She's dead, right?

15:37.320 --> 15:38.320
She's dead, right?

15:38.320 --> 15:39.320
In Jesus Christ?

15:39.320 --> 15:40.320
Man.

15:40.320 --> 15:44.320
She's dead, right?

15:44.320 --> 15:45.320
That's Charles.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.320
She's dead, right?

15:46.320 --> 15:47.320
She's dead, right?

15:47.320 --> 15:48.320
She's dead, right?

15:48.320 --> 15:50.320
She's dead, right?

15:50.320 --> 15:51.320
Yeah.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.320
I mean, Carter is the leader in the clubhouse.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.320
So you guys have to get closer if you want.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.320
Yeah, that's really tough.

15:57.320 --> 15:58.320
At any point you guys can call.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.320
Are you tech widо and what?

16:00.320 --> 16:01.320
Stay, jackar.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.320
Those are three different people.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.320
One of them is a famous widow.

16:03.320 --> 16:07.320
It's like that they maybe did also music theater, right?

16:07.320 --> 16:10.320
Yeah, because Barbara Bush.

16:10.320 --> 16:13.320
Um, oh, that's not bad.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.320
Thank you.

16:14.320 --> 16:18.320
I love that you're in the political sphere, which is very interesting.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.320
I'm trying to get more of that.

16:19.320 --> 16:20.320
She's gone, right?

16:20.320 --> 16:21.320
Right.

16:21.320 --> 16:22.320
But it was 92.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.320
In 92.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.320
Um, is George H.W. alive?

16:25.320 --> 16:27.320
No, he's dead.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.320
Um, okay.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.320
You guys can call Drunkl any time.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.320
Who's Drunkl?

16:31.320 --> 16:32.320
Yeah, I don't mean like phone affeen.

16:32.320 --> 16:33.320
I mean like,

16:33.320 --> 16:34.320
I mean like,

16:34.320 --> 16:39.320
I mean like you can call Uncle and be like, I can't take the same thing.

16:39.320 --> 16:40.320
Uncle.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.320
Yeah.

16:41.320 --> 16:42.320
I'm cooler.

16:42.320 --> 16:43.320
Drunkl means I give up.

16:43.320 --> 16:44.320
Drunkl.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.320
I give up.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.320
I get up.

16:46.320 --> 16:47.320
Frank.

16:47.320 --> 16:48.320
Frank Erie.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.320
We were looking for

16:49.320 --> 16:51.320
Aslovian architect,

16:51.320 --> 16:55.320
Famous for designing the sand-if-your-town hall

16:55.320 --> 16:58.320
and the Norwegian Maritime Museum,

16:58.320 --> 17:04.520
and trond Elias, I thought he was going to get that even with a hint.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.120
He really won a one.

17:06.120 --> 17:07.920
You thought it seems younger.

17:07.920 --> 17:10.120
He was about to be a hundred and two.

17:10.120 --> 17:12.120
He's his birthday is in March.

17:12.120 --> 17:13.120
Yeah.

17:13.120 --> 17:15.920
He's going to say he's a Pisces for sure.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.720
Do you think he's going to be on the today's show smoker segment?

17:18.720 --> 17:20.720
I don't think he can make it out of bed anymore.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.320
Who's the famous widow?

17:22.320 --> 17:27.520
Rachel Robinson, Jackie Robinson's wife, former wife.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.120
He is gone.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.120
Also would have taken Janus Page.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.920
Stage actress in a way.

17:34.920 --> 17:38.320
And Norman Lear, Norman Lear was the one that I thought somebody might actually guess.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.120
I did guess it.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.120
You googled it.

17:40.120 --> 17:40.720
I did not.

17:40.720 --> 17:41.520
I texted Nick.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.320
Really?

17:42.320 --> 17:42.720
Yeah.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.920
He's been to his house a lot.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.320
Wait, how old is Nick?

17:45.320 --> 17:46.120
Wow.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.320
He's older.

17:47.320 --> 17:47.920
He's not one.

17:47.920 --> 17:48.920
No one.

17:48.920 --> 17:49.720
To 35.

17:49.720 --> 17:50.320
He looks great.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.120
I almost nailed Nick.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.120
What did he mean?

17:53.120 --> 17:53.920
His age.

17:53.920 --> 17:54.920
That's it.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.720
Good thing he doesn't listen to the show.

18:03.720 --> 18:07.720
It's this portion of the show that I had opened for Huta.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.920
Fucking give your brothers.

18:09.920 --> 18:10.920
I already did it.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.920
So I don't know what else because we have 12 minutes before the next one.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.920
So we shouldn't have assigned that to Ferris.

18:15.920 --> 18:16.120
Yeah.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.520
I was going to say that wasn't for Huta.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.520
So there was only one fragment.

18:21.520 --> 18:22.920
It's fragments, plural.

18:22.920 --> 18:23.920
No, there's a lot.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.920
I just the next one is timed, right?

18:25.920 --> 18:26.920
What do you mean?

18:27.320 --> 18:30.720
I had 12 minutes to talk about how you shouldn't park your car.

18:30.720 --> 18:34.920
I thought who's 101 was going to take like 15.

18:34.920 --> 18:35.720
How long did it take?

18:35.720 --> 18:37.120
I felt like it took 30 minutes.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.520
Sure, yeah.

18:38.520 --> 18:39.920
I thought it was going to be less.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.120
We'd time it out perfect.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.120
It's okay to wax.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.520
It's okay to have fun.

18:44.520 --> 18:47.120
We're in the studio at the same time.

18:47.120 --> 18:47.920
Fine.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.520
Honestly, Jake being here is more of like an exciting moment

18:50.520 --> 18:51.120
in a moment.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.920
It's a occasion in a different studio.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.520
Like Jake has a done this show in six months.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.720
And I would agree with you because he hasn't done the show on a bit.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.920
Since you're, we've never done the show here.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.320
He's been on the show before.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.520
We've never done it in studio.

19:01.520 --> 19:02.920
But this doesn't really matter.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.320
It doesn't affect the show.

19:04.320 --> 19:05.320
What is this?

19:05.320 --> 19:06.120
You could've done this.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.920
Blood sweat and sweat equity.

19:07.920 --> 19:08.720
Blood equity.

19:08.720 --> 19:09.720
Blood equity.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.120
Now you put into this shit.

19:11.120 --> 19:13.320
And call a pain.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.520
I don't, I just sort of want to do this matter with paints on the wall.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.320
She worked her fucking asshole for this shit.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.320
Don't let him case you.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.320
I don't think it's funny to do it as a bit.

19:21.320 --> 19:24.320
I thought you can't make fun of her or give her praise.

19:24.320 --> 19:25.720
He's not giving me praise.

19:26.320 --> 19:26.920
He's not.

19:26.920 --> 19:27.920
I do mean this.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.320
It was fake and faint.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.720
It was not faint.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.120
It was praise.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.720
Whether it was being sarcastic or not.

19:33.720 --> 19:34.920
It's a dealer.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.120
The praise, but it was real.

19:36.120 --> 19:37.720
I think the studio is amazing.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.720
I have a note, which is cola.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.720
But that doesn't mean the studio is not a break.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.120
I've been begging them to let me.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.320
We get enough feedback.

19:44.320 --> 19:47.320
I think in the YouTube comments that you, you're, it's covered.

19:47.320 --> 19:47.920
What are they?

19:47.920 --> 19:48.520
About you think.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.320
Just in general.

19:49.320 --> 19:52.320
People are trying to say like, oh, you guys should have edited this a little bit.

19:52.920 --> 19:53.920
I'm an editor.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.520
I know if you'd like to hear it from someone who's,

19:56.520 --> 19:57.920
I've been in the industry for a long time.

19:57.920 --> 19:58.920
Sweet.

19:58.920 --> 20:02.120
If you have anything to say about the editing or the style of the studio.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.320
Sound off in the comments.

20:03.320 --> 20:03.920
I want to hear it.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.520
Well, it's hard because I'm going to edit this, right?

20:05.520 --> 20:06.920
So it's like, I don't really know if I want to.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.720
If you have anything to say about Jeff, sound off in the comments.

20:09.720 --> 20:10.720
I don't know about that.

20:10.720 --> 20:12.120
Because I feel like they already sound off.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.320
And that's without permission.

20:13.320 --> 20:13.920
Yeah.

20:13.920 --> 20:14.920
It is pretty much speech.

20:14.920 --> 20:15.920
They can express themselves.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.720
I don't know if it's good for the comment because it's like,

20:17.720 --> 20:19.920
engage my and gets like the video up in the algorithms.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.120
And I appreciate that.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.320
I just wish that the reason why it's going up in the algorithm is.

20:24.320 --> 20:25.520
It's still cut as well.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.120
I think people should just say what they want.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.720
And if it turns out that it's negative,

20:29.720 --> 20:31.520
then you should take that as.

20:31.520 --> 20:34.520
But I'm not even open kind of a sign that you criticism.

20:34.520 --> 20:34.720
Yeah.

20:34.720 --> 20:35.520
That makes it clearly.

20:35.520 --> 20:35.720
Yeah.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.520
It seems to give you a very thin skin.

20:37.520 --> 20:37.920
Yeah.

20:37.920 --> 20:38.320
Yeah.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.720
No, it's like that, you know,

20:39.720 --> 20:41.120
obviously the layers there.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.320
But I was going to say here.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.120
It's sort of a mirror.

20:43.120 --> 20:43.520
Yeah.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.920
It's it's it's it's I'm I'm bolting.

20:45.920 --> 20:46.320
Yeah.

20:46.320 --> 20:47.920
I'm sort of translucent.

20:47.920 --> 20:48.520
Yeah.

20:48.520 --> 20:49.720
I'm shedding my previous.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.920
Skin, which was thin for another one.

20:51.920 --> 20:52.120
Yeah.

20:52.120 --> 20:52.920
That's more of a neary.

20:52.920 --> 20:53.120
Yeah.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.520
Like a snake.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.320
Like a reptile.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.720
You're a reptilian, man.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.520
I fear veneer.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.120
Yeah.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.720
It's I'm in mesh with the idea of having a.

21:02.720 --> 21:03.720
Does that make sense?

21:03.720 --> 21:04.320
It does.

21:05.320 --> 21:06.720
He had the mesh.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.120
He had the skin.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.920
That was mesh.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.520
It was in meshed.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.720
It was a graveyard.

21:14.720 --> 21:16.120
His name was mesh.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.720
Um, so.

21:20.520 --> 21:20.720
All right.

21:20.720 --> 21:21.120
Well, we're done.

21:21.120 --> 21:21.920
I, there's a similar.

21:21.920 --> 21:22.720
We're not done.

21:23.720 --> 21:23.920
Yeah.

21:23.920 --> 21:24.720
It's a fucking gun.

21:25.520 --> 21:27.120
I saw him flashing a gap.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.520
Jake tried to tell me.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.320
I knew the gun.

21:29.920 --> 21:30.520
Yeah.

21:30.520 --> 21:30.920
Yeah.

21:31.320 --> 21:32.120
I suggested.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.720
I heard what I was hoarding now.

21:33.720 --> 21:34.720
Like the zoom started.

21:34.720 --> 21:34.920
Right.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.520
I asked if you had a gun.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.320
And then you said, no, you said, we should get you one.

21:38.320 --> 21:38.720
Yeah.

21:38.720 --> 21:39.920
Well, when you said, you didn't have one.

21:39.920 --> 21:40.920
I said, we should get you a gun.

21:41.320 --> 21:41.520
Right.

21:41.520 --> 21:41.720
Right.

21:41.720 --> 21:41.920
Right.

21:41.920 --> 21:42.120
Nice.

21:42.120 --> 21:42.520
Yeah.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.320
So I didn't come out of nowhere.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.720
I said, do you have a gun?

21:45.720 --> 21:46.720
I said, no.

21:46.720 --> 21:47.720
Yeah.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.120
Then I said, we should get you a clock or at least a nice musket.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.120
Yeah.

21:53.120 --> 21:56.520
You guys play a game on your show called Mystery Guest.

21:56.520 --> 21:57.520
Right.

21:57.520 --> 21:58.520
Is that fair to say?

21:58.520 --> 21:59.520
Yeah.

21:59.520 --> 22:00.520
I'm buying time.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.120
You said a lot of unfair things.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.520
But that back was definitely not.

22:08.920 --> 22:13.520
This is the segment I like to call shivering guest, George Saba.

22:13.920 --> 22:17.720
She can't just guess at a nowhere.

22:18.720 --> 22:19.720
And that's not correct.

22:19.720 --> 22:20.720
That's not correct.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.120
Um, Riley and spa.

22:23.120 --> 22:24.120
Shut up.

22:25.120 --> 22:25.720
Right.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.120
Did you think that rhymed?

22:27.120 --> 22:27.720
Is it mild?

22:27.720 --> 22:29.120
Mystery with my husband here.

22:29.120 --> 22:30.120
My husband's here.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.920
Why do you keep on playing the intro?

22:32.920 --> 22:36.120
Because I'm trying to have another fucking edit point where I can get rid of your

22:36.120 --> 22:37.120
guys nonsense, right?

22:37.120 --> 22:38.120
Here we go.

22:38.120 --> 22:41.320
This is a segment I like to call shivering guest.

22:41.320 --> 22:42.520
My husband's in your way.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.520
Just let me introduce the segment first, right?

22:45.520 --> 22:45.720
Okay.

22:45.720 --> 22:46.720
Yeah.

22:46.720 --> 22:49.120
This is just like mystery guest.

22:49.120 --> 22:53.920
Only in this version, our mystery guest is currently standing outside

22:53.920 --> 22:57.120
in a below freezing climate without a jacket.

22:57.120 --> 23:00.120
It's like outside the studio in a cold climate.

23:00.120 --> 23:00.720
Right.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.120
Like right outside the studio.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.520
Well, it's not a cold climate.

23:03.520 --> 23:04.720
Here's not blood freezing.

23:05.920 --> 23:09.920
Shivering guest, can you text in the chat to let us know that you're here

23:09.920 --> 23:12.520
and that you are outside?

23:15.520 --> 23:16.920
Why can you hear them breathing?

23:16.920 --> 23:17.920
Yeah.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.920
Also mute yourself, everyone else.

23:19.920 --> 23:20.920
Obviously.

23:20.920 --> 23:23.920
Your teeth chattering is very distracting.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.920
Shivering guest.

23:25.920 --> 23:28.920
I need you to be colder, shivering guest.

23:28.920 --> 23:31.920
Shivering guest, you can also text me.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.920
You're too cold.

23:33.920 --> 23:36.920
Did you freeze to death, shivering guest?

23:36.920 --> 23:40.920
Yes, but the sweater on until you go live, shivering guest.

23:40.920 --> 23:41.920
We need to get them one of those.

23:41.920 --> 23:42.920
I am outside.

23:42.920 --> 23:43.920
Okay, great.

23:43.920 --> 23:44.920
Chatted.

23:44.920 --> 23:45.920
I am outside.

23:45.920 --> 23:46.920
All right.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.920
So you guys all get 20 guesses collectively.

23:48.920 --> 23:49.920
Okay.

23:49.920 --> 23:50.920
20 guesses total.

23:50.920 --> 23:51.920
Let's guess where they are first.

23:51.920 --> 23:52.920
Right.

23:52.920 --> 23:53.920
I'm most curious if it's here in New York.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.920
I don't think it has to be New York.

23:55.920 --> 23:56.920
Well, we can ask that.

23:56.920 --> 23:57.920
Yeah.

23:57.920 --> 23:58.920
Should we ask questions?

23:58.920 --> 24:00.920
Are you standing outside in New York?

24:00.920 --> 24:01.920
Shivering guest.

24:01.920 --> 24:02.920
Are you in New York City?

24:03.920 --> 24:05.920
40 minutes later.

24:05.920 --> 24:06.920
I'm like.

24:06.920 --> 24:08.920
Great question.

24:08.920 --> 24:09.920
Yes.

24:09.920 --> 24:10.920
Okay.

24:10.920 --> 24:11.920
Okay.

24:11.920 --> 24:12.920
So truly a freezing climate.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.920
So who would Jeff Ashton?

24:14.920 --> 24:15.920
Johnny.

24:15.920 --> 24:16.920
Johnny's my first guess also.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.920
Do you want to jump straight to guessing names?

24:19.920 --> 24:21.920
By the way, you've already guessed.

24:21.920 --> 24:22.920
Is it George Saba?

24:22.920 --> 24:23.920
Is it Riley Foss?

24:23.920 --> 24:24.920
Riley Foss?

24:24.920 --> 24:26.920
You made an edit cup.

24:26.920 --> 24:28.920
You reintroduced that.

24:28.920 --> 24:29.920
Did you?

24:29.920 --> 24:31.920
So why are we going to be down to guesses for that?

24:31.920 --> 24:33.920
Well, we can't edit this out.

24:33.920 --> 24:34.920
Like a guest.

24:34.920 --> 24:35.920
Johnny Villa.

24:35.920 --> 24:36.920
All right.

24:36.920 --> 24:37.920
Shivering guest.

24:37.920 --> 24:38.920
Are you Johnny Villa?

24:46.920 --> 24:48.920
Not Johnny Villa.

24:48.920 --> 24:49.920
Okay.

24:49.920 --> 24:50.920
So it's someone in New York.

24:50.920 --> 24:51.920
It was a full sentence.

24:51.920 --> 24:52.920
That it says.

24:52.920 --> 24:53.920
I'm not Johnny Villa.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.920
Feels comfortable asking to stand outside.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.920
I think you I wouldn't put it past you to ask Marita.

24:58.920 --> 24:59.920
But I don't think she'd do it.

24:59.920 --> 25:02.920
She should we ask if this person that I've ever done this podcast before?

25:02.920 --> 25:03.920
Oh, that's not going to help.

25:03.920 --> 25:04.920
Sorry.

25:04.920 --> 25:05.920
Yes, it will.

25:05.920 --> 25:06.920
Ask.

25:06.920 --> 25:07.920
Help a lot.

25:07.920 --> 25:08.920
Ask.

25:08.920 --> 25:09.920
Shivering guest.

25:09.920 --> 25:10.920
Have you been on this podcast before?

25:10.920 --> 25:11.920
Shivering guest.

25:11.920 --> 25:12.920
Have you been on this podcast before?

25:12.920 --> 25:13.920
The audio is here.

25:13.920 --> 25:14.920
So I have to repeat everything.

25:14.920 --> 25:15.920
Yes.

25:15.920 --> 25:16.920
Yes.

25:16.920 --> 25:17.920
Okay.

25:17.920 --> 25:18.920
All right.

25:18.920 --> 25:19.920
Hang on.

25:19.920 --> 25:20.920
Wait.

25:20.920 --> 25:21.920
Should we ask?

25:21.920 --> 25:22.920
Not to be binary.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.920
But should we ask if it is a male or a female?

25:24.920 --> 25:25.920
We are at the very least.

25:25.920 --> 25:26.920
Yeah.

25:26.920 --> 25:27.920
Yeah.

25:27.920 --> 25:28.920
Do you identify it?

25:28.920 --> 25:29.920
Does the shivering guest or no?

25:29.920 --> 25:30.920
The shivering guest?

25:30.920 --> 25:31.920
I identify female.

25:31.920 --> 25:32.920
As a woman.

25:32.920 --> 25:33.920
Yeah.

25:33.920 --> 25:36.920
Yes.

25:36.920 --> 25:37.920
Okay.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.920
A freezing cold woman in New York.

25:39.920 --> 25:40.920
Shivering guest.

25:40.920 --> 25:41.920
Do you work?

25:41.920 --> 25:42.920
Yeah.

25:42.920 --> 25:43.920
Do you work at head gum?

25:43.920 --> 25:44.920
Do you work for headgum?

25:44.920 --> 25:45.920
Shivering guest.

25:45.920 --> 25:46.920
Do you work at headgum?

25:46.920 --> 25:47.920
I think that's it.

25:47.920 --> 25:48.920
Yeah.

25:48.920 --> 25:49.920
We've been on the show.

25:49.920 --> 25:50.920
Yeah.

25:50.920 --> 25:51.920
It could be like a podcast.

25:51.920 --> 25:52.920
Yes.

25:52.920 --> 25:53.920
All right.

25:53.920 --> 25:54.920
We've got.

25:54.920 --> 25:55.920
Okay.

25:55.920 --> 25:56.920
So I mean, we're definitely going to get it.

25:56.920 --> 25:57.920
Okay.

25:57.920 --> 25:58.920
Right.

25:58.920 --> 25:59.920
Sage or.

25:59.920 --> 26:00.920
It could be Sage.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.920
Sage has been on the show before.

26:02.920 --> 26:03.920
Yeah.

26:03.920 --> 26:04.920
Poor Sage.

26:04.920 --> 26:05.920
If it's Sage.

26:05.920 --> 26:06.920
Yeah.

26:06.920 --> 26:08.920
If it's Sage or enthroned.

26:08.920 --> 26:09.920
No.

26:09.920 --> 26:10.920
Hey.

26:10.920 --> 26:11.920
Shivering guest.

26:11.920 --> 26:12.920
Leave the zoom.

26:12.920 --> 26:13.920
It was Emma.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.920
I guess we got to guess Emma.

26:15.920 --> 26:16.920
I guess we got to guess Emma.

26:16.920 --> 26:17.920
Emma.

26:17.920 --> 26:18.920
I think.

26:18.920 --> 26:19.920
Well.

26:19.920 --> 26:20.920
Yeah.

26:20.920 --> 26:21.920
Who do you want to guess?

26:21.920 --> 26:22.920
How about is it Emma or Marieco?

26:22.920 --> 26:23.920
We'll get it.

26:23.920 --> 26:24.920
Okay.

26:24.920 --> 26:25.920
The question is shivering guest.

26:25.920 --> 26:27.920
Is your name Emma or Marieco?

26:27.920 --> 26:33.920
But you only answer yes or no.

26:33.920 --> 26:34.920
Wow.

26:34.920 --> 26:35.920
What a nailed it.

26:35.920 --> 26:36.920
Yes.

26:36.920 --> 26:37.920
So now we can narrow it down.

26:37.920 --> 26:38.920
It's got to be either Emma or Marieco.

26:38.920 --> 26:39.920
So yeah.

26:39.920 --> 26:40.920
We know that you knew that we know that.

26:40.920 --> 26:41.920
I don't know.

26:41.920 --> 26:42.920
I guess that question.

26:42.920 --> 26:43.920
Okay.

26:43.920 --> 26:44.920
How do we narrow it down?

26:44.920 --> 26:45.920
Because I just don't.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.920
It's going to be boring to say is it Emma.

26:47.920 --> 26:48.920
Marieco.

26:48.920 --> 26:52.920
So Emma is more of like, she would play Kate Jeff and stand outside.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.920
We wouldn't want to play Kate Jeff but does not mind suffering.

26:55.920 --> 26:56.920
I would say.

26:56.920 --> 26:57.920
What?

26:57.920 --> 26:58.920
Why don't we take a vote?

26:58.920 --> 26:59.920
Sure we guess.

26:59.920 --> 27:01.920
This does not count as a guest.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.920
Are you hearing like the guests?

27:03.920 --> 27:04.920
Or can you only hear me?

27:04.920 --> 27:09.920
I am hearing the girl.

27:09.920 --> 27:10.920
Okay.

27:10.920 --> 27:11.920
Do we want to know?

27:11.920 --> 27:13.920
So did you heard Jake say that you're fine with suffering?

27:13.920 --> 27:14.920
No.

27:14.920 --> 27:15.920
Marieco.

27:15.920 --> 27:16.920
I don't know.

27:16.920 --> 27:17.920
Just whoever it is.

27:17.920 --> 27:18.920
No.

27:18.920 --> 27:19.920
He said.

27:19.920 --> 27:20.920
Tell me.

27:20.920 --> 27:21.920
You said you were fine with suffering.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.920
You said that the person is fine with suffering.

27:24.920 --> 27:25.920
It's Marieco.

27:25.920 --> 27:26.920
Shivering guests.

27:26.920 --> 27:27.920
Oh.

27:27.920 --> 27:28.920
Turn on your camera.

27:28.920 --> 27:29.920
Yeah.

27:29.920 --> 27:30.920
You caught that.

27:30.920 --> 27:32.920
That's on me.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.920
I've never played Mr. Just before.

27:34.920 --> 27:35.920
Are you cold?

27:35.920 --> 27:38.920
Well, Jeff didn't tell me to not wear a coat.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.920
So I am wearing my coat.

27:40.920 --> 27:41.920
That's a shit.

27:41.920 --> 27:42.920
I just want to never have that.

27:42.920 --> 27:44.920
Just guess.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.920
But are you shivering?

27:46.920 --> 27:48.920
A little bit.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.920
But maybe out of anxiety for being a suit.

27:51.920 --> 27:52.920
It is nerve wracking.

27:52.920 --> 27:53.920
That's all right.

27:53.920 --> 27:54.920
I'm very good.

27:54.920 --> 27:55.920
Very good.

27:55.920 --> 27:56.920
Good guess.

27:56.920 --> 27:57.920
Thank you Marieco.

27:57.920 --> 27:58.920
Good job.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.920
Any parting with play?

28:00.920 --> 28:01.920
Any plugs?

28:01.920 --> 28:03.920
Um.

28:03.920 --> 28:04.920
No.

28:04.920 --> 28:05.920
Follow me.

28:05.920 --> 28:06.920
Do you want to know about it?

28:06.920 --> 28:07.920
I'm going.

28:07.920 --> 28:08.920
Oh my god.

28:08.920 --> 28:09.920
Thank you.

28:09.920 --> 28:10.920
Dave.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.920
Marieco, do you want to know how the episode is going?

28:12.920 --> 28:14.920
Sorry.

28:14.920 --> 28:15.920
I can't hear you.

28:15.920 --> 28:18.920
I'm just as do you want to know how the episode is going?

28:18.920 --> 28:19.920
I do.

28:19.920 --> 28:20.920
Not well.

28:20.920 --> 28:21.920
She says not well.

28:21.920 --> 28:22.920
Yeah.

28:22.920 --> 28:23.920
Did you like the art?

28:23.920 --> 28:24.920
No.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.920
The art looks really good.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.920
I think the episodes are hit.

28:28.920 --> 28:31.920
The song was awesome.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.920
The segments are awesome.

28:33.920 --> 28:34.920
Yeah.

28:34.920 --> 28:35.920
All right.

28:35.920 --> 28:36.920
Thank you Marieco.

28:36.920 --> 28:37.920
I'm Marieco.

28:37.920 --> 28:38.920
Bye.

28:38.920 --> 28:39.920
She can't see us.

28:39.920 --> 28:40.920
Right.

28:40.920 --> 28:41.920
That makes sense.

28:41.920 --> 28:42.920
Maybe when she watches this later.

28:50.920 --> 28:52.920
Um, we've come to the final drag man.

28:52.920 --> 28:53.920
You're right.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.920
The Ferrisis COVID.

28:55.920 --> 28:56.920
Ferris does have COVID.

28:56.920 --> 28:57.920
Yeah.

28:57.920 --> 28:58.920
He better Ferris.

28:58.920 --> 29:01.920
When he sang that, he was not feeling well.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.920
He actually, I have a text from him that says,

29:03.920 --> 29:05.920
They're bringing me to the ER.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.920
I'm going to get intubated.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.920
And then, and those replies.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.920
Can you just in the file first?

29:11.920 --> 29:12.920
Yeah.

29:12.920 --> 29:13.920
This.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.920
Can you see if I can still have head gum health insurance?

29:15.920 --> 29:18.920
It's a corrector picking up in the background.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.920
He said, I'm mid-COVID right now.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.920
Don't think that because I asked him if he wanted to guess

29:22.920 --> 29:23.920
on the show on Friday.

29:23.920 --> 29:24.920
He said, I don't think I'll be 100%.

29:24.920 --> 29:27.920
So even after knowing he had COVID, I said,

29:27.920 --> 29:29.920
OK, wait, I just have to ask.

29:29.920 --> 29:31.920
Please say no if you're not feeling well enough.

29:31.920 --> 29:32.920
Oh, my God.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.920
But if I send you the lyrics to a parody theme song of segments,

29:35.920 --> 29:37.920
could you sing a scratch track of it?

29:37.920 --> 29:39.920
I think it'd be even funnier if it sounds.

29:39.920 --> 29:43.920
If you sound sick, and the recording isn't high quality.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.920
It was pretty good.

29:45.920 --> 29:47.920
And then you asked him to be the shivering guy.

29:48.920 --> 29:51.920
That was my backup because he wouldn't have had to be outside.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.920
Right, he already has a few like symptoms.

29:53.920 --> 29:56.920
Ferris says, not as bad as I thought, as he sends me the scratch track.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.920
If you had tried me yesterday, I might have thrown up.

29:59.920 --> 30:00.920
So he's trying to go.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.920
We do need to take a break, actually.

30:02.920 --> 30:03.920
So.

30:03.920 --> 30:04.920
Yeah, that's what has been the perfect time.

30:10.920 --> 30:12.920
This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.

30:12.920 --> 30:15.920
Guys, one of the most relationships.

30:15.920 --> 30:18.920
I'm most proud of in my life is the one that I have with a mirror,

30:18.920 --> 30:19.920
who's sitting right here.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.920
I mean, it's an incredible working relationship.

30:21.920 --> 30:22.920
Wouldn't you say?

30:22.920 --> 30:23.920
No.

30:23.920 --> 30:34.920
Well, a common misconception about relationships is that they have to be easy to be right.

30:34.920 --> 30:39.920
But sometimes the best ones happen when people put in the work to make them great.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.920
By the way, we're doing a better help at, obviously.

30:43.920 --> 30:47.920
Therapy can be a great place to work through the challenges you face in all of your relationships,

30:47.920 --> 30:50.920
whether with friends, work, your significant other or anyone.

30:50.920 --> 30:54.920
That's why I benefit from therapy by going thriceweekly a mirror.

30:54.920 --> 30:55.920
Did you know that about me?

30:55.920 --> 30:56.920
No.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.920
Whether you've been in therapy personally or not,

31:00.920 --> 31:05.920
it's always a good time to try it out, to see if it's working for you to better yourself.

31:05.920 --> 31:08.920
And BetterHelp is a great place to start.

31:08.920 --> 31:11.920
So if you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try.

31:32.920 --> 31:33.920
Thanks, BetterHelp.

31:33.920 --> 31:38.920
Maybe if we compliment them a lot, he'll sort of feel uncomfortable for the first time on this podcast.

31:38.920 --> 31:39.920
That's impressive.

31:39.920 --> 31:50.920
And we don't let people don't know that because of how much you fuck things up.

31:50.920 --> 31:51.920
That's what I was going to say.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.920
But you're really good at a lot of different things.

31:53.920 --> 31:54.920
He's also really intelligent.

31:54.920 --> 31:56.920
He almost got like a perfect SAT score.

31:56.920 --> 31:57.920
Really smart.

31:57.920 --> 31:58.920
People don't know that.

31:58.920 --> 31:59.920
That was a story of his class.

31:59.920 --> 32:00.920
It was a no-high open.

32:00.920 --> 32:01.920
You're impressive.

32:01.920 --> 32:02.920
You're an impressive guy.

32:02.920 --> 32:03.920
Yeah.

32:03.920 --> 32:04.920
Yeah.

32:04.920 --> 32:05.920
Poesy or no-es-y.

32:05.920 --> 32:06.920
What?

32:07.920 --> 32:13.920
The next drag man is Poesy or no-es-y.

32:13.920 --> 32:14.920
Okay.

32:14.920 --> 32:17.920
This is pretty much an airlift.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.920
Poesy or no-es-y.

32:19.920 --> 32:20.920
These are not kidding.

32:20.920 --> 32:22.920
This is just Poetry or no-etry.

32:22.920 --> 32:23.920
But I kind of punched it up.

32:23.920 --> 32:24.920
You were saying I was intelligent.

32:24.920 --> 32:25.920
I kind of appreciated that.

32:25.920 --> 32:27.920
It's not just Poetry.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.920
It's actually Poetry as well.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.920
It's not sort of a Poetry.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.920
Poetry is just a synonym for Poetry.

32:33.920 --> 32:34.920
No, it's it.

32:34.920 --> 32:35.920
Yeah, it is.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.920
There's a whole tiny way of saying Poetry.

32:37.920 --> 32:38.920
Have you heard that?

32:38.920 --> 32:39.920
No, never.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.920
But I don't know, maybe.

32:41.920 --> 32:42.920
Maybe.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.920
He didn't get it almost perfect score as I say.

32:44.920 --> 32:45.920
Poesy.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.920
Now, the art and composition of Poetry.

32:47.920 --> 32:48.920
That's weird.

32:48.920 --> 32:51.920
That is a word that sounds like the other word.

32:51.920 --> 32:52.920
So it's actually not Poetry.

32:52.920 --> 32:53.920
It's the composition of Poetry.

32:53.920 --> 32:57.920
So you're going to read three poems.

32:57.920 --> 33:00.920
Is it the same exact segment as our show segments?

33:00.920 --> 33:03.920
I ran out of time to come up with a brand new drag man.

33:04.920 --> 33:05.920
But writing a poem is difficult.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.920
You didn't come up with other new ones either.

33:07.920 --> 33:08.920
Who's a hunter in one?

33:08.920 --> 33:09.920
It was a punch show.

33:09.920 --> 33:10.920
And then mystery.

33:10.920 --> 33:11.920
And then mystery.

33:11.920 --> 33:12.920
Everybody.

33:12.920 --> 33:13.920
Yes.

33:15.920 --> 33:16.920
Show me just.

33:16.920 --> 33:17.920
Just do in punch downs.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.920
It's a punch down.

33:19.920 --> 33:20.920
It's a punch down.

33:20.920 --> 33:21.920
All right.

33:21.920 --> 33:22.920
You guys ready?

33:22.920 --> 33:23.920
Yeah.

33:23.920 --> 33:24.920
For sure.

33:26.920 --> 33:29.920
Well, so which should we explain to anybody who listens to this show,

33:29.920 --> 33:31.920
but not me and Amir show what this segment is.

33:31.920 --> 33:32.920
Poetry.

33:33.920 --> 33:34.920
You definitely.

33:34.920 --> 33:36.920
Do you want to come and do the whole show?

33:36.920 --> 33:37.920
No, I haven't.

33:37.920 --> 33:38.920
I don't think I spoke out of turn.

33:38.920 --> 33:39.920
Yeah.

33:39.920 --> 33:40.920
I think I'm saying anything.

33:40.920 --> 33:41.920
Sure, really.

33:41.920 --> 33:42.920
Yeah.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.920
You guys pitch it and you guys complex segments.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.920
But again, no one who listens to segments, by the way.

33:47.920 --> 33:49.920
Doesn't listen to drag.

33:49.920 --> 33:50.920
Why?

33:50.920 --> 33:51.920
So they already know.

33:51.920 --> 33:52.920
The segment.

33:52.920 --> 33:53.920
No.

33:53.920 --> 33:54.920
Yeah.

33:54.920 --> 33:55.920
I don't know.

33:55.920 --> 33:56.920
Like some of us.

33:56.920 --> 33:57.920
Okay.

33:57.920 --> 33:58.920
So the segment is.

33:58.920 --> 33:59.920
We read three poems.

33:59.920 --> 34:00.920
Two of them real.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.920
We read them that either a mirror or I wrote.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.920
And we try to guess.

34:04.920 --> 34:05.920
You know, which one?

34:05.920 --> 34:06.920
That's a good segment.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.920
Just to get shoulders back and maybe screw.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.920
But back to like your.

34:10.920 --> 34:11.920
I'm fine.

34:11.920 --> 34:12.920
You're.

34:12.920 --> 34:13.920
Yeah.

34:13.920 --> 34:14.920
If you're all right with fine.

34:14.920 --> 34:15.920
Yeah.

34:15.920 --> 34:16.920
Here we go.

34:16.920 --> 34:19.920
Tinkle, tinkle, little car.

34:19.920 --> 34:22.920
How I wonder what you are.

34:22.920 --> 34:25.920
Leaking oil every day.

34:25.920 --> 34:28.920
Having it your own way.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.920
Going up hills real slow.

34:32.920 --> 34:36.920
I don't want you any more.

34:36.920 --> 34:38.920
Tinkle, tinkle.

34:38.920 --> 34:40.920
Little car.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.920
Boy what a lemon.

34:42.920 --> 34:44.920
You are.

34:44.920 --> 34:46.920
Let's hear the second one.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.920
It's not good, but it's like.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.920
You might have the pressure of as a liberic.

34:50.920 --> 34:51.920
Yeah.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.920
Every word rhyme that thing.

34:53.920 --> 34:54.920
Okay.

34:54.920 --> 34:55.920
Go ahead.

34:55.920 --> 34:56.920
With itself.

34:57.920 --> 34:58.920
What do you, what does that mean?

34:58.920 --> 34:59.920
Everywhere.

34:59.920 --> 35:00.920
Every, every end of the word.

35:00.920 --> 35:01.920
I do go into the line.

35:01.920 --> 35:02.920
Every line.

35:02.920 --> 35:03.920
Yeah.

35:03.920 --> 35:04.920
Okay.

35:04.920 --> 35:09.920
A funny young fellow named Perkins was terribly fond of small

35:09.920 --> 35:10.920
Gorkins.

35:10.920 --> 35:11.920
So this is the Limerick.

35:11.920 --> 35:14.920
One day after T.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.920
He ate 93.

35:16.920 --> 35:20.920
And pickled his internal workings.

35:20.920 --> 35:21.920
That one's pretty good.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.920
And I don't think you wrote anything there.

35:23.920 --> 35:24.920
Yeah.

35:24.920 --> 35:25.920
Okay.

35:26.920 --> 35:29.920
I don't think you wrote the lemon car one either.

35:29.920 --> 35:30.920
Interesting.

35:30.920 --> 35:31.920
So I think the last one is going to be you.

35:31.920 --> 35:32.920
Let's take a listen.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.920
Where do you think you found the car one?

35:34.920 --> 35:35.920
He just searched Tinkle, Tinkle,

35:35.920 --> 35:36.920
Tinkle little car.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.920
He showed up on the pool.

35:38.920 --> 35:39.920
I didn't search it on Google.

35:39.920 --> 35:41.920
I searched it on my history.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.920
Because I love that poem.

35:43.920 --> 35:44.920
That's a joke.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.920
That one might be the one I wrote.

35:46.920 --> 35:49.920
But you're admitting that Gorkins is not you.

35:49.920 --> 35:51.920
Well, I think that you guys are kind of.

35:51.920 --> 35:52.920
I wouldn't jump to any conclusions as well.

35:52.920 --> 35:53.920
Yeah.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.920
There's also a chance you wrote all three of these.

35:55.920 --> 35:59.920
I guess that's just like sputtering the whole time.

35:59.920 --> 36:00.920
Incredible.

36:00.920 --> 36:02.920
I guess I was just leaking oil.

36:02.920 --> 36:03.920
Yeah.

36:03.920 --> 36:04.920
Okay.

36:04.920 --> 36:06.920
Do not make haste.

36:06.920 --> 36:07.920
It's breast is dressed.

36:07.920 --> 36:10.920
Displace horse radishy waist.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.920
No need for more zest.

36:12.920 --> 36:16.920
Some simply taste and seek to impress.

36:16.920 --> 36:20.920
While others disgrace and don't trust the chef.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.920
Don't dunk Toro in soy.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.920
Ditch chop sticks for hands.

36:26.920 --> 36:29.920
Drink Seporo with joy.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.920
And let fish guide your glands.

36:32.920 --> 36:34.920
That means that one has to be Jeff.

36:34.920 --> 36:35.920
But he's the thing.

36:35.920 --> 36:36.920
There's a chick.

36:36.920 --> 36:38.920
He could also have plugged in prompts to chat.

36:38.920 --> 36:39.920
GPT in.

36:39.920 --> 36:40.920
Yeah.

36:40.920 --> 36:41.920
They could all be.

36:41.920 --> 36:42.920
They all be AI.

36:42.920 --> 36:43.920
Or they could all be Jeff.

36:43.920 --> 36:44.920
I want the titles of all these.

36:44.920 --> 36:45.920
Yeah.

36:45.920 --> 36:46.920
He got that.

36:46.920 --> 36:47.920
Usually I don't know what to eat.

36:48.920 --> 36:50.920
The first one is tinkled tinkled little car.

36:50.920 --> 36:51.920
Yeah.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.920
The second one is funny young fellow.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.920
And the last one is Omakase.

36:55.920 --> 36:56.920
All right.

36:56.920 --> 37:00.920
So I think I feel like you could have written the first and the last.

37:00.920 --> 37:03.920
But the funny young fellow.

37:03.920 --> 37:04.920
Yeah.

37:04.920 --> 37:05.920
I don't.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.920
That one seems like it's such an old lemric.

37:07.920 --> 37:08.920
Right.

37:08.920 --> 37:11.920
Like a 1912 Harvard Lampu and joke.

37:11.920 --> 37:12.920
Yeah.

37:12.920 --> 37:13.920
Yeah.

37:13.920 --> 37:14.920
Yeah.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.920
I think if you wrote it, you would have.

37:16.920 --> 37:17.920
Yeah.

37:17.920 --> 37:18.920
That was the first.

37:18.920 --> 37:19.920
Norman Leary.

37:19.920 --> 37:20.920
Right.

37:20.920 --> 37:21.920
Right.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.920
That's the fact that there was soy and fish in the last one.

37:23.920 --> 37:24.920
Makes it so.

37:24.920 --> 37:25.920
And Omakase is the title.

37:25.920 --> 37:26.920
Yeah.

37:26.920 --> 37:27.920
Yeah.

37:27.920 --> 37:28.920
I mean, that one's obviously Jeff.

37:28.920 --> 37:29.920
Wait.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.920
It's called Omakase.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.920
And it's describing someone who's eating sushi.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.920
I'll say that you only wrote that last.

37:35.920 --> 37:36.920
I have a question.

37:36.920 --> 37:37.920
Okay.

37:37.920 --> 37:38.920
Is the.

37:38.920 --> 37:41.920
Are you saying that the other ones were written by like poets or like by.

37:41.920 --> 37:42.920
Yeah.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.920
The game is like two written by real.

37:44.920 --> 37:45.920
Game is like that.

37:45.920 --> 37:49.920
But this one you're saying the other ones were written by like actual poets.

37:49.920 --> 37:50.920
Or just like.

37:50.920 --> 37:54.920
I don't think that's too much of the other authors as dumb as you.

37:54.920 --> 37:55.920
It's.

37:55.920 --> 37:56.920
Right.

37:56.920 --> 37:57.920
I'm like, think anybody could have written it.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.920
Two of these are written by real poets.

37:59.920 --> 38:00.920
Pollock.

38:00.920 --> 38:01.920
Yeah.

38:01.920 --> 38:02.920
Who have written other poems?

38:02.920 --> 38:05.920
Well, it depends on what your definition of published is.

38:05.920 --> 38:07.920
That's because you want to ask it.

38:07.920 --> 38:09.920
Does the internet count sure?

38:09.920 --> 38:11.920
Do they have their own books of poetry?

38:11.920 --> 38:12.920
Probably not.

38:12.920 --> 38:13.920
I mean, what are you leaning towards on you?

38:13.920 --> 38:14.920
Yeah.

38:14.920 --> 38:15.920
Which one Jeff wrote?

38:15.920 --> 38:16.920
Yeah.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.920
Well, it's impossible to say because.

38:18.920 --> 38:19.920
It's impossible to say.

38:19.920 --> 38:20.920
That.

38:20.920 --> 38:21.920
Because.

38:21.920 --> 38:22.920
Because.

38:22.920 --> 38:25.920
If Jeff versus actual poem is one thing.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.920
But Jeff versus like something he read on mine.

38:27.920 --> 38:28.920
He's muddy the water.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.920
This isn't a true poetry or no a tree.

38:30.920 --> 38:31.920
But it's the Jeff version.

38:31.920 --> 38:32.920
All right.

38:32.920 --> 38:33.920
So you guys.

38:33.920 --> 38:34.920
You're from the internet.

38:34.920 --> 38:35.920
Yeah.

38:35.920 --> 38:36.920
We get award winning poems.

38:36.920 --> 38:37.920
Yeah.

38:37.920 --> 38:38.920
Really tinkled tinkled little.

38:38.920 --> 38:40.920
I do think I do think he wrote the last one.

38:40.920 --> 38:41.920
Okay.

38:41.920 --> 38:42.920
Last one.

38:42.920 --> 38:43.920
Last one.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.920
You're right.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.920
I wrote.

38:48.920 --> 38:49.920
Oh, my.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.920
You tried to.

38:51.920 --> 38:53.920
You tried to steer as a way for that.

38:53.920 --> 38:54.920
You're like that one.

38:54.920 --> 38:55.920
That makes sense.

38:55.920 --> 38:56.920
That makes sense.

38:56.920 --> 38:57.920
Really good.

38:57.920 --> 38:58.920
And the sentence.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.920
Where did you get the first two?

39:00.920 --> 39:01.920
Uh, the internet.

39:01.920 --> 39:02.920
Tinkled tinkled little car.

39:02.920 --> 39:03.920
Yeah.

39:03.920 --> 39:04.920
I googled short poems.

39:04.920 --> 39:05.920
Got it.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.920
And that was the website that had that poem on it.

39:07.920 --> 39:08.920
Yeah.

39:08.920 --> 39:09.920
Right.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.920
So the first one is tinkled tinkled little car by Cecilia L.

39:11.920 --> 39:12.920
Good body.

39:12.920 --> 39:16.920
And uh, the second one is funny young fellow by Graham Lester.

39:16.920 --> 39:17.920
A car out the first one.

39:17.920 --> 39:18.920
Yeah.

39:18.920 --> 39:22.920
Um, I feel like we're not giving my poem enough credit though.

39:22.920 --> 39:24.920
I know that it's like, oh, Jeff wrote that.

39:24.920 --> 39:25.920
But it's kind of good.

39:25.920 --> 39:26.920
Let's see it again.

39:26.920 --> 39:27.920
Yeah.

39:27.920 --> 39:28.920
Oh, my.

39:28.920 --> 39:29.920
By Jeffrey.

39:29.920 --> 39:30.920
By the way, it was, it's not about it being good or not.

39:30.920 --> 39:31.920
Yeah.

39:31.920 --> 39:32.920
It's about we knew it was you.

39:32.920 --> 39:33.920
I know.

39:33.920 --> 39:34.920
But it's not about it being good or not.

39:34.920 --> 39:36.920
It's about we knew it was you.

39:36.920 --> 39:37.920
I know.

39:37.920 --> 39:39.920
But it was literally in your archetypal center.

39:39.920 --> 39:40.920
You maybe would have been like, wow.

39:40.920 --> 39:41.920
That brought me to tears.

39:41.920 --> 39:42.920
Yeah.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.920
I mean, I've never heard of other shitty poems.

39:44.920 --> 39:49.920
I was going to say that the structure of it was there there.

39:49.920 --> 39:54.920
Wasn't that the content was cohesive and the whole thing was wrapped in a tiny bow.

39:54.920 --> 39:55.920
There were a lot of buzzwords though.

39:55.920 --> 39:56.920
They gave it away.

39:56.920 --> 39:58.920
Well, I did use white face.

39:58.920 --> 40:01.920
You're face with fish and joy.

40:01.920 --> 40:02.920
Fish and joy.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.920
Did it become like joy?

40:04.920 --> 40:06.920
That's what your identity.

40:06.920 --> 40:07.920
Do you understand that?

40:07.920 --> 40:10.920
That you're like a fish and soul.

40:11.920 --> 40:12.920
You're a fish monger.

40:12.920 --> 40:14.920
You're a fucking like sure.

40:14.920 --> 40:16.920
Honestly, guessing that was like fish and soul.

40:16.920 --> 40:18.920
Are you fucking proud of yourself?

40:18.920 --> 40:19.920
That's what we see.

40:19.920 --> 40:20.920
Yeah.

40:20.920 --> 40:22.920
Like that we hear trout.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.920
And we know it's like fish glands.

40:24.920 --> 40:27.920
And we're like, yep, that one's just.

40:27.920 --> 40:28.920
He loves that.

40:28.920 --> 40:32.920
It's your personality is to be a fish monger or a monger.

40:32.920 --> 40:34.920
It's crazy to have a comedy style.

40:34.920 --> 40:35.920
That's just the word joy.

40:35.920 --> 40:36.920
Yeah.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.920
So I think comedy is kind of healing.

40:39.920 --> 40:42.920
I really do think that the world means a little more joy.

40:42.920 --> 40:43.920
And I don't know.

40:43.920 --> 40:44.920
So me if that's about.

40:44.920 --> 40:45.920
Let's hear.

40:45.920 --> 40:46.920
Oh, my Cosa.

40:46.920 --> 40:47.920
Yeah.

40:47.920 --> 40:48.920
By Jeffrey James.

40:48.920 --> 40:49.920
Okay.

40:49.920 --> 40:50.920
Do not make haste.

40:50.920 --> 40:52.920
It's breast is dressed.

40:52.920 --> 40:55.920
Displaced horse Radicey waist.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.920
No need for more zest.

40:57.920 --> 40:58.920
Yeah.

40:58.920 --> 40:59.920
Listen good.

40:59.920 --> 41:00.920
Now it's like obvious.

41:00.920 --> 41:03.920
First Radicey is the worst adjective ever.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.920
Horse Radicey.

41:06.920 --> 41:09.920
Let's hear new say that word.

41:09.920 --> 41:13.920
I almost was like, well, this one isn't you because you had trouble reading it.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.920
Then I realized this should work.

41:15.920 --> 41:18.920
Horse Radicey.

41:18.920 --> 41:20.920
Horse Radicey.

41:20.920 --> 41:25.920
So simply taste and seek to impress.

41:25.920 --> 41:30.920
While others disgrace and don't trust the chef.

41:30.920 --> 41:35.920
Yeah.

41:35.920 --> 41:36.920
Yeah.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.920
The trust me as always.

41:38.920 --> 41:40.920
Oh, my Cosa means trust the chef.

41:40.920 --> 41:41.920
Yeah.

41:41.920 --> 41:42.920
Yeah.

41:42.920 --> 41:43.920
We got it.

41:43.920 --> 41:45.920
Don't dunk Toro in soy.

41:45.920 --> 41:46.920
Yeah.

41:46.920 --> 41:48.920
Ditch chop sticks for hands.

41:48.920 --> 41:49.920
Right.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.920
So explaining how to eat sushi.

41:51.920 --> 41:52.920
New gear with your hands.

41:52.920 --> 41:53.920
Yeah.

41:53.920 --> 41:54.920
What's that?

41:54.920 --> 41:56.920
You want to say just pick up the fish with your hands.

41:56.920 --> 41:59.920
With the gear you're supposed to use your hands and dip it fish side down.

41:59.920 --> 42:00.920
Yeah.

42:00.920 --> 42:01.920
Drink.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.920
See, this poem is for fuckers like him.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.920
Nice.

42:05.920 --> 42:14.920
You have to dig another break for all my last two lines.

42:14.920 --> 42:28.920
Drink Seporo with Joy.

42:28.920 --> 42:33.920
And let fish guide your glands.

42:33.920 --> 42:38.920
Were you planting like were those were you planting those so that we would get it right?

42:38.920 --> 42:40.920
Or is that just kind of all you can come?

42:40.920 --> 42:41.920
That's what's going to say.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.920
Or you can not help yourself.

42:43.920 --> 42:46.920
I did it last and I thought that you.

42:46.920 --> 42:49.920
But I was like, let me make it about rice and fish.

42:49.920 --> 42:51.920
But let me try and make it as good as I can.

42:51.920 --> 42:53.920
So I was like, oh, let me make it as good as you can.

42:53.920 --> 42:55.920
Well, I didn't like 15 minutes.

42:55.920 --> 42:56.920
Right.

42:56.920 --> 42:57.920
But it's like a long time.

42:57.920 --> 42:58.920
Oh, my gosh.

42:58.920 --> 43:01.920
It has a whole moral to the story, which is like, can we dissect it?

43:01.920 --> 43:03.920
I wouldn't call it a moral.

43:03.920 --> 43:04.920
The breast is dressed.

43:04.920 --> 43:05.920
I mean, don't do it.

43:05.920 --> 43:06.920
If necessary.

43:06.920 --> 43:10.920
Let her interrupt you.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.920
It'll be worth it.

43:12.920 --> 43:14.920
It's not breast.

43:14.920 --> 43:15.920
Well, okay.

43:15.920 --> 43:16.920
True.

43:16.920 --> 43:17.920
Okay.

43:17.920 --> 43:18.920
Yeah.

43:18.920 --> 43:19.920
But wait.

43:19.920 --> 43:22.920
And you go to Omakase, dining experience or otherwise.

43:22.920 --> 43:23.920
The fish is already dressed.

43:23.920 --> 43:24.920
It already has the sauce.

43:24.920 --> 43:26.920
That's not the part that I'm saying.

43:26.920 --> 43:27.920
I'm saying what's wrong.

43:27.920 --> 43:28.920
I know you're not saying it's wrong.

43:28.920 --> 43:29.920
I'm saying it's really good.

43:29.920 --> 43:30.920
Oh, I think.

43:30.920 --> 43:31.920
Right.

43:31.920 --> 43:32.920
I'm saying basically that the poems about Omakase.

43:32.920 --> 43:34.920
So the first two lines are, do you not make haste?

43:34.920 --> 43:35.920
Uh-huh.

43:35.920 --> 43:36.920
The breast is dressed.

43:36.920 --> 43:37.920
Meaning the sauce is on the fish.

43:37.920 --> 43:40.920
You don't need to dunk it in soy.

43:40.920 --> 43:41.920
Displace horseradish.

43:41.920 --> 43:42.920
You wish.

43:42.920 --> 43:43.920
Up.

43:43.920 --> 43:44.920
Saying that word wrong.

43:44.920 --> 43:45.920
Also, it's not.

43:45.920 --> 43:47.920
They wear the horseradish in your sushi experience.

43:47.920 --> 43:48.920
It's not.

43:48.920 --> 43:49.920
It's not.

43:49.920 --> 43:50.920
But it's not horseradish.

43:50.920 --> 43:51.920
Yeah.

43:51.920 --> 43:52.920
It's not.

43:52.920 --> 43:53.920
Really?

43:53.920 --> 43:54.920
It's not.

43:54.920 --> 43:55.920
It's called wasabi.

43:55.920 --> 43:56.920
It's literally wasabi.

43:56.920 --> 43:57.920
It's a different plant.

43:57.920 --> 44:00.920
It's in the plant family of horseradish.

44:00.920 --> 44:01.920
Horseradish.

44:01.920 --> 44:02.920
Horseradish.

44:02.920 --> 44:03.920
Horseradish.

44:03.920 --> 44:05.920
But the place wasabi.

44:05.920 --> 44:06.920
Don't put it on.

44:06.920 --> 44:07.920
Why isn't it?

44:07.920 --> 44:08.920
It doesn't.

44:08.920 --> 44:09.920
It doesn't.

44:09.920 --> 44:10.920
It doesn't.

44:10.920 --> 44:12.920
Wasabi, you can even say better than you can say horseradish.

44:12.920 --> 44:14.920
Some simply taste and seek to impress.

44:14.920 --> 44:16.920
Some people go to these places and they know exactly what they're doing.

44:16.920 --> 44:17.920
Right.

44:17.920 --> 44:22.920
And then others disgrace the chef by not trusting their ass.

44:22.920 --> 44:23.920
Right.

44:23.920 --> 44:26.920
Don't throw in soy because it's definitely going to be dressed.

44:26.920 --> 44:28.920
Did chopsticks for hands?

44:28.920 --> 44:30.920
Because Amir was he didn't even know.

44:30.920 --> 44:31.920
Yeah.

44:31.920 --> 44:33.920
With Nagiri, you're supposed to use your hands and you fish side by.

44:33.920 --> 44:34.920
I didn't know that either.

44:34.920 --> 44:35.920
Drink support with joy.

44:35.920 --> 44:37.920
Have a good time with the only gossip.

44:37.920 --> 44:38.920
Yeah.

44:38.920 --> 44:40.920
And let the fish guide your glam.

44:40.920 --> 44:43.920
The worst thing I've ever heard.

44:43.920 --> 44:45.920
Guide your glam.

44:45.920 --> 44:50.920
What do you guys have going on?

44:50.920 --> 44:51.920
What do you want to point people?

44:51.920 --> 44:52.920
It's already.

44:52.920 --> 44:53.920
Yeah.

44:53.920 --> 44:54.920
It happens fast.

44:54.920 --> 44:55.920
It's a tight 45.

44:55.920 --> 44:56.920
Yeah.

44:56.920 --> 44:57.920
That's great.

44:57.920 --> 45:01.920
Are you ever going to, you should do that in an open mic and see what actual poetry fans would

45:01.920 --> 45:02.920
kind of be back there.

45:02.920 --> 45:05.920
Like a poetry open mic or like a stand up open mic?

45:05.920 --> 45:06.920
Definitely poetry.

45:06.920 --> 45:07.920
Yeah.

45:07.920 --> 45:08.920
Not good enough for stand up.

45:08.920 --> 45:09.920
We're like a or a band.

45:09.920 --> 45:11.920
I was going to say like a battle of the bands.

45:11.920 --> 45:12.920
That all of the bands.

45:12.920 --> 45:13.920
Yeah.

45:13.920 --> 45:14.920
Yeah.

45:15.920 --> 45:21.920
Plugs.

45:21.920 --> 45:25.920
On your what do you have going on when you want to point people toward radio free obviously?

45:25.920 --> 45:26.920
On you?

45:26.920 --> 45:27.920
Yeah.

45:27.920 --> 45:28.920
On Instagram.

45:28.920 --> 45:30.920
Which is kind of ironic though because you aren't free of radio.

45:30.920 --> 45:31.920
You host a radio show.

45:31.920 --> 45:32.920
Yeah.

45:32.920 --> 45:34.920
It's kind of.

45:34.920 --> 45:36.920
If you google it.

45:36.920 --> 45:39.920
It will come.

45:39.920 --> 45:41.920
Listen to.

45:41.920 --> 45:48.160
Okay, Alex coming back, video episodes, full video on YouTube, March 27th, submit to the

45:48.160 --> 45:53.280
love motel. We really need love advice questions and they don't host a advice show anymore. So

45:53.280 --> 46:00.160
you can just pivot and send those to love motelradio.com. There's a submission format at the bottom.

46:00.160 --> 46:06.080
So if you're still confused about love, there's a place to go. Yeah, we'd love to talk about your

46:06.080 --> 46:15.520
problems on the radio, wgxc.org. On the radio, uh, uh, on the radio. So don't have some or some,

46:15.520 --> 46:19.520

46:19.520 --> 46:28.720
snap because then I encourage him to sing more often. Jake. Yeah, check out me in a mere show.

46:29.520 --> 46:34.560
It's like fragments like fragments. Yeah, I want to hear your poems. I should go back and listen.

46:34.560 --> 46:38.720
Yeah, they're all up there. You guys should all go to a poetry meeting and see who's poem does.

46:38.720 --> 46:45.200
Actually, got a mirror on the latest episode. I'd love to read hot oon to you and see what you think.

46:45.200 --> 46:48.880
Yeah, you're not going to sit here and tell me hot oon or whatever is better than

46:49.440 --> 46:56.240
dragons. Really better than dragons just I think it was. We're better than oh,

46:56.320 --> 47:01.520
Macasas. Oh, Macasas. Oh, Macasas. Oh, Macasas. Oh, Macasas. Oh, Macasas. Oh, Macasas. Oh, Macasas. I'm here.

47:02.720 --> 47:06.320
Do you want to plug your divorce lawyer? Oh, yeah. You're getting a divorce. Yeah. Yeah.

47:06.320 --> 47:12.000
I'll be talking back on the market. You're good, man. Uh, as guiding us through this whole crazy

47:12.000 --> 47:19.040
fucking miraculous uncoupling. Yeah. I had a conscious uncouple. Yeah. Exactly. Irreconcilable

47:19.040 --> 47:24.080
difference. Yeah. And you knew you're again a boy, right? You're the opposite of a printup where you

47:24.160 --> 47:31.120
trust them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be tall. I'll pay for it. It's for power. Yes. From one to the other. Amazing.

47:31.120 --> 47:37.600
Which was a flea training because you got fleeced and nice. Yes. And it was incredible to go through

47:37.600 --> 47:44.800
that with her. Good man. Good man who guided our eye throughout the entire very good man.

47:44.800 --> 47:50.080
And he is with all the tall down. Yeah. I was going to say he guided your hand up. They hooked

47:50.080 --> 47:57.760
us on the paper and also in the ring. He's wearing my ring. Yeah. Yeah. And he deserves it. So I missed

47:57.760 --> 48:02.320
this. What happened? Basically a mirror got a divorce. And in the divorce papers, you're also

48:02.320 --> 48:08.320
supposed to stay chased for 18 months. Yeah. We should be done. Yeah. Non-compet clause. Yeah.

48:08.320 --> 48:13.360
I'm not allowed to. It's a medieval gardener clause. So basically you're loins us,

48:13.360 --> 48:20.000
did you? For the better part of a decade, I think. Anyway, um, I'll post an uptool cheating

48:20.000 --> 48:24.960
with you. Yes. She can't do, but I can legally. But there was this weird live that you did.

48:24.960 --> 48:30.800
It's live? Yeah. You were on IG. Yeah. And you were like, check out my post-nup drip. Yeah.

48:30.800 --> 48:37.360
Post-nup-should drip. And it was just your chastity belt. And you had put a stussy sticker on the ass.

48:37.360 --> 48:45.040
With my whole stussy. My stussy, you see. At Jeffrey James on Instagram,

48:45.040 --> 48:49.280
patreon.com forward slash Riley and Jeff for still doing zardies over there. Zoom parties.

48:49.280 --> 48:53.840
So you're coming out with us to $20 once. And sorry. I didn't talk over your

48:53.840 --> 48:59.280
plot. You did. Really? Yeah. You basically commented. Yeah. You turned it into a divorce layer.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Alright swirls of peppermint mix with creamy white chocolate for the guilt-free hot cocoa

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Or should I say your holiday beans?

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
It's the perfect winter wind down for those cold snowy nights.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
It's a triple, lab tested, and contains the ultimate,

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
sleep, promoting ingredients.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Rashi.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Magnesium.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
Elfianine and melatonin with no sugar or artificial sweeteners.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Those are all absolutely positive ingredients.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
This doesn't seem like nonsense.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Those I know are good and for sleep.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
I actually take magnesium, elfianine and melatonin.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Regardless, so I'm excited to try this.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Curl up with a cup of white chocolate peppermint dream right before bedtime.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
And get your best sleep ever.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I don't sleep that well.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
It's very hard for me to follow sleep.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I'm always kind of wired.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
So I have found that things like what's in this product,

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
and I can't wait to try the product itself,

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
really does help me wind down at the end of the day.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
So guys, give it a shot.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I mean, you know, the holidays are stressful.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Maybe you're switching time zones like me.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
You need to need to need a little bit of a sleep it.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Plus, people love dream powder.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
And the reviews Jennifer M wrote,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I've suffered from insomnia for years.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
I've tried just about every supplement on the market,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
and this is by far the most effective.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
I'm very grateful for it.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
I fall asleep quickly and sleep deeper and longer.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Thank you, Beam.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Melanie wrote,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
This stuff is legit.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
I'm a gym rat who just turned 50 and has sleep issues.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
I take this at 10 p.m. and sleep from 11 to 6 a.m.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
The best part is that I wake up refreshed

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
and ready to hit the gym.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Wow.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000

Thanks, Beam.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Why does it feel like we haven't done one of these

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
in forever?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Did one of these ever been here?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
That must be it.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
That must be it.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
I mean, you did it last week,

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
but we haven't been on in a while.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Okay.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Yeah.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Sorry.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
So it's not really forever.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
I just...

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
What a sour attitude to bring to the beginning of it.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
You're not even looking at your monitor.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
It's good to see you, Jeff.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Yeah, Marieka.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
You haven't been on for a couple weeks.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
A lot of comments saying that this podcast,

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
not only is bad, but barely exists without you.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
How does that make you feel?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
No, I always want to have Marieka on it.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
She just does probably the most.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
No, no, no.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
I'm talking to someone who's actually contributing to the show.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Wow.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
How does that make you feel?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I feel good.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Yeah.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I think so.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
A little concerned.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
I feel like personally,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
I don't feel like I bring much to the table,

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
but overall positive as long as people aren't being mean to me,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
because I do read all of the YouTube comments.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
I'm pretty fine.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Pretty fine.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
A lot of people are trying to wed you.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Oh, like that.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Well, if you feel like you don't contribute anything,

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
why don't you hit us with a major healer.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Oh, boy.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Be good to yourself, I guess.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
That's my major healer.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
That's great.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
Johnny, we're so almost the same person, man.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Dude, hell yeah.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
We pretty much are the same person.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
I'm pretty much going to take over your life at this point.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Well, yeah.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
I'm officially coming to New York in 13 days.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Yeah.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
It's so soon.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Yeah.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
I realize I was that soon.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
It's really exciting.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Dredding it completely.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Dredding it?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Yeah.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
I'm like, I'm dreading it so much, man.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
What is there to dread?

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I mean, I'm just going to be hitting you up way too often

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
and being a burden in your life.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
I mean, yeah.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
I understand that.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I think that's kind of why I'm dreading it a lot.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Mmm.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
So I think there is an agreement.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
I have the benefit of not being like close to anyone.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Location wise.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Johnny here.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
And by relation.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Yeah.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
You're so easy to like convince to go somewhere.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Cause you're sort of central.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
So yeah.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
And I mean, like.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I don't know why.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Why it is about people from New York.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
But they think that 30 minutes is a long time.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Like to get from one place to another.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
I think it takes like three hours for me to be like.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Uh, I don't know if I'll go.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Three hours.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
So Kingston's two and a half hours from you.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
You'd drop everything and go up there.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Uh, yeah.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
If I had like a free day, I'd probably would.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
I guess you're also kind of used to like,

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
commuting from Jersey.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Yeah.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
I feel like hour and a half.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Two hours is kind of my like.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Oh, boy.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Well, stuck this morning.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Got yourself a gun.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Nice.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
The sopranos.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Yeah.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
I started watching the sopranos for the first time.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Do you enjoy seeing it?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I love it.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
I don't like that.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
It takes place in New Jersey.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Cause it does sort of remind me of Johnny.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Okay.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Interesting.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
All right.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
You're like.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
It's a very dynamic.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Yeah.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Sorry, non-secretor from the show.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
I'll give you that.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
I'll give you that.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
It is a little bit.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Not part for the course.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Yeah.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Is this the point where you say this is not going easy?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Are you wanted?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Yeah.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
We know of the seats.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Yeah.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
It's a script, man.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
No, to me.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
I'm trying to, this was one of those weeks where I'm like, let me try and reinvent the show

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
in a way where I kind of bring instead of sour poison.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
A new perspective.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Jennifer's body style.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Yeah.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Great.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
And.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Uh.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Agent Wisdom of your.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
Dipwi to Joel.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
All right.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
What's the agent wisdom?

07:56.000 --> 07:56.500
Yeah.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.500
Well, it's going to be just first throughout the show.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.500
Like, I don't have bullet points that I want to just read off.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.500
I know that you guys always say that, oh, you just write jokes.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.500
And then we're just supposed to sit here and feel them.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.500
F-E-L-D.

08:06.500 --> 08:09.500
And Johnny knows what I'm talking about.

08:09.500 --> 08:10.500
Um.

08:10.500 --> 08:15.500
And no, but I want to just interject with actual.

08:15.500 --> 08:20.500
Useful words to hear.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.500
It's a great goal.

08:22.500 --> 08:23.500
I love that for you.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.500
Thank you.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.500
You're welcome.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.500
Johnny, you've been up.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.500
No.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.500
No.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.500
Well, you're going to say, what have I been up to?

08:31.500 --> 08:32.500
I'm just gonna.

08:32.500 --> 08:33.500
Yeah.

08:33.500 --> 08:34.500
Yeah.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.500
Um.

08:35.500 --> 08:39.500
Last yesterday, I went to a sake tasting with my roommate and some friends.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.500
And uh, learned a little bit about rice wine.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.500
I don't know how to say Johnny.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.500
I did.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.500
I mean, I didn't taste.

08:45.500 --> 08:46.500
You went to a tasting.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.500
How did taste?

08:47.500 --> 08:48.500
No, no.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.500
It was sake school.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.500
It was sake school.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.500
And so you learned about it and tasted.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.500
It's just like in retaliation for.

08:54.500 --> 08:57.500
Riley, taking wine classes.

08:57.500 --> 08:58.500
It's like every day.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.500
Really happy.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.500
They won up her.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.500
No, this was something that, well, so George Sava said,

09:03.500 --> 09:06.500
Do you want to go to sake school with me on Sunday?

09:06.500 --> 09:07.500
I said, what the hell is that?

09:07.500 --> 09:10.500
He said, it's before this place opens an hour before it opens.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.500
You can go and taste sake for free and learn about it.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.500
I was like free sake, of course.

09:15.500 --> 09:18.500
Didn't end up being free to ended up being thirty two dollars for six

09:18.500 --> 09:20.500
ounces of sake total.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.500
Um, but it was still fun.

09:22.500 --> 09:31.500
I found that I like a grainy, icy, warm sake with a milk cream mouth feel.

09:31.500 --> 09:37.500
But if it's a little more balanced, a little more polished.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.500
I'll go cold.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.500
I'll go cold.

09:40.500 --> 09:44.500
And I will fall cold because I've recently found out that drinking alcohol makes me sort of pass out

09:44.500 --> 09:46.500
if I have too much of it.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.500
Happens to everybody.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.500
And yeah, just staying to just laying that right.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.500
Yeah.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.500
Really?

09:52.500 --> 09:55.500
We've had shots together multiple times.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.500
You've had shots in front of me.

09:56.500 --> 09:59.500
Yeah, because you kept buying it for me.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.500
And I don't say love to buy a Johnny shots.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.500
That was more of an August-ish.

10:04.500 --> 10:07.500
Mm-hmm.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.500
Cold news.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.500
What are you guys?

10:12.500 --> 10:16.500
I was just going to bring up that you bought a frozen espresso

10:16.500 --> 10:18.500
Martinez for the table.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.500
Wait, when did I do that?

10:21.500 --> 10:22.500
Oh, I raised.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.500
Yeah.

10:23.500 --> 10:24.500
You had too much of drink and you forgot.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.500
So you forgot about forgetting.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.500
That was also August-ish.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.500
Mm-hmm.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.500
The coffee reminded me.

10:30.500 --> 10:31.500
Yeah.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.500
Um, what's new, do you guys?

10:33.500 --> 10:38.500
I'm a little shook if I can be perfectly honest.

10:38.500 --> 10:39.500
Holy shit.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.500
Bomb drop.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.500
Holy.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.500
Nice.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.500
That was easy.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.500
Sure.

10:47.500 --> 10:56.500
Uh, I, tonight I'm going to a concert version of the musical Spring Awakening

10:56.500 --> 11:03.500
with the original Broadway cast from 15 years ago.

11:03.500 --> 11:08.500
And I, I feel like I might cry for three hours.

11:08.500 --> 11:13.500
And in the next three hours, I'm a little like crazy right now.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.500
Oh, it's going on.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.500
Is that why you have to leave your house at five?

11:17.500 --> 11:18.500
Mm-hmm.

11:18.500 --> 11:19.500
Interesting.

11:19.500 --> 11:24.500
Because I live far and I have to travel far.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.500
I believe that out.

11:26.500 --> 11:31.500
Uh, yeah.

11:31.500 --> 11:34.500
That's, I'm, I'm shook by that.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.500
Really excited.

11:35.500 --> 11:40.500
One of my friends that I haven't seen in a long time is coming for the concert.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.500
Uh, and it's her first time in a Broadway theater.

11:43.500 --> 11:48.500
Um, sort of fans of Spring Awakening around the same time.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.500
Hmm.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.500
It's going to be great.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.500
Where are they coming in from?

11:51.500 --> 11:52.500
You didn't say.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.500
Ah.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.500
They're coming in from a,

11:55.500 --> 11:57.500
Mayor asset from DC.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.500
DC.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.500
For sure.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.500
Yeah.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.500
Mm-hmm.

12:01.500 --> 12:04.500
And then Johnny, what kind of nonsense is called in your life?

12:04.500 --> 12:06.500
Uh, I got the flu twice.

12:06.500 --> 12:07.500
I got tested twice.

12:07.500 --> 12:10.500
It was both the times the flu.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.500
Uh, the first time I recovered,

12:12.500 --> 12:15.500
I was like, finally, it was just right before Halloween weekend.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.500
Yeah.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.500
And then, uh, I went out one day for Halloween,

12:18.500 --> 12:20.500
and then I got the flu again.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.500
So I was out of commission for quite some time.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.500
But now I'm back.

12:24.500 --> 12:25.500
COVID-free.

12:25.500 --> 12:26.500
Flu-free.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.500
And, uh, I probably should get my flu shot.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.500
Just in case this happens a third time.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.500
Yeah.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.500
Yeah.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.500
All of it could have been avoided if you just got in your flu shot.

12:36.500 --> 12:40.500
Now you haven't had to bodies for something that doesn't really matter in the end.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.500
I mean, I could get the flu again.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.500
And that's the same strain.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.500
Right.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.500
Let's see if I don't sulfide it.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.500
All right.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.500
I guess.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.500
You're not giving me anything.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.500
What is it?

12:51.500 --> 12:52.500
I'm not giving you guys anything.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.500
I've come up with gold so far.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.500
Actual conversation starters.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.500
Yeah.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.500
But you said you're going to interject with something positive.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.500
I think that would help.

13:00.500 --> 13:01.500
Yeah.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.500
You know, you know what?

13:02.500 --> 13:03.500
I'm not going to have it.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.500
Cause guess what?

13:04.500 --> 13:05.500
You guys have this expectation of me as a host.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.500
And you're kind of waiting for me to come in with the crazy.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.500
All I've done so far is,

13:09.500 --> 13:13.500
yes, play sounds, but also off deposit.

13:13.500 --> 13:17.500
Jumping off points that I think are positive.

13:17.500 --> 13:22.500
You asked me was where my friend was from.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.500
I think that's really good.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.500
It's fine.

13:29.500 --> 13:32.500
Uh, I Jesus Christ.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.500
I got my flu shot on Thursday.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.500
And I tried to get my COVID booster at the same time.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.500
Uh, they didn't have appointments available.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.500
So I scheduled mine for November 30th and green point.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.500
And, uh, yeah.

13:44.500 --> 13:45.500
What was that sound?

13:45.500 --> 13:47.500
What was that sound that you just played?

13:47.500 --> 13:49.500
Oh, you mean one of the people?

13:49.500 --> 13:52.500
Oh, I thought it was a wild animal.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.500
It does kind of sound like a cougar.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.500
It was a wild line.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.500
So it was a wild.

13:57.500 --> 13:58.500
Oh, great.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.500
Yeah.

13:59.500 --> 14:03.500
We're also going to have to figure out how to film this one.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.500
If we're all in New York.

14:05.500 --> 14:08.500
Yeah, but that's going to continue being at home.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.500
Well, what do we think of the video episode so far?

14:10.500 --> 14:14.500
Because I think that people, I think 80% of the people like it.

14:14.500 --> 14:18.500
I think 20% think the audio version got worse, which I agree with.

14:18.500 --> 14:23.500
But my fear is that we're not generating new avenues of revenue.

14:23.500 --> 14:27.500
Interestingly, you do keep playing copyright in music.

14:27.500 --> 14:32.500
That stops YouTube monetization like the one that you immediately played

14:32.500 --> 14:33.500
in those episodes.

14:33.500 --> 14:34.500
Which one?

14:34.500 --> 14:39.500
Uh, that like, truly like the two second clip that started this.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.500
I don't know what song it is, but it got flagged.

14:42.500 --> 14:43.500
The other.

14:43.500 --> 14:44.500
No, we didn't.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.500
I didn't do any songs.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.500
I swear to God, oh, you mean, oh, yeah.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.500
The answer.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.500
Yeah.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.500
That is flagged.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.500
It did.

14:50.500 --> 14:51.500
Yeah.

14:51.500 --> 14:52.500
Okay.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.500
I'll cut that out then.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.500
I've been trying to be dude to not do it.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.500
I feel like I didn't do it.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.500
Yeah, you've been trying.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.500
No.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.500
Jeffrey, I feel like it's.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.500
I think they're going well.

15:03.500 --> 15:10.500
Um, I feel like, you know, I think that we've been doing a lot of visual bits.

15:10.500 --> 15:17.500
So that probably adds to the, the audio quality situation.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.500
But yeah.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.500
Yeah.

15:19.500 --> 15:20.500
And I was.

15:20.500 --> 15:24.500
I already wasn't as well received as I would have hoped on the audio forum.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.500
And the second I was very visual.

15:28.500 --> 15:29.500
Yeah.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.500
I'm ready to alienate more people.

15:31.500 --> 15:36.500
Johnny, what's the status with, uh, uh, pretty wack industries?

15:36.500 --> 15:39.500
Pretty wack industries is currently cooking.

15:39.500 --> 15:40.500
They're in the steel.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.500
Always chill.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.500
Yeah.

15:42.500 --> 15:43.500
Who?

15:43.500 --> 15:46.500
Ha ha ha ha ha.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.500
Well, you physically are in a steady recording.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.500
So I guess that works.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.500
Oh, yeah.

15:52.500 --> 15:55.500
I just spent all my time in my room now.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.500
I spent all my time drinking wine.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.500
So this is a jumping off point.

16:02.500 --> 16:08.500
Johnny, we should do like on the shop style interview series at the headgum office,

16:08.500 --> 16:11.500
where we like talk about shit way too seriously.

16:11.500 --> 16:16.500
You mean Danny and a rotating cast of way too famous guests.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.500
Wait, the shop like, uh, where they're all in a barber shop.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.500
On interrupts.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.500
Yeah.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.500
Shopping it.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.500
Yeah.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.500
The shop could be the shock.

16:25.500 --> 16:28.500
And so if for every answer that the guest doesn't do,

16:28.500 --> 16:32.500
we kind of zap him with a magic wand.

16:32.500 --> 16:35.500
Definitely illegal very bad.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.500
I did.

16:36.500 --> 16:37.500
Or not a magic wand.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.500
What's it called?

16:38.500 --> 16:39.500
Tazer.

16:39.500 --> 16:40.500
Not a tazer.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.500
It's kind of delicious.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.500
Not a cattle prod.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.500
More salacious.

16:45.500 --> 16:50.500
Like a sex toy that is electric things.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.500
Violet.

16:51.500 --> 16:52.500
Violet.

16:52.500 --> 16:53.500
Violet one.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.500
What is that?

16:54.500 --> 16:56.500
It's a sex toy.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.500
Nice.

16:58.500 --> 17:01.500
Because that I think makes the guests uncomfortable and I was certain way.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.500
And then you basically have to answer the question.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.500
So we'll get physical fucking.

17:05.500 --> 17:06.500
Yeah.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.500
We'll get Seth Myers on the show.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.500
Can't go.

17:09.500 --> 17:10.500
No way.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.500
What's that?

17:11.500 --> 17:12.500
No way.

17:12.500 --> 17:13.500
We can get Seth Myers.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.500
Why do you say it's so mad or happy the time of day?

17:15.500 --> 17:18.500
He might give me the time of his, the out of his day.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.500
To physically potentially name him.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.500
Of course not name.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.500
It's all playful.

17:24.500 --> 17:27.500
It's all the shock.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.500
With Johnny Villa.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.500
I love it now.

17:30.500 --> 17:33.500
It's great.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.500
Just needed this name on it.

17:35.500 --> 17:36.500
Yeah.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.500
Well, yeah.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.500
We should say that we have a new part time employee.

17:40.500 --> 17:41.500
John, a kinshan.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.500
Is that he?

17:42.500 --> 17:43.500
Yeah.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.500
Interesting.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.500
Yeah.

17:45.500 --> 17:46.500
Joining us in nearly a few minutes here.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.500
Her head gun podcast debut.

17:48.500 --> 17:53.500
I got yelled at via Johnny for not inviting her on earlier.

17:53.500 --> 17:56.500
But I was also kind of drunk.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.500
So I apologize for yelling at you.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.500
Yeah.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.500
Well, it's probably because I bought you nine shots for some nonsense.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.500
Yeah.

18:02.500 --> 18:03.500
So I guess.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.500
Do you guys like bargames,

18:05.500 --> 18:07.500
darts, billiards, et cetera?

18:07.500 --> 18:09.500
Not really.

18:09.500 --> 18:12.500
What do you like then?

18:13.500 --> 18:15.500
What do you like?

18:15.500 --> 18:16.500
I like musicals.

18:16.500 --> 18:27.500
I like formula one racing, which people don't want me to talk about any more.

18:27.500 --> 18:33.500
Do you get blasted at a Broadway show?

18:33.500 --> 18:36.500
Because I know they sell alcohol there.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.500
What do you do?

18:37.500 --> 18:39.500
It's so expensive.

18:40.500 --> 18:44.500
I mean, the alcohol's like $30 for like a double shot beverage.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.500
But no, I'm not.

18:45.500 --> 18:49.500
I normally don't buy drinks unless it's like, there's a cup that I want.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.500
Cause the logo's on it.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.500
And it's everywhere that I do that.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.500
We're going to have you out of the drunk.

18:55.500 --> 18:59.500
Uh, I'm going to say probably no.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.500
Probably like close to drunk.

19:01.500 --> 19:06.500
Maybe tipsy, but not like, not blasted if as it were.

19:07.500 --> 19:08.500
Oh, okay.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.500
And Johnny, have you ever done masculine?

19:11.500 --> 19:13.500
Oh, what is?

19:13.500 --> 19:14.500
Oh, wait, no.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.500
No, not that.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.500
That's a masculine.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.500
That's a masculine.

19:17.500 --> 19:20.500
I think it's peyote.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.500
Oh, peyote.

19:21.500 --> 19:22.500
Yeah.

19:22.500 --> 19:25.500
But it's definitely if I had a wish list of drugs.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.500
Peyote would be there.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.500
Yeah.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.500
Yeah.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.500
Yeah.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.500
Yes.

19:31.500 --> 19:32.500
Yes.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.500
I love, I love.

19:35.500 --> 19:39.500
Let the record show that I do enjoy a good, uh, hallucinogen.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.500
That's cool.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.500
Well, the record show.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.500
Ferris, keep this in.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.500
I want people to know I'm cool.

19:45.500 --> 19:46.500
Yeah.

19:46.500 --> 19:50.500
I'm going to get you arrested somehow, just from that.

19:50.500 --> 19:54.500
Question, which I don't even think is illegal to say.

19:54.500 --> 19:57.500
Officer, which is trying to be cool.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.500
Uh, we should take a quick break.

20:00.500 --> 20:05.500
But we'll be right back after a couple of weird video ads where I have to talk directly

20:05.500 --> 20:07.500
to Kimmer by myself.

20:07.500 --> 20:13.500
Oh, yeah.

20:13.500 --> 20:19.500
Guys, the holidays are coming up and gift buying slash giving can be stressful.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.500
Am I right?

20:20.500 --> 20:24.500
But it's never too early to start gift shopping for the holidays, especially because

20:24.500 --> 20:29.500
today you can save big on a gift that they'll use every day.

20:29.500 --> 20:32.500
And that's Raycon wireless earbuds.

20:32.500 --> 20:36.500
Listen, guys, they sent me two pairs of Raycons.

20:36.500 --> 20:39.500
And I use them almost every day.

20:39.500 --> 20:40.500
I use them on my bike rides.

20:40.500 --> 20:44.500
I use them on my commute to work when I walk to work, which is something I'm

20:44.500 --> 20:46.500
doing recently, man.

20:46.500 --> 20:50.500
It has seamless Bluetooth pairing and a comfortable noise isolating fit.

20:50.500 --> 20:54.500
It actually fits into your ear as opposed to the other wireless earpods that

20:54.500 --> 20:57.500
everybody uses, which is just kind of like one size fits all.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.500
And it's not as nice.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.500
The audio quality is amazing.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.500
Absolutely comparable to the other ones that everybody uses.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.500
And it also starts at half the price.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.500
So kind of an old brainer.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.500
Also, you're bound to lose these, right?

21:09.500 --> 21:11.500
You're bound to lose any wireless thing.

21:11.500 --> 21:17.500
So why not have the vibe in price to get them back at half the price?

21:17.500 --> 21:22.500
The new Raycon every day earbuds come with three new sound profiles to make sure

21:22.500 --> 21:25.500
that everything you're listening to sounds it's best with just the right amount of

21:25.500 --> 21:26.500
bass.

21:26.500 --> 21:29.500
There's pure mode for podcasts listening, blues, instrumentals, etc.

21:29.500 --> 21:34.500
Balance to mode, also for podcasts listening, rock, heavy metal, etc.

21:34.500 --> 21:38.500
And bass mode for hip hop, EDM, reggae, etc.

21:38.500 --> 21:41.500
They offer eight hours of playtime with a 32-hour battery life.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.500
I don't ever really struggle with charge issues.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.500
They seem normal.

21:46.500 --> 21:50.500
There's also a built-in microphone, so you can take calls at the press of a button.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.500
Take my therapy calls on these.

21:52.500 --> 21:57.500
So this holiday season get your loved one, something that they can use for calls, music,

21:57.500 --> 22:01.500
work, play, at home or on the go with Raycon.

22:01.500 --> 22:02.500
Pick up a pair for yourself.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.500
Trust me, you're going to use them every day.

22:04.500 --> 22:08.500

Jeff, guess what?

22:28.500 --> 22:29.500
What?

22:29.500 --> 22:34.500
Remember how I rewatched feet twice during the pandemic?

22:34.500 --> 22:38.500
I didn't know you did it two times over, but yeah, Jesus Christ.

22:38.500 --> 22:41.500
I feel like you should cause I use your HBO Max account.

22:41.500 --> 22:47.500
Anyway, there is a brand new podcast with the stars of feet themselves.

22:47.500 --> 22:53.500
An exclusive behind the scenes look at the show with a Matt Walsh aka Mike McClent

22:53.500 --> 22:56.500
Josh and Timothy Simon's aka Joe Ryan.

22:56.500 --> 23:00.500
My favorite character because I'm a garbage person.

23:00.500 --> 23:01.500
Right.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.500
Yep.

23:02.500 --> 23:08.500
We've joined together for the first ever feet per watch podcast called second in command.

23:08.500 --> 23:14.500
They're going to have all the stars of the popular HBO show on as a rewatch every episode.

23:14.500 --> 23:20.500
One by one, giving all the behind the scenes dirt on filming gossip and what they actually

23:20.500 --> 23:22.500
thought about the storylines themselves.

23:22.500 --> 23:28.500
I just listened to the episode about my favorite VP episode nicknames, which I learned

23:28.500 --> 23:33.500
used to be titled Dan Dates Jonah, which is really important to me personally.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.500
So that was great to learn.

23:35.500 --> 23:41.500
So if you've just been meaning to watch it, drawing Matt Tim and the rest of the cast on a

23:41.500 --> 23:46.500
trip down memory lane on one of the most critically acclaimed shows of all time.

23:46.500 --> 23:51.500
So be sure to follow cast media's new podcast, second in command wherever you like to listen.

23:51.500 --> 23:56.500
You can also check out the video releases each week on second in command YouTube channel.

23:56.500 --> 24:01.500
Well, thanks second in command or thanks cast.

24:01.500 --> 24:06.500
Whatever.

24:06.500 --> 24:14.500
What do you mean for what?

24:14.500 --> 24:17.500
For this this is fucking work at this point, man.

24:17.500 --> 24:20.500
Oh, I thought this was the next segment.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.500
You called old for a buck.

24:22.500 --> 24:24.500
Oh, no, I was saying, and we're back.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.500
Oh, okay.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.500
Oh, I was rusty.

24:27.500 --> 24:30.500
We should get into our demo.

24:30.500 --> 24:35.500
That won't get flagged.

24:35.500 --> 24:39.500
Bond of the week.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.500
Absolutely bond of the week.

24:41.500 --> 24:44.500
Let's start with Johnny Villa, who's your bond of the week?

24:44.500 --> 24:47.500
We should say every week until the next bond is cast.

24:47.500 --> 24:53.500
We're going to kind of cast our votes for the next James.

24:53.500 --> 24:54.500
All right.

24:54.500 --> 25:00.500
My bond of the week is fellow short king Daniel Radcliffe.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.500
Does he want it?

25:01.500 --> 25:04.500
Probably not, but I think he would like it.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.500
Not even love it.

25:07.500 --> 25:10.500
Doesn't get out of the solid now.

25:10.500 --> 25:11.500
Radcliffe.

25:11.500 --> 25:13.500
How rich do we think he is?

25:13.500 --> 25:14.500
Let's get in here.

25:14.500 --> 25:15.500
Hang on.

25:15.500 --> 25:16.500
Daniel Radcliffe.

25:16.500 --> 25:19.500
Oh, ABC family Harry Potter.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.500
My earth on.

25:20.500 --> 25:21.500
Royal T's.

25:21.500 --> 25:22.500
Oh, yeah.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.500
That equals a lot.

25:24.500 --> 25:25.500
Oh, my God.

25:25.500 --> 25:31.500
Okay, over under how much do we think it is over under $70 million.

25:31.500 --> 25:32.500
Over.

25:32.500 --> 25:33.500
Definitely over.

25:33.500 --> 25:36.500
Yeah, 110 million.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.500
That's so much money.

25:38.500 --> 25:41.500
That's a lot smaller than I thought it would be.

25:41.500 --> 25:43.500
Considering how huge Harry Potter was.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.500
I feel like once money gets up in those numbers,

25:46.500 --> 25:49.500
I lose all sense of what anything means.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.500
Yeah.

25:50.500 --> 25:51.500
You know, it's like, what's a hundred.

25:51.500 --> 25:54.500
I feel in small bit of so much money.

25:54.500 --> 25:57.500
It's so fucking much money.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.500
Um, yeah.

25:59.500 --> 26:00.500
Wow.

26:00.500 --> 26:01.500
That's what I need to do.

26:01.500 --> 26:06.500
I need to fucking like book a 10 poll franchise leading role or some bullshit.

26:06.500 --> 26:09.500
Are you going out for like Marvel stuff?

26:09.500 --> 26:12.500
I went out for one Marvel series.

26:12.500 --> 26:15.500
Can you say what it was?

26:15.500 --> 26:19.500
Uh, was it who's in Miss Marvel?

26:19.500 --> 26:20.500
Uh, is that it?

26:20.500 --> 26:21.500
Yeah.

26:21.500 --> 26:22.500
It's Miss Marvel.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.500
No, the actor.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.500
Yeah.

26:25.500 --> 26:26.500
Miss Marvel.

26:26.500 --> 26:27.500
Yeah.

26:27.500 --> 26:28.500
Nice.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.500
But sometimes they send me out for things where I have to be our

26:30.500 --> 26:31.500
median.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.500
And I'm like, I don't think I look our median enough.

26:33.500 --> 26:37.500
And I can't pronounce these words, which is kind of a dead giveaway.

26:37.500 --> 26:40.500
Um, full steam ahead.

26:40.500 --> 26:42.500
Oh, my God.

26:42.500 --> 26:43.500
The week.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.500
Yes.

26:45.500 --> 26:48.500
Uh, since he's having a little moment,

26:48.500 --> 26:51.500
I'm going to go with Barry Kyo again.

26:51.500 --> 26:54.500
Uh, he's not because we don't know who that is.

26:54.500 --> 26:55.500
It is.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.500
Barry is having a yes.

26:58.500 --> 26:59.500
He wasn't done. He most recently.

26:59.500 --> 27:00.500
He was in the eternal.

27:00.500 --> 27:01.500
He's like the.

27:01.500 --> 27:04.500
Oh, this is like Harry Styles guy.

27:04.500 --> 27:06.500
Sure.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.500
I don't know what that means.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.500
They were in Dunkirk together.

27:09.500 --> 27:10.500
Yes.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.500
Spoiler alert.

27:11.500 --> 27:13.500
Harry Styles is in the.

27:13.500 --> 27:16.500
Uh, and credit scene of the eternal.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.500
Uh, so sure.

27:18.500 --> 27:19.500
He is.

27:19.500 --> 27:20.500
Yeah.

27:20.500 --> 27:21.500
Oh, you didn't know that.

27:21.500 --> 27:22.500
No.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.500
They're all over the Twitter.

27:25.500 --> 27:26.500
Is he in it?

27:26.500 --> 27:28.500
Is he going to be in a Marvel movie?

27:28.500 --> 27:29.500
Mm-hmm.

27:29.500 --> 27:30.500
Yeah.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.500
Like that's have like what character?

27:32.500 --> 27:34.500
Aeros Star Fox.

27:34.500 --> 27:35.500
I don't know.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.500
He's Thanos's brother.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.500
That's his character.

27:39.500 --> 27:42.500
Um, he did a good job.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.500
I'm so hot.

27:44.500 --> 27:46.500
He's a good job.

27:46.500 --> 27:47.500
How are you?

27:47.500 --> 27:48.500
How are you?

27:48.500 --> 27:49.500
He deserves.

27:49.500 --> 27:50.500
He deserves.

27:50.500 --> 27:52.500
Uh, as a die hard.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.500
Big time rush stand.

27:54.500 --> 27:57.500
I was constantly mad at one direction.

27:57.500 --> 28:01.500
Uh, so I just didn't care when they were abandoned.

28:01.500 --> 28:03.500
And, you know, he's doing a good job.

28:03.500 --> 28:06.500
I have nothing against him in his little solo career.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.500
He seems like a nice lad.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.500
I'm seeing him in Friday at the forum.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.500
I can't be more excited.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.500
Couldn't be.

28:14.500 --> 28:15.500
I.

28:15.500 --> 28:18.500
I got some high-waisted pants for it.

28:18.500 --> 28:19.500
Yeah.

28:19.500 --> 28:20.500
This is from she in.

28:20.500 --> 28:21.500
So that's where everyone's buying their high-waisted pants.

28:21.500 --> 28:22.500
Oh, yeah.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.500
The t-shirts?

28:23.500 --> 28:24.500
Brow.

28:24.500 --> 28:25.500
All right.

28:25.500 --> 28:26.500
All right.

28:26.500 --> 28:28.500
Twenty four dollars for me, Bay.

28:28.500 --> 28:29.500
Nice.

28:29.500 --> 28:30.500
Good deal.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.500
Exciting.

28:31.500 --> 28:32.500
Yeah.

28:32.500 --> 28:33.500
Yes.

28:33.500 --> 28:34.500
Good deal.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.500
Yes.

28:36.500 --> 28:37.500
This was like.

28:37.500 --> 28:40.500
The most energy we've ever given.

28:40.500 --> 28:48.500
I remember reading a comment about us, too, Marika.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.500
Because I also do read all the comments.

28:50.500 --> 28:51.500
And it was a negative one.

28:51.500 --> 28:52.500
And I wanted to share it with you.

28:52.500 --> 28:53.500
Or was it?

28:53.500 --> 28:54.500
It was.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.500
So it was an episode.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.500
Don't just do it like that.

28:59.500 --> 29:02.500
You're hand-setting up an eighth of the frame.

29:02.500 --> 29:03.500
Sorry.

29:03.500 --> 29:05.500
I should only pull it back.

29:05.500 --> 29:07.500
So a mirror was in the episode as well.

29:07.500 --> 29:11.500
And Marika, you and I were in the corners of the video.

29:11.500 --> 29:15.500
And one comment was.

29:15.500 --> 29:17.500
Are the people in the corners comedians?

29:17.500 --> 29:19.500
If not, why are they there?

29:20.500 --> 29:22.500
That's a good one.

29:22.500 --> 29:23.500
Yeah.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.500
So much plastic.

29:24.500 --> 29:27.500
Behind the smile of that was a good one.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.500
I thought it was something like.

29:29.500 --> 29:37.500
My bond of the week is Bay Bruth.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.500
Not British.

29:38.500 --> 29:39.500
Why?

29:39.500 --> 29:40.500
Well, we've established.

29:40.500 --> 29:41.500
They don't have to be British.

29:41.500 --> 29:42.500
What's it mean?

29:42.500 --> 29:44.500
Irish and fucking Brooklyn East.

29:44.500 --> 29:45.500
Imagine.

29:46.500 --> 29:52.500
Just bond pointing to left field and knocking at home.

29:52.500 --> 29:57.500
Still like baseball or something more spirally to it.

29:57.500 --> 29:58.500
Probably more spirally to it.

29:58.500 --> 30:01.500
But he could still sort of knock it out of the park.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.500
Knock it out.

30:02.500 --> 30:03.500
Yeah.

30:03.500 --> 30:04.500
Yeah.

30:04.500 --> 30:05.500
Yeah.

30:05.500 --> 30:06.500
Yeah.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.500
I think Johnny and my choices were better.

30:09.500 --> 30:10.500
Yeah.

30:10.500 --> 30:11.500
They were definitely better.

30:11.500 --> 30:12.500
Yeah.

30:12.500 --> 30:13.500
I don't think so.

30:14.500 --> 30:15.500
Yeah.

30:15.500 --> 30:16.500
Yeah.

30:16.500 --> 30:19.500
I think Bay Bruth could be a good bond.

30:19.500 --> 30:20.500
Thank you.

30:20.500 --> 30:21.500
Think about it.

30:21.500 --> 30:24.500
Because then imagine the marketing.

30:24.500 --> 30:27.500
Because like you have the chocolate bars.

30:27.500 --> 30:29.500
And it could be like baby.

30:29.500 --> 30:31.500
James.

30:31.500 --> 30:34.500
Should we cut this out?

30:34.500 --> 30:42.500
We should cut it out if you're worried about people stealing the great idea.

30:43.500 --> 30:47.500
You're intellectual property of Bay Bruth becoming a dead person, by the way.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.500
Bay Bruth becoming the next bond.

30:49.500 --> 30:50.500
Correct.

30:50.500 --> 30:54.500
And then the marketing being mostly candy bar related.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.500
Okay.

30:55.500 --> 30:56.500
Yeah.

30:56.500 --> 30:59.500
At least you're thinking about it through a business standpoint.

30:59.500 --> 31:00.500
Yeah.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.500
Well, I kind of look at everything holistically.

31:02.500 --> 31:05.500
I don't know if you guys are familiar with Mike Ferris, CEO of Fun Your Die.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.500
But his whole thing is holistic.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.500
Holisticism.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.500
If that's a word.

31:11.500 --> 31:12.500
I don't know.

31:12.500 --> 31:13.500
I really took that to heart.

31:13.500 --> 31:21.500
And maybe this is one of those moments where I kind of impart wisdom is that if you're not looking at things from not just the front end and not just the back end.

31:21.500 --> 31:24.500
But including the back end and maybe even the sides.

31:24.500 --> 31:29.500
Because those are the chances to really monetize content.

31:29.500 --> 31:33.500
Then you're not going to, you're not going to become a Daniel Redcliffe type.

31:33.500 --> 31:39.500
You're not going to get that nine figure salary.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.500
I stopped listening when you started.

31:41.500 --> 31:46.500
But I'm sure what you had to say was accidentally wise at one point.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.500
And then it kind of trail down.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.500
Probably.

31:50.500 --> 31:51.500
Wow.

31:51.500 --> 31:52.500
Listen.

31:52.500 --> 31:58.500
Geonna just texted us in the slack saying that her computer's still on the reboot.

31:58.500 --> 32:05.500
Johnny, do you want to save your segment for when she's here or do you want to do it now?

32:05.500 --> 32:07.500
We can do this segment now.

32:07.500 --> 32:08.500
Actually.

32:08.500 --> 32:09.500
Let's do it.

32:09.500 --> 32:10.500
Yeah.

32:10.500 --> 32:11.500
Let's do it.

32:11.500 --> 32:12.500
All right.

32:12.500 --> 32:13.500
So Johnny's going to share his screen.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.500
Hopefully this doesn't fuck up the recording.

32:15.500 --> 32:16.500
Yes, I hope.

32:16.500 --> 32:17.500
I fucking hope.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.500
We got to go to Bernie's again, guys.

32:19.500 --> 32:20.500
Yeah.

32:20.500 --> 32:21.500
We should.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.500
Johnny didn't go with us that one time.

32:23.500 --> 32:24.500
It was AJ, but.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.500
Yeah.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.500
They're kind of interchangeable to me.

32:27.500 --> 32:29.500
So.

32:29.500 --> 32:33.500
What the fuck is this?

32:33.500 --> 32:34.500
This is my segment.

32:34.500 --> 32:37.500
Jeff, I've actually spoken to you about this over text.

32:37.500 --> 32:38.500
Yeah.

32:38.500 --> 32:39.500
It was awesome.

32:39.500 --> 32:40.500
The read.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.500
Yeah.

32:41.500 --> 32:43.500
Marie Kabubakiki.

32:43.500 --> 32:44.500
Okay.

32:44.500 --> 32:45.500
What?

32:45.500 --> 32:46.500
You're not giving me anything.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.500
I don't know what to give you.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.500
I don't know what to give you.

32:49.500 --> 32:50.500
Okay.

32:50.500 --> 32:51.500
Perfect.

32:51.500 --> 32:52.500
So.

32:52.500 --> 32:53.500
No.

32:53.500 --> 32:54.500
It's not what you want.

32:54.500 --> 32:55.500
No.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.500
Explain what's on the screen.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.500
Explain what this is.

32:59.500 --> 33:02.500
So last weekend.

33:02.500 --> 33:05.500
I dove into this rabbit hole.

33:06.500 --> 33:12.500
And to be quite honest, I want everybody past present and future to see what's been going

33:12.500 --> 33:15.500
on in my whole lately.

33:15.500 --> 33:18.500
So phrase it like that.

33:18.500 --> 33:21.500
Bubakiki is the name.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.500
It happened when I was watching a lot of TED talks.

33:24.500 --> 33:29.500
And frankly, this is very, very free game for anyone listening right now.

33:29.500 --> 33:30.500
And anyone watching.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.500
So listen up.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.500
So these shapes.

33:33.500 --> 33:37.500
If you had to guess which one is Buba America and which one is Keiki?

33:37.500 --> 33:40.500
What would your answer be?

33:40.500 --> 33:43.500
So we're looking at like two different shapes.

33:43.500 --> 33:46.500
One's kind of like a star like with sharp edges.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.500
The other ones has rounded edges.

33:48.500 --> 33:53.500
I'm going to say rounded is Buba Keiki is the sharp edges.

33:53.500 --> 33:54.500
Yeah.

33:54.500 --> 33:55.500
So.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.500
So what?

33:58.500 --> 34:25.500
This is the most interesting thing about this is that across all languages and cultures, people

34:25.500 --> 34:26.500
think the same exact thing.

34:26.500 --> 34:31.500
Of the pointy shape being Keiki and the rounded shape being Buba.

34:31.500 --> 34:35.500
It's a social phenomenon that has been studied by psychologists.

34:35.500 --> 34:38.500
Now, here's where the game comes in.

34:38.500 --> 34:42.500
How can we apply this to podcasting?

34:42.500 --> 34:44.500
Are you asking us?

34:44.500 --> 34:46.500
So you didn't bring a segment.

34:46.500 --> 34:47.500
You brought two shapes.

34:47.500 --> 34:51.500
And now you're asking us to pick and shoehorn in something related to these two

34:51.500 --> 34:53.500
phonetic words.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.500
Let me finish.

34:54.500 --> 34:57.500
How can we apply this to podcasting?

34:57.500 --> 35:00.500
You may be asking yourself.

35:00.500 --> 35:01.500
You pause.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.500
You pause it.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.500
I was asking.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.500
I know where this is going.

35:05.500 --> 35:11.500
Well, it doesn't matter because I have a few dynamic duos that I can pull up that

35:11.500 --> 35:15.500
will help us out and figuring how we can apply this to podcasting.

35:15.500 --> 35:18.500
So here we have my God.

35:18.500 --> 35:21.500
America's level of trick.

35:21.500 --> 35:23.500
It's not the original art.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.500
It's some off literally from Deviant.

35:25.500 --> 35:26.500
Deviant art.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.500
It also has America's level of art.

35:28.500 --> 35:31.500
Is he Spanish?

35:31.500 --> 35:35.500
One, I couldn't get the, I don't have the legal permission.

35:35.500 --> 35:36.500
You don't even the right.

35:36.500 --> 35:37.500
There you go.

35:37.500 --> 35:38.500
I don't flag that.

35:38.500 --> 35:39.500
I don't.

35:39.500 --> 35:40.500
Your guys are going to have the audio version.

35:40.500 --> 35:41.500
It's not even English.

35:41.500 --> 35:42.500
God.

35:42.500 --> 35:47.500
You guys are going to really dislike the other picture.

35:47.500 --> 35:50.500
Now, using the same criteria.

35:50.500 --> 35:53.500
Who is Buba?

35:53.500 --> 35:54.500
And who is Kiki?

35:54.500 --> 35:55.500
The situation.

35:55.500 --> 35:57.500
Jeff, do you want to take this one?

35:57.500 --> 36:01.500
I guess Shrek is Buba and Donkey's Kiki.

36:01.500 --> 36:03.500
Rico, would you agree?

36:03.500 --> 36:04.500
I would agree.

36:04.500 --> 36:06.500
Great.

36:06.500 --> 36:08.500
You guys are definitely.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.500
Eyes are hunting.

36:10.500 --> 36:11.500
Yeah.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.500
What the fuck is wrong with you, Johnny?

36:13.500 --> 36:18.500
I thought it was the closest representation of Shrek that I could find on

36:19.500 --> 36:20.500
You definitely didn't.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.500
You didn't have to search just on DeviantArt.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.500
I did it.

36:24.500 --> 36:25.500
It's DeviantArt.

36:25.500 --> 36:29.500
That's like mostly like a anime porn site, right?

36:29.500 --> 36:33.500
Uh, I don't think you can post explicit photos there.

36:33.500 --> 36:34.500
Okay.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.500
I may be mistaken.

36:36.500 --> 36:38.500
I don't think you can either.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.500
Next slide.

36:39.500 --> 36:40.500
Obviously.

36:40.500 --> 36:41.500
I like it.

36:41.500 --> 36:45.500
It was kind of like in a day day where all the fan art went.

36:46.500 --> 36:47.500
Uh, yes.

36:47.500 --> 36:53.500
Now, uh, to bring it back, uh, you guys are totally right about Buba and Kiki.

36:53.500 --> 36:54.500
Yeah.

36:54.500 --> 36:55.500
I wanted to say it's not a right or wrong thing.

36:55.500 --> 36:58.500
I thought this was like a mentally exercise.

36:58.500 --> 37:05.500
I wanted to say that Shrek grossed $487.9 million US dollars.

37:05.500 --> 37:13.500
Now imagine if this Buba Kiki was podcast was a podcast.

37:16.500 --> 37:17.500
Nothing.

37:17.500 --> 37:18.500
Next question.

37:18.500 --> 37:19.500
You didn't say anything.

37:19.500 --> 37:20.500
That was nothing.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.500
And then my god.

37:22.500 --> 37:24.500
Also no photo credit for this one.

37:24.500 --> 37:25.500
Yeah.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.500
I couldn't find the credits.

37:27.500 --> 37:30.500
So I just kind of saw it right for listeners.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.500
It's SpongeBob and Patrick making out the first one.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.500
SpongeBob's kind of being lifted.

37:35.500 --> 37:40.500
And the second one, it's like a post proposal photo on a beach.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.500
Yeah.

37:41.500 --> 37:44.500
And it should be noted that the first one,

37:44.500 --> 37:49.500
not only is SpongeBob being lifted, but his shoe is tucked into the

37:49.500 --> 37:51.500
actress's pants.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.500
And it's exposing just the tiniest crack.

37:54.500 --> 37:55.500
Oh.

37:55.500 --> 37:56.500
Yeah.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.500
See?

37:58.500 --> 37:59.500
Yeah.

37:59.500 --> 38:02.500
Everyone whoever's listening on audio.

38:02.500 --> 38:05.500
Get on YouTube right now and check this out.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.500
You got to see this shit.

38:07.500 --> 38:08.500
No, you don't.

38:08.500 --> 38:09.500
Spear yourself.

38:09.500 --> 38:10.500
Let's see it.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.500
What was last time you guys said sex?

38:12.500 --> 38:16.500
Because I haven't had sex in, I think, three weeks.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.500
And this, even this photo is made.

38:18.500 --> 38:19.500
Don't bring that up.

38:19.500 --> 38:20.500
Yeah.

38:20.500 --> 38:21.500
Don't bring that up.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.500
Looking out.

38:22.500 --> 38:23.500
Yeah.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.500
Yeah.

38:24.500 --> 38:25.500
Yeah.

38:25.500 --> 38:26.500
No.

38:26.500 --> 38:27.500
It's been folks.

38:27.500 --> 38:28.500
Booban.

38:28.500 --> 38:29.500
Kiki.

38:29.500 --> 38:30.500
First of all.

38:30.500 --> 38:31.500
Let's bring it back.

38:31.500 --> 38:33.500
I feel like I might get this one wrong.

38:33.500 --> 38:34.500
Me too.

38:34.500 --> 38:38.500
Patrick is Booban.

38:38.500 --> 38:40.500
SpongeBob is Kiki.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.500
I was going to say the opposite.

38:43.500 --> 38:46.500
I had actually kind of more aside with Marie.

38:46.500 --> 38:49.500
And Patrick being Booban and SpongeBob being Kiki.

38:49.500 --> 38:50.500
Okay.

38:50.500 --> 38:51.500
Okay.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.500
13 billion in worldwide sales.

38:53.500 --> 38:54.500
This doesn't.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.500
Exactly.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.500
Don't pour away.

38:56.500 --> 38:57.500
You wait.

38:57.500 --> 38:58.500
At all.

38:58.500 --> 39:01.500
They both are Boobaki relationships.

39:01.500 --> 39:02.500
And they're both.

39:02.500 --> 39:03.500
Soul.

39:03.500 --> 39:04.500
Soul.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.500
Monot.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.500
They're so rich.

39:08.500 --> 39:09.500
It's rich because of the copies.

39:09.500 --> 39:12.500
And TV are different than podcasts.

39:12.500 --> 39:13.500
As we know.

39:13.500 --> 39:14.500
So what are you even saying?

39:14.500 --> 39:18.500
You want to do an entire Booba Kiki podcast.

39:18.500 --> 39:21.500
And you think it's going to gross millions of dollars?

39:21.500 --> 39:25.500
What I'm saying is there's so much more opportunity.

39:25.500 --> 39:30.500
If we can establish a firm Booba Kiki relationship in this podcast.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.500
Then we can get rich.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.500
Oh, you're saying one of us has to be Booba.

39:34.500 --> 39:35.500
One of us has to be Kiki.

39:35.500 --> 39:36.500
And then we'll get rich.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.500
Oh, I don't even think you know what you're saying.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.500
I think I kind of do.

39:40.500 --> 39:41.500
I think I know what I'm saying.

39:41.500 --> 39:42.500
Whatever's going on.

39:42.500 --> 39:44.500
Please welcome to the show, by the way.

39:44.500 --> 39:46.500
Gianna Kenshin.

39:46.500 --> 39:47.500
Yeah.

39:47.500 --> 39:48.500
Nice live last blow.

39:48.500 --> 39:49.500
Thank you.

39:49.500 --> 39:50.500
Thank you.

39:50.500 --> 39:51.500
Yeah.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.500
Very chuggy.

39:53.500 --> 39:54.500
Very chuggy.

39:54.500 --> 39:55.500
Yeah.

39:59.500 --> 40:00.500
So long.

40:00.500 --> 40:02.500
This is how?

40:02.500 --> 40:03.500
How is this long?

40:03.500 --> 40:05.500
Are you just chaining it together?

40:05.500 --> 40:06.500
No, that's how long it is.

40:06.500 --> 40:09.500
I just usually cut it off because it is so long.

40:09.500 --> 40:12.500
But I figured she would need some time to do what she's doing right now.

40:12.500 --> 40:17.500
Which is maneuver her laptop and plug her headphones in.

40:17.500 --> 40:22.500
Gianna, are you recording on your own?

40:22.500 --> 40:23.500
This is crazy.

40:23.500 --> 40:24.500
She doesn't have headphones in.

40:24.500 --> 40:25.500
Are you recording?

40:25.500 --> 40:26.500
Yes, headphones in.

40:26.500 --> 40:33.500
Awesome internet connection to you.

40:33.500 --> 40:36.500
Oh, god.

40:36.500 --> 40:41.500
Welcome to the show.

40:41.500 --> 40:47.500
Yeah, you're joining what is quickly becoming a train wreck.

40:47.500 --> 40:53.500
Gianni has Johnny talks about Bubba Kiki.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.500
Okay, so he's showing us photos.

40:55.500 --> 41:01.500
And we have to basically figure out the relational Bubba Kiki to these photos.

41:01.500 --> 41:02.500
Yeah.

41:02.500 --> 41:03.500
All right.

41:03.500 --> 41:04.500
So Carlson and Will Smith.

41:04.500 --> 41:05.500
Yeah.

41:05.500 --> 41:07.500
So why don't you answer this one?

41:07.500 --> 41:10.500
Will is Kiki and Carlton is Bubba.

41:10.500 --> 41:11.500
Yeah.

41:11.500 --> 41:12.500
I agree.

41:12.500 --> 41:13.500
Same.

41:13.500 --> 41:14.500
Wow.

41:14.500 --> 41:15.500
Okay.

41:15.500 --> 41:18.500
Well, it's kind of a tricky situation.

41:18.500 --> 41:19.500
Not really.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.500
It's Prince and it's cousin Carlton.

41:21.500 --> 41:26.500
His funny funny cousin Carlton are also wildly successful and also Bubba Kiki.

41:26.500 --> 41:28.500
So you guys are right.

41:28.500 --> 41:34.500
But this relationship confused me a little bit when I was putting this together.

41:34.500 --> 41:36.500
So I took a few pills.

41:36.500 --> 41:43.500
And then after that, I realized I could just create a scale that measures all shades

41:43.500 --> 41:46.500
of gray in the Bubba Kiki dimension.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.500
Oh, I put this together.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.500
Fucking God.

41:50.500 --> 41:55.500
It's based on the Kinsey scale of sexual orientation.

41:55.500 --> 42:00.500
I don't have to dive into it completely.

42:00.500 --> 42:01.500
It's very big.

42:01.500 --> 42:02.500
I understand that.

42:02.500 --> 42:07.500
But this is this tackle's haul from True Bubba to True Kiki.

42:07.500 --> 42:12.500
And here's where Carlton and Will will fall into the scale.

42:12.500 --> 42:17.500
Will falls into the pseudo Bubba because he has an outward appearance of a Kiki.

42:17.500 --> 42:21.500
But obviously very Bubba behaviors.

42:21.500 --> 42:30.500
Nothing that you've shown up prior to this proves that Bubba and Kiki can be a behavior.

42:30.500 --> 42:32.500
It was solely based on looks.

42:32.500 --> 42:34.500
You started with genetics.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.500
Yeah.

42:36.500 --> 42:38.500
So this is.

42:38.500 --> 42:42.500
It's also unbelievably open to interpretation.

42:42.500 --> 42:46.500
That's the entire interesting part of it, which is why you brought it up in the first place.

42:48.500 --> 42:49.500
Oh.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.500
Don't I stroke your.

42:51.500 --> 42:53.500
There's nothing that you can be realizing.

42:53.500 --> 42:54.500
I don't think.

42:54.500 --> 42:59.500
You know, what you're saying right now is really, really Bubba.

42:59.500 --> 43:01.500
And I'm noticing it.

43:01.500 --> 43:06.500
Can you explain how this is how this is based on the Kinsey scale toast?

43:06.500 --> 43:08.500
Yeah, this is way more just to scale.

43:08.500 --> 43:11.500
It's just to scale.

43:11.500 --> 43:14.500
The fact that it's a scale, it means I based it on a scale.

43:15.500 --> 43:18.500
Let's do next slide.

43:18.500 --> 43:22.500
I just wanted to relay it back for every Bubba.

43:22.500 --> 43:24.500
There's an equal and opposite Kiki.

43:24.500 --> 43:26.500
This is just things you think.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.500
There's no facts.

43:28.500 --> 43:31.500
Don't say a theorem without a proof.

43:31.500 --> 43:32.500
Yeah.

43:32.500 --> 43:34.500
This is all the proof you need.

43:34.500 --> 43:36.500
This is not a simple rule.

43:36.500 --> 43:40.500
Look, the sponge Bob and Patrick relationship the Bubba Kiki there.

43:40.500 --> 43:42.500
That's 13 billion dollars.

43:42.500 --> 43:43.500
No.

43:43.500 --> 43:45.500
The show is 13 billion.

43:45.500 --> 43:49.500
The show is the content and writing is good.

43:49.500 --> 43:50.500
Okay.

43:50.500 --> 43:54.500
So that's the photo or how it relates to Bubba Kiki.

43:54.500 --> 43:57.500
John, a great photo of the right.

43:57.500 --> 43:58.500
Yeah.

43:58.500 --> 43:59.500
I.

43:59.500 --> 44:00.500
She agrees.

44:00.500 --> 44:02.500
I don't know what's going on right now.

44:02.500 --> 44:03.500
Yeah.

44:03.500 --> 44:04.500
Well, you did join.

44:04.500 --> 44:05.500
45 minutes.

44:05.500 --> 44:09.500
That was not my fault.

44:10.500 --> 44:12.500
Is that the end of the Kiki journey?

44:12.500 --> 44:14.500
Because we can start with the next.

44:14.500 --> 44:15.500
Oh, okay.

44:15.500 --> 44:17.500
I'll just like steam roll through this.

44:17.500 --> 44:18.500
No.

44:18.500 --> 44:20.500
There's no Bubba Kiki in this one.

44:20.500 --> 44:21.500
And guess what?

44:21.500 --> 44:24.500
They a fight club actually flopped at the box office.

44:24.500 --> 44:25.500
It's an on its initial release.

44:25.500 --> 44:28.500
Don't base this on box office numbers.

44:28.500 --> 44:32.500
Well, even Edward Norton went on to blame.

44:32.500 --> 44:33.500
No.

44:33.500 --> 44:35.500
Edward Norton's Edward Norton.

44:35.500 --> 44:38.500
Oh, I cannot doctor an indie wire article.

44:38.500 --> 44:39.500
Yes.

44:39.500 --> 44:40.500
You don't know.

44:40.500 --> 44:41.500
I can't bond.

44:41.500 --> 44:42.500
Imagine the font.

44:42.500 --> 44:44.500
And I know you know how to do that.

44:44.500 --> 44:45.500
Right.

44:45.500 --> 44:46.500
Quick and specked.

44:46.500 --> 44:47.500
Change the rating.

44:47.500 --> 44:48.500
Yeah.

44:48.500 --> 44:51.500
I would say is Bubba.

44:51.500 --> 44:52.500
Hmm.

44:52.500 --> 44:53.500
Can we all agree?

44:53.500 --> 44:59.500
Also, why was he talking about the box office flop of fight club in 2019?

44:59.500 --> 45:02.500
When talking, doing press for motherless brook.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.500
Did any of us see motherless brook?

45:04.500 --> 45:07.500
And I didn't want to doctor that far because I knew.

45:07.500 --> 45:09.500
Anyway, we can move on.

45:09.500 --> 45:10.500
Hi, fine.

45:10.500 --> 45:11.500
Yeah.

45:11.500 --> 45:12.500
Next slide.

45:12.500 --> 45:14.500
This is interesting.

45:14.500 --> 45:16.500
Oh, my god.

45:16.500 --> 45:19.500
I spent hours of hours of living.

45:19.500 --> 45:22.500
Between anything that has some kind of relationship.

45:22.500 --> 45:23.500
Yeah.

45:23.500 --> 45:24.500
But Bubba alone.

45:24.500 --> 45:28.500
Two Bubba's can't activate the same level of dynamism.

45:28.500 --> 45:30.500
That sexual chemistry.

45:30.500 --> 45:32.500
That sexual dynamite.

45:32.500 --> 45:33.500
That Bubba and Kiki.

45:33.500 --> 45:34.500
Is it sexual?

45:34.500 --> 45:35.500
Yeah.

45:35.500 --> 45:36.500
Why is it sexual?

45:37.500 --> 45:39.500
Nothing you've shown us has related to sex at all.

45:39.500 --> 45:40.500
No, I'm not kidding.

45:40.500 --> 45:41.500
I'm not kidding.

45:41.500 --> 45:42.500
All right.

45:42.500 --> 45:43.500
Fine.

45:43.500 --> 45:44.500
You showed us cousins.

45:44.500 --> 45:45.500
And yep.

45:45.500 --> 45:46.500
Okay.

45:46.500 --> 45:47.500
So that's a fun round.

45:47.500 --> 45:48.500
Monster.

45:48.500 --> 45:54.500
Like wasowski and James P. Sullivan of monsters incorporated from Disney Pixar.

45:54.500 --> 45:57.500
I didn't go into that detail of that one.

45:57.500 --> 45:59.500
This is saying what studio did it.

45:59.500 --> 46:01.500
You didn't mention dream works when you brought up Shrek.

46:01.500 --> 46:03.500
You didn't mention Nickelodeon when you brought up SpongeBob.

46:03.500 --> 46:04.500
But now you're like,

46:05.500 --> 46:08.500
This is made by the last paint for sure.

46:08.500 --> 46:11.500
This will love in children's cartoon.

46:11.500 --> 46:12.500
Yeah.

46:12.500 --> 46:15.500
You're talking about sexual sexual tension.

46:15.500 --> 46:17.500
Sexual dynamism.

46:17.500 --> 46:18.500
Yeah.

46:18.500 --> 46:20.500
But it's even worse.

46:20.500 --> 46:24.500
I think that Mike was asking is a tough powering through.

46:24.500 --> 46:26.500
That's my God.

46:26.500 --> 46:30.500
That's why anywhere you go at any time in the world.

46:30.500 --> 46:32.500
There will be a boobah Kiki.

46:32.500 --> 46:34.500
The likelihood is 100%.

46:34.500 --> 46:35.500
Sure.

46:35.500 --> 46:36.500
Obviously.

46:36.500 --> 46:38.500
Because you're saying this exists.

46:38.500 --> 46:39.500
To begin with.

46:39.500 --> 46:41.500
Of course there's that.

46:41.500 --> 46:42.500
Exactly.

46:42.500 --> 46:45.500
So you agree that I.

46:45.500 --> 46:52.500
I agree with this slide that you said that at any point in time.

46:52.500 --> 46:54.500
A boobah Kiki exists.

46:54.500 --> 46:58.500
If you're saying that a boobah Kiki exists to begin with.

46:58.500 --> 46:59.500
Then yes.

46:59.500 --> 47:00.500
That's correct.

47:00.500 --> 47:01.500
There we go.

47:01.500 --> 47:02.500
Yes.

47:02.500 --> 47:04.500
Boobah Kiki exists.

47:04.500 --> 47:05.500
This is the God.

47:05.500 --> 47:06.500
I don't know.

47:06.500 --> 47:07.500
I'm going to hammer in.

47:07.500 --> 47:08.500
This entire thought.

47:08.500 --> 47:09.500
Oh my God.

47:09.500 --> 47:11.500
You've stumped me.

47:11.500 --> 47:13.500
I don't know what to say.

47:13.500 --> 47:14.500
This isn't anything.

47:14.500 --> 47:17.500
The second one is laughs per minute.

47:17.500 --> 47:18.500
Right.

47:18.500 --> 47:20.500
Because any movie is boobah Kiki.

47:20.500 --> 47:22.500
So of course it's more than 100 billion.

47:22.500 --> 47:24.500
Because it's laughs every week.

47:24.500 --> 47:25.500
Yeah.

47:25.500 --> 47:26.500
But we can.

47:26.500 --> 47:27.500
Who's watching it.

47:27.500 --> 47:31.500
The second minute is not an actual unit of measurement that anyone uses.

47:31.500 --> 47:32.500
LPM.

47:32.500 --> 47:33.500
We don't know it.

47:33.500 --> 47:34.500
It laughs per minute.

47:34.500 --> 47:38.500
You can't just put shit on graph paper and say that it's science.

47:38.500 --> 47:39.500
You did no reason.

47:39.500 --> 47:40.500
You're no proof.

47:40.500 --> 47:41.500
I know.

47:41.500 --> 47:43.500
Said no such thing that this was science.

47:43.500 --> 47:45.500
This is just pure fact.

47:45.500 --> 47:46.500
Honestly.

47:46.500 --> 47:49.500
That's actually non scientific.

47:49.500 --> 47:52.500
But worse.

47:52.500 --> 47:56.500
I was actually giving you the benefit of the doubt saying you thought this was science.

47:56.500 --> 47:59.500
You're open to being wrong even a little bit.

47:59.500 --> 48:03.500
You're astrological big three and boobah Kiki.

48:03.500 --> 48:05.500
My astrological big three.

48:05.500 --> 48:06.500
Boobah Kiki.

48:06.500 --> 48:07.500
Yeah.

48:07.500 --> 48:09.500
I think I need a big two.

48:09.500 --> 48:10.500
A big two.

48:10.500 --> 48:12.500
Like boobah son.

48:12.500 --> 48:13.500
Kiki rising.

48:13.500 --> 48:14.500
Boobah son.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.500
Kiki rising.

48:16.500 --> 48:17.500
But you know what?

48:17.500 --> 48:19.500
Like everybody's been kind of.

48:19.500 --> 48:23.500
Shooting on my segment, which I prepared tirelessly.

48:23.500 --> 48:24.500
How I'm clear.

48:24.500 --> 48:25.500
Take you.

48:25.500 --> 48:30.500
This actually took me three hours.

48:30.500 --> 48:34.500
And like only like 50,000 people are going to see me.

48:34.500 --> 48:36.500
To be fair to be fair, he got really distracted.

48:36.500 --> 48:38.500
Looking up SpongeBob art on DVN.

48:38.500 --> 48:39.500
Yeah.

48:39.500 --> 48:42.500
That was like that took a solid two.

48:42.500 --> 48:49.500
That was me and Oliver Branch by saying this is the end of the presentation.

48:49.500 --> 48:53.500
When the world ends, will you be someone's boobah or someone's Kiki?

48:53.500 --> 48:56.500
It doesn't fucking matter.

48:56.500 --> 48:57.500
Just think about it.

48:57.500 --> 49:01.500
Think about it for a second.

49:01.500 --> 49:02.500
And there we go.

49:02.500 --> 49:03.500
That.

49:03.500 --> 49:04.500
Are you happy?

49:04.500 --> 49:05.500
You end 18 slides.

49:05.500 --> 49:06.500
18 slides.

49:06.500 --> 49:07.500
18 slides.

49:07.500 --> 49:08.500
My fucking god.

49:08.500 --> 49:10.500
How do I make you stop screen sharing?

49:10.500 --> 49:11.500
I do it myself.

49:11.500 --> 49:12.500
I do it myself.

49:12.500 --> 49:13.500
I do it.

49:13.500 --> 49:18.500
I mean, I had another segment.

49:18.500 --> 49:20.500
We're 45 minutes into this thing.

49:20.500 --> 49:22.500
We can have to go.

49:22.500 --> 49:23.500
Yeah.

49:23.500 --> 49:24.500
They do need to go.

49:24.500 --> 49:25.500
All right.

49:25.500 --> 49:26.500
So let's bid it to you.

49:26.500 --> 49:27.500
Tamarika.

49:27.500 --> 49:28.500
And then we'll do this last segment.

49:28.500 --> 49:29.500
How's that sound?

49:29.500 --> 49:30.500
Great.

49:30.500 --> 49:31.500
Okay.

49:31.500 --> 49:32.500
Hang on.

49:32.500 --> 49:33.500
Let me get something for you to go out.

49:33.500 --> 49:34.500
Let me get something to go out on.

49:34.500 --> 49:35.500
All right.

49:35.500 --> 49:36.500
All right.

49:36.500 --> 49:37.500
The.

49:37.500 --> 49:38.500
The.

49:38.500 --> 49:40.500
Thanks.

49:40.500 --> 49:41.500
Bye.

49:41.500 --> 49:43.500
I don't think anybody.

49:43.500 --> 49:44.500
All right.

49:44.500 --> 49:45.500
Welcome.

49:45.500 --> 49:46.500
Oh, sorry.

49:46.500 --> 49:47.500
Let me do the fucking.

49:47.500 --> 49:49.500
Everybody wants a fucking song.

49:50.500 --> 49:54.500
I don't think anybody said they want a song.

49:54.500 --> 49:57.500
I want a song.

49:57.500 --> 50:00.500
Welcome to smash your pass.

50:00.500 --> 50:01.500
Great.

50:01.500 --> 50:04.500
Now, this is a segment I can get behind.

50:04.500 --> 50:05.500
Yeah.

50:05.500 --> 50:10.500
You guys are playing smash your pass, right?

50:10.500 --> 50:12.500
Where it's like kind of objectifying other humans.

50:12.500 --> 50:14.500
I'm just saying like who you want to fucking.

50:14.500 --> 50:15.500
You don't.

50:15.500 --> 50:16.500
Of course.

50:16.500 --> 50:17.500
Okay.

50:18.500 --> 50:21.500
Okay. So this is that, but it's going to be about other shit.

50:21.500 --> 50:23.500
And there's no right or wrong answers here.

50:23.500 --> 50:24.500
I just thought that we could wax.

50:24.500 --> 50:26.500
So smash your pass.

50:26.500 --> 50:27.500
A COVID-19 booster.

50:31.500 --> 50:32.500
Smash.

50:32.500 --> 50:33.500
Yeah.

50:33.500 --> 50:35.500
Totally smash correct.

50:35.500 --> 50:37.500
You said they're no right or wrong answers.

50:37.500 --> 50:38.500
Sorry.

50:38.500 --> 50:39.500
I just got one.

50:39.500 --> 50:40.500
There is a right or wrong answer.

50:40.500 --> 50:41.500
Okay.

50:41.500 --> 50:42.500
Yeah.

50:42.500 --> 50:43.500
I would agree.

50:43.500 --> 50:44.500
Okay.

50:44.500 --> 50:46.500
How about judging a midwife's decisions outside of work?

50:46.500 --> 50:51.500
I would totally pass on that.

50:51.500 --> 50:56.500
So this is what kind of decisions.

50:56.500 --> 50:58.500
What are we talking about?

50:58.500 --> 51:00.500
Well, that's what I'm saying is like you don't get.

51:00.500 --> 51:01.500
You can't know.

51:01.500 --> 51:03.500
This is the theoretical midwife, the royal midwife.

51:03.500 --> 51:04.500
And so it's like, okay.

51:04.500 --> 51:07.500
You don't know what their decisions are.

51:07.500 --> 51:13.500
But can you even step into the arena of judgment?

51:14.500 --> 51:21.500
Or is being a midwife so sacral that it's like sacral kind of get.

51:21.500 --> 51:23.500
No, I think you can judge her.

51:23.500 --> 51:24.500
I'm going to smash on that.

51:24.500 --> 51:25.500
Nice.

51:25.500 --> 51:26.500
Nice.

51:26.500 --> 51:27.500
All right.

51:27.500 --> 51:30.500
What about giving a platform to the unhoused?

51:32.500 --> 51:33.500
Smash.

51:33.500 --> 51:34.500
Yes.

51:34.500 --> 51:35.500
Yeah.

51:35.500 --> 51:38.500
I thought Marie could would say pass.

51:38.500 --> 51:40.500
I actually think that I can speak from Marie.

51:40.500 --> 51:41.500
I've known her for six fucking years.

51:41.500 --> 51:43.500
I feel like I can kind of speak for her.

51:43.500 --> 51:44.500
She would pass.

51:44.500 --> 51:45.500
I don't know.

51:45.500 --> 51:46.500
She would pass.

51:46.500 --> 51:47.500
Why wouldn't she pass?

51:47.500 --> 51:48.500
Yeah.

51:48.500 --> 51:49.500
I don't think so.

51:49.500 --> 51:50.500
She loves hierarchy.

51:50.500 --> 51:51.500
She loves social nowhere.

51:51.500 --> 51:54.500
She loves to have people.

51:54.500 --> 52:00.500
By virtue or vice-rather of policy decisions.

52:00.500 --> 52:05.500
Have people not have human dignity and basic needs.

52:05.500 --> 52:06.500
Wrong.

52:06.500 --> 52:10.500
I find it hard to believe that you've even spoken to Marie.

52:10.500 --> 52:11.500
You've never been your entire life.

52:11.500 --> 52:12.500
About this?

52:12.500 --> 52:14.500
No, just in general.

52:14.500 --> 52:15.500
There's no way.

52:15.500 --> 52:21.500
I think like you kind of get to get a gauge on like someone's moral standing.

52:21.500 --> 52:22.500
The first time you meet them.

52:22.500 --> 52:23.500
Right?

52:23.500 --> 52:24.500
And Carlos.

52:24.500 --> 52:29.500
And Mirica haven't met nearly as many times as you and her.

52:29.500 --> 52:32.500
And I know that she would definitely smash on this.

52:32.500 --> 52:34.500
A great.

52:34.500 --> 52:35.500
It's supposed to be fun.

52:35.500 --> 52:37.500
Just remember that.

52:37.500 --> 52:41.500
A paper doll by John Mayer.

52:41.500 --> 52:44.500
I don't know that song.

52:44.500 --> 52:50.500
I'm going to pass just to spite you.

52:50.500 --> 52:52.500
That's fair.

52:52.500 --> 52:54.500
John Mayer's hot.

52:54.500 --> 52:55.500
Agreed.

52:55.500 --> 52:56.500
All right.

52:56.500 --> 52:57.500
No, that I can agree with.

52:57.500 --> 52:58.500
Yeah.

52:58.500 --> 52:59.500
Just smash her past John Mayer.

52:59.500 --> 53:00.500
Yeah.

53:00.500 --> 53:01.500
That would be.

53:01.500 --> 53:02.500
No, that's not what it is.

53:02.500 --> 53:03.500
It's paper doll by John Mayer.

53:03.500 --> 53:05.500
What are we trying to make it a little bit more.

53:05.500 --> 53:07.500
We're trying to make it a little bit more fun.

53:07.500 --> 53:08.500
Is that all right with you?

53:08.500 --> 53:11.500
There you go.

53:11.500 --> 53:14.500
It's not like my fucking dad.

53:14.500 --> 53:15.500
All right.

53:15.500 --> 53:20.500
What about reality bending aspects of your?

53:20.500 --> 53:22.500
Smash.

53:22.500 --> 53:23.500
Such as.

53:23.500 --> 53:26.500
Reality bending aspects of your life.

53:26.500 --> 53:27.500
I don't know, man.

53:27.500 --> 53:32.500
Like the acid tests are like any kind of thing where it's like,

53:33.500 --> 53:36.500
you know, consciousness is altered,

53:36.500 --> 53:40.500
but, you know, in a certain time period, right?

53:40.500 --> 53:43.500
Bicycle day.

53:43.500 --> 53:45.500
Is this the next one or?

53:45.500 --> 53:46.500
I don't know.

53:46.500 --> 53:47.500
Let's move on.

53:47.500 --> 53:49.500
This is this is already.

53:49.500 --> 53:50.500
You guys are going to mean nothing.

53:50.500 --> 53:52.500
What about a state sales to have?

53:52.500 --> 53:54.500
A state sales to have?

53:54.500 --> 53:55.500
Yeah.

53:55.500 --> 53:56.500
Or just a state sales.

53:56.500 --> 53:57.500
But yeah.

53:57.500 --> 53:58.500
A state sales.

53:58.500 --> 53:59.500
I would totally.

53:59.500 --> 54:00.500
Yeah.

54:01.500 --> 54:03.500
A hundred percent great deals.

54:03.500 --> 54:06.500
One time I pulled up to a state sale.

54:06.500 --> 54:08.500
That was going to open at 11 in the morning.

54:08.500 --> 54:12.500
I pulled up at six in the morning because it had so much.

54:12.500 --> 54:15.500
Nineteen 60s mod furniture.

54:15.500 --> 54:16.500
Okay.

54:16.500 --> 54:18.500
I was like, I'm going to walk out with so many things.

54:18.500 --> 54:20.500
Everything was extremely expensive.

54:20.500 --> 54:21.500
So I waited there for nothing.

54:21.500 --> 54:23.500
And I walked out with less than nothing.

54:23.500 --> 54:25.500
You waited for five hours.

54:25.500 --> 54:26.500
Yeah.

54:26.500 --> 54:27.500
Damn.

54:27.500 --> 54:28.500
That sucks.

54:28.500 --> 54:29.500
That's your fucking jam, too.

54:29.500 --> 54:30.500
That's like a mod.

54:30.500 --> 54:31.500
Oh yeah.

54:31.500 --> 54:32.500
No.

54:32.500 --> 54:37.500
You don't even give him a smile for that because it's like he makes these decisions.

54:37.500 --> 54:38.500
Yeah.

54:38.500 --> 54:42.500
He has to live with and he's still joyous of bad decision making.

54:42.500 --> 54:46.500
You're not making this any more fun than she was trying to make it fun again.

54:46.500 --> 54:47.500
Childhood.

54:47.500 --> 54:48.500
Childhood.

54:48.500 --> 54:50.500
Childhood journaling.

54:50.500 --> 54:51.500
Smash.

54:51.500 --> 54:52.500
Totally smash.

54:52.500 --> 54:53.500
Yeah.

54:53.500 --> 54:56.500
I think that's a healthy way to deal with your emotions.

54:56.500 --> 54:57.500
I agree.

54:57.500 --> 54:58.500
I agree.

55:00.500 --> 55:01.500
Did you.

55:01.500 --> 55:02.500
Jeff.

55:02.500 --> 55:04.500
Did you ever child journal as a child?

55:04.500 --> 55:05.500
No.

55:05.500 --> 55:06.500
Okay.

55:06.500 --> 55:08.500
So that explains kind of a lot, right?

55:08.500 --> 55:14.500
Stem cell research or not.

55:14.500 --> 55:15.500
Or not.

55:15.500 --> 55:16.500
So.

55:16.500 --> 55:17.500
We're.

55:17.500 --> 55:18.500
Which one are we smashing?

55:18.500 --> 55:19.500
Passing.

55:19.500 --> 55:20.500
Passing.

55:20.500 --> 55:21.500
Right.

55:21.500 --> 55:24.500
So it's either to have it or not.

55:24.500 --> 55:26.500
And then smash your pass.

55:26.500 --> 55:28.500
It's supposed to be called either to.

55:28.500 --> 55:29.500
Yeah, it's smash.

55:29.500 --> 55:30.500
I totally smash.

55:30.500 --> 55:31.500
Okay.

55:31.500 --> 55:32.500
Stem.

55:32.500 --> 55:34.500
That one's tough because passing is the same as smash.

55:34.500 --> 55:35.500
Exactly.

55:35.500 --> 55:37.500
That's why it's confusing.

55:37.500 --> 55:38.500
All right.

55:38.500 --> 55:40.500
Sexual analytics.

55:40.500 --> 55:41.500
Totally smash.

55:41.500 --> 55:42.500
Really.

55:42.500 --> 55:44.500
I'd love to go with your paths.

55:44.500 --> 55:45.500
Yeah.

55:45.500 --> 55:46.500
I'd love to.

55:46.500 --> 55:47.500
You.

55:47.500 --> 55:48.500
Yeah.

55:48.500 --> 55:49.500
You.

55:49.500 --> 55:50.500
You.

55:50.500 --> 55:51.500
Yeah.

55:51.500 --> 55:52.500
You.

55:52.500 --> 55:53.500
We're both from the same hometown.

55:53.500 --> 55:54.500
Uh.

55:54.500 --> 55:55.500
Burlington.

55:55.500 --> 55:56.500
Yeah.

55:56.500 --> 55:57.500
Yeah.

55:58.500 --> 55:59.500
Right.

55:59.500 --> 56:00.500
Is that what it is?

56:00.500 --> 56:01.500
We're all dumb.

56:01.500 --> 56:02.500
Yeah.

56:02.500 --> 56:03.500
Yeah.

56:03.500 --> 56:05.500
We are.

56:05.500 --> 56:06.500
It's also.

56:06.500 --> 56:08.500
The thing is that weirdly.

56:08.500 --> 56:11.500
There are people that listen to this show that have real jobs.

56:11.500 --> 56:13.500
That affect the world in a positive way.

56:13.500 --> 56:17.500
And like sometimes we'll say something or I'll say something specifically incorrect.

56:17.500 --> 56:20.500
And then like I'll get a DM or somebody tweets at me and it's like,

56:20.500 --> 56:22.500
Hey, I work in like.

56:22.500 --> 56:24.500
Research for like XYZ.

56:25.500 --> 56:27.500
You're actually completely off base with this thing.

56:27.500 --> 56:29.500
And I'm like, you'd work there.

56:29.500 --> 56:30.500
And you listen to this.

56:30.500 --> 56:32.500
I wouldn't trust that.

56:32.500 --> 56:33.500
Uh.

56:33.500 --> 56:34.500
Sexual analytics.

56:34.500 --> 56:35.500
So like yeah.

56:35.500 --> 56:38.500
Basically rank in your sexual partners against each other.

56:38.500 --> 56:40.500
I think that that's kind of fucked up because it's not necessarily.

56:40.500 --> 56:42.500
It's about sexual chemistry.

56:42.500 --> 56:44.500
It's about kind of forging a bomb with somebody.

56:44.500 --> 56:45.500
If free.

56:45.500 --> 56:48.500
I assume bisexual analytics you're describing like a.

56:48.500 --> 56:50.500
A spreadsheet.

56:50.500 --> 56:51.500
Uh.

56:51.500 --> 56:53.500
The sheet that you spread a spreadsheet about.

56:53.500 --> 56:56.500
Just like minutes lasted.

56:56.500 --> 56:57.500
Uh.

56:57.500 --> 57:00.500
It's color coded and shit.

57:00.500 --> 57:01.500
That's what I wanted.

57:01.500 --> 57:02.500
Yeah.

57:02.500 --> 57:04.500
But now I feel like for your own disgusting.

57:04.500 --> 57:05.500
Yeah.

57:05.500 --> 57:06.500
For my own performance.

57:06.500 --> 57:07.500
I'm trying to get better.

57:07.500 --> 57:09.500
What's the longest you ever had sex?

57:09.500 --> 57:14.500
Johnny.

57:14.500 --> 57:18.500
Because sometimes it gets too long.

57:18.500 --> 57:20.500
And then it's like not that fun anymore.

57:20.500 --> 57:21.500
Yeah.

57:21.500 --> 57:22.500
Yeah.

57:22.500 --> 57:32.500
But like 30, 40, second half finally.

57:32.500 --> 57:33.500
Let's move on.

57:33.500 --> 57:34.500
What about?

57:34.500 --> 57:35.500
Yeah.

57:35.500 --> 57:36.500
Gatekeeping.

57:36.500 --> 57:38.500
Gatekeeping.

57:38.500 --> 57:39.500
Gatekeeping.

57:39.500 --> 57:41.500
Gatekeeping.

57:41.500 --> 57:42.500
Smash.

57:42.500 --> 57:43.500
Did you see that lady on TikTok?

57:43.500 --> 57:45.500
That was like a fake beekeeper?

57:45.500 --> 57:46.500
I don't know.

57:46.500 --> 57:48.500
But that's perfect for you.

57:48.500 --> 57:49.500
Yeah.

57:50.500 --> 57:52.500
She had a bunch of followers.

57:52.500 --> 57:56.500
And she was like making videos about like she would like have like a like a

57:56.500 --> 57:58.500
bee hive that was like in danger or something.

57:58.500 --> 57:59.500
And then she would like come up.

57:59.500 --> 58:03.500
And she would like pull a queen out of her jacket and like a little clip.

58:03.500 --> 58:04.500
And she would be like luckily.

58:04.500 --> 58:07.500
I had a queen on me right in the nick of time.

58:07.500 --> 58:08.500
And I saved the hive.

58:08.500 --> 58:09.500
And people were like yo.

58:09.500 --> 58:11.500
This lady is a fucking liar.

58:11.500 --> 58:13.500
Got like themselves.

58:13.500 --> 58:15.500
I believe she wasn't a real beekeeper.

58:15.500 --> 58:16.500
No way.

58:16.500 --> 58:17.500
You saw her?

58:17.500 --> 58:18.500
Yeah.

58:18.500 --> 58:19.500
She's fake.

58:19.500 --> 58:20.500
Oh, my god.

58:20.500 --> 58:22.500
My whole world is crumbling before my eyes.

58:22.500 --> 58:27.500
You got to be hit more fortified as a person for that to not crumbles.

58:27.500 --> 58:30.500
Like that's like that was a lot of that meant like a whole lot.

58:30.500 --> 58:31.500
It should know.

58:31.500 --> 58:33.500
It should have meant little to none.

58:33.500 --> 58:34.500
Market.

58:34.500 --> 58:39.500
What about marketing goals slash sauce?

58:39.500 --> 58:40.500
Marketing goals.

58:40.500 --> 58:41.500
Smash process.

58:41.500 --> 58:44.500
Marketing goals slash sauce.

58:44.500 --> 58:47.500
So like you're sitting there kind of setting goals for Q1 and you're like dipping.

58:48.500 --> 58:50.500
Carrots and ranch.

58:50.500 --> 58:51.500
Maybe.

58:51.500 --> 58:52.500
Oh.

58:52.500 --> 58:53.500
Smash.

58:53.500 --> 58:54.500
Okay.

58:54.500 --> 58:58.500
I would smash the sauce part but the marketing goals I could definitely do with that.

58:58.500 --> 58:59.500
That's right.

58:59.500 --> 59:02.500
Basically what I was doing at the headgum live show.

59:02.500 --> 59:04.500
All right.

59:04.500 --> 59:06.500
What about meals on wheels?

59:06.500 --> 59:07.500
Totally smash.

59:07.500 --> 59:08.500
Smash.

59:08.500 --> 59:09.500
Yeah.

59:09.500 --> 59:10.500
Great.

59:10.500 --> 59:12.500
You're offering a lot of smashes.

59:12.500 --> 59:13.500
Not really many.

59:13.500 --> 59:14.500
Yeah.

59:14.500 --> 59:15.500
You are.

59:15.500 --> 59:16.500
All right.

59:17.500 --> 59:18.500
Smash.

59:18.500 --> 59:19.500
Smash.

59:19.500 --> 59:20.500
Well.

59:20.500 --> 59:21.500
I actually want anything about that.

59:21.500 --> 59:23.500
We are the POCs and this.

59:23.500 --> 59:24.500
We are.

59:24.500 --> 59:25.500
Yeah.

59:25.500 --> 59:26.500
We had a.

59:26.500 --> 59:29.500
This is the second all person of color had gone podcast episode.

59:29.500 --> 59:31.500
I love that.

59:31.500 --> 59:32.500
Yeah.

59:32.500 --> 59:33.500
John.

59:33.500 --> 59:34.500
John Z.

59:34.500 --> 59:35.500
Oh my god.

59:35.500 --> 59:36.500
Soon.

59:36.500 --> 59:37.500
Soon.

59:37.500 --> 59:38.500
I hope.

59:38.500 --> 59:39.500
But I.

59:39.500 --> 59:40.500
Give me money.

59:40.500 --> 59:42.500
I'm going to plug my.

59:42.500 --> 59:43.500
My.

59:43.500 --> 59:44.500
My.

59:44.500 --> 59:45.500
My.

59:46.500 --> 59:47.500
No.

59:47.500 --> 59:48.500
I don't want to.

59:48.500 --> 59:50.500
Uh, because I'm going to work for three months.

59:50.500 --> 59:51.500
Why?

59:51.500 --> 59:53.500
To be like in two weeks.

59:53.500 --> 59:54.500
We're good.

59:54.500 --> 59:55.500
December.

59:55.500 --> 59:58.500
I'm February and potentially half of March.

59:58.500 --> 59:59.500
Hopefully.

59:59.500 --> 01:00:02.500
I'll take the good old energy transit.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.500
To come up and see us off.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.500
Yeah.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.500
Yes.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.500
It is awful.

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:08.500
It is.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:09.500
It's so awful.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.500
What about choosing a location based on vocation.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.500
Smash or pass.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.500
Based on vocation.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.500
Yeah.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:18.500
Pass.

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:20.500
Clearly.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.500
Because you still live in New Jersey.

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:22.500
And you work in New York.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.500
Yeah.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.500
Yeah.

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.500
See.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:27.500
Johnny.

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:31.500
I have to smash because that's exactly what I did.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:35.500
But what if you get a job in like.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:40.500
Like what if you get your dream job offer and it's in like Utah.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.500
That's why I say pass.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.500
Exactly.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:44.500
I'd have to.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:49.500
So you wouldn't even move somewhere that you don't like for your absolute dream job.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.500
I don't think I would.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:56.500
If it was somewhere really, truly awful.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.500
But you have to.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.500
I feel like you have to look at it in a certain way where like.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.500
Okay.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:02.500
You're there for two years.

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.500
Maybe even a year and a half.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:09.500
And then you have that experience under your belt that the next job.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:14.500
You get to go back to New York or something nonsense.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.500
Okay.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:19.500
Maybe I'll smash this.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:20.500
You kind of convinced me.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:25.500
It's like the open to change in opinions.

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:26.500
Uh.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.500
All right.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:28.500
We got two more.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:29.500
Let's get through these.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:30.500
Uh.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.500
Sacred.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.500
Get through it.

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:34.500
I said.

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:37.500
Sacred river blessings.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:41.500
So sort of druidry in a way.

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:42.500
Druidry.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.500
Setting mother earth like a table.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:49.500
And blessing her most.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:52.500
Life giving substance.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.500
This is that sounds like an amazing thing.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.500
I would totally smash.

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:57.500
I guess.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.500
Yeah.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:01:59.500
Mother earth.

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.500
Father sky.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.500
Grandmothers and grandfather's.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.500
Yes.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.500
Grandfather.

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:07.500
Great mother.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:08.500
All right.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.500
Let's round it out.

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:10.500
The Joe Bros.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.500
Chastity promise.

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.500
That.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.500
I'll have to pass on.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.500
I'll have to pass on that one.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.500
Because it was a trick.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.500
It was definitely a trick question because it's Chastity.

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.500
I'm going to have to pass on it.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.500
Okay.

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.500
Because I'm.

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:28.500
I'm fulfilling their wishes of Chastity.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.500
Okay.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.500
They also were not chased when they had those.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.500
No, they weren't.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:36.500
Ferris cut this out.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:41.500
Cut out the whole Taylor Swift.

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.500
The whole segment.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:44.500
All right.

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:48.500
The whole segment because it wasn't good because of Johnny.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.500
How I was.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.500
Bringing my regular game.

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:53.500
I'm not going to say my.

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.500
Because it wasn't an A game.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.500
We do have to wrap things up.

01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.500
Blugs.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.500
What do you guys got?

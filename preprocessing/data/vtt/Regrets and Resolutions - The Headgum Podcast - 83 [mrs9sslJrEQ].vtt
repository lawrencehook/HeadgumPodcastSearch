00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:03.000 --> 00:27.000
Music

00:27.000 --> 00:38.440
another end to another monumental yearning another end to beautiful

00:38.440 --> 00:43.960
beginning to have it be this way on a podcast orally lay

00:43.960 --> 00:54.400
Zai December 31 2021 recording this weeks in advance so who knows what will happen

00:54.400 --> 00:57.760
and in our individual lives until the end of the year but for the listeners

00:57.760 --> 01:03.240
years the years over. Please welcome to the show. We've been felled on the

01:03.240 --> 01:08.160
sacks break around in the facts and George Soba bringing up the rear. Let's hear

01:08.160 --> 01:15.440
from you guys. Here what? What do you like about like a roll call. George.

01:15.440 --> 01:26.520
Very bad. George. That's funny but now there's a certain gravity to the

01:26.520 --> 01:32.120
end of the year. You know it's a it's a moment of reflection it's a moment of

01:32.120 --> 01:40.160
projection and it's a moment of resolution and it's a moment of new beginnings.

01:40.160 --> 01:51.160
Earth's Renaissance personal spiritual revelations. The like major killer or

01:51.160 --> 01:56.960
no that's just that's off the dome that's straight from the heart but this is

01:56.960 --> 02:01.320
part two of our sort of holiday special that we're recording on December 14th.

02:01.320 --> 02:07.760
We have a lot to get to but yeah I mean you guys are barely giving me anything

02:07.760 --> 02:15.480
already. I'm trying to stay positive. To be entire time. My my personal job today

02:15.480 --> 02:21.080
is to stay as positive as possible through all of this. The past couple weeks have

02:21.080 --> 02:27.840
seen me being herangued by a mere Billy Brick Johnny et cetera for 15-minute

02:27.840 --> 02:32.360
periods where I don't get a word in edge wise and I'm just kind of truly the

02:32.360 --> 02:38.360
center of a diet tribe. And now I think it's time for me to stay positive.

02:38.360 --> 02:41.760
Well I think the catch train to you find yourself in like two saying oh we're not

02:41.760 --> 02:46.160
giving you anything is like you're being kind of agreeable right now you haven't

02:46.160 --> 02:49.520
said anything incorrect and so much of the construct of this show is you being

02:49.520 --> 02:54.160
wrong and then you being yelled at. Like that's the engine it's either that

02:54.160 --> 02:58.200
where you're playing a power point that we have to comment on even those what

02:58.240 --> 03:08.320
you joke is pre-written. That's true. Your tone is nice but what you're saying isn't

03:08.320 --> 03:13.560
good. So like you're almost like hypnotizing the audience and to think that

03:13.560 --> 03:20.760
you're a good guy. Like you're sing-songing melody but like if people stopped

03:20.760 --> 03:24.560
and read a transcript of what you're saying they'd realize it was nothing. Like a

03:24.560 --> 03:29.720
snake oil salesman. Yes exactly. And you're using like nice music that's

03:29.720 --> 03:34.200
recognizable to make people feel warm and soft on the inside but again if they ever

03:34.200 --> 03:38.320
stopped to like listen to the meaning of what you're saying it realized that you

03:38.320 --> 03:52.220
are a nasty bad man. I get that. It has a spin I'm going to be like no

03:52.260 --> 04:02.900
I'm gonna go right now. No the positive spin I'm going to put on that is that it's still

04:02.900 --> 04:06.380
that's a good note and it's constructive feedback that I'm going to use going into

04:06.380 --> 04:10.260
this new year. This show might look entirely different by this time next year.

04:10.260 --> 04:16.660
Maybe it's all positive maybe it's all constructive maybe it's all border line

04:17.460 --> 04:23.460
performance art. In that it points out both the positive and negative aspects of humanity

04:23.460 --> 04:29.620
itself. So far it's only been negativity because you guys again the note that I always get

04:29.620 --> 04:33.620
is that I'm you know about hosts that the games are hard to play within that they're it's

04:33.620 --> 04:39.940
not really spreading positivity. It's spreading poison in a way. I know that was going

04:39.940 --> 04:46.220
to be the word. And I want it to be less sour starting with this episode. Great. I think

04:46.300 --> 04:56.380
that's admirable. Thank you. I am admirable. Yeah, no I said but yeah I guess what changes

04:57.260 --> 05:03.500
do you feel like need to be made in order to for all of us to spread more positivity on this?

05:05.020 --> 05:11.020
I think it starts in ends with um you were almost saying me which is almost dead.

05:11.100 --> 05:21.580
It's not short at actual introspection. Grace and who? It starts in ends with grace and who

05:21.580 --> 05:30.860
edits these video episodes. No way. Because you can be making I think that there's ways that

05:30.860 --> 05:35.820
you can frame some of the things that happen and make it seem like more of a positive or interaction

05:35.900 --> 05:41.020
because we don't actually all hate each other. You know sometimes there's just we're adding

05:41.020 --> 05:44.380
each other's throats and I think that that could be edited in a way like keeping up with the

05:44.380 --> 05:49.180
Kardashians it's like it's reality TV but it's also like they play it up for the camera and

05:49.180 --> 05:59.580
the editor is sort of the final um you edit the audio. You make starts in ends with the same I guess

05:59.580 --> 06:07.420
but I don't like that responsibility. Yeah that's clear. Yeah. What have you guys

06:08.780 --> 06:11.580
what have you guys learned about yourself this past year I know I asked that I don't think

06:11.580 --> 06:16.940
that's what you said and you did ask that last week and then I said are you sure you have

06:16.940 --> 06:21.500
enough segments because we're recording back to back and you said yeah don't worry about it.

06:21.500 --> 06:27.100
I got this figured out I wrote new segments it won't sound like a retread of the last episode

06:27.980 --> 06:33.980
first segment what have you guys learned in the past year. Instantly right off the bat

06:33.980 --> 06:39.100
same word for word segment that you had that we already answered the question too.

06:39.100 --> 06:44.380
By the way when we could did I answer that question you sort of ignored her you picked up your

06:44.380 --> 06:46.220
phone and then you cut to commercial break.

06:46.620 --> 07:02.300
That's so true. Is that Steve? Okay right but this one is more specific within the context of

07:02.300 --> 07:08.140
this show. So George I think you've been on three times this year or twice. I think this will be my third

07:08.140 --> 07:13.420
time depending if you count the live show. I do. Okay. Maria has been on countless times

07:14.060 --> 07:20.860
I think it could be good to see how this show has affected your guys' lives positively or negatively.

07:20.860 --> 07:25.580
Let's start with George. How is the headgum podcast affected your life?

07:25.580 --> 07:31.100
Yeah so I guess every time I'm on I get a few more like Instagram and Twitter followers.

07:32.860 --> 07:35.900
That's nice. That's yeah. Let's go.

07:37.740 --> 07:42.060
I guess that's sort of the big one.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.940
I get sort of like I get to practice media literacy.

07:47.820 --> 07:52.860
Yeah so like if you were to come out with a project you'd be able to go on a podcast and like you would

07:52.860 --> 07:59.980
be used to it. Oh I guess I was thinking like sometimes being recorded makes me have to sort of look

07:59.980 --> 08:04.940
in the mirror with any sort of cultural reference I make or anything I say. So I have to be a little

08:04.940 --> 08:10.380
bit more like polished or make sure I say things either correctly or importantly at the very least.

08:11.340 --> 08:17.820
Mm-hmm. It's good. It's good to get wraps it. Yeah Maria, how is this show affected you?

08:19.820 --> 08:32.140
In the past year. I a lot. I feel like I had to be on a stage which I don't like to be

08:32.460 --> 08:42.620
um and I feel like uh I think the same thing with George said like having to be aware of what I'm

08:42.620 --> 08:49.980
saying at all times like uh pay more attention to how I speak on a microphone which I'm not used to doing

08:49.980 --> 08:58.060
as men. A good lesson. Um yeah but it's been fun. It's it's been like a good way to

08:58.140 --> 09:02.380
talk doll on my co-workers and people I don't see that often which is always nice.

09:03.820 --> 09:11.100
So I appreciate that part of it. I'm here. Yeah it's been awesome to talk to people that I wouldn't

09:11.100 --> 09:21.980
necessarily get to like Dane, Marika, George, Johnny, Jake to some extent. Um it's awesome to see

09:21.980 --> 09:28.940
like Angie and Sam beyond an episode. All the guests I think have carried um the show the years.

09:30.620 --> 09:35.500
Yeah. It's been cool that we're still you know going strong despite.

09:38.140 --> 09:41.660
The media landscape working against your best effort. Yeah.

09:44.540 --> 09:48.460
Well you know what we I'm we did the audit earlier this year

09:49.260 --> 09:55.500
I thought the show really grew from that um I think we found a groove but I guess

09:56.940 --> 10:02.860
it does feel like it's ending the years ending on a note of the wheels falling off the

10:02.860 --> 10:08.460
wagon right before we get to California. Are you revealing that this is the last episode?

10:09.180 --> 10:12.300
This is the last episode that I accept defeat.

10:12.620 --> 10:23.180
And going for every episode will be the best it's ever been. I think that uh

10:25.820 --> 10:28.620
yeah do you have any like resolutions for the show as a host?

10:29.420 --> 10:33.500
That could be your resolutions if you guys want to hear them for the show. Yeah. Okay yeah.

10:34.540 --> 10:40.380
I want to do more creative things because sometimes the week just creeps up on me and then it's Friday

10:40.940 --> 10:46.140
and then I'm like I have nothing and I I want to do right by the listener more than the

10:46.140 --> 10:54.140
yeah that shows that tracks. Yeah um yeah and I have an idea for a mini series that I want to do

10:54.940 --> 11:01.100
four episodes of and it's it's more I'm not I don't want to give anything away. I want to just

11:01.100 --> 11:08.700
be a surprise drop. Great. Yeah so I want to plan that for probably April because

11:11.340 --> 11:18.300
so far. Well the mini series that'll take you three months to plan it. The idea that I have

11:18.300 --> 11:21.740
is very high production value and also I can't do it unless I'm in LA.

11:23.740 --> 11:30.620
So maybe March but probably April. George do you know when Jeff's coming back he's your roommate

11:30.620 --> 11:36.140
so I assume he's kept you in the loop? Well so it's funny you said yes I know he's coming back

11:36.140 --> 11:43.180
and a February but there are things that he has not kept us in the loop about where we did have

11:44.140 --> 11:49.180
he did subletters room which is fine because like it's not very invasive based on the landscape

11:49.180 --> 11:56.540
of our house but he's like hey I've got a friend says their name it's a name I've never heard him say

11:56.540 --> 12:02.380
before and he's like they're staying from 12th three to 12th nine and I'm like Jeffrey today is 12th

12:03.260 --> 12:12.460
yeah so six days of a stranger in your house to you. Right and then on 12th nine Jeffrey was

12:12.460 --> 12:18.460
like hey the guest is leaving today you should have sex in my bedroom this was something

12:18.460 --> 12:26.060
Jeffrey actively encouraged me to try to do I said no thank you and then the guest ended up staying

12:26.060 --> 12:32.220
three more days so in spite of God you didn't take up up on the offer I know you wanted to

12:32.860 --> 12:37.740
he's so enticing offer yeah so then the friend stayed another three days but this is not the

12:37.740 --> 12:42.860
friend that's doing the housing swap that's living with you now for three months no this was a full

12:42.860 --> 12:55.980
extra person yeah she was a friend of a friend yeah that's not true and she didn't tell

12:55.980 --> 13:01.900
me she was staying in extra three days you ever see her George I know she's like in a downstairs room

13:01.900 --> 13:09.900
with a separate entrance I never met her and I would only hear like the sounds of like the

13:09.900 --> 13:17.580
gate opening and like walking around like I knew she was around but also we we live in an area with

13:17.580 --> 13:22.700
a lot of critters those are because we've got like we've like a skunk and a possum and the cats

13:22.780 --> 13:28.300
straight cats yeah there was a family of like raccoons but then they were like killed by a

13:28.300 --> 13:33.980
bigger raccoon she slaughtered with their intestines all over our front deck yeah yeah all the

13:33.980 --> 13:40.940
roommate had their call LA sanitation to remove like the raccoon carcasses cheese yeah yeah it was pretty

13:40.940 --> 13:48.060
gruesome too like to come home and just see that and I didn't even know that there were raccoons

13:48.140 --> 13:54.140
living under that table until what they were dead in front of us yeah to Jeffery's point earlier

13:54.140 --> 13:59.820
about how like uh the end of the year is really introspective it sort of makes you look in the mirror

13:59.820 --> 14:05.420
about your own mortality now everything we have is sort of fragile and yeah we will be that raccoon

14:05.420 --> 14:13.180
yeah exactly and does Jeff get paid for the sublet like how does that work if is there a

14:13.180 --> 14:17.420
chance he's being in a profit off of these strangers staying with him because like it's a

14:17.420 --> 14:23.740
little unclear about how it works into the greater rent situation the monetary stuff is sort of

14:23.740 --> 14:28.860
a great area especially when it comes down to utilities but we actually be looking at down face

14:28.860 --> 14:34.780
to face because of how in the day on uninvasive it is yeah like overall it's fine but like it

14:34.780 --> 14:39.020
might get to the point where it might be a little weird because like what if Jeff ends up making

14:39.100 --> 14:42.940
a lot of money does that go into like the overall rent does that like because you're the one who's

14:42.940 --> 14:50.540
sort of sacrificing your privacy yeah yeah like I definitely incur the burden but then it's one of

14:50.540 --> 14:55.420
those things where you have conflicts with your roommate and you're like oh like which ones do you

14:55.420 --> 15:01.900
like make it any louder okay make it louder to drown up the standard all right it's sort of

15:01.900 --> 15:07.100
we and it's not like your conversation that he ever had before like he's sort of through the room

15:07.100 --> 15:12.380
it in and he figured you guys will be polite enough not to make a big stink out of it exactly and

15:12.380 --> 15:17.100
it's like tested us and we did ultimately lose that battle and I unfortunately believe we've set

15:17.100 --> 15:25.740
a precedent for him to do it now he considers you guys pushovers and he can sort of do this

15:25.740 --> 15:37.020
swap whenever he wants to willard-nilard Fred willard-nilard if you got if you got she gave me $200

15:37.020 --> 15:46.620
if you ingest and want the two of us here we go she gave me $200 the truth comes for him

15:46.620 --> 15:52.700
is a normal sublet and they were just giving me whatever I asked for like everybody they were

15:52.700 --> 16:00.140
paying my rent or not would you guys like would you take a cut well it's here but yeah the fact that

16:00.140 --> 16:07.580
it's a housing swap other than her it's clean there's no money exchanged so uh but if I was

16:07.580 --> 16:11.580
in a straight sublet I probably would have charged extra and then given you guys the extra money

16:12.220 --> 16:17.980
for the yeah I think well if we're talking the like the the swap part of it uh no I think it's

16:17.980 --> 16:24.940
if anything it would be like imposed how invasive they are like how in not in the next month we will

16:25.020 --> 16:31.340
have two different swap people yeah and then the final month it is another complete stranger we know

16:31.340 --> 16:37.260
the middle month person but the stranger if they're like an agent of chaos or what have you then I give

16:37.260 --> 16:42.300
you a kickback yeah yeah yeah which would be my own personal money because no one's paying me

16:43.420 --> 16:47.660
what if I think you could retroactively ask for it if we gave enough complaints right

16:48.700 --> 16:54.780
or you go to the paper on it no of course what if she tries to invoke squatters rights

16:54.860 --> 17:00.140
are you concerned about that uh I don't know I think I'm good at dulling out threats like I could

17:00.140 --> 17:05.260
I like to insinuate that I have like friends and high places that can do horrible things digitally

17:08.700 --> 17:13.740
you know what like what like it's somewhat due digitally to this person I can't anonymous believe

17:14.540 --> 17:20.460
well first of all I have a spokio premium account so I can find some information on her and then

17:20.460 --> 17:26.620
insinuate that I have more when that's actually all I have so like I find out her previous address

17:26.620 --> 17:31.340
and I say I'm like hey you can't invoke squatters rights this is my house you have to go she's like

17:31.340 --> 17:36.940
I'm invoking them and then I'm like okay well then maybe I'll go do that at you know XYZ South

17:36.940 --> 17:41.180
Metropolitan Avenue and then she's like how did you know my old address and I'm like I know a lot of

17:41.180 --> 17:46.620
things about you and I can use those things against you because I have a friend not only in the

17:46.620 --> 17:57.580
LA DA's office but also in the CI fucking hay let's a spokio premium account that's just like

17:57.580 --> 18:05.740
you can look up people's information CI by the way I'm at the culinary institute what did initially

18:05.740 --> 18:12.780
drew you to get a spokio premium to figure out where celebrities lived so I call them where I

18:12.780 --> 18:19.740
thought it was very obvious to me I was hoping there'd be like a darker reason not that that's

18:19.740 --> 18:23.740
particularly jovial

kid thank you to diet smoke for sponsoring this episode of our show guys sometimes cannabis

20:06.060 --> 20:12.220
edibles get you way too high right can be difficult to control the dose it outright you just sit

20:12.220 --> 20:17.500
there suffering stone out of your mind but that's why when you need the perfect medium high I

20:17.500 --> 20:22.940
had up my friends at diet smoke for their delicious delta eight THC gummies diet smoke isn't

20:22.940 --> 20:29.900
light it's just right now what is delta eight delta eight is simply a less potent THC the THC

20:29.900 --> 20:33.900
that you're probably most familiar with is delta nine and while both are natural to the cannabis

20:33.900 --> 20:39.980
plant diet smoke extracts their delta age from hemp some may call this a loophole I call it the secret

20:39.980 --> 20:45.740
recipe to getting a smooth stable and most importantly legal high diet smoke is legal in most

20:45.740 --> 20:50.300
states and it's non-prescription just check diet smoke's website to see if they ship their delicious

20:50.300 --> 20:56.140
gummies to your state now you're probably asking yourself does diet smoke really get you high of course

20:56.780 --> 21:01.420
the how you get with diet smoke is best described as somewhere between the chillness of CBD and that

21:01.420 --> 21:07.020
classic stone feeling with regular weed plus diet smoke comes in two delicious flavors blue raspberry

21:07.020 --> 21:13.420
and watermelon I love anything flavored blue raspberry but marica likes watermelon I say try

21:14.300 --> 21:20.460
so when CBD isn't enough and traditional THC is too much enjoy the smooth buzz of diet smoke each

21:20.460 --> 21:26.780
gummy is infused with 10 milligrams of delta eight THC derived from american grown hemp delta eight

21:26.780 --> 21:32.220

22:03.500 --> 22:10.060
reflection and I'd like to talk about some of our biggest regrets from the year let's start with

22:10.060 --> 22:22.620
the mirror because you probably have the most regret I feel like I should have there's a lot

22:22.620 --> 22:27.260
of stuff building on the outside of my house that I'm like oh I can use this pandemic to organize

22:27.260 --> 22:34.060
or fix like my front gate is kind of fucked up and I keep sort of pushing it off and pushing it off

22:34.060 --> 22:39.660
to be like make a home renovation weak happen and it should probably have already happened because

22:39.660 --> 22:45.740
I've had what at this point 19 months of just being at home doing nothing but at a certain point

22:45.740 --> 22:49.660
you just get used to how it is and you're like what's the point like there's no need to actually

22:49.660 --> 22:55.500
pay money to fix this thing I'll just ignore the problem until that becomes status quo and then

22:55.500 --> 23:01.820
I'm suddenly not even thinking about it at all but yeah there's probably a bunch of spring cleaning

23:01.820 --> 23:07.820
slash home Renault stuff that I should have taken care of in the last two years at this point

23:08.780 --> 23:24.860
what are some of your biggest regrets for you most recently I regret not signing up for

23:24.860 --> 23:31.980
to get master fan verification for the Olivier Rodrigo sour tour that's what we should call this

23:31.980 --> 23:39.820
tour if we do it next year the sour tour yeah we can do it we'll do a poster that looks like

23:39.820 --> 23:45.980
the sour album coverage just you with stickers all over yeah or like a play on the band poison

23:46.620 --> 23:57.020
by poison tour yeah those stickers are like thousand dollars and I would just stupid

23:59.580 --> 24:10.620
I don't know I mean I regret I regret sitting on my couch so much that my back got bad

24:11.580 --> 24:18.380
I feel like that's a god 2020 I feel like I'm the only thing I could have been

24:24.620 --> 24:31.100
I don't know it's kind of it Burton Oh, why is there no it's been a decent year otherwise

24:31.180 --> 24:42.060
George biggest regret from the year I regret buying dodge coin and safe moon

24:44.300 --> 24:51.980
safe moon Mike swing back at one point I had $6,000 in safe moon and now that same amount is worth

24:51.980 --> 25:03.900
800 so you yeah not until I sell also that's still a profit because I didn't put like 500 in

25:05.020 --> 25:11.100
I think I put 100 in I meant I haven't checked in a minute but I believe I put 100 in

25:11.900 --> 25:23.100
and it turned to 40 oh it's sorry it's 30 98 now who told you to buy was that a Jeff thing

25:23.100 --> 25:27.100
is a Jeff thing yeah but I wasn't trying to make it about him because of his whole thing

25:27.100 --> 25:32.060
about positivity but yeah Jeffrey told me to buy both dodge coin and safe moon and I've been

25:32.060 --> 25:38.460
pretty positive this 20 minutes yeah no you you absolutely have you I thought you were projecting

25:38.460 --> 25:44.460
about the rest of us you've never not been positive about yourself

25:48.700 --> 26:03.100
dodge pro I'm pro I see's it's happening I'm thinking too hard

26:03.820 --> 26:10.780
yeah that's fair how's your dodge coin did you sell you're proud was you waited way too late

26:12.460 --> 26:19.340
yeah because I was hesitant and then you were like oh it's gonna spike it's gonna hit a dollar

26:19.340 --> 26:26.860
on either a for 20 or b when Elon Musk hosts us an out it did hit 70 cents on on the

26:26.860 --> 26:31.500
SNL and I should have sold right then because I would have made way more money so I sold it like

26:31.500 --> 26:37.740
40 cents I think I broke even or I got I made like 12 dollars and had a little bit of fun

26:39.020 --> 26:42.220
yeah I mean I rode the wave and I learned about the stock market

26:43.500 --> 26:47.820
stock market through buying and selling does shit coin

26:49.180 --> 26:53.500
well you do kind of learn about it like someone who didn't really know anything about that like

26:53.580 --> 26:59.900
about how like it is it in like a vacuum of like how rapidly things fluctuate yeah now I'm

26:59.900 --> 27:04.540
all in on a theory and but I don't I'd obviously don't own a full one I own a fraction of one

27:04.540 --> 27:13.420
and it's just kind of slowly climbing I bought it I bought a game stop stock but too late so I have

27:13.420 --> 27:21.820
lost money yeah obviously yeah did you use Robinhood no fan guard this is how we're ending the year

27:22.780 --> 27:27.900
I'm just interested joining on with that investment in the way you say things

27:27.900 --> 27:34.460
or your biggest threats Jeffrey I really didn't have any this year I did I went for it this year

27:34.460 --> 27:42.220
in every regard yeah I guess so you moved to New York temporarily it's a big change do you

27:42.220 --> 27:50.620
regret getting COVID you got my one regret is going to the cheesecake factory August one sort of

27:51.900 --> 27:58.700
cases were off the hook it wasn't surging at that time I was like part of the beginning of that

27:58.700 --> 28:03.980
small wave but I don't know I'm kind of bulletproof now because I'm triple-vaxed I have the natural

28:03.980 --> 28:14.860
antibodies for a couple more weeks probably I'm golden grams I'm golden grams I'm golden globes

28:21.900 --> 28:40.860
Resolutions did you feel that the pause was uncomfortable but then I resolved it with a

28:40.860 --> 28:46.620
resolution do you ever play music for that long on this podcast if it weren't like royalty free

28:46.620 --> 28:54.460
or public domain like you ever try to push those limits oh you mean like this we might get away

28:54.460 --> 28:58.940
with that this time we might if not all edited out and re-upload here's the way we need to talk about

28:58.940 --> 29:05.260
that's everybody everybody was getting to and every time he is to say we have to hear the black

29:05.260 --> 29:12.220
I'd piece over add money on YouTube you guys have a thing about the black I'd piece our hip hop

29:12.220 --> 29:18.940
like I'm like their their own genre yeah I kind of like imagine drag it's like it's own genre

29:20.700 --> 29:28.300
it's hip hop which sounds like hip hop but it's actually hip hop yeah the suck resolutions

29:28.300 --> 29:34.140
what do you guys want to change about yourselves in the next year I want to take a vacation

29:35.260 --> 29:41.980
sounds good thank you that's a good goal yeah I feel like I want to go more at it

29:42.460 --> 29:49.500
in U.S. or at a broad I'm I'm trying to go to France South of France for Le Mans

29:51.020 --> 29:56.300
as I've recently mentioned so that's that's what I'm currently planning in June also

29:56.300 --> 30:04.300
many people with friends with one friend that also wants to go to this race so we're just going

30:04.300 --> 30:13.660
to camp in France for five days Blamp actually after reserve or 10 what's the time of year

30:13.660 --> 30:18.860
or that be June summer oh that's good yeah we're part of France

30:20.220 --> 30:28.700
definitely going to go to Paris but then the race itself is in Le Mans so Jeff was wrong he's answered

30:28.700 --> 30:35.260
caught it was really quick but I wanted to point that that Jeff said knees yeah yeah I just don't

30:35.260 --> 30:39.340
want anybody to be like oh Jeff was right because he said something confidently I couldn't

30:39.340 --> 30:44.140
quite make out what it was yeah that's not the case let's do this because you guys aren't oh sorry

30:45.980 --> 30:50.060
yeah because she was answering your question yeah it was and

30:51.260 --> 30:57.820
no yeah I think it would be fun I'm scared of traveling outside the country I don't do it that often

30:57.980 --> 31:04.540
the only time I've been outside the country it was too England so it would be fun to go somewhere else

31:05.340 --> 31:11.740
re-learning French is like are you scared of at literally traveling like coming on a flight or you

31:11.740 --> 31:17.260
just afraid of the experience of being in a foreign land where people don't speak English every thing

31:19.260 --> 31:24.300
I mean I feel like it the jet of an all plus foreign land plus flying

31:25.260 --> 31:31.900
literally just the same the same soil it's the same earth's crust what do you say I cannot hear so

31:33.180 --> 31:37.260
bad

31:40.860 --> 31:51.820
you're not good you're like yeah you're a disease that one is tough to spin positive

31:54.460 --> 31:59.340
unequivocally I'm bad yeah good feet back

32:03.260 --> 32:08.700
let's get the fucking energy that was great resolution that's your resolution that's great let me do this let's

32:08.700 --> 32:14.940
do resolution or nah let's go out with a bang and it's way too similar to everything we've done this year

32:14.940 --> 32:23.340
it's because I did not time hmm focus on a passion not the way you look resolution or

32:23.340 --> 32:29.980
nah yeah that's a resolution no I think do you guys want to bring that into the fold of your

32:29.980 --> 32:36.700
resolutions oh I want to take a furniture making I want to take a furniture making class

32:37.740 --> 32:44.460
yeah I'd like to get back into hobbies that I used to do I want to do ceramics again

32:44.460 --> 32:49.740
offline hobbies specifically it's good to give your brain and eyes a break feel like we're looking at

32:49.740 --> 32:54.780
screens all the time yeah do you guys look at your phone while watching TV it's like yeah

32:54.780 --> 32:59.340
what's your what's your screen time on your oh my god hours and hours I don't even

32:59.980 --> 33:04.620
I'm afraid to even look I watch like full sporting events on there it's it's not a good thing

33:06.140 --> 33:12.780
I'm average I'm basically attached yeah I'm average like eight hours a day of on my phone

33:12.860 --> 33:20.540
all right it's like more looking at your phone than not yeah it's bad let me check mine

33:20.540 --> 33:25.180
like I'm already watching a sporting event and I'm checking other sporting events on my phone

33:25.180 --> 33:28.700
I'm just like constantly doing two things that aren't good for me at the same time

33:30.380 --> 33:34.140
my daily average at least for this week is four hours and eight minutes

33:34.780 --> 33:39.180
yeah like imagine getting that down to one hour which would have been a lot like ten years ago

33:39.740 --> 33:45.340
like feels unattainably low my daily average for this week I sorry I changed it from day to week

33:45.340 --> 33:52.460
uh 10 hours and six minutes I don't know if I've hit double digits yet but I mean like

33:52.460 --> 34:01.980
we just constantly on like yeah yeah but I like do things I like go to movies and put my phone away

34:01.980 --> 34:08.460
like go to the theater but it's the only that's the only time where I have my phone not in my hand

34:09.180 --> 34:14.460
yeah it's an hour and a half oh my god wow that's part of why I'm really bad at texting

34:14.460 --> 34:21.820
people back yeah my messages are most used seven hours 40 minutes if you're in like group chats

34:21.820 --> 34:26.620
it's just like a rope like a constant rolling room and if you're in like five of them you wake

34:26.620 --> 34:32.220
up and there's like 190 messages yeah workout to feel good not to be thin

34:32.780 --> 34:40.860
um resolution yeah I'm going to go no all right why you want to be thinner

34:43.980 --> 34:50.300
you made it up and you're saying it's not um no I want to be I want to be a wace

34:51.580 --> 34:57.180
a wake wow a wace jiffy says a wake weird

34:57.340 --> 35:07.980
what time did you wave up today um wave up this one I know Georgia's answer but stop gossiping

35:09.260 --> 35:13.740
now I want to gossip all the time I think it's awesome this is important yeah gossip is real

35:13.740 --> 35:26.940
coolism and journalism's necessary in a way I'm speaking truth to power when I say my neighbor

35:27.020 --> 35:33.980
was caught jerking off on his balcony last night. Georgia's direct neighbor

35:35.020 --> 35:41.660
has a balcony but it's a cat balcony. I'm like truly you're never going to be able to see it

35:41.660 --> 35:45.900
never mind that was so ambitious for me to try it. No no try you got to show it all right

35:45.900 --> 35:51.340
remember this is being recorded so don't show anything you don't want me like fully hold up a camera

35:51.340 --> 36:02.860
to their house yeah yeah the patio yeah a cat patio yeah go a whole day without checking your email

36:05.020 --> 36:13.260
I'm gonna not it's like it's impossible yeah I mean maybe it's like a Sunday during holidays and

36:13.900 --> 36:18.780
there's nothing super pressing you could probably pull that off. No let's do Monday morning

36:21.820 --> 36:29.660
yeah no. Oh I want all I want is like I phones to have a setting where

36:30.380 --> 36:35.580
for a certain period of time during a day you don't see notifications for a specific app and they're

36:35.580 --> 36:41.020
like so close to having that because I want that for my email I want to like turn my email

36:41.020 --> 36:49.420
only off for like end of day stuff but I can't and therefore I look at it every 20 minutes. Nice

36:52.300 --> 37:00.140
just speak in my true. Do you want answers to this question that you set us up for

37:00.140 --> 37:05.180
because it looks like you're bored every time we actually trend towards giving you what you want.

37:05.180 --> 37:10.220
I mean it's supposed to be a vehicle for like jokes and you guys aren't like you're just answering

37:10.220 --> 37:17.020
them straight. Yeah that's sort of what I remarked on at the very beginning was you wanted positivity

37:17.820 --> 37:23.260
where is like I don't know you want this show to us be berating you and commenting on that

37:23.260 --> 37:30.300
what's bad. Right you can't have it both ways. What about keep a journal?

37:32.540 --> 37:39.020
Can we do that in the new year? Yeah you can it's probably a pretty good idea. Yeah resolution or

37:39.020 --> 37:45.100
not resolution can we play one of the games where you've been by us real money. George you still

37:45.100 --> 38:00.060
only $400 or $200. But that's the gamble that I take isn't it. No I've stopped doing that because

38:00.060 --> 38:06.620
I can't I can't I don't want to get taxed on it and be sometimes people don't send them

38:06.620 --> 38:12.300
money back and I can't do that. Maybe it'll be a special occasion thing. What about sanitize your

38:12.460 --> 38:16.860
personal belongings? Is the New Year's episode not a special occasion?

38:19.900 --> 38:25.740
It could have been if I'd prepared more. And I want to be clear that I texted Jeff a week ago

38:25.740 --> 38:31.180
about batch recording these and was like should we do a holiday special and he was like yeah I

38:31.180 --> 38:34.860
want to do that. Yeah and this is what it is.

38:35.420 --> 38:45.820
Jeff, you have to be on this truly five minutes before recording the game. And that's often

38:45.820 --> 38:52.220
how it goes for most people I think. It's gonna it's gonna be better. That's a resolution for the

38:52.220 --> 38:59.660
New Year a recording schedule. We have a recording schedule and it is like Fridays at four

38:59.660 --> 39:03.740
Eastern one campus of it. They're just like you know having people sign up again.

39:04.940 --> 39:11.980
Yeah it's just this this shows crazy because it's like it's the staff of the network they have

39:11.980 --> 39:18.620
real jobs and so getting people can sometimes be tough and people will sign up and then I'll

39:18.620 --> 39:23.660
follow up on the day or the day before and they're like oh actually I can't do it and then I have

39:23.660 --> 39:28.220
to still get someone last minute. So the calendar thing didn't super work that well anyways but

39:28.220 --> 39:41.260
we can try doing it again. What is this? You guys are stone faced and stone walling me.

39:42.140 --> 39:47.740
Don't face as you talk about the calendar scheduling for this recording.

39:48.380 --> 39:53.900
Obviously that's a very dry one I was just talking about that I the fact that I've chronic pain

39:53.980 --> 40:00.140
and to you are mad about this specifically. What about removing negativity from your life or

40:00.140 --> 40:07.500
anything that makes you feel kind of lousy? No impossible next. What about the traveling somewhere

40:07.500 --> 40:17.180
without a plan? No. All right. What about paying off your credit card every month and then if you

40:17.180 --> 40:22.140
want to put something on it that you know you can't afford don't. I do that already.

40:23.100 --> 40:32.220
Uh what about doing something that scares you once a month? Why? What about going to bed happy every day?

40:32.940 --> 40:38.780
Sure that's nice but like what are you doing to what steps can you take to make that last?

40:38.780 --> 40:55.020
My smile. So regardless of how much of joy 2021. I'm like three times an hour.

40:58.220 --> 41:07.100
What about changing your name to Yates? What about that man? What about it? What about diving first into

41:07.100 --> 41:12.300
something that you don't know if it's going to work out? Diving first or diving head first.

41:13.820 --> 41:21.820
What about fucking junk looking before you leap? That's the same. The opposite of the

41:21.820 --> 41:28.620
thing you said. They're nearly negating one of them. So you should say yes to that one I guess I was

41:28.620 --> 41:34.300
just trying to get a yes out of some of you. We gave you yeses before and then you said this isn't fun.

41:37.100 --> 41:43.820
You don't hear the game midway. I don't like that actual resolution. I feel bad. It's hard to

41:43.820 --> 41:50.140
keep the positivity up. It's not about positivity. It's not about positivity. Okay. What about staying

41:50.140 --> 41:58.380
positive? You said you definitely said I'm okay. What are you telling me? I'm telling you

41:58.380 --> 42:04.140
towards the finish line of this year. This is the episode that deserves to happen at the end of

42:04.140 --> 42:08.060
it all. George, what about your pop-ups? Is there anything you want to do with those?

42:09.180 --> 42:13.340
Yeah, I'd like them to be more regular. I want some kind of pop-ups are you doing?

42:13.340 --> 42:18.300
The restaurant pop-up that I do with our friends Sarah, it's called Virginia Moss.

42:19.580 --> 42:24.540
We also do private events. What do you make of what's where are these places?

42:25.820 --> 42:34.060
We have different venues around but we are in talks with a brewery space to just set up there

42:34.060 --> 42:37.740
and pop up pretty regularly. We do up to go Southern. Which one? Mumford?

42:38.540 --> 42:42.700
Yeah. Mumford's kind of fire. What kind of Southern food?

42:44.780 --> 42:54.300
So like, it's you fay or like, we do like oysters or like, we'll do like fragmented tomatoes

42:54.300 --> 43:00.140
like that kind of stuff but sort of dressed up. Yes.

43:00.700 --> 43:05.660
Well, you, Jeff, you look like you were laughing at something earlier. I wasn't.

43:06.220 --> 43:14.620
I was just scratching my chin. I actually, my, in a very sincere plug, my dad was on the

43:14.620 --> 43:25.500

43:25.500 --> 43:32.140

And so they're talking about that process and then my dad was on like cooking hop and John and

43:40.140 --> 43:47.660

43:47.660 --> 43:55.900

43:55.900 --> 44:04.700
200. That's my cousin. This is like five minutes long. So we don't have to watch it. You can

44:04.780 --> 44:10.780

You appreciate anybody that's going to be the worst out of every.

What if this was like my M.A. Ultra like sleeper thing? Like I have to listen to all these and then I become

45:32.300 --> 45:48.220

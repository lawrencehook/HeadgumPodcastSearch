00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head gum original.

00:02.000 --> 00:31.980
Let's start with the energy really fucking out.

00:31.980 --> 00:35.980
Let's keep that going for the whole episode.

00:35.980 --> 00:38.980
Let's do it. Really?

00:38.980 --> 00:42.980
This is going to be the hangariest episode of the head gum podcast in history.

00:42.980 --> 00:44.980
We all have not eaten today, is that fair to say?

00:44.980 --> 00:47.980
I forgot to complete the group order.

00:47.980 --> 00:49.980
The lead.

00:49.980 --> 00:52.980
We're like, where are the salads?

00:52.980 --> 00:55.980
That's what we have that be of snacks in the room.

00:55.980 --> 00:58.980
We're getting a peek into the New York office.

00:58.980 --> 01:03.980
The trials, tribulations, miss happenings, etc.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.980
Does this happen often? Is that fair to say?

01:06.980 --> 01:09.980
No, because I'm not put in charge of the laundry.

01:09.980 --> 01:11.980
Normally does it.

01:11.980 --> 01:13.980
Tell me it's not a risk.

01:13.980 --> 01:14.980
It's usually Marie.

01:14.980 --> 01:15.980
It's not.

01:15.980 --> 01:16.980
Yeah, it's usually me.

01:16.980 --> 01:18.980
You've been doing it right recently.

01:18.980 --> 01:20.980
Honestly, it's pretty political.

01:20.980 --> 01:23.980
Let's move away from the topic.

01:23.980 --> 01:27.980
No, it's actually that time to dive in when it's political.

01:27.980 --> 01:29.980
But what's the gossip?

01:29.980 --> 01:32.980
Who gets mad at whom's when Marie replaces the order?

01:32.980 --> 01:35.980
What are her normal follies and faults?

01:35.980 --> 01:36.980
I don't do anything wrong.

01:36.980 --> 01:37.980
Placing the order.

01:37.980 --> 01:38.980
It's just really political.

01:38.980 --> 01:40.980
The chosen restaurant.

01:40.980 --> 01:41.980
Okay.

01:41.980 --> 01:43.980
And what do you guys normally want, dig?

01:43.980 --> 01:44.980
No.

01:44.980 --> 01:45.980
No, they don't.

01:45.980 --> 01:47.980
I would eat dig all the time.

01:47.980 --> 01:48.980
To comb.

01:48.980 --> 01:49.980
To comb.

01:49.980 --> 01:50.980
To comb.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.980
No, we haven't ordered to comb.

01:52.980 --> 01:53.980
Ever.

01:53.980 --> 01:54.980
That could be fun.

01:54.980 --> 01:55.980
Not to the office.

01:56.980 --> 01:58.980
I used to do that on Williamsburg.

01:58.980 --> 01:59.980
I got the Williamsburg office.

01:59.980 --> 02:00.980
I used to get that.

02:00.980 --> 02:02.980
Well, there is one near Union Square.

02:02.980 --> 02:03.980
We should say.

02:03.980 --> 02:04.980
Yeah.

02:04.980 --> 02:05.980
It's near the Grammar Sea.

02:05.980 --> 02:06.980
I think.

02:06.980 --> 02:08.980
Because I got to comb be right before our show there two years ago.

02:08.980 --> 02:10.980
Which I want to emphasize two years ago.

02:10.980 --> 02:12.980
Why didn't we do a show last year?

02:12.980 --> 02:14.980
Why had it when we done this one this year?

02:14.980 --> 02:16.980
Let me take that again.

02:16.980 --> 02:18.980
Why didn't we do one last?

02:18.980 --> 02:21.980
Why didn't we do one this year?

02:21.980 --> 02:23.980
This is a question for Joel for some reason.

02:23.980 --> 02:24.980
We're working on it.

02:25.980 --> 02:26.980
Are we?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.980
Joel's running code on it.

02:28.980 --> 02:29.980
Yes.

02:29.980 --> 02:30.980
No way.

02:30.980 --> 02:32.980
It's going to be an AI event.

02:32.980 --> 02:33.980
Yeah.

02:33.980 --> 02:35.980
You don't actually even need to fly here.

02:35.980 --> 02:36.980
Yeah.

02:36.980 --> 02:40.980
A virtual clone of really every podcast host not just you.

02:40.980 --> 02:42.980
In perpetuity or.

02:42.980 --> 02:43.980
Uh.

02:43.980 --> 02:44.980
Yeah.

02:44.980 --> 02:46.980
Will I still get paid.

02:46.980 --> 02:48.980
Royalties.

02:48.980 --> 02:50.980
Or they can.

02:50.980 --> 02:51.980
Penny's on the dollar.

02:51.980 --> 02:53.980
That's fine.

02:53.980 --> 02:56.980
At least they wouldn't have to show up for anything.

02:56.980 --> 02:57.980
Um.

02:57.980 --> 02:59.980
No, that weekend where we did the live show.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.980
Emma and Joel, were you guys working here yet?

03:01.980 --> 03:02.980
No.

03:02.980 --> 03:04.980
It was such a good time.

03:04.980 --> 03:06.980
It was like the best weekend of my life.

03:06.980 --> 03:10.980
I think Marieka had a bad time because we did it on her birthday.

03:10.980 --> 03:12.980
Yeah, it was on my birthday.

03:12.980 --> 03:13.980
Um.

03:13.980 --> 03:14.980
So that was rough.

03:14.980 --> 03:15.980
Yeah.

03:15.980 --> 03:16.980
Didn't.

03:16.980 --> 03:17.980
Didn't make the choice of.

03:17.980 --> 03:20.980
I didn't get to make the choice of the week of the show that I was.

03:20.980 --> 03:21.980
Planning.

03:21.980 --> 03:22.980
Did you feel celebrated?

03:23.980 --> 03:24.980
Um.

03:24.980 --> 03:25.980
I'm away.

03:25.980 --> 03:26.980
People.

03:26.980 --> 03:27.980
People.

03:27.980 --> 03:30.980
The cookies that were brought for me.

03:30.980 --> 03:32.980
We're brought by for you.

03:32.980 --> 03:33.980
I brought those for you.

03:33.980 --> 03:34.980
Yeah.

03:34.980 --> 03:36.980
I said a lot of people ate them.

03:36.980 --> 03:37.980
And you wanted.

03:37.980 --> 03:38.980
Oh, you wanted the whole box.

03:38.980 --> 03:39.980
Is that what you're saying?

03:39.980 --> 03:40.980
I want the whole box.

03:40.980 --> 03:41.980
But I like didn't really get a chance.

03:41.980 --> 03:42.980
Eat them.

03:42.980 --> 03:43.980
You didn't even have one.

03:43.980 --> 03:44.980
I had one.

03:44.980 --> 03:46.980
But it was like a box of 12 cookies.

03:46.980 --> 03:48.980
But how many cookies did you really want?

03:48.980 --> 03:50.980
We're starting to understand how

03:50.980 --> 03:52.980
you can get around her birthday.

03:52.980 --> 03:53.980
Her anniversary.

03:53.980 --> 03:54.980
Yeah.

03:54.980 --> 03:55.980
Your Divo.

03:55.980 --> 04:01.980
I just felt like I should have been able to at least have like two.

04:01.980 --> 04:02.980
Two.

04:02.980 --> 04:03.980
That's what I was going to say.

04:03.980 --> 04:05.980
A sample science, especially because these were from.

04:05.980 --> 04:06.980
Um.

04:06.980 --> 04:07.980
Let me.

04:07.980 --> 04:08.980
I'm going to look it up on Google Maps.

04:08.980 --> 04:09.980
I forget where they were from.

04:09.980 --> 04:10.980
The place was bizarre.

04:10.980 --> 04:11.980
Played these air.

04:11.980 --> 04:12.980
Um.

04:12.980 --> 04:14.980
Was it the the one in Williamsburg?

04:14.980 --> 04:15.980
Yeah.

04:15.980 --> 04:17.980
But I feel like there's a couple in Williamsburg.

04:17.980 --> 04:19.980
It was the one on wife.

04:19.980 --> 04:20.980
I think.

04:20.980 --> 04:22.980
I know where you're talking about.

04:22.980 --> 04:23.980
I just don't remember the name.

04:23.980 --> 04:25.980
It's next to Brooklyn.

04:25.980 --> 04:27.980
By the way, it matters.

04:27.980 --> 04:28.980
Chip.

04:28.980 --> 04:29.980
Chip.

04:29.980 --> 04:30.980
It matters.

04:30.980 --> 04:31.980
Chip City.

04:31.980 --> 04:32.980
Yeah.

04:32.980 --> 04:33.980
And I also love Chip City.

04:33.980 --> 04:35.980
But this year, it's got to be crumble.

04:35.980 --> 04:36.980
Crumbles.

04:36.980 --> 04:38.980
Do you guys listen to blonde shell?

04:38.980 --> 04:39.980
No.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.980
Never heard about for it.

04:41.980 --> 04:43.980
Uh, she's an old buddy of mine from college.

04:43.980 --> 04:45.980
And she has the song called Kiss City.

04:45.980 --> 04:46.980
Yeah.

04:46.980 --> 04:47.980
Okay.

04:48.980 --> 04:49.980
Okay.

04:49.980 --> 04:54.980
That wasn't a commensurate reaction.

04:54.980 --> 04:57.980
That wasn't fair to me.

04:57.980 --> 04:59.980
Um.

04:59.980 --> 05:00.980
America.

05:00.980 --> 05:01.980
We are looking.

05:01.980 --> 05:04.980
We should say at the weekend of October.

05:04.980 --> 05:05.980
It's not even a weekend.

05:05.980 --> 05:08.980
But we are looking to do a show on Monday, October 16th.

05:08.980 --> 05:09.980
Um.

05:09.980 --> 05:10.980
So the day after.

05:10.980 --> 05:11.980
Martin.

05:11.980 --> 05:12.980
Martin.

05:12.980 --> 05:13.980
Oh.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.980
Today's afternoon.

05:15.980 --> 05:16.980
Wait.

05:16.980 --> 05:17.980
I haven't even realized that Martin.

05:17.980 --> 05:19.980
Amir's wedding is on Marty's birthday.

05:19.980 --> 05:22.980
I thought Marty's birthday was the 14th.

05:22.980 --> 05:23.980
Really.

05:23.980 --> 05:27.980
I might have been wishing him well.

05:27.980 --> 05:28.980
Wrong.

05:28.980 --> 05:29.980
The day late.

05:29.980 --> 05:30.980
Yeah.

05:30.980 --> 05:31.980
Let me say.

05:31.980 --> 05:32.980
It doesn't matter though.

05:32.980 --> 05:33.980
He has a Porsche.

05:33.980 --> 05:34.980
Right?

05:34.980 --> 05:35.980
So it doesn't.

05:35.980 --> 05:36.980
He sold it.

05:36.980 --> 05:37.980
Um.

05:37.980 --> 05:38.980
That's fair.

05:38.980 --> 05:40.980
He didn't fit in it.

05:40.980 --> 05:43.980
Marty like the company got some funding.

05:43.980 --> 05:45.980
Marty started being like a big spender.

05:45.980 --> 05:48.980
He sold up vintage Porsche, like ending in 1969.

05:48.980 --> 05:50.980
And then he pulled up one day to the office.

05:50.980 --> 05:51.980
I was like, that's such a cool car.

05:51.980 --> 05:53.980
And he was like, yeah.

05:53.980 --> 05:55.980
My head hits the roof.

05:55.980 --> 05:58.980
He was like, yeah, he'll grow it.

05:58.980 --> 05:59.980
Yeah, exactly right.

05:59.980 --> 06:00.980
Yeah.

06:00.980 --> 06:01.980
Two big first bridges.

06:01.980 --> 06:02.980
Yeah.

06:02.980 --> 06:03.980
Amir.

06:03.980 --> 06:04.980
Are you a guy?

06:04.980 --> 06:06.980
Are you a disciple?

06:06.980 --> 06:08.980
Are you a car guy?

06:08.980 --> 06:09.980
No.

06:09.980 --> 06:11.980
I'm not a car guy.

06:11.980 --> 06:12.980
Joel.

06:12.980 --> 06:14.980
I think the car guy is like so lame.

06:14.980 --> 06:15.980
How so?

06:15.980 --> 06:24.980
Like, it's not a hobby to buy expensive things.

06:24.980 --> 06:29.980
What do you, what constitutes a hobby?

06:29.980 --> 06:32.980
Because I, it needs, go ahead.

06:32.980 --> 06:35.980
I don't, I mean, I don't, I'm not a car guy either.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.980
But just to play devil's at it.

06:37.980 --> 06:38.980
Yes.

06:38.980 --> 06:41.980
But that, this argument doesn't even lean towards that.

06:41.980 --> 06:46.980
For car guys, I feel like their whole thing is like getting together and just driving.

06:46.980 --> 06:48.980
Is that not a hobby?

06:48.980 --> 06:49.980
That's a hobby.

06:49.980 --> 06:54.980
I don't think it's a cool thing that car gets together to do something entirely solitary

06:54.980 --> 06:59.980
is like a very kind of masculine.

06:59.980 --> 07:01.980
That's, that's true.

07:01.980 --> 07:04.980
I was just talking to Joel saying that I met somebody who went to his high school.

07:04.980 --> 07:09.980
And I went out with like a vague new friend and his friends last weekend.

07:09.980 --> 07:10.980
And I was a little nervous.

07:10.980 --> 07:13.980
I was like, I don't know what your friends are like.

07:13.980 --> 07:16.980
And then they were all like sensitive boys.

07:16.980 --> 07:18.980
And we actually got into shit.

07:18.980 --> 07:19.980
We actually got into it.

07:19.980 --> 07:27.980
We talked about our family dynamics and like how our, you know, childhood shaped our nowadays.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.980
And that's something rare.

07:30.980 --> 07:33.980
Medium rare, maybe.

07:33.980 --> 07:34.980
We're a response fast.

07:34.980 --> 07:37.980
Don't like stare at the extent of silence.

07:37.980 --> 07:42.980
Mereka looks like devastated by the idea of me having an emotionally intelligent conversation

07:42.980 --> 07:43.980
with a medium rare.

07:43.980 --> 07:45.980
And it means like it happens the perfect amount.

07:45.980 --> 07:47.980
No.

07:47.980 --> 07:49.980
That's true.

07:49.980 --> 07:50.980
That's true.

07:50.980 --> 07:51.980
Um.

07:51.980 --> 07:57.980
Mereka, my fans on both of them a lot.

07:57.980 --> 07:58.980
My headphones.

07:58.980 --> 07:59.980
Bond of the week.

07:59.980 --> 08:00.980
Back on for that.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.980
Susan Sorandon is my pick.

08:02.980 --> 08:03.980
Let's just get through this.

08:03.980 --> 08:04.980
Emma.

08:04.980 --> 08:05.980
That's fun.

08:05.980 --> 08:06.980
Oh, that's a good one.

08:06.980 --> 08:07.980
Start with Joel.

08:07.980 --> 08:08.980
I don't know.

08:08.980 --> 08:09.980
Gave it from Dave.

08:09.980 --> 08:10.980
All right.

08:10.980 --> 08:11.980
You know, I ate through every cast member.

08:11.980 --> 08:12.980
Mereka.

08:12.980 --> 08:14.980
Ian McShane.

08:14.980 --> 08:16.980
Oh, the, um.

08:16.980 --> 08:19.980
The hot French girl who's in passages.

08:19.980 --> 08:20.980
Passive.

08:20.980 --> 08:21.980
Passive.

08:21.980 --> 08:22.980
Passive.

08:22.980 --> 08:23.980
I saw.

08:23.980 --> 08:24.980
Did you, when did you see it?

08:24.980 --> 08:25.980
I saw it last week.

08:25.980 --> 08:26.980
Okay.

08:26.980 --> 08:27.980
I saw it.

08:27.980 --> 08:28.980
I saw it like two days ago.

08:28.980 --> 08:29.980
Did you like it?

08:29.980 --> 08:30.980
Yeah, I loved it.

08:31.980 --> 08:36.980
It was a great tip for my entire theater to turn on the main character at the same time.

08:36.980 --> 08:37.980
Yeah.

08:37.980 --> 08:38.980
Yeah.

08:38.980 --> 08:39.980
Totally.

08:39.980 --> 08:40.980
Um.

08:40.980 --> 08:41.980
Yeah.

08:41.980 --> 08:42.980
She's my Adele.

08:42.980 --> 08:43.980
Something are there.

08:43.980 --> 08:44.980
I don't know her name.

08:44.980 --> 08:45.980
Nice.

08:45.980 --> 08:46.980
Um.

08:46.980 --> 08:47.980
That's that segment.

08:47.980 --> 08:48.980
We did it.

08:48.980 --> 08:49.980
Um.

08:49.980 --> 08:50.980
We don't do it every week.

08:50.980 --> 08:52.980
But I'm trying to do it as much as we can every week.

08:52.980 --> 08:54.980
So that it's like a runner.

08:54.980 --> 08:56.980
I have a point about my little hobby.

08:56.980 --> 08:58.980
Where are you explaining this now?

08:59.980 --> 09:00.980
Real hobbies.

09:00.980 --> 09:01.980
Yeah.

09:01.980 --> 09:06.980
I think every man should have like one hobby that no one else in their life understands.

09:06.980 --> 09:07.980
Well, it dears.

09:07.980 --> 09:08.980
What's yours?

09:08.980 --> 09:09.980
Yeah.

09:09.980 --> 09:10.980
I think I'm still searching.

09:10.980 --> 09:20.980
But like my friend found a great one where he has like a storage unit upstate, which is also kind of where he like motor cycle.

09:20.980 --> 09:21.980
So he's a murderer.

09:21.980 --> 09:22.980
So that's cars.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.980
That's the same thing with different amounts of wheels.

09:24.980 --> 09:25.980
No.

09:25.980 --> 09:31.980
Because the thing that he does is he just like, he's just like, oh, I got to like check out like some stuff at my storage unit.

09:31.980 --> 09:33.980
And you're like, what?

09:33.980 --> 09:36.980
And he's just like gone for like 36 hours from the city.

09:36.980 --> 09:37.980
Yeah.

09:37.980 --> 09:38.980
He's a drug dealer.

09:38.980 --> 09:40.980
I was going second family.

09:40.980 --> 09:41.980
I went.

09:41.980 --> 09:42.980
I went.

09:42.980 --> 09:43.980
I went.

09:43.980 --> 09:44.980
That's where he stores his bodies.

09:44.980 --> 09:48.980
I just think it's cool that like he disappears and like no one knows what he's doing.

09:48.980 --> 09:50.980
I think we've listed is arguably a hobby.

09:50.980 --> 09:51.980
Yeah.

09:51.980 --> 09:54.980
That's worse than car guy hobby.

09:55.980 --> 09:59.980
You think it's cool that he disappears off the face of the earth.

09:59.980 --> 10:00.980
We're 30.

10:00.980 --> 10:01.980
Exactly.

10:01.980 --> 10:02.980
A hobby.

10:02.980 --> 10:05.980
Well, I guess you could have a solitary hobby.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.980
That's like gone girling.

10:07.980 --> 10:08.980
That's a hobby.

10:09.980 --> 10:10.980
Yeah.

10:10.980 --> 10:11.980
I've never seen that.

10:11.980 --> 10:12.980
But that sounds weird.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.980
I do collect watches.

10:14.980 --> 10:17.980
This is actually a swatch that I just got in the mail this morning.

10:17.980 --> 10:18.980
Cool.

10:18.980 --> 10:19.980
So it's actually kind of watch.

10:19.980 --> 10:20.980
That's the name of it.

10:20.980 --> 10:23.980
You should get the James Bond swatch series.

10:24.980 --> 10:28.980
So I don't know if you can see this on the zoom, but the it shows the date.

10:28.980 --> 10:30.980
The day the week.

10:30.980 --> 10:32.980
So this isn't cool or impressive.

10:32.980 --> 10:33.980
Yeah.

10:33.980 --> 10:34.980
That's fine.

10:34.980 --> 10:38.980
That it isn't to you, but you just said that you think it's cool when men have hobbies

10:38.980 --> 10:40.980
that other people don't understand.

10:40.980 --> 10:41.980
Yeah.

10:41.980 --> 10:42.980
That's true.

10:42.980 --> 10:43.980
But this isn't a hobby.

10:43.980 --> 10:44.980
This is buying shit.

10:44.980 --> 10:45.980
Yeah.

10:45.980 --> 10:46.980
No, it's collecting.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.980
Collecting is not a hobby.

10:48.980 --> 10:52.980
Collecting like all quarters from 50 states is the same.

10:52.980 --> 10:54.980
This is the same thing.

10:54.980 --> 10:57.980
This is from the 70s.

10:57.980 --> 10:58.980
Anyway.

10:58.980 --> 11:01.980
I just joined a watch collecting group in Los Angeles.

11:01.980 --> 11:03.980
And I'm going to the first one tomorrow.

11:03.980 --> 11:04.980
The first event.

11:04.980 --> 11:06.980
I wonder if you guys will talk about yours.

11:06.980 --> 11:09.980
I'm really excited to hear about the people that we're at.

11:09.980 --> 11:11.980
I'm really worried about the people that are at it.

11:11.980 --> 11:12.980
Yeah.

11:12.980 --> 11:17.980
I'm like, I'm really like, like I said, I'm trying to say yes to more shit right now.

11:17.980 --> 11:23.980
And I am fearful avoidant that these people will avoid me.

11:23.980 --> 11:24.980
And vice versa.

11:24.980 --> 11:25.980
Right.

11:25.980 --> 11:26.980
I'm going to dance that.

11:26.980 --> 11:27.980
Yeah.

11:27.980 --> 11:30.980
But actually be more similar to you than you could ever possibly imagine.

11:30.980 --> 11:32.980
That's almost worst case scenario.

11:32.980 --> 11:33.980
Right.

11:33.980 --> 11:38.980
Anyway, Maria, you have a lot of hobbies.

11:38.980 --> 11:43.980
I feel like there's a lot of fast.

11:44.980 --> 11:48.980
I feel like there's a normal, like, definition of a hobby.

11:48.980 --> 11:51.980
It's like going to the movies.

11:51.980 --> 11:54.980
Like, I don't know.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.980
Do you not feel like that?

11:56.980 --> 11:57.980
Like it's not exciting.

11:57.980 --> 11:59.980
It's just like a thing that you do.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.980
I, you've seen every Broadway show.

12:01.980 --> 12:04.980
It seems like I think that's novel.

12:04.980 --> 12:05.980
I think that's normal.

12:05.980 --> 12:07.980
I would say that that is my hobby.

12:07.980 --> 12:09.980
But then when I tell people that it's my hobby,

12:09.980 --> 12:11.980
they're like, that's crazy.

12:11.980 --> 12:12.980
And not a hobby.

12:12.980 --> 12:13.980
I don't know.

12:13.980 --> 12:19.980
What is this, like, weird, like, fucking big brothering of what's a hobby and what's not?

12:19.980 --> 12:20.980
I don't know.

12:20.980 --> 12:22.980
Sort of a hobby.

12:22.980 --> 12:25.980
That's your thing that no one else has been.

12:25.980 --> 12:29.980
I just want to make a few people feel bad about the shit that they do on the side.

12:29.980 --> 12:34.980
I just want to make a few people feel bad about the shit that they do on the side.

12:34.980 --> 12:36.980
On the side.

12:36.980 --> 12:38.980
Emma, hobbies?

12:38.980 --> 12:39.980
Oh, okay.

12:39.980 --> 12:44.980
I was going to say, I mean, I wish I like played a sport or like did an activity.

12:44.980 --> 12:48.980
It was like more of a thing or like did crafting.

12:48.980 --> 12:49.980
That's like a hobby.

12:49.980 --> 12:52.980
It's entirely in your hands.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.980
You can take up a sport or a craft.

12:55.980 --> 12:56.980
What craft did you do?

12:56.980 --> 12:58.980
I'll teach you how to knit.

12:58.980 --> 12:59.980
We could knit together.

12:59.980 --> 13:00.980
I don't know how to knit.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.980
I would love to learn how to knit.

13:02.980 --> 13:04.980
I know to crochet.

13:04.980 --> 13:07.980
My, I really want to make rugs.

13:08.980 --> 13:09.980
Let's try one.

13:09.980 --> 13:10.980
Talk about that a lot.

13:10.980 --> 13:11.980
I did.

13:11.980 --> 13:12.980
I should get into that.

13:12.980 --> 13:14.980
Yeah, you're always talking about that.

13:14.980 --> 13:16.980
At this point, just do it.

13:16.980 --> 13:17.980
Yeah.

13:17.980 --> 13:19.980
It's why we can't fucking order lunch.

13:19.980 --> 13:22.980
Because just talking about making rugs.

13:22.980 --> 13:25.980
Because browsing looms.

13:27.980 --> 13:30.980
Emma, what are your hobbies or lack there of?

13:30.980 --> 13:33.980
My hobbies are.

13:34.980 --> 13:38.980
Stuff that like with any skill would be more than a hobby.

13:38.980 --> 13:42.980
Like creating poetry or movies or whatever.

13:42.980 --> 13:44.980
That is, that is the thing.

13:44.980 --> 13:46.980
I feel like I want to make rugs partially.

13:46.980 --> 13:48.980
So I could like sell them for a lot of money.

13:48.980 --> 13:49.980
Rugs?

13:49.980 --> 13:50.980
Do you work?

13:50.980 --> 13:51.980
What a list.

13:51.980 --> 13:52.980
I think.

13:52.980 --> 13:53.980
Have an art.

13:53.980 --> 13:55.980
But it's like what am I going to do with like.

13:55.980 --> 13:58.980
What am I going to do with like 10 rugs, you know?

13:58.980 --> 14:00.980
Like, and I just keep making rugs.

14:00.980 --> 14:01.980
You could sell them.

14:01.980 --> 14:04.980
But for a lot of money is the part of the sentence that I have an issue with.

14:04.980 --> 14:05.980
Or you gift them to your friends.

14:05.980 --> 14:06.980
Give them your friends.

14:06.980 --> 14:07.980
Give them your friends.

14:07.980 --> 14:08.980
Like for a month.

14:08.980 --> 14:09.980
It would be a great gift.

14:09.980 --> 14:13.980
But it'd be like a, like, rugs are like $600.

14:13.980 --> 14:17.980
Plus, like, I'm giving you a $600 hand made item.

14:17.980 --> 14:19.980
No, so I'm a cost.

14:19.980 --> 14:22.980
But not just don't, just don't be like Nordic knots.

14:22.980 --> 14:23.980
At cost is crazy.

14:23.980 --> 14:28.980
I made a lot of, so I give a lot of like knitwear is gift.

14:29.980 --> 14:32.980
And I made a bunch of like baby onesies over the pandemic.

14:32.980 --> 14:34.980
And it was like, we like $200 in materials.

14:34.980 --> 14:37.980
And then probably like $2,000 in my time.

14:37.980 --> 14:39.980
But that's that cost.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.980
It has to be inclusive of labor is what I meant.

14:41.980 --> 14:45.980
So just, but $200 is still an insane amount of money.

14:45.980 --> 14:47.980
No, no, it would be the $2200.

14:47.980 --> 14:48.980
Okay.

14:48.980 --> 14:50.980
That's more reasonable.

14:50.980 --> 14:51.980
I see a thing now.

14:51.980 --> 14:52.980
For one baby ones.

14:52.980 --> 14:53.980
One baby ones.

14:53.980 --> 14:54.980
Yeah.

14:54.980 --> 14:55.980
How much the rug costs that you gift me.

14:55.980 --> 14:57.980
Inclusive of labor.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.980
I will spend that amount of dollars on chip city chips.

15:00.980 --> 15:01.980
It's a gift to you on your birthday.

15:01.980 --> 15:02.980
What?

15:02.980 --> 15:03.980
It just give me cash.

15:03.980 --> 15:05.980
All right.

15:05.980 --> 15:09.980
I'm again, I'm also starting to see what Marika wants for her birthday.

15:09.980 --> 15:11.980
Seems like cash and envelope.

15:11.980 --> 15:13.980
I just truly, all I ever want.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.980
And let me tell you, a hard thing to ask my parents for.

15:16.980 --> 15:18.980
They do not want to do that.

15:18.980 --> 15:21.980
I got that.

15:21.980 --> 15:23.980
I'm like that too.

15:23.980 --> 15:25.980
But no, I'm not sure.

15:26.980 --> 15:30.980
Um, can you make those onesies in any size?

15:30.980 --> 15:31.980
Yeah.

15:31.980 --> 15:32.980
I can make a job size one.

15:32.980 --> 15:33.980
See if that's what you're doing.

15:33.980 --> 15:34.980
All right.

15:34.980 --> 15:36.980
I'm a 44 regular.

15:36.980 --> 15:39.980
I don't know if that is taking some size.

15:39.980 --> 15:40.980
Yeah.

15:40.980 --> 15:41.980
Yeah.

15:41.980 --> 15:43.980
Oh, it's like.

15:43.980 --> 15:46.980
No, like 22 to 23 inches across the chest.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.980
And then just like, you know,

15:48.980 --> 15:51.980
I don't need that much room in the ground.

15:52.980 --> 15:53.980
For now.

15:55.980 --> 15:57.980
Uh, Marika.

15:57.980 --> 15:58.980
Yeah.

15:58.980 --> 16:02.980
You're shifting in your seats, making everyone else uncomfortable by proxy.

16:02.980 --> 16:04.980
I mean, you have to point it out.

16:04.980 --> 16:06.980
And we probably have gotten past it.

16:06.980 --> 16:09.980
I sort of like, I was trying to take up my shoes.

16:09.980 --> 16:10.980
So I could sit across.

16:10.980 --> 16:11.980
I got a mud spired me.

16:11.980 --> 16:14.980
And I'm worried about Joel and Emma's corporate level with you.

16:14.980 --> 16:16.980
Not having shoes on in the fucking studio.

16:16.980 --> 16:18.980
And my son, she was on the studio.

16:18.980 --> 16:19.980
Okay.

16:19.980 --> 16:20.980
Joel.

16:20.980 --> 16:21.980
I'm not wearing underwear.

16:21.980 --> 16:22.980
That's fine.

16:22.980 --> 16:23.980
Yeah.

16:23.980 --> 16:27.980
Um, what do you guys most excited about in life right now?

16:27.980 --> 16:32.980
I am, uh, stressed.

16:32.980 --> 16:37.980
Some flying to Red Rocks tomorrow to see in my friend have no plan.

16:37.980 --> 16:38.980
But we're going to see Mount Joy.

16:38.980 --> 16:41.980
I haven't done laundry in weeks.

16:41.980 --> 16:44.980
But it should go well.

16:44.980 --> 16:46.980
Are you okay?

16:46.980 --> 16:47.980
Yeah.

16:47.980 --> 16:49.980
No, he's not.

16:50.980 --> 16:52.980
He's flying during.

16:52.980 --> 16:55.980
Marie, go what you most excited about.

16:55.980 --> 16:58.980
Um, I'm excited for you to come to New York.

16:58.980 --> 16:59.980
Yeah.

16:59.980 --> 17:00.980
I'm coming to New York.

17:00.980 --> 17:01.980
Just for sad.

17:01.980 --> 17:02.980
I'm not going to be here.

17:02.980 --> 17:03.980
Nobody's going to be there.

17:03.980 --> 17:06.980
Oh, do you want to come do a Bruce Spring scene with me and my dad?

17:06.980 --> 17:09.980
All of my friends are like on the 30th.

17:09.980 --> 17:12.980
No, unlike September 3rd or 2nd or something.

17:12.980 --> 17:13.980
Never mind.

17:13.980 --> 17:15.980
Besides a Sunday.

17:15.980 --> 17:18.980
Um, if it wasn't with your dad, I would go.

17:18.980 --> 17:20.980
We should have father sometime.

17:20.980 --> 17:22.980
We have an extra ticket.

17:22.980 --> 17:25.980
You know, it would be sort of medium rare.

17:25.980 --> 17:26.980
Really bad.

17:26.980 --> 17:30.980
I'm not comfortable around fathers.

17:30.980 --> 17:35.980
So, uh, we don't have to get us like that.

17:35.980 --> 17:38.980
Um, but that sounds really fun.

17:38.980 --> 17:43.980
I actually did almost get tickets to see Springsteen in LA.

17:43.980 --> 17:44.980
And I still might.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.980
So, I might save myself for that slash marriage.

17:47.980 --> 17:49.980
I'll pencil you in.

17:49.980 --> 17:51.980
Um, Emma.

17:51.980 --> 17:52.980
Um.

17:52.980 --> 17:53.980
Um.

17:53.980 --> 17:54.980
You didn't gush her as bad.

17:54.980 --> 17:56.980
I'm sorry.

17:56.980 --> 17:57.980
Um.

17:57.980 --> 17:59.980
I am excited.

17:59.980 --> 18:02.980
The week that I won't be here and that you will be here.

18:02.980 --> 18:07.980
I'm going to be with my sisters and my cousins all on a trip.

18:07.980 --> 18:09.980
In coastal Maine or.

18:09.980 --> 18:10.980
Um, Black Island.

18:10.980 --> 18:12.980
I wasn't used to Maine recently.

18:12.980 --> 18:14.980
It's off of Rhode Island.

18:14.980 --> 18:15.980
That's cool.

18:15.980 --> 18:16.980
Newport.

18:17.980 --> 18:18.980
No.

18:18.980 --> 18:21.980
Don't just like list places in the Northeast.

18:21.980 --> 18:24.980
There's no way you're going south from here.

18:24.980 --> 18:27.980
Because you'd have to get down to South Carolina for there to be anywhere.

18:27.980 --> 18:28.980
Worth.

18:28.980 --> 18:30.980
I'm not going south.

18:30.980 --> 18:31.980
Right.

18:31.980 --> 18:32.980
Or other words.

18:32.980 --> 18:33.980
Your line is pretty good.

18:33.980 --> 18:34.980
Nice.

18:34.980 --> 18:35.980
What's up, America?

18:35.980 --> 18:37.980
I said North Carolina is pretty good.

18:37.980 --> 18:39.980
Really Asheville.

18:39.980 --> 18:40.980
Sure.

18:40.980 --> 18:41.980
Sure.

18:41.980 --> 18:44.980
I heard the most tragic horrendous story.

18:44.980 --> 18:45.980
So bad.

18:45.980 --> 18:46.980
I can't even say it on the podcast.

18:46.980 --> 18:48.980
The took place in North Carolina recently.

18:48.980 --> 18:50.980
We really need to take a break.

18:50.980 --> 18:51.980
I'm so sorry.

18:55.980 --> 18:58.980
Guys, wait, you hear that sound?

18:58.980 --> 19:01.980
That's the sound of a sale that you're missing out on.

19:01.980 --> 19:03.980
Because you're not selling on Shopify.

19:03.980 --> 19:05.980
And what does it sound like with Shopify?

19:05.980 --> 19:07.980

Now, I've never sold with Shopify, but I have bought from a lot of Shopify stores,

19:47.980 --> 19:48.980
especially on the e-commerce side.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.980
And I have to say that that last point is absolutely correct.

19:51.980 --> 19:54.980
I mean, sometimes when I'm on the fence about whether or not I want to buy something.

19:54.980 --> 19:58.980
You know, if it's a native checkout in someone's own website,

19:58.980 --> 20:01.980
I'm like, I don't know if I want to create an account and enter all my information.

20:01.980 --> 20:05.980
But if it's a Shopify store, it auto fills and it's just, you know,

20:05.980 --> 20:08.980

Let's hear that sound again.

20:29.980 --> 20:30.980
Thanks, Shopify.

20:30.980 --> 20:35.980
And we're back.

20:36.980 --> 20:40.980
Well, welcome to we haven't done an actual game segment in a minute.

20:40.980 --> 20:43.980
And what's that?

20:43.980 --> 20:46.980
What's that?

20:46.980 --> 20:49.980
And said, and we're snack.

20:49.980 --> 20:51.980
So you got a pretzel out of the container.

20:51.980 --> 20:56.980
Sorry, I just, yeah.

20:56.980 --> 20:57.980
I don't know.

20:57.980 --> 20:59.980
Not like derail everything, but.

21:06.980 --> 21:07.980
Yeah.

21:07.980 --> 21:08.980
Yeah.

21:08.980 --> 21:09.980
Yeah.

21:09.980 --> 21:10.980
Yeah.

21:10.980 --> 21:11.980
Yeah.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.980
Yeah.

21:13.980 --> 21:14.980
Yeah.

21:14.980 --> 21:15.980
Yeah.

21:15.980 --> 21:16.980
Yeah.

21:16.980 --> 21:17.980
Yeah.

21:17.980 --> 21:18.980
Yeah.

21:18.980 --> 21:19.980
Yeah.

21:19.980 --> 21:20.980
Yeah.

21:20.980 --> 21:21.980
Yeah.

21:21.980 --> 21:22.980
Yeah.

21:22.980 --> 21:23.980
Yeah.

21:23.980 --> 21:24.980
Yeah.

21:24.980 --> 21:25.980
Yeah.

21:25.980 --> 21:26.980
Yeah.

21:26.980 --> 21:27.980
Yeah.

21:27.980 --> 21:28.980
Yeah.

21:28.980 --> 21:29.980
Yeah.

21:29.980 --> 21:30.980
Yeah.

21:30.980 --> 21:31.980
Yeah.

21:31.980 --> 21:32.980
Yeah.

21:32.980 --> 21:33.980
Yeah.

21:33.980 --> 21:34.980
Yeah.

21:35.980 --> 21:38.980
We've played this game before.

21:38.980 --> 21:40.980
Gizhou boo.

21:40.980 --> 21:41.980
All over again.

21:48.980 --> 21:51.980
Can I finish?

21:51.980 --> 21:54.980
Go on.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.980
This is fiction, Harry.

21:56.980 --> 21:59.980
This was suggested by somebody in the YouTube comments to play this again.

21:59.980 --> 22:01.980
I had forgotten we'd done it.

22:01.980 --> 22:02.980
And I don't know their name.

22:02.980 --> 22:03.980
So they won't get any credit.

22:03.980 --> 22:05.980
But this is fiction area.

22:05.980 --> 22:17.980
This is a Victorian era parlor game where everyone guesses the definition of an obscure word in the parlor.

22:17.980 --> 22:19.980
So you need to go to the parlor.

22:19.980 --> 22:21.980
That's just treat this as the parlor.

22:21.980 --> 22:22.980
Okay.

22:22.980 --> 22:25.980
Are you guys get the rules of the game?

22:25.980 --> 22:31.980
I'm going to say an obscure word and then we all take guesses that, you know, what it means.

22:31.980 --> 22:35.980
And let's raise the stakes a little bit.

22:35.980 --> 22:39.980
If you guys get kind of near the right word.

22:39.980 --> 22:41.980
And I'm not going to do the Venmo thing.

22:41.980 --> 22:42.980
I'm not going to do the cash.

22:42.980 --> 22:43.980
We haven't done that in like a year.

22:43.980 --> 22:44.980
It's played out.

22:44.980 --> 22:48.980
I will answer one very personal question about myself.

22:48.980 --> 22:50.980
People always say, oh, Jeff can dish it out.

22:50.980 --> 22:52.980
But he can't take it.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.980
You can ask me anything.

22:54.980 --> 22:56.980
If you're close enough to the definition.

22:56.980 --> 22:59.980
But I'm only comfortable doing this because you're not going to get any of these.

22:59.980 --> 23:00.980
Is that fair?

23:00.980 --> 23:01.980
Yeah.

23:01.980 --> 23:02.980
That's fair.

23:02.980 --> 23:03.980
All right.

23:03.980 --> 23:05.980
Naskin.

23:05.980 --> 23:08.980
N-A-What's that?

23:08.980 --> 23:10.980
No, I was going to ask with an N or an M.

23:10.980 --> 23:14.980
N-A-S-K-I-N.

23:14.980 --> 23:17.980
It's like napkin, but with an S.

23:17.980 --> 23:22.980
That is when like new skin grows over a scab.

23:22.980 --> 23:29.980
So you think it's like a portmento of like nasty skin.

23:29.980 --> 23:31.980
I was thinking nascent and skin.

23:31.980 --> 23:33.980
Oh, very good.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.980
Very good.

23:35.980 --> 23:45.980
That is a colloquialism, meaning like I'm not asking that.

23:45.980 --> 23:48.980
So can you use that in a sentence?

23:48.980 --> 23:50.980
I'm asking that.

23:50.980 --> 23:51.980
Oh.

23:51.980 --> 23:52.980
What?

23:52.980 --> 23:53.980
Okay.

23:53.980 --> 23:55.980
That's a good assumption.

23:55.980 --> 23:57.980
Yeah.

23:58.980 --> 24:01.980
I think Naskin is...

24:01.980 --> 24:05.980
When you're like perturbing someone, like annoying.

24:05.980 --> 24:06.980
Okay.

24:06.980 --> 24:08.980
I'm really like Marika's.

24:08.980 --> 24:09.980
Yeah.

24:09.980 --> 24:10.980
I really do start using it.

24:10.980 --> 24:12.980
Marika's is awesome.

24:12.980 --> 24:14.980
Thank you.

24:14.980 --> 24:17.980
Naskin means you're all wrong.

24:17.980 --> 24:20.980
Prison.

24:20.980 --> 24:21.980
Prison?

24:21.980 --> 24:22.980
Yeah.

24:22.980 --> 24:24.980
It's just a different word for a prison.

24:24.980 --> 24:26.980
What's the origin?

24:27.980 --> 24:29.980
It wasn't prepared for you to ask that.

24:29.980 --> 24:31.980
And we're doing it now.

24:31.980 --> 24:34.980
I really wish you were Naskin that.

24:34.980 --> 24:37.980
Very good.

24:37.980 --> 24:43.980
It looks like it is not showing up on Google.

24:43.980 --> 24:46.980
It's not a real word.

24:46.980 --> 24:48.980
It really is not.

24:48.980 --> 24:51.980
Tell Google to get in the parlor.

24:51.980 --> 24:54.980
Google is lacking in the parlor.

24:55.980 --> 24:56.980
Okay.

24:56.980 --> 24:57.980
Dictionary.

24:57.980 --> 25:00.980
She's fucking crazy.

25:00.980 --> 25:05.980
It's not showing origin.

25:05.980 --> 25:06.980
Right.

25:06.980 --> 25:09.980
I think it's not English word.

25:09.980 --> 25:10.980
No.

25:10.980 --> 25:12.980
It is.

25:12.980 --> 25:16.980
I think it must just be like so old.

25:16.980 --> 25:19.980
That there's not a lot of literature on it.

25:19.980 --> 25:22.980
Moving on.

25:23.980 --> 25:26.980
Jabri.

25:26.980 --> 25:29.980
J-O-B-B-E-R-Y.

25:29.980 --> 25:32.980
Also, everyone feel free to play along at home.

25:32.980 --> 25:37.980
And write your definitions of these words in the comments of the YouTube video.

25:37.980 --> 25:38.980
One at a time.

25:38.980 --> 25:39.980
One at a time.

25:39.980 --> 25:41.980
As you're watching this.

25:41.980 --> 25:42.980
Yeah.

25:42.980 --> 25:46.980
So we can then maybe next time we play this or next week we'll read those on the pod.

25:46.980 --> 25:47.980
Maybe.

25:47.980 --> 25:48.980
Maybe.

25:48.980 --> 25:49.980
That might not be a good idea.

25:49.980 --> 25:50.980
I just thought of it now.

25:50.980 --> 25:51.980
Jabri.

25:51.980 --> 25:54.980
J-O-B-B-E-R-Y.

25:54.980 --> 25:57.980
I think it's like joyful.

25:57.980 --> 26:00.980
Playful.

26:00.980 --> 26:05.980
I think it's a location similar to like a Haber Dashory.

26:05.980 --> 26:07.980
But where they give out jobs.

26:07.980 --> 26:10.980
Like a like a tempo agency.

26:10.980 --> 26:11.980
But old timey.

26:11.980 --> 26:13.980
Like you go in or like I need a job.

26:13.980 --> 26:14.980
And they're like, you know.

26:14.980 --> 26:19.980
Like a depression era person standing out of a factory and like handing like

26:19.980 --> 26:20.980
this lipstick.

26:20.980 --> 26:21.980
Yeah.

26:21.980 --> 26:22.980
Yeah.

26:22.980 --> 26:23.980
So good at this game.

26:23.980 --> 26:26.980
I'm just doing the most humorless thing.

26:26.980 --> 26:28.980
What is a Haber Dash?

26:28.980 --> 26:31.980
It's a place where they sell hats.

26:31.980 --> 26:33.980
Is a Haber Dash a hat?

26:33.980 --> 26:34.980
I don't know.

26:34.980 --> 26:35.980
I don't think so.

26:35.980 --> 26:36.980
Okay.

26:36.980 --> 26:37.980
J-O-B-E-R-Y.

26:37.980 --> 26:38.980
It feels like you wouldn't know.

26:38.980 --> 26:44.980
I take a fence to that.

26:44.980 --> 26:52.980
Uh, a jobry is like that feeling when something's gone a little too soon.

26:52.980 --> 26:55.980
Well, well.

26:55.980 --> 26:57.980
All wrong.

26:57.980 --> 27:02.980
It's the conduct of public business for private gain.

27:02.980 --> 27:04.980
I mean.

27:04.980 --> 27:07.980
You think any of those rich clothes?

27:07.980 --> 27:08.980
What do you call this?

27:08.980 --> 27:12.980
You said it was a Haber Dashory.

27:12.980 --> 27:15.980
I said it was, I said it was a business.

27:15.980 --> 27:16.980
Yeah.

27:16.980 --> 27:17.980
Business.

27:17.980 --> 27:18.980
We get jeans.

27:18.980 --> 27:19.980
Fine.

27:19.980 --> 27:20.980
Not hats.

27:20.980 --> 27:21.980
Ask me anything.

27:21.980 --> 27:22.980
I don't want to.

27:22.980 --> 27:24.980
I don't know anything about me.

27:24.980 --> 27:29.980
I don't take joy in asking extremely personal questions about you.

27:29.980 --> 27:34.980
See, I don't get that.

27:34.980 --> 27:39.980
Do you want a phone a friend or a phone a phone?

27:39.980 --> 27:41.980
Sure.

27:41.980 --> 27:44.980
Joel, do you want to ask a personal question?

27:44.980 --> 27:51.980
Uh, when did you last feel my definition of jobry?

27:51.980 --> 27:53.980
And I already forgot your definition.

27:53.980 --> 27:55.980
Can you remind me?

27:55.980 --> 27:58.980
When something's gone a little bit too soon.

27:58.980 --> 28:00.980
Oh.

28:00.980 --> 28:03.980
Uh.

28:03.980 --> 28:06.980
My next thing does not make work.

28:06.980 --> 28:09.980
I joke because I want to like make a good for the podcast.

28:09.980 --> 28:10.980
That's not what I said I would do.

28:10.980 --> 28:14.980
Um, my friend Corey, who's on the show on the all about dairy or something about dairy.

28:14.980 --> 28:15.980
Oh, yeah.

28:15.980 --> 28:17.980
That's the guy who threatened me or something.

28:17.980 --> 28:18.980
Yeah.

28:18.980 --> 28:19.980
Oh, he is in New York.

28:19.980 --> 28:20.980
By the way, and he is going to beat the shit out of you.

28:20.980 --> 28:22.980
He's been searching for you.

28:22.980 --> 28:23.980
No, he moved to New York.

28:23.980 --> 28:25.980
I went to Kentucky for a job.

28:25.980 --> 28:27.980
And then when I was there, he moved to New York.

28:27.980 --> 28:28.980
And what I got back.

28:28.980 --> 28:30.980
And I was just like, where the hell is Corey?

28:30.980 --> 28:31.980
And that made me sad.

28:31.980 --> 28:36.980
Also, I was supposed to get back the day of his going away party.

28:36.980 --> 28:38.980
And then they extended me.

28:38.980 --> 28:41.980
And so I didn't even get to say goodbye.

28:41.980 --> 28:42.980
Hmm.

28:42.980 --> 28:46.980
It was kind of a flex, but I'm sorry to hear that.

28:46.980 --> 28:50.980
The flex is that I have no friends in LA.

28:50.980 --> 28:56.980
But the job and secretary people in Kentucky fucking love you.

28:56.980 --> 28:57.980
Bad job.

28:57.980 --> 28:59.980
I went already ordered.

28:59.980 --> 29:02.980
So I mean, if he can get food in the whole podcast or community.

29:02.980 --> 29:03.980
Yeah.

29:03.980 --> 29:04.980
Sure.

29:04.980 --> 29:05.980
We could if you guys wanted it.

29:05.980 --> 29:07.980
Crazy looking chair.

29:07.980 --> 29:08.980
I like it.

29:08.980 --> 29:09.980
I like it.

29:09.980 --> 29:11.980
I do too.

29:11.980 --> 29:15.980
What do you think about like outlets that are like really high up?

29:15.980 --> 29:17.980
I don't need that.

29:17.980 --> 29:19.980
I don't like it.

29:19.980 --> 29:20.980
Yeah.

29:20.980 --> 29:21.980
Sorry.

29:21.980 --> 29:22.980
How did it delivery?

29:22.980 --> 29:23.980
What'd you get?

29:23.980 --> 29:32.980
I got a new AC unit because the old one broke and it's fucking scorching here.

29:32.980 --> 29:33.980
Moving on.

29:33.980 --> 29:38.980
Prover.

29:38.980 --> 29:40.980
TR-O-V-E-R.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.980
This one's stumping you guys.

29:42.980 --> 29:46.980
It's trover.

29:46.980 --> 29:49.980
Can you give us what type.

29:49.980 --> 29:53.980
Can you give us if it's like a noun or an adjective.

29:53.980 --> 29:54.980
It is.

29:54.980 --> 29:56.980
It's a great question.

29:56.980 --> 29:57.980
It's a noun.

29:57.980 --> 30:00.980
I think I'm so stressed by that question because I'm like,

30:00.980 --> 30:02.980
I'm not sure about what I'm in an adjective.

30:02.980 --> 30:09.980
I can't think of what that grouping of things is called.

30:09.980 --> 30:11.980
It's a person place or a thing.

30:11.980 --> 30:12.980
No, no.

30:12.980 --> 30:15.980
Like a noun, adjective, verb, etc.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.980
Like what those are.

30:17.980 --> 30:18.980
Oh.

30:18.980 --> 30:20.980
Part of speech.

30:20.980 --> 30:23.980
Thank you.

30:23.980 --> 30:27.980
Trover's a noun.

30:27.980 --> 30:30.980
I think it's a terrestrial rover.

30:30.980 --> 30:33.980
Like the one sent to Mars.

30:33.980 --> 30:34.980
Interesting.

30:34.980 --> 30:41.980
I think it's like low lying shrubs in a forest on a hill.

30:41.980 --> 30:42.980
It's really good.

30:42.980 --> 30:43.980
Okay.

30:43.980 --> 30:45.980
We made love on the trover.

30:45.980 --> 30:46.980
Yeah.

30:46.980 --> 30:48.980
On the shrubs.

30:48.980 --> 30:49.980
Yeah.

30:49.980 --> 30:51.980
Yeah.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.980
Um.

30:55.980 --> 30:56.980
Trover.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.980
Trover.

30:59.980 --> 31:03.980
Uh, I think it's a kind of trophy.

31:03.980 --> 31:04.980
Okay.

31:04.980 --> 31:11.980
Um, it's actually legal action brought to recover goods from the wrongful owner.

31:11.980 --> 31:14.980
Yeg.

31:14.980 --> 31:17.980
He was the same pleasure as having.

31:17.980 --> 31:19.980
Egg with a Y.

31:19.980 --> 31:21.980
Is that the egg?

31:21.980 --> 31:22.980
Y.

31:22.980 --> 31:24.980
Exactly.

31:25.980 --> 31:26.980
Yeg.

31:30.980 --> 31:32.980
This is a hard one, honestly.

31:32.980 --> 31:33.980
Yeg.

31:33.980 --> 31:35.980
You do the part of speech?

31:35.980 --> 31:36.980
No.

31:44.980 --> 31:49.980
It's a hobby that was popular in 1850's Germany.

31:49.980 --> 31:51.980
Interesting.

31:52.980 --> 31:53.980
We're in.

31:53.980 --> 31:55.980
If you put an egg on a spoon.

31:55.980 --> 31:58.980
And then bike with it in your mouth.

31:58.980 --> 31:59.980
Oh, Carl.

31:59.980 --> 32:00.980
Okay.

32:00.980 --> 32:01.980
What?

32:01.980 --> 32:02.980
It's sorry.

32:02.980 --> 32:03.980
What time?

32:03.980 --> 32:04.980
You said 1850's?

32:04.980 --> 32:05.980
Yeah.

32:05.980 --> 32:06.980
Okay.

32:06.980 --> 32:07.980
Maria.

32:07.980 --> 32:10.980
I think it is a type of singing.

32:10.980 --> 32:12.980
That's very gutterl.

32:12.980 --> 32:18.980
And with a very flummy situation in your throat.

32:18.980 --> 32:19.980
Emma.

32:19.980 --> 32:21.980
I think it's like some sort of club.

32:21.980 --> 32:22.980
Okay.

32:22.980 --> 32:24.980
Honestly, I'm going to give it to Joel.

32:24.980 --> 32:26.980
It's a burglar of safes.

32:26.980 --> 32:30.980
But it first appeared in print in Europe in 1873.

32:30.980 --> 32:32.980
So I'll give it to you for the timing of it all.

32:32.980 --> 32:36.980
And I do think that safe cracking is kind of a hobby.

32:36.980 --> 32:37.980
That is a hobby.

32:37.980 --> 32:38.980
Yeah.

32:38.980 --> 32:40.980
Have at it.

32:40.980 --> 32:43.980
I don't want to ask you any more personal questions.

32:43.980 --> 32:45.980
So these stakes aren't high enough.

32:45.980 --> 32:47.980
You guys don't want to get the definition, right?

32:47.980 --> 32:49.980
I don't want to know anything about me.

32:49.980 --> 32:53.980
You don't want to share your so explicit about not wanting to share.

32:53.980 --> 32:56.980
I just shared a very earnest thing.

32:56.980 --> 32:58.980
Yeah, but it wasn't like.

32:58.980 --> 33:00.980
So it's like interesting.

33:00.980 --> 33:01.980
Yeah.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.980
Yeah, it wasn't interesting.

33:03.980 --> 33:04.980
All right.

33:04.980 --> 33:05.980
So what would raise the stakes?

33:05.980 --> 33:10.980
What would you want the prize to be for being close?

33:10.980 --> 33:14.980
I think you should have to make me a rug.

33:14.980 --> 33:16.980
That's so mismatched.

33:17.980 --> 33:20.980
I mean, I don't have to learn a new trade.

33:20.980 --> 33:22.980
You would improve yourself.

33:22.980 --> 33:24.980
Barely.

33:24.980 --> 33:31.980
I think that you, I think you should make him like a t-shirt.

33:31.980 --> 33:32.980
No.

33:32.980 --> 33:33.980
These are weights.

33:33.980 --> 33:34.980
These are.

33:34.980 --> 33:35.980
Just on a barn.

33:35.980 --> 33:39.980
Honestly, I think Jeff, I think you could make like,

33:39.980 --> 33:42.980
Oh, made t-shirts a thing for you.

33:42.980 --> 33:43.980
Maybe.

33:43.980 --> 33:46.980
Like the ones where you just write in a black Sharpie on a white t-shirt,

33:46.980 --> 33:48.980
like you bring this back.

33:48.980 --> 33:49.980
Maybe.

33:49.980 --> 33:51.980
That's not good for this episode.

33:51.980 --> 33:56.980
I'm trying to put together a good episode and something oral.

33:56.980 --> 33:59.980
Sure.

33:59.980 --> 34:00.980
Gosh, right.

34:00.980 --> 34:01.980
All right.

34:01.980 --> 34:02.980
No.

34:02.980 --> 34:04.980
Sing me your favorite spring scene song for 15 seconds.

34:04.980 --> 34:05.980
Please.

34:05.980 --> 34:06.980
No.

34:06.980 --> 34:07.980
I was just pissing a song.

34:07.980 --> 34:08.980
No.

34:09.980 --> 34:14.980
And actually, no, this is what it is.

34:14.980 --> 34:17.980
Every time someone gets one right,

34:17.980 --> 34:20.980
you need to do that same task.

34:20.980 --> 34:21.980
Okay.

34:21.980 --> 34:23.980
And when we collectively get five right,

34:23.980 --> 34:26.980
you have to go to spring scene with me and my dad.

34:26.980 --> 34:30.980
Listen, there's six more.

34:30.980 --> 34:36.980
So you have to get three, three, three out of six.

34:36.980 --> 34:37.980
Okay.

34:38.980 --> 34:40.980
And by the way, I'm the judge.

34:40.980 --> 34:43.980
So I'm just not going to give you three.

34:43.980 --> 34:44.980
Gosley,

34:44.980 --> 34:47.980
G-us-l-i.

34:47.980 --> 34:49.980
It's an app where they deliver gas to you.

34:49.980 --> 34:54.980
Gosley, just IPO.

34:54.980 --> 35:02.980
I think it's a descriptor of like,

35:02.980 --> 35:06.980
when you have really,

35:06.980 --> 35:11.980
like, roughly, appendages on like a dress or outfit.

35:11.980 --> 35:12.980
Okay.

35:12.980 --> 35:16.980
It's like a very like overwhelming bosom.

35:16.980 --> 35:19.980
That's how you get it.

35:19.980 --> 35:23.980
Before there were mommy milkers there was a ghost.

35:23.980 --> 35:28.980
The correct definition is actually Russian zither.

35:28.980 --> 35:30.980
Oh, that's cool.

35:30.980 --> 35:31.980
What's zither?

35:31.980 --> 35:32.980
That's a musical instrument.

35:32.980 --> 35:33.980
Zither.

35:33.980 --> 35:34.980
Okay.

35:35.980 --> 35:36.980
Don't yell at me.

35:36.980 --> 35:38.980
That's the next word.

35:38.980 --> 35:39.980
It's a musical instrument.

35:39.980 --> 35:40.980
Fuck.

35:40.980 --> 35:42.980
That's one fruit.

35:42.980 --> 35:45.980
So I have to sing another spring scene song.

35:45.980 --> 35:47.980
No sing a song.

35:47.980 --> 35:51.980
I'm song that's not what would you do on a Saturday night.

35:51.980 --> 35:52.980
I can't.

35:52.980 --> 35:54.980
Did the song that I'm do?

35:54.980 --> 35:56.980
He didn't know that's Andrew Lloyd-Retweber.

35:56.980 --> 35:57.980
What else?

35:57.980 --> 35:59.980
Sing, sing, sing, sing.

35:59.980 --> 36:00.980
Oh yeah.

36:00.980 --> 36:01.980
Oh my god.

36:01.980 --> 36:02.980
Sing, sing.

36:03.980 --> 36:06.980
Sing, um, an angel named Wipper songman.

36:06.980 --> 36:09.980
Babbery.

36:09.980 --> 36:13.980
All alone in the dark.

36:13.980 --> 36:17.980
Ta-da-da-da-da.

36:17.980 --> 36:18.980
All right.

36:18.980 --> 36:20.980
Those were the words.

36:20.980 --> 36:21.980
You were close, sir.

36:21.980 --> 36:22.980
Whatever.

36:22.980 --> 36:24.980
I did think you started with mammary though.

36:24.980 --> 36:25.980
What?

36:25.980 --> 36:26.980
You did think one.

36:26.980 --> 36:28.980
I didn't like.

36:28.980 --> 36:31.980
I said I thought you started with mammary.

36:32.980 --> 36:33.980
Instead of mammary.

36:33.980 --> 36:35.980
And I do always do that.

36:35.980 --> 36:38.980
Hmm.

36:38.980 --> 36:40.980
Start with the mammaries.

36:40.980 --> 36:43.980
I hope, well, in my head, when I sing that song sometimes,

36:43.980 --> 36:44.980
you're going to have it's often.

36:44.980 --> 36:47.980
It's mammaries.

36:47.980 --> 36:49.980
Because I'm thinking of...

36:49.980 --> 36:50.980
Nevermind.

36:50.980 --> 36:51.980
Uh, all right.

36:51.980 --> 36:52.980
You're thinking of gusslies.

36:52.980 --> 36:53.980
I'm thinking of gusslies.

36:53.980 --> 36:54.980
Exactly, right.

36:56.980 --> 36:58.980
Vacky.

36:58.980 --> 36:59.980
Vacky.

36:59.980 --> 37:02.980
Spellinger.

37:02.980 --> 37:05.980
V-A-C-K-Y.

37:05.980 --> 37:08.980
It's like when someone doesn't pay their taxes.

37:08.980 --> 37:09.980
Oh, no, he's bad.

37:09.980 --> 37:10.980
All right, go.

37:10.980 --> 37:11.980
Um.

37:11.980 --> 37:14.980
I think it's when I business doesn't pay their taxes,

37:14.980 --> 37:16.980
and have to evacuate.

37:16.980 --> 37:18.980
The bill doesn't pay their taxes,

37:18.980 --> 37:20.980
and have to evacuate.

37:20.980 --> 37:22.980
The bill doesn't pay their taxes,

37:22.980 --> 37:24.980
and have to evacuate.

37:24.980 --> 37:27.980
The bill doesn't pay their taxes,

37:27.980 --> 37:28.980
and have to evacuate.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.980
It's the building.

37:30.980 --> 37:31.980
Emma?

37:31.980 --> 37:32.980
Sticky.

37:32.980 --> 37:33.980
Sticky.

37:33.980 --> 37:34.980
Um.

37:34.980 --> 37:37.980
Both Joel and Marieka were almost exactly right.

37:37.980 --> 37:39.980
It's just in a vacuumy.

37:39.980 --> 37:41.980
Which is such...

37:41.980 --> 37:42.980
Like...

37:42.980 --> 37:47.980
Irresponsible way of referring to someone who had to flee

37:47.980 --> 37:49.980
a life-threatening situation.

37:49.980 --> 37:51.980
Oh, they back eat.

37:51.980 --> 37:56.980
It's also too close to like vacate.

37:56.980 --> 38:01.980
There's a bunch of vacgies trying to vacate.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.980
Uh, all right.

38:03.980 --> 38:05.980
Another song I have to sing, I guess.

38:05.980 --> 38:06.980
Playboy Cardi song.

38:06.980 --> 38:09.980
I don't know any of his songs.

38:09.980 --> 38:11.980
A Britney Spears song.

38:11.980 --> 38:14.980
Um.

38:14.980 --> 38:17.980
Sing Lucky.

38:17.980 --> 38:22.980
Strong girl, then yesterday.

38:23.980 --> 38:27.980
Down to bed a dad never ran away.

38:27.980 --> 38:29.980
I love that song.

38:29.980 --> 38:30.980
Yeah.

38:30.980 --> 38:32.980
Jerk!

38:32.980 --> 38:33.980
J.A.R.K.

38:33.980 --> 38:34.980
Let's-

38:34.980 --> 38:35.980
This has been-

38:35.980 --> 38:37.980
Let's speed it up.

38:37.980 --> 38:39.980
It's because you guys are taking pregnant pauses.

38:39.980 --> 38:41.980
It's supposed to be like, first thought, best thought.

38:41.980 --> 38:43.980
You're going to-

38:43.980 --> 38:45.980
Jerk!

38:45.980 --> 38:47.980
It's a fucking...

38:47.980 --> 38:50.980
Joey and me.

38:50.980 --> 38:54.580
They chimmy shark, like shark sprinkles.

38:54.580 --> 39:00.780
I said a jumpy shark, like a shark that jumps out of the ocean like a dolphin.

39:00.780 --> 39:07.580
All right, shark, it's like when a dog's teeth get really overgrown and scary.

39:07.580 --> 39:08.580
Okay.

39:08.580 --> 39:12.780
It's like a joke, but if you're Australian, and you don't know how to do it.

39:12.780 --> 39:13.780
All right.

39:13.780 --> 39:14.780
That's pretty good.

39:14.780 --> 39:17.980
No, it's a killer insignia on a counterfeit document.

39:17.980 --> 39:18.980
Whoa.

39:18.980 --> 39:21.180
Did it.

39:21.180 --> 39:23.180
G-I-D.

39:23.180 --> 39:24.180
Did.

39:24.180 --> 39:29.620
Um, get a lot of care from this outfit.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.900
What'd you say?

39:31.900 --> 39:33.900
I said laugh.

39:33.900 --> 39:34.900
Okay.

39:34.900 --> 39:38.380
I said, like, get, like, a command, like, get, but if you're from this outfit.

39:38.380 --> 39:41.860
To move swiftly, verb.

39:41.860 --> 39:42.860
It's brain disease.

39:42.860 --> 39:45.100
It's a brain disease suffered by sheep.

39:46.100 --> 39:49.100
Ode.

39:49.100 --> 39:50.100
O-D.

39:54.100 --> 40:03.900
Um, let's go with a short,

40:03.900 --> 40:07.100
in the way of saying odometer.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.100
Uh, a tornado.

40:15.100 --> 40:17.100
A stand-up guy.

40:17.100 --> 40:22.100
It's actually a mild oath.

40:22.100 --> 40:25.100
So it's something you're not sure if you're going to keep.

40:25.100 --> 40:27.100
Yeah, like why there shouldn't be a word for that.

40:27.100 --> 40:29.100
And if there is going to be a word for that.

40:29.100 --> 40:31.100
Why is it Ode?

40:45.100 --> 40:54.100
Short and sweet in and out.

40:54.100 --> 40:57.100
That was all we had.

40:57.100 --> 40:59.100
Um, do you guys have any other points to make?

40:59.100 --> 41:01.100
Anything else you want to say?

41:01.100 --> 41:02.100
We can wax for a bit.

41:02.100 --> 41:04.100
And then go ahead.

41:04.100 --> 41:05.100
And then go ahead.

41:05.100 --> 41:06.100
Short and sweet.

41:06.100 --> 41:07.100
In and out.

41:07.100 --> 41:09.100
That was all we had.

41:09.100 --> 41:12.100
Um, do you guys have any other points to make?

41:12.100 --> 41:13.100
Anything else you want to say?

41:13.100 --> 41:14.100
We can wax for a bit.

41:14.100 --> 41:17.100
And then go to plugs or we can go to plugs and see what happens.

41:17.100 --> 41:24.100
Um, I don't have any closing thoughts.

41:24.100 --> 41:30.100
I can't believe you thought Zither was a weird word.

41:30.100 --> 41:32.100
I don't think if you, if you were on this episode,

41:32.100 --> 41:34.100
no one would have known what that was.

41:34.100 --> 41:37.100
I believe.

41:37.100 --> 41:39.100
I believe this.

41:39.100 --> 41:42.100
I think he says an open hammer.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.100
No.

41:43.100 --> 41:44.100
It's good, right?

41:44.100 --> 41:45.100
It's good.

41:45.100 --> 41:50.100
If I want to get married, I just need to reference more movies.

41:50.100 --> 41:51.100
No.

41:51.100 --> 41:55.100
It was honestly like the fact that I'm a reference something and up at

41:55.100 --> 42:00.100
Hymer after seeing it with us after not lining to see it with us because

42:00.100 --> 42:02.100
she didn't know what it was.

42:02.100 --> 42:04.100
It was the whole backstory of it.

42:04.100 --> 42:05.100
So I have no chance.

42:05.100 --> 42:06.100
Got it.

42:06.100 --> 42:07.100
Yeah.

42:07.100 --> 42:08.100
All right, plugs.

42:08.100 --> 42:13.100
What do you guys have going on?

42:13.100 --> 42:19.100
Let's fucking, let's get, let's get out of here.

42:19.100 --> 42:21.100
Joel.

42:21.100 --> 42:23.100
Uh, texting in the next 24 hours.

42:23.100 --> 42:26.100
What I should do in Denver for a night.

42:26.100 --> 42:28.100
Do you want to share your number?

42:28.100 --> 42:31.100
This episode is going up for weeks.

42:32.100 --> 42:35.100
Right.

42:35.100 --> 42:36.100
You can.

42:36.100 --> 42:39.100

42:39.100 --> 42:43.100
Just text me honestly.

42:51.100 --> 42:52.100
Nice.

42:52.100 --> 42:58.100

And let's start getting some buzz about a headgun podcast live show going on.

43:26.100 --> 43:27.100
Um, online.

43:27.100 --> 43:30.100
Let's start sending some, uh, some emails to.

43:30.100 --> 43:32.100
That come to me.

43:32.100 --> 43:34.100
Well, that come and, uh, start demanding it.

43:34.100 --> 43:35.100
Right.

43:35.100 --> 43:36.100
We're, uh, looking at the mirror area.

43:36.100 --> 43:37.100
We're really scary.

43:37.100 --> 43:38.100
Melt.

43:38.100 --> 43:39.100
Yeah.

43:39.100 --> 43:40.100
Let's start threatening people's lives until it happens.

43:40.100 --> 43:42.100
That's maybe the only way we'll get it.

43:42.100 --> 43:43.100
Push it across the finish line.

43:43.100 --> 43:44.100
And, um, yeah.

43:44.100 --> 43:45.100
Looking forward.

43:47.100 --> 43:49.100
That's Daw's folks.

43:49.100 --> 43:50.100
Classic.

43:50.100 --> 44:08.100
That was a hit-dum original.

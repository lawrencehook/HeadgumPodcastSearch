00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head gum original.

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
Nope.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Hello?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Yeah.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Good.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
You did.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
I've never done this.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Is.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
I've never done this.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Okay.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Thanks.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Thank you.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
Please, now.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
No.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
This is never happened before.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Oops.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
All producer.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Yeah.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Wow.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Everybody.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Everybody.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Get to it.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Get stole from my.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Get started.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Get started.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Get started.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Get started.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Oh.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
The first edit of that song or the second.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
What was that?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Was that the first edit of that song or the second?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
I'm here.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
What?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Help me out.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
None of these.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
I don't understand the question.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Um.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
The original version of that song.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Sure.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Oh.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
I understand the question.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
And.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Okay.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
So you're like inching out of frame here.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Well, you're.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
So Jeffrey.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
You're going to get up and adjust the camera.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
No, just like if you could turn your body.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Exactly.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
If I'm sitting over there.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I would adjust the camera.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
But so you want me to sit.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
No.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
I'll do what you did.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
This is like some sort of lackey Wednesday where Jeff is producing a show.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
I think we started.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Yeah.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Yeah.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Yeah.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
We started.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
And then the.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Don't move it.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
The producer.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Right off the bat.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
All right.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
You look great.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Um.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
No.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
I mean, we listen.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
I don't want to be rude to anyone here.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Because everyone here works hard on the show except for a mirror.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
But, you know, there's been obvious laps and judgments, slaps and time.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
And I figured I might as well just take over the reigns of producing.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Got it.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Um.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
And then get all three of the producers, which we're only going to get to.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
But now we have all three.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
So this is perfect.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Um.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
In the room on the zoom.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
I don't know.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Maybe create more sympathy for each other, right?

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
To see for y'all to see how hard it is to be taking the reigns of hosting.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
And for me to see how.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I mean, maybe hard it is to produce.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
But I don't know.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
I feel like I can live at it.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Like, look at that.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
That was so easy.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
And it's such like something.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
What's that?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
So couples counts.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
I pressed the wrong button.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
I went to like the foreshot when I met to do.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Yeah.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
So get it on me.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Yeah.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
And then I can even shoot it on to me.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Right?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Cause there I am.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
And I say this is like something.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
A couple's counselor told you to do like to understand the other person's plight.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
So like now you're going to be more.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Sympathetic towards the engineers and producers that make the show.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Hopefully.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Sure.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
And hopefully vice versa, right?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Well.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
I mean, I host to show every week and release it and like do all the editing.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
And I also do that.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
I'm like a number of other shows.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
So you both.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
I'm not learning much.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
And you and you wear many hats.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Yeah.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
And why do you in.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Is it because you guys are deaths on the show a lot?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Is that what you're saying?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I can't even see Casey.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Yeah.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
You couldn't move.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
You can move over a little bit.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Yeah.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Yeah.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
You got it.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Yeah.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Sorry.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Who should introduce everybody?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Cause I feel like you're still the host.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Are you the host?

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
Or you should introduce Grace Harper at Charles Borkley to the show.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
All the way from down under.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
And yeah.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
So Grace, you want to tell us a little bit about what you do on the show.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
You're basically the new Ferris.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Sure.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
How did that come about?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
How did what come about?

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
How did Grace become your defacto.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Engineer slash editor.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Well, you didn't have a chance to speak.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Right.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
I said, sure.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
That's all you care to say.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Yeah.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
That's a compliment.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
He's a hard worker, nice guy.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Jeff is?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
No.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Ferris is.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
I took over.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
No.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
No.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
No.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
No.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
I don't know.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
We had Ferris.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
And then he.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
I think quit.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
And then did Ferris train you?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
But to do this job?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
No.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
So how did you?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
No.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Cause then great.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Yeah.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Then Grace and Wise took over.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Right.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
From Grace and to Grace.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Yeah.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Did Grace and.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
What's that?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Tall.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Do you like what I want to know?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Are you asking me?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Yeah.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Are you asking Grace?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Cause you're looking at me and then at the very land.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
You look at Grace.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Like, let's see, like, ask Grace and other questions.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Really.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
But you'll be a host.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
And is that kind of difficult for conversation?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Is that your thing?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
I don't know.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
How does that look for camera?

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Not good.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
You guys are at, like, the opposite ends of frame.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Like, I almost have to go back to the foreshot.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
And that's a little bit better.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Are you for share recording?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
I'm both.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Ah, yes.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Okay.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Yeah.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Looks like videos recording.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
But I can't speak for audio.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Audio is, oh.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Oh.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
No.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
It is real.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
It is real.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
It is real.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
It is real.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
We're good.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Well, we should say, okay.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
So let's just lay out what everybody does on the phone.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Well, so from my perspective, I got an email.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Okay.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
That's true.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Okay.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
That's true.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Okay.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
That's true.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Okay.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
That's true.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Okay.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
That's true.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
This is actually the, this might be the most recent show I've taken on.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
That's true.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
And then how did you reach out to us?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Well, it's funny because Chris was working on it.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Yeah.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Yeah.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
With what?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Like, you emailed Katie out of the blue.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
You applied for freelance job.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
I applied for it.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
No, the engineer job in December 2021.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Well, high to the pandemic.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
And you were at the UK.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Tail end.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
I don't know.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Everybody was back.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Yeah.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
That's fine.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
You were still in the UK.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Yeah.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
And you were like, I can move places or I can do it remotely.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
And where you're wondering if, yeah, you were still in the UK?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
No.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
I was applying to the job to be here or the new year of the studio.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
It seems sort of, um, non-specific.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Yeah.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
And then the, uh, had three rounds of interviews.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Wow.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
And then.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Too many.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Didn't really get the job.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Um, but was told we'd like to keep you one as a freelancer as well.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
I've been freelancing since.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
And so here we are.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
What other shows have you worked on besides the Hedgehog podcast?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Oh, I look on.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Mazeal Goys.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Oh, wow.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Um, when it.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Retop.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Well, when it returned.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
TBD.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Um, nice cut that out.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
That's okay.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Oh, like, yeah.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
I could cut anything.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Um, goes on points.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Sit on the indie.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
This show and twin evasion.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
And is the process for this show?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Does it.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Is it more unique than the other shows?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Does it stand out to you?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
No.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Are you getting like, or does it just feel like another podcast?

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
It is slightly different in the, um,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
because Jeff has already mixed everything to video.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I have to local the audio and time.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Um, sort of a just.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
And would you say the emails that you get from Jeff are at a normal business.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Our kind of frantically sent in the middle of the night.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
But maybe that's fine because it's sort of London.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
I feel like this is usually where our producer steps in and just says,

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
like, let's keep things on track.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Let's keep things joyful.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Yeah.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Yeah.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Just two that was on the board.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
The issue I had more with Jeff's communication is that.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
No, because I wanted to talk about Jeff's.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Yeah.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
And I wanted to talk about, yeah.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Right.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Like fleeting.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Yes.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Exactly.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
It's possible to be available and then he's unavailable.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Yeah.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Right. Like where did he go?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
He has a smartphone.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
And we're seeing on the screen right now.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
But on the case, he aren't even trying to get a word in that dress.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Well, I think they want your serious selection.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Yeah.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
This is between you guys.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
We're kind of staying out of it.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Although I have a question.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
It wasn't one of your interviews with the mayor.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Yeah.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Was it with me and Jay?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Wow.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Cool.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
So how was that?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Good.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
It happened.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
So I had an interview with K.E.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
And then a week later, I had an interview with Mike.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Come a day.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Great.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Who was leaving and was very candid.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
He was on.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Tell us about his order.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Oh, he was straight up like asked me about salary.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
I'll tell you.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Yeah.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
That's why we had to fire my camera.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Where's my camera?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Whoa, our cans just got louder.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Jeffery, was that you?

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
I, I, I, I, I, I do your fucking job.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
I, I, I, I, I.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
We're not on a ship, man.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
So messed up.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
No, I don't know.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
I have to, I have to sort of be forceful with Jeff some time.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
So a mirror heard people talking about salary at the car.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Oh, yeah.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Yeah.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
I'm not a freelancer.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Sorry.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
How much did a comment say?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Wait.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Wait.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Because he's a fucking like son of a boy.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
I want to know what a mirror was like in the interview.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
In the zoom room.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Um.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Fine.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
I was, so I had to have the next day.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Asked it answered.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
That's fine.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
That's fine.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
That's the nicest thing you could say.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
If you think about it.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Because usually it's like nasty stuff over zoom.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
So fine.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
It's considered like fine.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
It's great.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Fine.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Well, he did.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Um, he was momentarily mean to me.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
But I did deserve it.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
And I don't wish.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
This is how I'm here.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I can't believe it.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Well, I just said I used to listen to.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
If I leave.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
And now.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Did don't we all.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Yes.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
You were sort of ahead of the curve.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Yeah.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Yeah.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
You used to cancel this before we canceled.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I knew the pain was coming.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
And I was like, oh, oh, quit this.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
And was my reaction sort of over the top.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
Jokey anger or was, did you actually feel like I had higher towards you?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Because he used to listen to the show.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
But you don't anymore.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Well, I thought I don't mean to butt in here.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Because that's not really a producer's job.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
But um, you were saying that you felt like if you were not in the zoom, but in the room,

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
that you would have felt physically in danger.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
I wouldn't do that by the way.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Do what?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
I wouldn't have said that much stuff.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Okay.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Yeah.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Yeah.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
But I also use a friend.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Well, we should also say that you guys are like missing tons of opportunities

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
to like interrupt their conversation.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Like force your agenda through.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
You're not like letting live like giving notes.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Like I would have hit one of those.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I would have done like, uh, I don't know.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Word of the week.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
We already said head gum.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
That was the day.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
We don't have.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
We keep leading grace to answers, and then we never hear what the answers are.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Like the communication with Jeff.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
We never really heard about that.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Yeah.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
What I said about you not listening to that.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
If I were you anymore, we didn't hear about that either.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
And why do you think that is?

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Because you sort of interrupt the rail side track, the entire conversation.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
All right.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Yeah.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
I can tell you exactly how you reacted.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
And I'd like to know what you think of your reaction.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Okay.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Which is it.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
You put your thumb over your camera.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
So you could no longer see me.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Uh-huh.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
So you're like, I don't listen to the show anymore.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
And then I put my thumb over the camera.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Yeah.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
That's like a, that's like a Shakespearean insult.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Oh, yeah.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Shakespeare hated Zoom famously.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I thought Grace was going to say you were going to.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Yeah.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Okay.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
I think you're sitting down.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
I think that's why we get a higher.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I thought Grace was going to like during the interview.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Yeah.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
During the interview.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
I can't play here.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
You're saying man.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
I think, I think Jeff was just saying what I just said.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah, but I'm about to edit this right after.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
So I was going to maybe like, because I kind of noticed the case.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
He said that.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
You know, like, that's kind of funny.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Yeah.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
So why don't I say it on my camera.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
And I can choose later.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Who I want to have said that.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
So Grace is responsible for that.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
I think right.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
That's true.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
For the video version, it's all on him.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
But for the audio only, the podcast version.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Hmm.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Interesting.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
I'll do whatever everyone.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Yeah.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
So tell me again about the communication style.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
You're saying you hear from Jeff a lot.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
And then he disappears vanishes for days.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
No, no.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
I rarely hear from him.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
I hear from him once a week.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
If that with the episode files.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Hmm.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Sometimes.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Two, three weeks.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
We'll absolutely nothing.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Not funny.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
But okay.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
In Jeff's defense.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
You like that?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Great.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
They have a four.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
I say what I'm going to say.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I just take the cup.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I think I like about Jeff.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
If there was a thing.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
It would be that when he doesn't.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
It's not like that the episode doesn't go up.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
Like he could send everything to you and make his life easier.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
Instead, he stays up all night editing himself because he forgot to send it to him

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
in time.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
So he's suffering for the first.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Got it.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Yeah.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Which I think is nice.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
It is.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
It's very strange and admirable.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
It's like a professional model.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
This even this episode for.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
But like also.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
It's a Wednesday.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
It's going up on.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Right.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Yeah.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
And because also it like deprives me of money.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Right.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
He's taking money out of your pot.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
So.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Well, not necessarily.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Right.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Because like you're going to edit the assembly files after this.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Hmm.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
But those were the things that you don't send it to grace.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
That is money that you're taking from her pocket and putting it to yours.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Interesting.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Interesting.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Should we take a break?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
It's only been 13 minutes.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
We have a ton of stuff to get to that we haven't even touched it.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Because we've been like in this weird dumbass setup.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
And I don't even know like because I'm trying to get an word in touch.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Casey hasn't said jack other than like fixing thing.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
I had a pretty funny joke of like me giving it.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Right.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
That's what they'll be seeing.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
They'll be probably the same social thing.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Yeah.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Very good.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
I feel like I never noticed how low these arms are.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Yeah.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Strange being on this side.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Yeah.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
That's what I'm saying.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
That's what the whole thing is about.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Right.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Because I have this camera staring at what the whole thing is about.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
It's about us testing out the chair.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
We're sort of auditing the room.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
We're doing it all the way.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
And I'll start it.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
In a way.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
But it's very low key.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
You know, it's.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
What was that?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Somebody was leaving or coming.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Oh, yeah.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
We should also say.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
People are doing it.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Constructions happening as we specifically on this room.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
The studio is outer walls.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
There will be a whole being made in this one.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Are you kidding me?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Some one.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
I'm real.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Should be coming through the wall.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
And you're somewhere around.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
It's a wall near you.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Yeah.

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
We're just going to have to put the wire through your heart.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I mean, we got to get in here somehow.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
That would.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Bond of the week.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Who do you guys got?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
My pick is Matthew McFaden.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
It's a good one.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
So is the audio definitely loud by the time you get it or does Jeff sort of adjust that before you?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
No, absolutely.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
No, it's a hundred percent.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
That loud.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Yes, a hundred percent.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
He has it up at a hundred.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Hold on a second.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Yeah, because I might lose the level sometimes.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
So that's not necessarily the sound effects fault.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Just that we're really quiet.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
And then the sound effects were so loud.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I wonder if that's something that you do in poster.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
If that's a grace response.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Bond of the week.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
The bum drop one is also really loud.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
How do you figure?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
It's all loud.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
You figure.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Yeah, but then it's usually followed by a clap.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
You know, which I think is usually fine.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Yeah.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
The claps are fine.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Also, which one?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Some of the other ones are all right.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I will eat your ass.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
It's not too loud.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
My bond of the week is pasta.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
This Bostonian hockey player that was eliminated recently.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
So he has plenty of freedom on his hand.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
I think his name is something pastor and actor, something.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
But pasta isn't easy.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Why did you bring it though?

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
I'm just saying he's a hard week for me.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
He's making it worse.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
He's a bruiser and an abuser.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
He doesn't have to eat.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
He doesn't have to eat.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
With the tart.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
I don't.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
I never know.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
It's hard to edit the show when everybody is so slow in their town.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Oh, when they're talking.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I know who's been said in the second time.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
I said this all the time for.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
That we should hear it.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Oh, we should hear it.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
We should hear it.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
So I'm doing it right now.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
So that we don't have to edit the pasta later.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
For a bond of the week is Matthew McConaughey.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
That's pretty good.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Two Matthew is actually on your way.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Matthew, Matthew, Max actually.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Oh, interesting.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Yeah.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
I don't think you can say the second word.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Matthew, make a...

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Chronicle.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Is there another famous?

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Um, I'm a comedian.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
McModene.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Yeah.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Matt McDonnell.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
Like am I supposed to stay calm when you guys are spewing shit that I know I'm going

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
to have to cut out later?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Yeah.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I also want to say...

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
I just meant...

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
I just meant...

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
I just meant...

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
When I talk.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
It's ridiculous.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
I didn't realize that was where the slur came from till right now.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Oh, yeah.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
I think I said...

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I was saying like, oh, they have the same last name.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Yeah, MC.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
I'm going to get fired.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
That's okay.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Am I going to get fired?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I think we're all learning.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
I think no one should be scared until I get fired.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Well, slur.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
What's that for real?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Well, let's slur.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Are you talking about that?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I mean, great.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
A derogatory term for an Irish person, I think.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
I don't mean to say.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Yeah.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
That from the last name.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Isn't that a show?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I think I think it because there's a lot of mix.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Well, sort of like, shrill.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
You know, like you wouldn't actually say that about somebody.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Yeah.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
And then if you did, you'd be about a person.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
But it's a great show name.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Shrill?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
What's that?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Nothing.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Thank you.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Um.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Um.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Mine is our, um.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
Our contractor who scheduled this construction at the same time as the heavy

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
on podcasts.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
That's pretty good.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
I'm sure he did not know that we were recording the head gun podcast.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
He's a big thing.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
While he was putting a hole in the wall of the studio.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Yeah.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
I'm sure of that.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Do you guys think that when contractors make a hole in the wall and, you know,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
they maybe like dress up like a pirate and they're like,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
a hole.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Sorry.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
No.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
You should cut that out.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
I can't get it.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Well, Casey, do you mind if you, could you say it?

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
So that it sounds like you made this stupid joke?

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
Just mouth it and help with his voice.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
When you think, when you guys think a contractor puts a hole in the wall,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
do they dress up like a pirate and go,

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
a hole.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Why does he work?

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
That came out of nowhere.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
That's really funny.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
But I'm not reacting to anyone.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Sorry.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
On you.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I already said mine.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Oh, you?

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
I just said it.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
It sounded like you were trying to say something else.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Oh, yeah.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Oh, yeah.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Right.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
I had some.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
It's fine.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Not one of the weakest Austin powers.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
That's pretty good.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
I like that.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
I just rewatched that phrase.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Which one?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
The first one.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Is it good?

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Then it holds up.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I heard you wrote it in four or five days or something.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
That also tracks.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Yeah.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
You guys ever have like panic attacks.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Or it feels like you're about to have a heart attack.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
You're like Googling like the actual symptoms of like pre-hard attack.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Right.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Like chest attack.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Pre-hard attack.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
On your left side, if you're, you know, prone to that kind of thing.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Yeah.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Yeah.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
I also think we should give Austin powers an emotional send up.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Like kill the character off.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Because I don't think you can, I don't think they can bring him back.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Oh, I think.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Like I think they could disagree.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Make Austin powers maybe now.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Yeah.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
I'm saying they shouldn't.

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
They should make a serious movie with he dies.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
I like that.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Like Austin powers skyfall.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Yeah.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
It's kind of like a full circle moment.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Have you guys ever had a moment?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
I'm new me.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
God is.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
God is.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
God is.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I'm a mermaid moment.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
What do you say?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
I'm like a little mermaid.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Are you a little mermaid?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
I'm a little mermaid.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Dye your hair red.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
And walk down to the street.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Shirtless.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
At first.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Carrying a fish.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
She's not sure.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
She hasn't seen show, bro.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Oh, yeah.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Put on a sea shell, bro.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Bro.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Pantsless.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
She wears gills.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Really?

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
She wears them.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
She has them.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
I was just going to say, have you guys ever had a moment in surgery,

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
where you maybe saw the other side?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Uh.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
I did have a medical procedure where I could see my insides.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Wow.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
While you were awake.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Take a break.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
I was.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
What?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
What?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
What?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
What?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
What?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
What?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Say it then.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
What?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Say the interesting bullshit.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
It was a surgery where she saw her insides.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
It wasn't surgery.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
It was a.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
And Noscopy.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Oh, I see.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Look at her camera.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
You saw the.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
What was that?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Why were they showing it to you?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Are you.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
I would want to say.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
No, they would want to say.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
No, they would want to say.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
No, they would want to say.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
No, they would want to say.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
No, they would want to say.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
No, they would say.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
They would.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
What's cousin?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
The UK.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
They've CCTV everywhere.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Yeah.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I feel like whatever is on the screen would only be interesting.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
The camera.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
I don't know.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
That goes through your mouth, right?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Yeah.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
But they did also put it up the other end too.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Wow.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
I'm going to see what's up there.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
What a plan.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
What a plan.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
What a plan.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
What a plan.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
What was that?

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
Did you just start to introduce a segment and then bail on it?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Casey, have you ever had a colonoscopy?

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
No.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Okay.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Probably.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Probably should get one.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
I'm here.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
About my.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Also know, but yeah, getting to that age.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
I think in your 40s you're supposed to start getting them.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Yeah.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
You guys both in your 40s?

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
No, I got a few years.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
But I was after drinking a few beers.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Yeah.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
It's not me if this is too personal.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Have any of you guys ever had an abnormal path?

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Jeff.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
I'm just trying to get to the bottom of shit.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
The boys have path?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
No.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
That's the worst part.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Yeah.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
That's why it's inappropriate.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
Um.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Yeah.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
There's no way.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
There's no way.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
Who's the last time you guys had to dress black tie?

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Fuck off.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
I don't think I never had like maybe a wedding.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Yeah.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
But like getting out of somewhere.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Or black tie dress code.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
I'm pretty sure.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Would you do bolo?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
I do.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
I do bolo.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Of course you do bolo.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
I do bolo kinds of societal norms in terms of evening wear in terms of...

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
I'm a disruptor.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Yeah.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
You and the rest of stuff.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Yeah.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Yeah.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yeah.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Yeah.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Yeah.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Yeah.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Yeah.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Yeah.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Yeah.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Yeah.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Yeah.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Yeah.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Yeah.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Yeah.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Yeah.

22:28.000 --> 22:28.500
Yeah.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.500
I did right before we started recording this.

22:30.500 --> 22:34.500
I ran out of the studio because I saw a friend of mine walking down the street.

22:34.500 --> 22:35.500
Who looks like me.

22:35.500 --> 22:38.500
So we could say hi and then talk.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.500
Bring them in.

22:40.500 --> 22:41.500
Um.

22:41.500 --> 22:42.500
I think he's gone.

22:42.500 --> 22:43.500
No.

22:43.500 --> 22:44.500
But.

22:44.500 --> 22:45.500
I've never been cool.

22:45.500 --> 22:46.500
I've never been.

22:46.500 --> 22:47.500
Sorry.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.500
He's never been here.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.500
No.

22:49.500 --> 22:50.500
What's that, Jeff?

22:50.500 --> 22:51.500
Can you say that?

22:51.500 --> 22:52.500
Just sentence again.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.500
Because you had a little bit of a lip smack.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.500
And it's going to be tough for that.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.500
Which sentence?

22:57.500 --> 22:58.500
Yeah.

22:58.500 --> 22:59.500
I don't know if you care about that.

22:59.500 --> 23:00.500
Yeah.

23:00.500 --> 23:01.500
So just if you could like.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.500
Okay.

23:02.500 --> 23:03.500
From the moment you saw something.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.500
Like when some garbage and then you're picking this knit.

23:05.500 --> 23:06.500
Okay.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.500
I'll try and recreate the magic.

23:08.500 --> 23:09.500
Um.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.500
I also cut these out.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.500
You cut out lip smacks.

23:12.500 --> 23:13.500
Yeah.

23:13.500 --> 23:14.500
What is that even like to look?

23:14.500 --> 23:15.500
Someone who goes like that.

23:15.500 --> 23:16.500
No.

23:16.500 --> 23:17.500
No.

23:17.500 --> 23:18.500
It's like when somebody goes like that.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.500
Why is that bad?

23:19.500 --> 23:20.500
That noise.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.500
Yeah.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.500
Just go straight.

23:22.500 --> 23:23.500
I don't know.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.500
I don't know why you guys think I'm bad.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.500
But I deal with.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.500
There's no human lips smack.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.500
Are there usually games?

23:31.500 --> 23:34.500
Uh, we have discussion points later, not necessarily.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.500
I've got that even in the outline.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.500
Yeah.

23:39.500 --> 23:40.500
Yeah.

23:40.500 --> 23:41.500
Yeah.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.500
I'll do it again, uh, I'm glad we're getting a clean.

23:44.500 --> 23:49.500
Right before we started recording right before I want to get inside.

23:49.500 --> 23:52.500
No, we ran outside to say hi, and we look.

23:52.500 --> 23:57.300
Very similar, almost the same outfit actually and uh, why don't you bring it up?

23:59.780 --> 24:05.780
Is that real? Do I need to do it again? Sorry. Yeah, I'm I'm really sorry about that. Can you do that again?

24:05.780 --> 24:12.340
I'm sure this Mike did not pick up that sneeze. I just you're I think I saw I mean just so we're we have it. All right

24:13.220 --> 24:19.300
So right before we started recording I saw my friend walking by the window and I ran outside to say hi to him

24:20.100 --> 24:22.100
And we actually look very similar

24:23.060 --> 24:29.220
Very similar outfits on now everyone looks mad that I'm I'm doing this, but I'm just trying to make the best

24:30.340 --> 24:32.340
Show possible

24:32.340 --> 24:37.780
on his phone Jeff is on his phone. What was that? It was TikTok. I just I thought it was on you

24:44.180 --> 24:48.100
I think we got it there. Okay, great. I don't know I'd even just use the other Frankenstein it

24:48.580 --> 24:52.900
Well, it might be easier to get the lips smack out than to try and Frankenstein anything

24:54.180 --> 25:00.100
I just don't need you have to hear that again. Just so people are like like getting a little smarter and in terms of post-production

25:00.100 --> 25:03.060
What can you sort of explain or frank in signing means?

25:03.620 --> 25:07.540
Um, I don't know if that's the best use of our time. I'm really in like 21 minutes

25:08.500 --> 25:14.180
Drinking signing would be like I don't know people know the concept of ADR which they call automated dialogue replacement

25:14.260 --> 25:16.980
Which is not even true because it's not automated. You have to

25:17.540 --> 25:19.540
It's additional. Yeah, so we have to say

25:20.180 --> 25:25.700
So it's not actually doesn't say I'm proud. I made it something. No, yeah, yeah, it doesn't stand for automated. That was a test

25:26.820 --> 25:30.900
Grace didn't say anything which is kind of interesting because she is sort of our post supervisor on the show

25:31.460 --> 25:35.540
An audio engineer for the road slash ages. Did you call left to you a friend?

25:36.260 --> 25:39.220
Yeah, I called after I'm gonna run. We're on it. You heard it. Oh

25:40.180 --> 25:43.620
It's like that said Morgan. He's never been here. He just like walks by

25:44.500 --> 25:50.740
I mean, yeah, he's never I don't think he's ever been in the studio, but he did just direct a feature film

25:51.460 --> 25:57.380
Featuring some had come talent Mike Mitchell John Gabriel. Oh, yes. I remember you talking about yeah

25:57.380 --> 26:01.940
Those guys being in your friends movie. Yeah, and that was the friend that I saw outside the window

26:01.940 --> 26:04.660
Get him in here. I wonder where he was headed. Okay. Oh

26:05.620 --> 26:12.660
Well, he was wearing a WGA shirt. I think he was I was on his way to or from picketing. Finally

26:13.540 --> 26:19.300
A normal fucking segue. Let's talk about the WGA strike. Right. How does that affect what we do here?

26:19.860 --> 26:24.180
And vice versa. Oh, I think business is gonna be booming. It's good for us because now all these

26:25.300 --> 26:28.980
Yeah, they're they're not waiting. They're gonna come here

26:29.540 --> 26:34.020
Amazon's got extra cannot going to be speaking unscripted word exactly

26:34.100 --> 26:39.620
So we're not necessarily part of that union. We're not scabs. We're just giving people a secondary revenue stream

26:39.620 --> 26:41.140
Yeah, honestly

26:41.380 --> 26:47.780
Better than protesting. I want to say I think the studio should be scared. Yes, the charts are like this exactly

26:49.380 --> 26:50.740
Sick

26:50.740 --> 26:52.740
Did you just start playing Pink Floyd?

26:52.740 --> 26:55.860
Yeah, so this is like what I imagine like I don't know

26:56.340 --> 27:02.340
Yes, today morning. Yeah, this morning was co-in walking in with sunglasses to the tune of this song snap

27:02.340 --> 27:04.340
I'm gonna let her jacket. Yeah

27:05.540 --> 27:11.220
Right and up from the cowboy boots up. Yeah, it's now dick out by accident. Yes. Yeah

27:15.380 --> 27:21.780
Well, that's good. I didn't think about that. Hopefully hopefully I can see some of that fucking cash, but yeah, um anyway

27:24.260 --> 27:28.900
The whole fucking industry's grinding to a halt. Yeah, and I guess there are other unions

27:28.900 --> 27:32.100
Yeah, I guess the DGA you know might follow suit

27:32.660 --> 27:34.500
I'll be interesting. What's interesting about

27:34.500 --> 27:40.500
We're pro union. No, I don't know not where but there's no podcast union you guys haven't really tried to move the needle there in any way

27:40.980 --> 27:43.300
Would you like do you look hold a company right here?

27:45.780 --> 27:50.820
So let's fucking figure the union is right now and front of the mirror. Let's let's start the idea

27:51.060 --> 27:54.740
Let's start the election. Can you join? I'm legally a producer

27:55.460 --> 28:01.300
No, you're not a mere can join, but Marty can't oh, that's great. Yeah, so we would sue Marty or something

28:01.300 --> 28:03.300
Yeah, yeah, that's what unions

28:03.540 --> 28:08.660
Yeah, what do you mean think that an hour a fair hourly rate for a producer would be? Oh, 40

28:09.540 --> 28:11.540
40

28:11.540 --> 28:12.580
40

28:12.580 --> 28:14.580
He just had 40

28:14.580 --> 28:16.580
Pretty fucking friends

28:16.580 --> 28:18.580
40 pregnant Frank furters

28:18.980 --> 28:20.980
Frosted in a pie

28:21.940 --> 28:23.940
That was not a liberation

28:25.220 --> 28:30.660
I think I think probably base rate would be like a hundred and fifty dollars base base base for sure

28:30.660 --> 28:34.340
Yeah, yeah, and all your base for belong to us. I mean how much do we pay you grace?

28:34.900 --> 28:35.940
base

28:35.940 --> 28:43.300
Boy solidarity. Let's hear a grace. I'm I'm legally allowed to ask just a pay raise two days ago to what say it specifically

28:43.380 --> 28:46.020
It might be higher than Jeff, so if you want yeah, are you

28:46.500 --> 28:52.100
Willing and able to hear the number if I didn't do offended? What if it's if it's less I'm gonna feel worse

28:52.100 --> 28:57.140
Yeah, so you want it to be equal or more if I don't say what I make in comparison to what she makes

28:57.140 --> 29:01.540
It'll be because I get more okay. I just put a zoom Katie. Yeah, let's do this

29:01.540 --> 29:06.980
Because she might not want that number out there. Yeah, and we can kind of just Katie make Katie

29:06.980 --> 29:12.740
I think she's making what 160 that salary base that salary base before bonuses before you know

29:12.740 --> 29:18.180
Jeff what Katie is making. Oh employees solidarity. I get drinks with people just to know

29:18.180 --> 29:20.180
So that's Mark. He makes up

29:22.180 --> 29:24.180
Just so I can get bad at people

29:25.140 --> 29:27.140
Well Katie's making up

29:29.780 --> 29:32.820
Oh, she just got her right. It's gone up since the last time I looked

29:33.140 --> 29:38.100
It's hard until leave but I can't get a fucking leaf. I saw I think Marty love yeah

29:38.740 --> 29:44.180
Which is actually great. What are you getting 55 an hour? You don't have to answer that you don't have to answer that

29:44.180 --> 29:49.060
I can't say that because I know it's not it's not 55 an hour if you get paid an American can you five

29:49.060 --> 29:54.660
It's sort of is it a insulate it on a big 40-year-old lady that over. Yeah, I was that work with the exchange rate

29:54.980 --> 29:57.780
And when was the last time yeah, sorry you considered

29:58.740 --> 30:00.980
You'd be making a purchase that was outside Jeff usually

30:02.020 --> 30:04.820
If I could give you a note as a producer yeah

30:05.380 --> 30:10.580
You usually you let the people on the couch kind of do the talk in right? And then we you

30:10.580 --> 30:14.660
And we want to hear from you. We'll throw to you exactly all right, so do you want to try that

30:14.660 --> 30:18.740
Grim and I love that you're like in the room and you're additive, but you're not necessarily looking

30:18.740 --> 30:20.740
You're not looking forward to like yeah

30:24.740 --> 30:31.540
It honestly feels like you're talking more now than ever before like if you're on that cherry you'd be talking a lot

30:31.780 --> 30:35.780
Let's hear from Jeff. Not having the lights on him is like he's sweating

30:38.100 --> 30:40.180
Which again, it's usually the opposite

30:40.180 --> 30:44.420
It's hot in the dark. Let's hear from Grace. It was a question. How much money do you make an answer?

30:45.700 --> 30:51.060
Before I move past that and now you keep like dry and I follow a question what about other networks?

30:51.060 --> 30:55.460
Yeah, oh, do you freelance or radio is 50 an hour according to Dan that was two years ago

30:55.460 --> 30:58.660
So if you're like a part radio I heart when you shut the fuck up

31:02.500 --> 31:04.500
Oh

31:04.980 --> 31:07.620
Second will be what a plan what a plan what a

31:09.540 --> 31:13.140
Are you singing that or is that part of the set of words?

31:14.740 --> 31:21.380
Don't let's either talk about Grace's salary or the fucking strike than the second one. Yes, yeah

31:21.860 --> 31:24.820
So what should we be getting over the next couple years?

31:24.820 --> 31:31.140
426 million instead of 87. Yeah, I don't know the exact numbers actually 429 versus 86

31:32.260 --> 31:38.820
Why did you say the other ones because I fucked it up because I fucked it all all right?

31:38.820 --> 31:43.460
Are you in the live switching with each say because I fucked it all

31:44.580 --> 31:46.580
All right

31:46.580 --> 31:48.580
Every

31:48.900 --> 31:50.900
What a plan

31:52.660 --> 31:54.660
I

31:54.660 --> 31:58.900
You are yes, did you pick it yes, no because I was really sad yesterday

31:59.540 --> 32:05.940
Are you really in the WGA and right early sad what am I supposed to do there's not a pick it happening right now

32:05.940 --> 32:09.060
There was one this morning. I slept through the bitch. There's a meeting tonight at seven

32:09.060 --> 32:13.460
Why would I go to the shrine right? Why would I go to the shrine auditorium to hang out with a bunch of nerds all right?

32:13.540 --> 32:19.220
David young by the way was on the fucking negotiating committee and he flaked out really. Yeah, what does that mean? I think he got scared

32:21.220 --> 32:23.540
He got scared so he left should we call?

32:24.100 --> 32:28.660
You call I don't want to call I haven't talked to him like a year and a half right we can get him on

32:29.380 --> 32:32.340
Really he's not gonna join me as a family and kids

32:32.340 --> 32:35.700
Why did we is on the negotiating committee? He never he's never done this show

32:35.700 --> 32:39.700
I tried to invite him like two years ago. We've called him once or something. Did we call him? Should I call him?

32:39.780 --> 32:42.020
We've seen what it looks like when you try to get someone on the show

32:43.140 --> 32:45.140
Who else do we know in the WGA?

32:45.140 --> 32:49.700
Because I haven't worked again. I saw I was actually ready before we started rolling

32:49.700 --> 32:54.580
I saw my friend Morgan. Nick why I don't know why I hear is on it. Yeah

32:55.300 --> 33:01.940
But he's probably like doing something kind of related to that because we did this 24 hour live stream

33:01.940 --> 33:05.300
Right where I did the doughboys technically and then on the doughboys subreddit

33:05.300 --> 33:09.540
They were like it. This was a bad episode like yeah because it wasn't a real episode

33:09.860 --> 33:14.420
I'd love to redeem myself. Oh, maybe. I mean, it's not really up to us

33:15.220 --> 33:20.660
But yeah, like we kind of have nothing to say. Yeah, yeah, I mean I only work on the show every week

33:20.660 --> 33:25.300
But yeah, maybe I could talk to someone. It's only like 50% of my play. But I don't know

33:25.300 --> 33:32.660
But if it was a bad episode, I don't see them wanting to run. Yeah, I think that's that's where we're kind of running into a head

33:32.660 --> 33:34.660
Yeah, is that it was so bad

33:34.900 --> 33:41.780
How many terms of yeah about this? Oh, I don't know. It's just it comes up a lot when I talk to Emma and Nick and Mitch

33:42.020 --> 33:47.140
That they're like, please do not let Jeff anywhere near the show. They say that more than once

33:47.140 --> 33:53.060
I feel like that's something that you can only say well KC kind of is a friend like he keeps bringing it up every week at our meetings with them

33:53.060 --> 33:57.380
Yeah, I'm trying to look out what did they say you bring it up every week? They don't finally be like that's enough

33:57.380 --> 34:06.180
We get it. Yeah, they're will they're like any talent that we could get on the show and then they look at me and say KC don't say Jeff again

34:06.180 --> 34:10.580
Right, they're like we'd rather not have a show that week. Yeah, they yeah, they do actually say they would rather

34:11.220 --> 34:13.540
Cancel the show. Oh my gosh, then have you?

34:13.540 --> 34:16.980
Gonna pull it from head gum. Yeah, if we ask you in and then Amir are you saying oh my gosh

34:16.980 --> 34:25.460
Yeah, because that's like foul because I am talent no because that you've poisoned the well so much so that you're having one of our biggest shows threat to leave

34:27.540 --> 34:31.540
But I think these like you're stream. I don't think so

34:33.620 --> 34:36.260
I think we all almost had when in the cardiac arrest

34:38.020 --> 34:42.900
Grace in terms of if you don't want to go hourly just say how you you go when you usually make any week

34:42.900 --> 34:47.620
So and how many hours you drag weren't as back in it doesn't matter with the exchange rate

34:47.620 --> 34:50.900
I submit my invoices in dollars and then I get paid in

34:52.100 --> 34:59.620
So it's very interesting. Yeah, does it feel like a more or less? I get about depends on the exchange rate

34:59.620 --> 35:06.580
But generally it's about like 80% it fluctuates around 80% of whatever the dollar amount of submit right now the dollars of

35:07.540 --> 35:16.500
A dollar to UK 80% 80 cents. Yeah, we're weaker. Yeah, pounds falling. That's bad for us one quick

35:16.500 --> 35:20.900
Yeah, things aren't going great over here. Yeah, I have no idea what's going on anyway. We shouldn't have left

35:21.140 --> 35:26.820
I found out that France was right in because of this podcast. We should talk about if we think France is gonna make it

35:27.700 --> 35:29.700
Is it country

35:31.060 --> 35:33.060
Yeah, just

35:33.060 --> 35:34.580
From succession

35:34.580 --> 35:39.540
Isn't that they really that's I think that's exactly what he says that is exactly right

35:40.580 --> 35:42.580
So almost like a I can

35:42.900 --> 35:45.780
Right yeah, if we were a yeah

35:45.780 --> 35:52.180
Succession writer right here. You should do it all a I episode. Oh a chat. Wow. We did an episode

35:52.180 --> 35:54.180
We did a segment called chat Jeff PT

35:54.980 --> 35:56.980
Where was that up

35:56.980 --> 36:00.500
Yeah, yeah, how come none of us know about it because you guys don't listen to the show

36:00.500 --> 36:02.500
Wait a great

36:05.540 --> 36:13.540
Is it 50 an hour just go on the next fucking segment 8th grade history testing is plunging to below average level

36:13.540 --> 36:17.860
I heard about that. Yeah, so the New York turns out Jeff and I listen to the same MPR program

36:19.540 --> 36:24.980
Just one of us retains the information can you pass and eight this 8th grade history

36:25.300 --> 36:27.300
Ask the New York times

36:27.300 --> 36:29.300
Here we go. Let's

36:29.300 --> 36:34.580
Grace this is your first time on the show so let's single you out here and also or you can tell us how much you make an hour and then I'll switch it over to Casey

36:34.900 --> 36:36.900
Don't know you. I'm happy to tell you

36:36.900 --> 36:38.900
Okay, wait, oh really how much

36:41.300 --> 36:43.860
You're not happy to tell me that's so fucked up. It was

36:45.060 --> 36:46.580
But two days ago

36:46.580 --> 36:49.460
All right, I'll take that business is booming

36:50.020 --> 36:52.500
No, because now I have a negotiating tactic

36:53.300 --> 36:54.900
Jeff makes

36:55.540 --> 36:57.540
I make 17 an hour

36:58.740 --> 37:04.180
Here are five questions of medium difficulty from the 8th grade US history test given by the federal government

37:04.180 --> 37:08.740
We're swinging it over to on your for some reason here we go what I listen to and PR to never mind let's go to Casey

37:11.300 --> 37:15.780
What we're European explorers such as Henry Hudson this is gonna be too easy for you

37:15.780 --> 37:19.620
That's why we have to swing it to Casey because it's about Hudson you you broadcast and Hudson New York we should say

37:20.180 --> 37:22.180
Yeah, I'm broadcasting funds in New York right now

37:22.340 --> 37:24.340
Name that for Henry Hudson yeah

37:25.540 --> 37:32.900
Casey what were European explorers such as Henry Hudson looking for when they sailed the coast and rivers of North America in the 1600s

37:33.380 --> 37:36.180
A a water trade route to Asia

37:37.700 --> 37:41.060
Keep going be a land route to South America

37:41.860 --> 37:47.860
C land to use for sugar plantations or D religious freedom

37:48.820 --> 37:58.660
Much like most of my tests. I took an eighth grade. I kind of spaced out while you're giving the information to me sure

37:58.660 --> 38:00.660
I'm gonna say

38:02.420 --> 38:07.300
Trade routes they're looking for trade routes to what continent South America or Asia

38:07.380 --> 38:11.380
Um

38:12.820 --> 38:20.260
I think about it. Yeah, I can't stop thinking of my buddy. I'm going to say like my ass. I don't know what on your

38:20.900 --> 38:22.260
Fair O

38:24.260 --> 38:28.900
I was Casey look at that stuff on my phone. Yeah, I was that app result you're asking

38:29.860 --> 38:31.860
I want to take it up to be really short

38:32.820 --> 38:36.420
You're true that I now that I've thought about it. It's definitely to Asia

38:38.180 --> 38:42.420
That's absolutely right and that was only cuz on you had build you up God he was fucking way off

38:42.420 --> 38:45.620
Leave that my doctor sent me a message about that unbelievable

38:45.860 --> 38:51.700
There's no way it's weird that your doctor was talking about that question. Yeah. I guess he's also an eighth grade or something

38:52.100 --> 38:54.100
Yeah, it's great doctor

38:54.100 --> 38:58.100
She's on your kind of sky

38:58.100 --> 39:00.100
It's great doctor

39:01.860 --> 39:06.420
It's like a misguided attempt on a children's book to be like you can be whatever you want

39:06.420 --> 39:09.380
But it just leads to kids practicing medicine

39:09.380 --> 39:11.380
My eighth grade OBG. Yeah

39:13.060 --> 39:15.060
Such a bummer

39:17.860 --> 39:22.980
Every pap is that normal in your third team and oily

39:23.300 --> 39:25.300
Oh

39:25.700 --> 39:32.340
Grace which of the following is a right guaranteed by the bill of rights of the unit? Oh, that's unfair

39:32.340 --> 39:34.900
States of constitution. Yeah, you can phone a fiend

39:35.700 --> 39:42.340
Do you have to learn about American history and you're oh like we let the learn about European not really not about government to laws

39:43.700 --> 39:47.540
Sometimes no, I don't know what they were teaching what school did you go to milk in

39:47.940 --> 39:49.940
I

39:50.580 --> 39:52.580
No, see if you got the you also

39:52.580 --> 39:58.580
You know, let's get into this. I didn't you tell a story once that there's like a photo of you on the wall at your high school of like famous alumni

39:59.140 --> 40:04.780
We should say because you invited them me when we were at South by once that you you were drunk and you told me this that you put that up there

40:06.180 --> 40:08.180
So let's go back to great

40:09.380 --> 40:12.420
What's the name of your high school?

40:12.500 --> 40:17.780
The name is milk in there's also a public school named middle again, which is a separate school

40:18.100 --> 40:22.980
There's a picture of me there if there is at the public school. No at the school that I went to it's I mean

40:23.940 --> 40:26.180
Class all right, let's go

40:26.180 --> 40:30.260
Which of the following is a is guaranteed on the bill of rights right to public education

40:30.900 --> 40:32.900
Right to health care

40:33.460 --> 40:36.180
Right to trial by a jury right to vote

40:38.180 --> 40:40.180
Which one is it is

40:42.420 --> 40:45.620
the right to vote? No, you know, I don't know

40:46.100 --> 40:49.860
But we are this not health care the correct answer is right to trial by jury

40:50.260 --> 40:56.340
Yeah, we love to litigate in this country. Well, let me challenge you on that for a second

41:00.740 --> 41:02.740
That was that was a litigation

41:04.420 --> 41:10.660
The following passages taken from a proclamation signed by president George Washington

41:11.060 --> 41:12.660
I think it's how you say

41:12.820 --> 41:20.100
70 who's trying to answer this one use from Hamilton George Washington is from Hamilton and Hamilton's from Washington

41:20.740 --> 41:24.100
How weird is that that's not true. Well, it's interesting. Oh, that's the last

41:25.540 --> 41:31.380
Yeah, what's the question the question is the following passages taken from a proclamation signed by

41:31.380 --> 41:38.900
President George Washington in 1793 it appears that a state of war exists between Austria, Prussia, Sardinia

41:39.460 --> 41:46.980
Great Britain and the United Netherlands of the one part and France on the other and the duty and interest of the United States

41:48.580 --> 41:54.820
Require that we should with sincerity and good faith adopted Prussia conduct friendly and impartial towards the belligerent

41:54.820 --> 42:00.740
Combating powers which of the following policies was President Washington recommended

42:01.460 --> 42:06.820
Colonialism new traility imperialism or isolationism

42:08.980 --> 42:12.580
New traility. That's correct. All right three more. Let's go

42:12.980 --> 42:14.980
More all KC on these three

42:15.540 --> 42:17.540
Let's go ratify

42:17.540 --> 42:23.060
KC lightning Donna here. Does he have to leave if he gets him wrong? Yeah, no if you get it them wrong

42:23.060 --> 42:26.980
You have to spank your own ass a camera to if you get them wrong. You have to stay

42:28.020 --> 42:29.540
Yeah, I was like that

42:30.020 --> 42:34.580
I would really be written for you which of the following changes took place in southern states immediately have to

42:34.660 --> 42:39.940
Civil War A access to education became more available to African-American people

42:40.580 --> 42:45.700
B most African-Americans quickly switched from agricultural work to employment and manufacturing

42:46.580 --> 42:49.140
African-American women were given the right to vote

42:50.020 --> 42:55.060
D state governments were required to have African-American people and legislative and executives of offices

42:56.180 --> 43:01.140
Can you do A and B one more time A was access to education was expanded and B was

43:02.100 --> 43:06.660
Black Americans switched from agricultural work to employment and manufacturing. I'm going to go would be

43:07.220 --> 43:12.580
I believe that is absolutely wrong. Yeah, access to education became more available. I didn't know that one

43:12.580 --> 43:17.860
All the other ones I got correct so far, but I didn't get that one right that's like that's the kind of answer that you would hope is the answer

43:17.860 --> 43:22.020
But just from the land this country. I might there's no way that's what happened. Yeah, I can said we

43:22.980 --> 43:27.940
Help put them right back into the capitalist machine. Yeah, that's what I thought. That's what I was saying because wage labor is just

43:28.580 --> 43:35.300
One notch above slave labor. Yeah, which by the way, what's that? Oh, just I was just saying that grace and I are

43:36.180 --> 43:38.180
Sort of the bottom of the barrel

43:39.540 --> 43:41.220
You didn't say that you haven't mentioned my name

43:45.220 --> 43:52.980
Were there any celebrities on the like on the wall of notable? Yeah, I have to say something nobody

43:52.980 --> 43:57.460
It's a very small plot. You've said a lot of everything. Yeah, but I don't understand my grace would be upset

43:57.460 --> 44:03.540
I'm just trying to get her raise a total. I just had more questions and you moved on into this eighth grade history thing and I just wanted to get more

44:03.540 --> 44:05.700
It's like there's still a more question

44:06.340 --> 44:09.300
Yeah, because I don't feel safe because I'm here to wrap in

44:10.020 --> 44:15.300
I got out of here. Yeah, yeah, but no famous people went to my school now. So the other way you put your foot

44:15.300 --> 44:20.180
We're on them. I didn't put my photo. That was a lie. Oh, now you deserve rumors get started

44:20.900 --> 44:25.220
Ridiculous that you would do you think if you had gone to crossroads you would have been more successful and Hollywood

44:26.660 --> 44:30.820
Crossroads is where a lot of celebrities send their children and the answer is yes

44:30.820 --> 44:33.940
I would have been more successful, but you're kind of the only

44:35.300 --> 44:40.420
Celebrity is a good restaurant from your school, which is kind of cool. The only celebrity

44:42.020 --> 44:45.700
I'm sure we have other notable alums on Wikipedia, but I don't know

44:46.660 --> 44:51.700
Anyone has as many Twitter followers as you know, but again, I haven't been there 20 years. What's that?

44:51.700 --> 44:54.100
Did you apply to Harvard West like you just didn't get them?

44:56.020 --> 44:58.020
I have my brother went there and

44:58.740 --> 45:03.780
He's another dude pretty rich pick up because of tech and like investments and

45:04.500 --> 45:09.060
advance best to that but yeah, he yeah, he's a graphic designer

45:13.060 --> 45:15.300
Does he work? Yeah, sorry

45:16.660 --> 45:20.020
You know, I'm a apology accepted. He went to Harvard West. I would just a pretty good

45:20.980 --> 45:27.940
School I applied in seventh grade one of few feeders into Ivy League schools, right? But he went to go to school. I went to public school

45:29.380 --> 45:31.380
Public public all the way even college

45:32.660 --> 45:39.540
You're like college college college in the country. Where are your suits college of art? That's right. Me too. You went there too? No

45:41.140 --> 45:43.140
You just like Massachusetts

45:43.940 --> 45:48.260
Casey and I we lived a boss on the same time. Really you think he has ever

45:48.260 --> 45:54.740
Each other no drink a brew at the same pub? No. No, but we have mutual friends. We have mutual friend. Yeah in Boston. Yeah

45:55.140 --> 46:01.460
Interesting pasta. Yeah, he loves pasta. Which of the following reasons best explains why many people

46:01.460 --> 46:03.460
supported the 18th

46:08.740 --> 46:15.140
I'm locking in answer C but this was what the options were. Which of the following reasons are for the 18th amendment

46:15.140 --> 46:20.020
Which band the sale of alcohol? A they believed that drinking alcohol had a negative impact on society

46:20.020 --> 46:26.580
B they wanted to prevent organized crime from profiting from alcohol sales C they believed that alcohol would hurt the country

46:27.300 --> 46:33.460
The country's ability to fight in the second world war and D they hoped alcohol would become more expensive

46:33.460 --> 46:38.100
If it were made illegal so the correct answer is obviously A and you said C which is that

46:38.660 --> 46:44.820
Before they knew that there was going to be a second world war. They were worried they'd be hung over for it

46:45.860 --> 46:49.220
Yeah, and they were going to call it that's a good world world. I didn't correct

46:50.820 --> 46:53.540
Well, this has you scored four out of five, but that's

46:53.700 --> 46:54.980
Um

46:54.980 --> 46:58.740
I scored five out of five. Well, you said you didn't go. No, you said you don't want no. That's true

46:58.980 --> 47:04.020
Fort five. That's an 80. It's a D by you would lie when you're being recorded. Well, you know

47:04.020 --> 47:08.820
I can I can make any because also we have enough sample especially from a mirror in me

47:09.220 --> 47:15.460
That we can just form AI sentences that say anything. You're right. We could do that like for every episode moving forward

47:15.460 --> 47:17.460
Actually now that you bring it up

47:17.460 --> 47:19.860
Yeah, we were trying and I'm worried about the hosting fee

47:20.580 --> 47:22.580
hosting fee

47:22.580 --> 47:25.620
I don't have to pay the robot anything. I don't think we'd have to pay the robot

47:27.780 --> 47:30.580
Crossroads is also a movie with Britney Spears. Yes

47:35.140 --> 47:38.260
Do you have to any famous people got your high school? No, he's from Ohio

47:43.140 --> 47:45.140

Okay, placed by

47:58.820 --> 48:02.740
My hearty who went to my high school. So there's no way

48:03.300 --> 48:04.900

48:26.900 --> 48:32.180
Did he have a song called World War Three? No, but that's because I think he's fighting for

48:32.900 --> 48:36.980
I guess what would now be the 31st amendment banning the sale of alcohol again

48:37.300 --> 48:41.700
He's worried we're gonna be hung over for World War Three. I think I did the music for scrubs a lot. Yeah

48:42.100 --> 48:47.940
Yeah, he's like good friends with Zach Braff. The other thing I'll say is um I'm no super man exactly

48:48.340 --> 48:52.580
That could have been him. Yeah, I can do this all on my own

48:55.780 --> 49:02.500

49:40.100 --> 49:42.100

British Asian and detainers she was in the sketch comedy group called good downstairs meeting was on TV show

49:48.260 --> 49:50.100
Mary to some chief bus car another

49:51.700 --> 49:57.540
It's funny when people are famous in America. They're famous worldwide and people are famous where you're there nobody gives a shit

49:58.500 --> 50:00.500
Oh

50:06.020 --> 50:08.020
Oh

50:08.020 --> 50:10.020
No, I'm sorry about that

50:10.260 --> 50:14.180
True, why are we offended it's not look we all know Mr. Bean

50:15.300 --> 50:17.300
I was really

50:18.420 --> 50:21.340
I wish I had a piece of the graph American single

50:21.340 --> 50:25.460
Yeah, so I could do what he's sorry Jeff we're doing a podcast over here

50:26.420 --> 50:30.660
I was talking about we're trying to talk about my parents so arbitrary when people decide to get upset at me

50:31.460 --> 50:35.700
I asked if you guys had an abnormal pap and you guys were just kind of silent and awkward

50:35.940 --> 50:39.380
And then I threw I've had a full information we don't call it a pap

50:39.780 --> 50:44.740
May we're like what is this may test? Oh, just if you ever in the UK and you're trying to get that done

50:46.740 --> 50:53.140
Where the pap does come from is it like a guy's name or is it like the specific I think it's instrument that you think the guy's name

50:53.140 --> 50:56.820
No, I thought it was based on how with the procedures done because usually there's a couple

50:57.220 --> 50:59.860
It's usually done by like a crowd of facts. What's that?

51:00.420 --> 51:07.060
I thought it was because of the way they take the photography or whatever or the scan is usually from like 18 paparazzi

51:07.300 --> 51:10.180
Open your mouth. What does coaster into it?

51:10.740 --> 51:12.740
This is so fucked up

51:14.740 --> 51:16.740
My god, it was really close

51:17.700 --> 51:22.980
The Wall Street Journal asked when you're traveling to an Airbnb beat a hotel

51:23.860 --> 51:26.180
Yeah, not anymore. It was a guy's last name

51:28.020 --> 51:30.020
That's so annoying

51:30.020 --> 51:34.100
You know they wouldn't stay at an Airbnb the G spots also named after a dog. They're guys first

51:34.100 --> 51:38.740
In charge this guy's I've been doing Airbnb

51:40.020 --> 51:42.580
I ended up doing Airbnb's less and less recently

51:43.300 --> 51:45.300
There's less quality

51:46.740 --> 51:48.740
And they definitely

51:48.980 --> 51:50.980
I know

51:50.980 --> 51:52.980
He's going to be saving money anymore

51:52.980 --> 51:54.980
I know

51:54.980 --> 51:56.820
I've never had four days

51:56.820 --> 51:58.820
I'm sorry

51:58.820 --> 52:00.820
I was wondering

52:00.820 --> 52:02.820
Because there's turned out service and yes

52:04.020 --> 52:06.660
Yeah, because there's a bunch of fees. There's no fees

52:08.660 --> 52:10.660
Like a long term

52:10.660 --> 52:14.660
Did you discount? Yeah, at the time and they have a lot of relief

52:15.220 --> 52:17.940
Yeah, it's hard because you can stay around

52:17.940 --> 52:19.940
So I'm a human in

52:21.220 --> 52:27.140
You probably want to do Airbnb then yeah, like you're staying in LA you're staying for like almost a month and a half

52:27.460 --> 52:31.140
Well, you have the option you said you were doing Airbnb in the Franklin Village you could do the Carlotta

52:31.380 --> 52:36.820
You could do this here that because there's sort of these Jeff's Jeff was called G spot in high school

52:37.300 --> 52:39.300
I

52:40.100 --> 52:43.140
Think we might have two ads maybe we do two abrikes. Oh

52:50.740 --> 52:52.740
Where would I have heard the

52:54.020 --> 52:59.140
Why I just I want to know if it was one of those things where he was they were laughing with or at him

52:59.140 --> 53:03.300
You know what I mean like is a cool that he was called that or was it like wasn't entirely unrelated?

53:03.300 --> 53:05.300
I bet it wasn't

53:05.300 --> 53:09.620
Cool, I bet it wasn't cool. It was because was it your wrapping name?

53:10.420 --> 53:13.620
No, I'd ever wrapped it was um I pissed my pants

53:14.260 --> 53:17.620
There was there was there was often a dribble on my khakis

53:18.580 --> 53:23.540
And that's unrelated. Another break. There's no way. Oh my god

53:23.940 --> 53:25.940
Yeah

53:31.140 --> 53:38.420
We did pass the eighth grade fucking thing. I think I'm actually souring on Airbnb. I'm here. What cheer up

53:40.740 --> 53:42.740
Plugs

53:42.740 --> 53:46.740
What do you guys got what do you want to point the people towards the floor's case season will go

53:47.540 --> 53:52.820

53:53.860 --> 53:58.180
What's left of it? What's left of it? I'm being wow. Yeah

53:58.740 --> 54:03.540
What a stink town. That's become you cannot listen to the pit wall podcast

54:03.540 --> 54:09.780
What should I do with Jeff sometimes if he wakes up to record the show

54:11.060 --> 54:16.500
What is that noise? Nothing just yeah, you're watching TikToks again during the show

54:17.780 --> 54:19.780
But you're following. Jeff, did you have another segment?

54:20.660 --> 54:24.100
Did we get through all of them? We didn't but it's 55 anything good

54:25.380 --> 54:33.060
We were also going to do something about how scientists finally solved the mystery of how minds made plaster so strong

54:34.420 --> 54:36.420
The secret ingredient

54:36.420 --> 54:38.420
sap

54:40.180 --> 54:42.180
Yeah, great stuff that

54:43.140 --> 54:45.140
Hahaha

54:45.540 --> 54:49.940
There's a whole segment about how uh you can now get a top dad URL

54:50.820 --> 54:54.100
So we're just going to have us all come up with dot dad URLs i had a

54:55.060 --> 54:57.060
Dot dad trying to a dot dad

54:58.740 --> 55:01.620
Pretty good marty michael's divorce dot

55:01.700 --> 55:05.400
Dad nice jack Daniel stole my dot dad

55:05.400 --> 55:11.560
So, not anything good, and then we were going to go in, I mean, we kind of ambiently have

55:11.560 --> 55:15.120
done this, but I wanted to do a whole audit about the producers, because honestly, this

55:15.120 --> 55:16.120
was fucking easy.

55:16.120 --> 55:19.480
Okay, let's do it.

55:19.480 --> 55:26.680
So listen to dough boy, yeah, and can I also say the other one?

55:26.680 --> 55:27.680
No, no.

55:27.680 --> 55:29.680
But sorry, no, no.

55:29.680 --> 55:32.080
But this comes out on, this comes out in two days, so.

55:32.080 --> 55:34.840
It gets, you know, who you're talking to, yeah.

55:34.840 --> 55:37.160
Grace, are you going to have time to edit this in the next few days?

55:37.160 --> 55:38.160
Yeah.

55:38.160 --> 55:39.440
There's a lot of cuts you have to make.

55:39.440 --> 55:40.440
Not really.

55:40.440 --> 55:42.880
I thought it was all gold, except for some of the shit where you guys were coming out

55:42.880 --> 55:43.880
me.

55:43.880 --> 55:45.600
What was funny?

55:45.600 --> 55:48.880
Grace, can you add more of the shit of us coming at him to the...

55:48.880 --> 55:50.840
Oh, yeah, yeah, do it twice.

55:50.840 --> 55:51.840
Run it back.

55:51.840 --> 55:55.280
The more we talk over each other, the less like editing there is to do.

55:55.280 --> 55:59.640
That's what I'm always trying to say is that people need overlapping dialogue, not this

55:59.640 --> 56:04.400
fucking long pause, because people don't know how to respond to something I said or did.

56:04.400 --> 56:05.400
I know what he got.

56:05.400 --> 56:08.800
Because he asked me about a pap smear, and I had nothing.

56:08.800 --> 56:12.400
I couldn't even call for the joke because I was going to lie straight.

56:12.400 --> 56:14.560
Would you say that it was jarred joy?

56:14.560 --> 56:15.560
No.

56:15.560 --> 56:16.560
All right.

56:16.560 --> 56:18.560
I got an effect on the man.

56:18.560 --> 56:19.560
No.

56:19.560 --> 56:21.560
That was beautiful.

56:21.560 --> 56:22.560
I was trying to lie straight.

56:22.560 --> 56:24.560
Now what was I about to say?

56:24.560 --> 56:25.560
Sorry.

56:25.560 --> 56:26.560
No, we had a great time for that.

56:26.560 --> 56:27.560
We had a great time for that.

56:27.560 --> 56:29.000
So about to lie to the poses.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.640
Some of my favorite times on the live show was a good time.

56:32.640 --> 56:37.720
The best part was Miles's segment where he litigated and you and me at 3 a.m.

56:37.720 --> 56:39.600
with KC also there.

56:39.600 --> 56:41.880
Were you in, uh, in the UK at the time?

56:41.880 --> 56:42.880
Yes.

56:42.880 --> 56:44.080
So it was like midday for you.

56:44.080 --> 56:45.080
Were you in that?

56:45.080 --> 56:46.080
Where were you living?

56:46.080 --> 56:47.080
I'm here.

56:47.080 --> 56:48.080
Was that actually how?

56:48.080 --> 56:49.080
You say that's how we plan it?

56:49.080 --> 56:50.080
Bath.

56:50.080 --> 56:51.080
Is that where you live?

56:51.080 --> 56:52.080
No, it's where we're living.

56:52.080 --> 56:53.080
Thank you.

56:53.080 --> 56:54.080
Where do you live?

56:54.080 --> 56:55.080
Good memory.

56:55.080 --> 56:56.080
I mean, you're called me smart.

56:56.080 --> 56:57.080
Do you remember?

56:57.120 --> 56:57.920
Oh, soul.

56:57.920 --> 56:58.760
Oh, soul.

56:58.760 --> 56:59.760
Oh, soul.

56:59.760 --> 57:01.520
And that sort of like the baker's field.

57:01.520 --> 57:02.960
The great thing is doing plugs.

57:02.960 --> 57:05.800
I'm wondering because KC did his plugs and then you sort of me and

57:05.800 --> 57:07.320
already started watching TikToks.

57:07.320 --> 57:12.760
It's never the person that I'm talking to her platform job to make sure

57:12.760 --> 57:14.840
everyone speaks just so in the right order.

57:14.840 --> 57:18.320
Are you just, are you live producing like changing camera angles while we talk?

57:18.320 --> 57:19.320
Of course.

57:19.320 --> 57:23.000
I just switched back onto you after I said that thing or while I was talking.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.960
I've been doing as best as I fucking can.

57:24.960 --> 57:25.960
All right.

57:25.960 --> 57:26.960
This shit is hard as shit.

57:27.200 --> 57:28.160
That's the hardest to do.

57:28.160 --> 57:29.800
Sir audit, this shit is hard as shit.

57:29.800 --> 57:32.040
Thank you for finally admitting it.

57:32.040 --> 57:35.600
Sorry, when you're trying to host, too, because I'm fucking, you know, it's person A.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.120
I don't know what he got the plug.

57:40.400 --> 57:43.200
We do have some exciting shows coming at, we have a lot of launches.

57:43.200 --> 57:44.840
I think we should be fair to say that it's, yeah.

57:47.360 --> 57:47.920
Sorry, go ahead.

57:47.920 --> 57:49.760
Well, you've heard a ****.

57:49.760 --> 57:50.880
Shut up.

57:50.880 --> 57:52.200
What brings up?

57:52.200 --> 57:53.840
We have a Will and Grey's body.

57:53.840 --> 57:55.040
Yeah, exactly right.

57:55.040 --> 57:56.240
Are you happy?

57:56.400 --> 57:57.760
Everyone knows now.

57:57.760 --> 57:58.080
Yeah.

57:58.080 --> 58:00.360
Deborah, we're just messing with you.

58:00.360 --> 58:02.200
We're busy, Deborah.

58:02.200 --> 58:06.480
I feel like this will go over well in your, uh, when you ask for a raise.

58:06.480 --> 58:08.360
I think moments like this are the moments I've ever done.

58:08.360 --> 58:10.320
What I'm going to do is bleep that out.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.320
I really will.

58:12.320 --> 58:13.920
Lots to listen to.

58:13.920 --> 58:17.360
I mean, you're made fun of me for this earlier, but I'm always looking for submissions

58:17.360 --> 58:19.400
to my radio show.

58:19.400 --> 58:20.200
Thank you.

58:20.200 --> 58:20.800
I love you so much.

58:20.800 --> 58:23.280
I'll tell you the real radio, the dot love motel.

58:23.280 --> 58:24.480
How do people call me there?

58:24.720 --> 58:30.240
Uh, on our website, the love motelradio.com or on the flyers, all over the office.

58:30.240 --> 58:34.280
Or do you not know how to do it or I want to try to save for them?

58:34.280 --> 58:35.640
Wjxie.org.

58:35.640 --> 58:36.640
You know, yeah.

58:36.640 --> 58:39.480
This is, this is, I've never said something more cancel.

58:40.480 --> 58:46.320
But sometimes I wish I had a direct line to my friends partners, so that they could

58:46.320 --> 58:49.080
like punish them later, you know what I mean?

58:49.080 --> 58:51.480
Like either like, like, like, like, like you just pissed me up.

58:51.480 --> 58:52.320
Like punish vibes?

58:52.320 --> 58:53.160
It could be fetish vibes.

58:53.240 --> 58:56.880
I mean, more like worse, like you're just getting iced out by your partner for the next three

58:56.880 --> 58:57.880
days, and you don't know.

58:57.880 --> 58:58.880
And she won't tell you.

58:58.880 --> 59:00.120
There's no way they would listen to you.

59:00.120 --> 59:00.880
No, but that's what I'm saying.

59:00.880 --> 59:04.720
If I had the direct line, maybe I'm eight, five, seven dial love.

59:04.720 --> 59:05.720
Okay.

59:05.720 --> 59:11.520
So maybe if I could conference call me and Jill, I could get Jake and the dog.

59:11.520 --> 59:12.520
Exactly.

59:12.520 --> 59:13.520
Right.

59:13.520 --> 59:14.520
Yeah.

59:14.520 --> 59:15.520
So maybe we'll put you both on the air.

59:15.520 --> 59:16.520
All right.

59:16.520 --> 59:18.360
And then Amir, you'll just sort of be ignored in your own house.

59:18.360 --> 59:20.800
There we go.

59:20.800 --> 59:22.520
Jill is not Amir's partner.

59:23.160 --> 59:23.960
No, I knew that.

59:23.960 --> 59:27.480
I just was, that was an example of like an impartial thing where it was my baby.

59:27.480 --> 59:28.320
Can we say that?

59:28.320 --> 59:29.320
What is?

59:29.320 --> 59:38.360
Just maybe she's with child, but it's my sperm donor, or you're asking Jeff, if you can say that.

59:38.360 --> 59:41.360
Jeff sort of, Jeff was the arbiter.

59:41.360 --> 59:43.800
I mean, he's a lot of that.

59:43.800 --> 59:45.480
It's a lot of power that's say, yeah.

59:45.480 --> 59:50.400
No, because what I had was two things was I had a meat locker and a turkey bastor.

59:50.400 --> 59:51.400
Exactly.

59:51.400 --> 59:57.680
That was for meat production, but it also ended up being for sheep production.

59:57.680 --> 59:58.680
We had Amir's seed.

59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.640
Let's add that to the pile.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:01.640
And guess who else was there?

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.640
Andrew Pile.

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.640
Exactly.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.480
I'm sure that's why it's wrong.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.480
Grace cut that out.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.680
That'll be for the Patreon.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.320
We do need a Patreon.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.320
What are you looking me for?

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.320
I don't know.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:19.320
One said that, sorry, let me turn in my story telling boys.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:26.840
Marika, one said that the headgum top breath is a shy carry.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.960
Backs up on the week for a P on the plastic.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:35.960
A headgum bodgash patreon where I would, what can you do Michael Kay?

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.120
Do you want to know this is my shy carry?

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.120
Do you?

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.120
Gilbert got freed.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.400
You can only need to go to London.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:47.800
I don't know if we could have a headgum bodgash patreon channel.

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.080
It's pretty good actually.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:49.440
Yeah.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.440
Well, he's like the easiest.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:51.080
Like you do it.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.120
I'm sure you could do it right now.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.880
I wonder if we can do it.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:54.800
That wasn't good at all.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.680
Let's keep going.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.880
Grace, what do you have?

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.880
Well, a Gilbert got freed in person.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:02.680
Let's do your plugs as Gilbert got freed.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.160
Can you do a Mr. Bean impression?

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:04.880
Follow me.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.440
That's it.

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.440
That's it.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.440
I'm not in front of you.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.440
I'm in front of you.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.440
I'm not really.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.440
You're going to do Mr. Bean.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.440
You're going to do Mr. Bean.

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.440
That's Mr. Bean.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.440
If you're going to.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.440
That's what they started to do in retirement.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:21.440
If you're going to do Mr. Bean, you have to eat French fries with a fork.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.440
Oh.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.440
Grace, what do you get?

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.440
My mom is from the same town as Mr. Bean.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.440
Really?

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.440
Yeah.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.440
The character of Rowan Act.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.440
Rowan Act.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.440
Wow.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.440
Where's that?

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.440
Concert count either.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.440
No feast.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.440
You and I buy his accent.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.440
Yeah.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.440
I'm never heard him talk.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.440
Is that the joke?

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.440
No.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.440
Mr. Bean.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.440
No match for me.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.440
Oh.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.440
Go.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.440
You haven't seen Blackhead.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.440
It's going to work for the each word you said.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.440
I got nervous that time because I knew that the camera was going to be

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.440
out of mass.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.440
Wow.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.440
I feel like you're going to see Blackhead.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.440
No, I'm never.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.440
That's so funny that you would have thought that.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.440
The Rowan Act can't talk.

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:00.440
It's so funny.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.440
You need to think the joke.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.440
Try to be a part of a car or say to it.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.440
I love Blackhead.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.440
I always get it confused with picky blinders.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:09.440
Was that still the god of being present?

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.440
You know, find it surprising that a man has never seen Blackhead.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.440
No, heard of it.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.440
No, I am surprised.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:24.440
Because it's like a British sitcom that's pretty similar to your sense of humor.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.440
Very dry.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.440
What if he can't see you on a diet?

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:29.440
It's like down the cushion.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.440
It's Jeffrey got free from your on-out.

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.440
Wouldn't it be Gilbert, Jalfrey?

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.440
It would be the G-Spot for sure.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.440
Plugs.

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.440
Yeah.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:43.440
I'm sorry.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.440
I work on the head compartment.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.440
It comes in D. Go's on point.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.440
Twinnovation.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:49.440
And.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.440
Maze all boys.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:51.440
Thank you.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.440
You're welcome.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.440
In that order.

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.440
No.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.440
Of how much you like them to least.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.440
I could do that.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.440
Reverse.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.440
That was a reverse.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.440
This is an order.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.440
And then I have a sub-stack.

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.440
Hey, like girls.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:08.440
Sub-stack.com.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.440
I talk about movies and NBA basketball.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.440
Oh my gosh.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.440
What?

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.440
No, indeed.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:17.440
Do you think Dylan Berksa's ever going to play me NBA again?

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.440
Yeah.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.440
I don't see it.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.440
I don't see it.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.440
There's a basketball podcast.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.440
Yeah.

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.440
How did you become a basketball fan in England?

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:29.440
Um, around 2012-13 through the Oklahoma City Thunder.

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.440
So how does the Oklahoma City Thunder reach you?

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.440
I loved.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.440
Well, I like LeBron James.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.440
Okay.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.440
You're not on the phone.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.440
Followed him to the heat.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.440
And then through that.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:45.440
So how old were you in 2010 when he joined the heat?

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.440
Guys, you can't see the monitors right now.

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:50.440
But Casey, I'm just not realizing.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.440
Looks like Pedro Pascal.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.440
But Irish.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.440
I'll take it.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.440
You don't sound like him.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.440
So just keep that.

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.440
Yeah.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.440
Keep that mouth shut.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.440
Keep that mouth shut.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.440
Keep that pretty little mouth shut.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.440
So what do we running out right now?

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.440
What time?

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.440
It's been an hour and 32 minutes.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.440
Yeah.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.440
That's very unfurlful.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.440
After post probably a spelled 42.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:15.440
37 less.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.440
Yeah.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:20.440
These are all kind of filling in all the stuff that Jeff said that we have to cut out.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.440
At Jeffrey James on Twitter.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.440
Sorry.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.440
At Jeffrey James on Instagram.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.440
At Jeffrey James on Twitter.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.440
And yeah, do you guys feel like you adequately plugged?

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.440
No, Charles Berkeley on Instagram.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.440
All right.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.440
How do you spell that?

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.440
Like Charles Barkley.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.440
But with O's instead of A's.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:41.440
C-H-O-R-L-E-S-B-O-R-K-L-E-Y.

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.440
Charles Berkeley.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.440
I'm here.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.440
You guys, are you guys good?

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.440
We can just be out right now.

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:49.440
We have to do.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:50.440
Yes.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.440
We have all stuff to do.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:53.440
This is everything I dreamed it would be.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:13.440
That was a hit-dum original.

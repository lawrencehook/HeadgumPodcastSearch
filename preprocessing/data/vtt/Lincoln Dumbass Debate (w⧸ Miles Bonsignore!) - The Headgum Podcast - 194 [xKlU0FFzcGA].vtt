00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head gum original.

00:02.000 --> 00:08.000
Are you going to talk about the suini?

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
We can get it back into it, but it feels like Miles has something specific.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
I'd like to unbox the 2023 listeners choice winner award.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Winner award.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Every award is a winner award.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
This is the 2023 listeners choice.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
It comes with care instructions.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
It's a clean, you soft and dry cloth.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Yes, this will melt in a washer dryer situation.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
And it does also come with some silica gel.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
It's just a part of a medicine cycle.

00:46.000 --> 00:55.000
And of course, the signal award for 2023 listeners choice winner of advice and out too for perfect person.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Thank you.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
For the vote.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
And of course, we would be remiss.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
We remiss.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
If not, also give a shot up to the 2023 silver winner.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
You won first and second place.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah, I won first and silver.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
I won listeners and I won silver, but I did not win the goal.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
The next year, guys.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
We'll get them.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
So how many awards are there per category?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
There's listener.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
There's gold.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
There's silver.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I believe there's silver.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Brown gold.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Teo.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
And listener.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Teo.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Oh, I'm smudging it.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Quick.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Get the microfiber.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Get the silica gel.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
It's going to be nice.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I did get a microfiber with this one as well.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
I believe.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Yes, it is.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Here it is.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I'm sure that I can keep it nice and clean.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
I wasn't sure if it was just a gold thing or this is heavy as fuck.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
It is heavy.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Well, I want to thank headgum.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
The headgum podcast.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
And everyone here except Jeff for really helping me secure the W.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Thanks, guys.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
I've been on two episodes.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
I contributed to like 180th of that award.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
I've been on three.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
And the fact that you don't remember that means you've been on one.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I mean, I'm deleting the old episode.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
No way, because then you're going to lose the ad revenue from that.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Doesn't matter.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Going forward.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
You won't get the impression.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
But I'll have my hope.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
I have stuff to get to.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Yeah.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Do you want to just put your award somewhere that's displayed so that we can really

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
Nice refer back to them if necessary slash ad nauseam.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Oh, I would like that.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Oh.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Wait.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
I wonder if they gold one is any different than the listener one,

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
which is also gold.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
What?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
What is hit?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
You're worried it's broken.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
I think.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
No.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
The headphones are wearable.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
You didn't know that?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Is that true?

02:52.000 --> 02:52.500
No way.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.500
There's no way.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.500
But they are loose.

02:54.500 --> 02:55.500
No.

02:55.500 --> 02:56.500
That's not true.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.500
I just wanted to see if you'd try and yank it.

02:58.500 --> 02:59.500
You want to meet it.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.500
Let's just put those right there.

03:00.500 --> 03:01.500
The heart started to show.

03:01.500 --> 03:04.500
By the way, we did the little cold open.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.500
And, you know, I was hoping that the cold open would be, oh, the awards.

03:07.500 --> 03:08.500
That's funny.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.500
He's opening them on the show.

03:09.500 --> 03:10.500
Cold open over.

03:10.500 --> 03:11.500
Let's get into the actual show.

03:11.500 --> 03:18.500
But you kept driving the point past home that you won these awards that basically

03:18.500 --> 03:19.500
are paid to play.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.500
By the way.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.500
They're not paid to play.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.500
Maybe the silver was.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.500
But it was a fortune to be nominated.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.500
But you did finish second.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.500
Naturally.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.500
Well, unless.

03:30.500 --> 03:31.500
And the list.

03:31.500 --> 03:32.500
I got a second.

03:32.500 --> 03:33.500
And list.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.500
Yeah.

03:34.500 --> 03:35.500
Did you submit it?

03:35.500 --> 03:36.500
It had come submit.

03:36.500 --> 03:37.500
It had come submitted for me.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.500
Which is why it is.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.500
Had come not do that for the had come podcast.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.500
Not once have we submitted the show for an award.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.500
I think it's too expensive.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.500
It's like $40.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.500
A little more.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.500
I think it's expensive.

03:49.500 --> 03:50.500
Yeah.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.500
And then I think it's a little bit more expensive.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.500
Maybe we didn't go anywhere.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.500
That's also possible, yeah.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.500
You can only bribe people so far.

03:58.500 --> 03:59.500
Yeah.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.500
We'll cut it later.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.500
We'll go ahead.

04:01.500 --> 04:02.500
The category would be paid to play.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.500
Oh, it's a bribery.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.500
Only category.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.500
We got the gold in the pay to play category.

04:07.500 --> 04:11.500
So whoever gives the most crash wins the most glass.

04:11.500 --> 04:12.500
Yeah.

04:12.500 --> 04:13.500
Yeah.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.500
Yeah.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.500
We were segments was in a bidding war with us.

04:17.500 --> 04:18.500
Interesting.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.500
You guys just did that because you know that you would drive the price up.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.500
And I would end up spending $1,400 for the gold.

04:24.500 --> 04:28.500
What's some big amount of money you've ever spent on a little silly joke that you've lost?

04:28.500 --> 04:30.500
Uh, it's a really good.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.500
Oh, I know.

04:31.500 --> 04:38.500
I spent $400 on edible arrangements for Hayes and Sean from Hollywood handbook when they

04:38.500 --> 04:41.500
guessed it on this episode because I was like, Oh, this is perfect.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.500
They'll be like, you sent us this fruit basket before.

04:44.500 --> 04:45.500
Why did you do that?

04:45.500 --> 04:47.500
There would be like a whole bit on the show.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.500
They didn't bring it up at all.

04:48.500 --> 04:49.500
Yeah.

04:49.500 --> 04:50.500
What?

04:50.500 --> 04:52.500
So you just want to really big one and one the smallest one possible.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.500
Exactly.

04:53.500 --> 04:58.500
So I gave, I think Hayes like the like exact 10,000 sticks of fruit.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.500
And I gave Sean like five sticks of piano load, not even.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.500
I think it was maybe honey do.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.500
Oh, I couldn't even afford the other melons.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.500
Yeah.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.500
Jesus.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.500
And they didn't discuss amongst themselves.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.500
So they didn't know the size.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.500
Exactly.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.500
Yeah.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.500
And it's supposed to be like, you got an edible arrangement too.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.500
Like, how big was yours?

05:18.500 --> 05:21.500
And it's like, you know, why did I get a tiny one?

05:21.500 --> 05:22.500
Why did Hayes get the huge one?

05:22.500 --> 05:23.500
That didn't come up.

05:23.500 --> 05:24.500
No, not once.

05:24.500 --> 05:25.500
Whatever.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.500
Yeah.

05:26.500 --> 05:27.500
Yeah.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.500
Anyway.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.500
Wow.

05:37.500 --> 05:38.500
We're putting this segment on hold.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.500
We have to.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.500
We have to.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.500
Because Barbara broccoli producer of the Bond movies.

05:43.500 --> 05:44.500
Sorry. Are we.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.500
Are we boring you?

05:46.500 --> 05:48.500
No, I was just pulling up my segment.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.500
You're a segment.

05:50.500 --> 05:54.500
Yeah. Well, every time I come on the show, I just thought I like to prepare a little segment.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.500
Yeah. I think I show it.

05:56.500 --> 05:57.500
Yeah.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.500
Not always.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.500
I mean, this one could be different.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.500
Bye by wisdom teeth.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.500
August 30th, 2013.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.500
Jeffrey James.

06:04.500 --> 06:05.500
Two comments.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.500
Eight likes.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.500
Just know that he can play it.

06:11.500 --> 06:19.500
I was just going to say we're shelving Bond the week for the time being because Barbara broccoli the producer says nothing is happening with regards to the new bond.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.500
But that was from my Facebook page.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.500
Yeah.

06:22.500 --> 06:28.500
This is on your public Facebook page, which I encourage everyone to check out because there's a lot of stuff I saw in witness that I don't feel comfortable sharing.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.500
Meaning.

06:29.500 --> 06:32.500
Because people that are not like you.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.500
Meaning.

06:33.500 --> 06:36.500
Well, it's like seeing other people sort of women flirt with you from high school.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.500
I don't feel comfortable.

06:38.500 --> 06:42.500
When they've come at like a cutie, like I don't feel comfortable saying that on the show.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.500
But you feel comfortable viewing it on the internet.

06:44.500 --> 06:45.500
Oh, I've viewed it all.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.500
Ten years ago.

06:46.500 --> 06:49.500
Oh, here's the Grand Budapest hotel trailer.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.500
So period excited.

06:51.500 --> 06:54.500
Oh, that's really nice.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.500
Yeah.

06:55.500 --> 06:56.500
I went to film.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.500
I was really into film in high school.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.500
2013.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.500
Did you like West Anderson?

06:59.500 --> 07:00.500
I loved West Anderson.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.500
Yeah.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.500
I still like West Anderson.

07:02.500 --> 07:03.500
He's good.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.500
Yeah.

07:04.500 --> 07:05.500
I actually did have a question, though.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.500
Okay.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.500
2014.

07:07.500 --> 07:08.500
November 28th.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.500
My birthday.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.500
Really?

07:10.500 --> 07:11.500
Uh-huh.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.500
That provides you.

07:13.500 --> 07:17.500
You say happy birthday, Karen Gillen.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.500
Because we share the birthday.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.500
And so it was kind of a little coy little thing of like,

07:22.500 --> 07:23.500
oh, my friends about my birthday,

07:23.500 --> 07:25.500
but I'm wishing someone else a birthday.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.500
And.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.500
What's that?

07:28.500 --> 07:29.500
Did she know her?

07:29.500 --> 07:30.500
No.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.500
Was she famous at that point?

07:32.500 --> 07:34.500
Yeah, she was a doctor who.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.500
Oh.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.500
So she loved doctor.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.500
She's booked.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.500
She was booked.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.500
She was blessed.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.500
She was blessed.

07:42.500 --> 07:43.500
Yeah.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.500
She was booked.

07:44.500 --> 07:48.500
Blast and thriving under under 30 and thriving.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.500
Yeah.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.500
Yeah.

07:50.500 --> 07:51.500
And now she's married to Nick Cocher.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.500
I know.

07:52.500 --> 07:53.500
Have you ever before?

07:53.500 --> 07:54.500
I haven't.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.500
But I feel like my friend Corey sees her all the time.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.500
Because he's buddies with Nick.

07:57.500 --> 07:58.500
Yeah.

07:58.500 --> 08:02.500
And I feel like I'm only two degrees separate from.

08:02.500 --> 08:03.500
Gillen.

08:03.500 --> 08:04.500
Would you bring that up?

08:04.500 --> 08:05.500
What's that?

08:05.500 --> 08:06.500
Would you bring it up?

08:06.500 --> 08:08.500
That on November.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.500
Twenty fourteen.

08:09.500 --> 08:10.500
I wish sure.

08:10.500 --> 08:11.500
Have you heard that my Facebook?

08:11.500 --> 08:12.500
No.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.500
Would you say, oh, we have the same birth.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.500
That.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.500
I would say.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.500
Yeah.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.500
Not this shit.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.500
You said I would say, I wish you have a birthday.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.500
You didn't get it.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.500
Okay.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.500
You don't think that's a little weird.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.500
That you knew her birthday.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.500
I think everyone knows.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.500
Everyone tends to know.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.500
Well, like, what celebrity share birthday with me, right?

08:27.500 --> 08:29.500
My sister shares it with Justin Bieber.

08:29.500 --> 08:30.500
It's cool.

08:30.500 --> 08:31.500
Yeah.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.500
By the way, this comes out of my sister's birthday.

08:32.500 --> 08:33.500
Have you heard the Sarah?

08:34.500 --> 08:35.500
That's.

08:35.500 --> 08:36.500
What's that?

08:36.500 --> 08:37.500
March 1st.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.500
Yeah.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.500
As in, let's March 1st.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.500
Towards the Capitol.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.500
Oh.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.500
Oh.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.500
Oh.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.500
Oh.

08:45.500 --> 08:46.500
Oh.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.500
Oh.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.500
Would she born on a leap year?

08:49.500 --> 08:52.500
Was it like almost the 29th of February?

08:52.500 --> 08:54.500
If her birthday is March 1st.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.500
But like, is it, uh, what year was she?

08:56.500 --> 08:57.500
Oh.

08:57.500 --> 08:58.500
Okay.

08:59.500 --> 09:04.500
I mean, can we get a numbers crunch on that machine?

09:04.500 --> 09:06.500
She's turning in 1994.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.500
Was that a leap year?

09:07.500 --> 09:10.500
Looking for cheap quality housing in the US area this summer?

09:10.500 --> 09:12.500
Look no further than the glimmering palace.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.500
That is the Sigma new house.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.500
So I was in a fraternity for a semester.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.500
I didn't know you were in a fraternity.

09:18.500 --> 09:19.500
Yeah.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.500
I feel like that's not a big part of your brand identity.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.500
Of course it's not.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.500
I was there for a semester and a half.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.500
But you were urging people to join or to live there.

09:27.500 --> 09:31.500
I had to advertise the housing thing as part of the pledging process.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.500
Did you make it where you were brother?

09:33.500 --> 09:34.500
Yeah.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.500
And then immediately I was like, this isn't fun anymore.

09:36.500 --> 09:40.500
And that was this, the, the, the, the that semester.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.500
The second semester.

09:41.500 --> 09:42.500
I was a full brother.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.500
It was the year that Trump got elected.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.500
Mm-hmm.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.500
And people in the house were celebrating.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.500
So I was like, ah, not for you.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.500
Oh, Trump was elected.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.500
And people were like, let's do a kega.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.500
And you said, I'll actually do theater.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.500
Yeah.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.500
Oh, I do improv.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.500
That's my brotherhood.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.500
Is there a threat that voted with her?

10:02.500 --> 10:06.500
Yeah.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.500
It got to be the beta house.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.500
Yeah.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.500
The beta cuck out.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.500
Yeah.

10:11.500 --> 10:12.500
Yeah.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.500
Um, government shutdown.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.500
Let's talk about it.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.500
Um, is it imminent?

10:18.500 --> 10:25.500
Would you guys be surprised or would you kind of be glad to have a shut down by government?

10:25.500 --> 10:26.500
Yeah.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.500
Would you, like, what if the post office stopped for a month?

10:29.500 --> 10:31.500
I don't send a lot of post.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.500
Yeah.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.500
I think I'll probably receive things.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.500
Would it affect Amazon?

10:35.500 --> 10:38.500
I think Amazon is safe because that's private.

10:38.500 --> 10:41.500
So to have that was shut this fucker down.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.500
Let's get public services gone for a while.

10:44.500 --> 10:48.500
Um, are we not surprised that head gum hasn't had a shut down?

10:48.500 --> 10:53.500
Um, I, not surprised that you've never thought about walking out.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.500
No.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.500
No.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.500
No.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.500
There's, yeah.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.500
I haven't.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.500
There's been no talk of unionizing.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.500
Yeah.

11:00.500 --> 11:04.500
I feel like Marie could have a different answer because we kind of threw a comedy festival that

11:04.500 --> 11:11.500
she was like forced into planning basically herself on the day of her birthday for years

11:11.500 --> 11:12.500
ago.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.500
Okay.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.500
I don't know.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.500
I don't know what that is.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.500
Do the walkout.

11:18.500 --> 11:19.500
Wow.

11:19.500 --> 11:20.500
I would have walked out of a user.

11:20.500 --> 11:21.500
I think I was.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.500
I think I was the only one who acknowledged it was her birthday.

11:23.500 --> 11:24.500
Because I brought her cookies.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.500
Yeah.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.500
And then she forgot that it was me.

11:26.500 --> 11:27.500
And she was like, oh, somebody brought cookies.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.500
I was like, that was me.

11:28.500 --> 11:33.500
I feel like we were all having a lot of fun before we walked in this studio.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.500
It sounded fun.

11:34.500 --> 11:38.500
Because we were talking about like your haircut versus a mirror's haircut.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.500
Yeah.

11:39.500 --> 11:40.500
Yeah.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.500
Yeah.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.500
We're just.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.500
We were talking about prebiotic sodas.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.500
Yeah.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.500
All the pops.

11:45.500 --> 11:46.500
I was going to say all the pop.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.500
Yeah.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.500
The fact that marshmallow is growing trees like money.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.500
Yeah.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.500
I'm like, what was it called?

11:51.500 --> 11:52.500
Obviously.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.500
I don't mind that.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.500
I clearly do.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.500
Facebook anymore.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.500
Do you want to sprinkle this in throughout the episode?

11:57.500 --> 11:59.500
Just like quotes here and there.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.500
Yeah.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.500
I'd rather sprinkle.

12:01.500 --> 12:02.500
Got it.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.500
All right.

12:03.500 --> 12:16.500
You guys hear about this?

12:16.500 --> 12:17.500
Yeah.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.500
Lauren Bobert.

12:18.500 --> 12:23.500
You used to have a gun-famed restaurant in rifle Colorado called Shooter's Grill.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.500
Is she the one who got in.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.500
Pingered in the.

12:27.500 --> 12:28.500
Beetle juice.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.500
Yeah.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.500
It's what?

12:30.500 --> 12:31.500
She was a group.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.500
I don't know.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.500
She was.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.500
Oh.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.500
She was faint.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.500
I need to say it.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.500
But she was.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.500
She was groping.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.500
Two, right?

12:39.500 --> 12:40.500
Consensual.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.500
Consensual.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.500
It's not groped.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.500
Thank you.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.500
She was Josh groping.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.500
I don't know.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.500
She got a little handsy during a matinee.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.500
And she was hands-done.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.500
I don't mind that for her though.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.500
That's not my issue with her.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.500
Okay.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.500
Do you mind that the play was Beetle juice?

12:55.500 --> 12:59.500
To me, Beetle juice is a romp and a fun festival.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.500
So being.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.500
Yeah.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.500
Beetle juice is the Beetle juice.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.500
The musical or play is a festival.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.500
Yeah.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.500
A musical.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.500
It's a fun festival.

13:09.500 --> 13:10.500
Okay.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.500
It's like a good talk.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.500
Yeah.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.500
I've seen it.

13:13.500 --> 13:14.500
Okay.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.500
Oh.

13:16.500 --> 13:17.500
Oh.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.500
Something rotten.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.500
Right is Gavroch.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.500
Get skill.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.500
I am a little.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.500
As soon as Hamlet exit.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.500
Do you think they do Hamlet on Broadway?

13:26.500 --> 13:27.500
Fuck it.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.500
They didn't even do.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.500
They did.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.500
They didn't even do.

13:31.500 --> 13:32.500
They did.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.500
Damn.

13:33.500 --> 13:34.500
What's that?

13:34.500 --> 13:37.500
It's a version of Hamlet with.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.500
Overweight.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.500
Marcel Spears.

13:39.500 --> 13:40.500
Yeah.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.500
Lauren Bobert used to have a gun-themed restaurant in Colorado.

13:43.500 --> 13:46.500
And rifle Colorado called Shooter's Grill.

13:46.500 --> 13:53.500
The restaurant was scantily decorated beyond two muskets on the wall in a few string lights.

13:53.500 --> 14:08.500
It seems like the theme was supposed to come alive mostly in the actual guns that people were allowed to brandish while eating dishes like chicken dunkers and dinner salad.

14:08.500 --> 14:11.500
The other salad is a great name for a salad.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.500
We were like a family, Bobert said.

14:14.500 --> 14:19.500
I would say shooters for any employee was their life.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.500
We lived and breathed it every day.

14:21.500 --> 14:26.500
They were a part of this culture and brand that we created in rifle.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.500
And there was a lot of pride with that.

14:29.500 --> 14:39.500
So this is a segment where I would like us all to create our bid build, our perfect order from shooters grill and rifle Colorado.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.500
I'd like to sprinkle in.

14:41.500 --> 14:42.500
Yep.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.500
Happy Mother's Day to the best most beautiful mom I've got to get a brass score.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.500
Thanks for putting up with me for 18 years, mama.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.500
So.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.500
May 26.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.500
I was obviously problem slash gifted trial.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.500
Okay.

14:53.500 --> 14:57.500
I'm seeing sharable desserts, just anyone want to go lay on something together.

14:57.500 --> 14:58.500
Oh yeah.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.500
Oh yeah.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.500
All the other fucking cat.

15:01.500 --> 15:05.500
We're there in creams, girls, anybody?

15:05.500 --> 15:08.500
This menu is so sweet.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.500
It has size.

15:11.500 --> 15:12.500
Go to the side.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.500
Hard shell taco salad.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.500
Click on sides of me.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.500
Okay.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.500
Check out the fucking, because I feel like it's a terrible size.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.500
I like the empty.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.500
Yeah.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.500
So they maybe don't have size.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.500
I'm going to jump the car up on that one.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.500
Pork green chili sounds good.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.500
So okay.

15:28.500 --> 15:32.500
Let's start a dish and then also what kind of gun you would have with that.

15:32.500 --> 15:35.500
I'm going to have the pork green chili with an oozy.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.500
Yeah.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.500
Serve to the corner of flower tortilla.

15:40.500 --> 15:47.500
Can I have an AK47 and a chili cheese, rise and add grilled chicken.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.500
The little shooters meal.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.500
Yeah.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.500
That's when I was just looking at some of them.

15:52.500 --> 15:57.500
I think I'm going to go little shooters burger.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.500
Which is a three ounce patty.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.500
Yeah.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.500
We're the sod off shot.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.500
And it's a little shooter burger.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.500
There's a little maverick smash burger.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.500
That's really good.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.500
A little maverick for a little shooter.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.500
Yeah.

16:10.500 --> 16:11.500
I like that.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.500
How about I go in on a grenade.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.500
A very green film show.

16:17.500 --> 16:18.500
That's pretty good.

16:18.500 --> 16:23.500
I'm going to get the Ron's heart attack stack with a cat.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.500
Cheesecake.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.500
One ton feels like cultural appropriation.

16:27.500 --> 16:30.500
Corn beef hash.

16:31.500 --> 16:36.500
We're the side of a fucking gun.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.500
So you ran out of gun.

16:38.500 --> 16:39.500
Yeah.

16:39.500 --> 16:40.500
Yeah.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.500
Yeah.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.500
Interesting.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.500
All right.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.500
We do have to move on full steam ahead.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.500
Okay.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.500
Wonderful.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.500
Who's?

16:48.500 --> 16:49.500
Sorry.

16:49.500 --> 16:50.500
Who was that?

16:50.500 --> 16:51.500
That's pile.

16:51.500 --> 16:52.500
That's a pile.

16:52.500 --> 16:53.500
I don't know if you met pile.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.500
Oh.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.500
Oh.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.500
To be.

16:56.500 --> 16:57.500
To be you again.

16:57.500 --> 16:58.500
You again.

16:58.500 --> 17:01.500
Pretty pile.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.500
Oh, God.

17:02.500 --> 17:03.500
Also pile.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.500
Why you see.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.500
What was he doing?

17:06.500 --> 17:07.500
He was he.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.500
He's like having trouble breathing.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.500
I think ever since he had a kid he has like a claw Dore.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.500
A orna.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.500
He's like good.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.500
Tell me serious.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.500
Yeah.

17:17.500 --> 17:18.500
Yeah.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.500
You've heard back.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.500
Yeah.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.500
I won.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.500
Okay.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.500
What's the update?

17:24.500 --> 17:26.500
How much did we lose in one?

17:26.500 --> 17:28.500
We still uh

17:28.900 --> 17:30.900
We're just pushing on through

17:31.900 --> 17:37.900
Are we still rolling? Yeah, we're just we'll just use the boom audio for that four minutes on you just said that we're good to go

17:37.900 --> 17:42.180
It's audio from what you mean from the kid. Sorry. That's that he's getting picked it up

17:42.180 --> 17:46.300
You see that he's getting hit Jeff. How's your blood brush? It's hypertens

17:50.020 --> 17:52.020
We'll do right back

17:57.020 --> 17:59.020
And we're back

17:59.020 --> 18:03.540
Does anybody have any brothers that they'd like to get out of their system? You have your segment

18:03.540 --> 18:07.700
That's just gonna keep sprinkling it through, but I don't have much left though. Yeah, all right

18:07.700 --> 18:10.060
I sort of you know, I've combed the internet

18:10.060 --> 18:14.500
I feel like I could read a little bit more from that interview you did about how music is your the calm

18:15.500 --> 18:20.020
To your life, but no my brothers recently. Is that something I hate or something I love?

18:20.380 --> 18:23.500
I think it's like something yet we're out of time. We have to start the next segment

18:27.220 --> 18:29.220
Welcome to

18:30.220 --> 18:32.220
Hengen podcast debates

18:33.580 --> 18:43.180
There's a big election on Tuesday in California. What is it? It's the Democratic primary with an incumbent president got it. So not that big I guess, but I

18:44.180 --> 18:48.220
Thought that there is a subject matter that I think is worth debating

18:48.220 --> 18:51.380
I wanted on you on this episode. She's not available

18:51.900 --> 18:57.020
But it needs to happen and that's why we will be debating the question

19:00.580 --> 19:06.700
But and what's the question are we so Roy? Sorry. This theme songs a lot there we go longer than you thought

19:07.020 --> 19:13.620
The question is is studio G truly better than studio H is it go did?

19:13.900 --> 19:19.700
Yes studio go did goty we are going to be doing a Lincoln Douglas debate

19:19.980 --> 19:21.980
Meaning with randomly assigned positions

19:22.980 --> 19:27.620
It will be structured like a Lincoln Douglas debate. It will be an affirmative construction

19:27.820 --> 19:33.140
Did you do debate in high school how do you know all these words I swam okay? And I swam

19:34.580 --> 19:36.580
Yeah, so far away

19:38.100 --> 19:44.140
So you're learning these words with us the Lincoln Douglas thing you knew that it's not that hard

19:44.140 --> 19:48.340
It's just a structure of debate that seems like you then you took a debate class or something

19:48.420 --> 19:53.100
I learned about it in preparation for the episode people are shocked when I put effort into this shit

19:53.660 --> 19:59.740
There's an affirmative construction meaning the person arguing that studio G is better will have

20:00.060 --> 20:01.980
Three minutes because we're doing it we're doing it half time

20:01.980 --> 20:06.820
There's it's supposed to be 40 minutes. We're doing it for 20. Yeah, you three minutes to set up your argument

20:06.820 --> 20:13.980
Why studio G is better than studio H and I think we should randomly assign now and then I'll explain the structure

20:13.980 --> 20:16.420
So that people can be thinking about it. How does it work with three people?

20:16.580 --> 20:18.740
It's going to be teams of two so I'm going to participate

20:18.740 --> 20:22.180
Okay, I'm interested in the SUNY pay you to be in the commercial. I don't want to brag

20:22.500 --> 20:24.500
But it was scale

20:25.140 --> 20:26.980
I want to brag but it was minimum wage

20:27.620 --> 20:29.940
Okay, ready. Yeah, I have put a

20:30.900 --> 20:36.580
Wheel of names together. So this is to prove that this is randomly assigned and I'm only saying this because if I get a

20:36.580 --> 20:41.460
Science studio G I don't want people to be like Jeff prepared his arguments I had a time because my and they're gonna be pretty strong

20:41.460 --> 20:45.700
I also want people to know that if I'm assigned that I'm supposed to be saying that studio H is better than studio G

20:45.700 --> 20:47.700
It's going to be tough for me

20:47.700 --> 20:55.300
So here we go. So seems like we have a lot of caveats about the segment that you start we'll be arguing for studio G is going to be

20:55.860 --> 21:01.140
Miles so I have to say that this studio is better than the other way exactly right. Okay. Absolutely. I'm happy to thank you

21:01.460 --> 21:03.460
Quiet, sorry, quiet. And

21:05.140 --> 21:07.140
And

21:07.140 --> 21:14.180
Everybody else no I'm going to spin it again because who's going to be Miles teammate rooting for studio G here. We go spinning the wheel

21:14.820 --> 21:21.700
Quiet, quiet, I hope it's not Jeff. Yes! Studio G!

21:23.540 --> 21:26.500
What that is the happiest I've ever seen Jeff

21:27.940 --> 21:32.340
He just screamed. He just gweed. Look at that. What is that?

21:34.340 --> 21:38.980
He was so pissed when the studio had started. It's hard to believe that none of his arguments are going to be

21:38.980 --> 21:43.780
preplayed. I know because he clearly did a lot of work on this. Well, I didn't see his the thing spinning.

21:43.780 --> 21:50.180
Oh, it will be it'll be on the episode. I just can't screen shares well. It's just in studio H. So in that way I guess studio G is not as good.

21:50.740 --> 21:59.700
Oh, that's one for me in a mirror. I'll get a mirror. We'll be arguing for studio H. Miles and I will be holding it down with studio Jeff. Absolutely. All right. Here we go

22:00.820 --> 22:06.180
Affirmative construction Miles and I have three minutes on the board to argue for

22:06.900 --> 22:14.340
studio G. Well, first and foremost, I got to say the high ceilings for a guy like me that struggled with being tall. My entire

22:14.340 --> 22:22.900
fucking life really nice to have. I think when you walk into studio G, you get that podcast feeling of quiet.

22:24.180 --> 22:32.020
You get that nice nice. So it's litter the walls with nothing but sound panels on them.

22:36.180 --> 22:46.180
The tables as far as the eye can't see. Curtains hungst among the walls. Purple they may be.

22:48.420 --> 22:56.260
Oh, I. Oh, I shed a tear upon my knife for a loft. They may be very busy.

22:58.260 --> 22:59.220
What is in the law?

22:59.540 --> 23:09.620
I don't know Jeff. I think to have walls of charcoal is something that has always brought me a smile to see. Not really. You hated charcoal.

23:10.180 --> 23:21.940
I think the lighting is there there compared to studio H. I don't have to color correct as much. Casey Donnie you texted me. He said

23:22.340 --> 23:39.060
and I quote he said the lighting in studio H is also good. He was lying to not only me, but also himself because I think that the viewers at home would agree and have us on last week's episode of this show

23:39.060 --> 23:50.580
Dregments that people pop off of the charcoal. People's skin tones are trueer to their real nature. The studio set up is spacious.

23:51.140 --> 24:01.460
That I don't mind that there's posters that could be anything, but we chose to advertise a podcast network that people are already watching.

24:02.180 --> 24:09.380
People are already watching head gum. Yet we still advertise. That's free ad space. When Jake Johnson is sitting right where miles is asses,

24:09.940 --> 24:17.540
he's adorning the studio with energy that we get to pick up on. He puts down the racket we pick it up and we're playing. We're just dancing.

24:17.540 --> 24:23.140
And I got to tell you guys, Jake Johnson being able to sit where my ass must be.

24:24.100 --> 24:31.780
Has it been three minutes? It's been two and fifteen seconds. Unbelievably slow. And if I may go on a diet ride, of course,

24:31.780 --> 24:42.020
somebody called into my advice podcast and said and asked for advice about a problem. Then they called into Jake Johnson advice podcast.

24:42.020 --> 24:49.620
This is actually sorry. It's the affirmative construction of studio. It's not so nice for me. Yeah. And I must say that my advice was better,

24:49.620 --> 24:55.060
but I thought it was funny that two headgums show the same guy calling bullshit. Wow, that's not good.

24:55.060 --> 25:04.260
Yeah, that's why you think studio G is better than studio A and thus I must conclude the walls behind the eyes are beauty.

25:05.060 --> 25:16.740
They are great. The G stands for grace. Creme. The G stands for grace. The G stands for grace.

25:17.700 --> 25:26.020
Okay, that's the end of that's the end of our time. I will say that the next part is a cross-examination from y'all 90 seconds.

25:26.020 --> 25:31.860
You have to ask us questions about what we have just set up. So I hope you're listening. I hope you're taking notes.

25:31.860 --> 25:41.860
You also get to set up your negative construction. Why is studio H better than studio G? 90 seconds on the board, have at it.

25:42.260 --> 25:47.060
What was the problem?

25:49.620 --> 25:56.100
Well, this isn't kind of Lincoln Douglas. Well, you know what I'll say, sort of the size of these walls are charcoal, what you like.

25:56.100 --> 26:02.340
I said the walls are howlode. I think I had bad memories. The other studio. Bad memories.

26:02.340 --> 26:09.860
Jeff would panic, run in, not supposed to say it. They're supposed to argue for studio H. She asked me a question.

26:09.940 --> 26:15.460
Well, you said the color of the walls, which is similar in studio H, are better here, but they're both charcoal.

26:15.460 --> 26:19.540
I thought you said you'd like to color. I thought you, yeah, your whole thing is you love Cola.

26:20.660 --> 26:27.300
I'm debating, yeah. I feel like you really should be studio C, cross. Nice studio J, Johnson.

26:27.860 --> 26:31.540
I was thinking C, cross, whatever you want to call that one. G, Jeff.

26:33.860 --> 26:37.380
You also said 40 seconds left for cross-examination. Yeah, you're losing the bit.

26:37.380 --> 26:41.460
Aren't the likes, the lights the same, too. A lot of the things you like in that room.

26:41.460 --> 26:46.820
It's pretty identical. Well, the these are the circular aperture slash amaran panel.

26:46.820 --> 26:52.980
We are not allowed to respond. Soft fucking Douglas. Was it being tall, really hard for you?

26:54.020 --> 26:59.540
Yeah, I'm sorry. I ever since. This is just a conversation. No, that's a part of my cross-examination.

26:59.540 --> 27:03.380
Highlands here. High-grivalids. Yeah, you can fit in either studio.

27:03.380 --> 27:07.060
If anything, the other one's a little bit more cozy. I was going to say cozy. I could have hardly seen you.

27:07.060 --> 27:13.620
No, it's a bug. Yeah. You're too busy. How about a day? Did you get scolded?

27:13.620 --> 27:17.220
Did you get scolded? Did you get scolded for playing copyright music? I'm not a lawyer.

27:17.220 --> 27:21.300
I don't know how to cross-examine. All right. That was pretty weak.

27:21.300 --> 27:25.060
I'm glad I wasn't paired with a mirror. What? All right. Here we go.

27:26.260 --> 27:30.660
Half your time was spent on a poem. I couldn't be that critical. It's hard to cross-examine.

27:31.060 --> 27:36.180
Yeah, it's a perfect experiment. Well, now you get to set up your argument. You have three and a

27:36.180 --> 27:41.620
half minutes to set up your own life. Here's what I will say. This has to be done.

27:42.340 --> 27:45.780
Okay. This is the segment. We're already in the debate. It has to be 20 minutes.

27:45.780 --> 27:48.420
Okay. Here we go. Yeah. Here we go. Three minutes.

27:48.420 --> 27:51.300
Fucker. Three minutes has to be done. He said.

27:51.300 --> 27:56.420
That thing way. Three minutes has to be done. Three and a half minutes on the board. Set up your argument.

27:56.500 --> 28:02.740
Why studio H is better? Okay. What sparks the most joy to you? I would feel, have you ever

28:02.740 --> 28:07.780
heard of the first waffle theory? No. So this, I'm a first waffle. If you're an oldest kid,

28:07.780 --> 28:11.860
you're a first waffle. And it's that when you're when you're making waffles, the first one's

28:11.860 --> 28:18.260
kind of a tester. And then as you make more waffles, they get better. Yeah. But you have to love

28:18.260 --> 28:23.860
every, you have to love the first one the most. Yeah. Because they showed you the way. And it also

28:24.340 --> 28:29.300
took off from zero to lawful is a, is a great moment. Once you start having second, third,

28:29.300 --> 28:34.660
fourth waffle, you start getting sick. Yeah. You got full. Yeah. You got too much. The studio, as we

28:34.660 --> 28:40.580
experienced it was the platonic ideal of a studio. This studio H, perfect bite. This one,

28:40.580 --> 28:44.900
too big. Yeah. It's a little bit too big. And Jeff is a little too far away. I can't quite see

28:44.900 --> 28:52.180
everything. I can't see it all. The thing is that room was built as a studio. It is glass and closed.

28:52.180 --> 28:59.540
It is sound proof. It was created to be a studio. This was a converted green room. It was a conference

28:59.540 --> 29:06.580
room. It was a loft. I mean, there's things are thrown about kind of haphazardly. We did the best

29:06.580 --> 29:14.660
with what we could. But this was improvised. This wasn't, and this wasn't ever meant to be a studio.

29:15.380 --> 29:20.660
So the fact that it looks pretty good is a testament to the people that built it, but it wasn't

29:20.660 --> 29:26.420
designed to be this. And you want to talk about butts in the seats. That one's been having

29:26.420 --> 29:31.140
famous butts in those seats for years. More. What kind of famous is it in there?

29:31.700 --> 29:36.740
You've been in 50 seconds. I mean, we know crosses been there. Yeah. We know Bateman. Yeah.

29:36.740 --> 29:41.540
Bateman was here. Yeah. Bateman was definitely there. Bateman didn't even come in this room.

29:41.540 --> 29:47.540
He didn't even have to. He didn't even want to. He didn't even see it. Because this is a secondary space.

29:47.620 --> 29:54.420
Did you get overflow? Do you give snacks to Bateman? We offered, but he didn't need slash

29:54.420 --> 29:58.580
long. He wouldn't. He wouldn't need a thing. He didn't have to have it. He said, I know it's

29:58.580 --> 30:03.780
dark. I didn't have anything. I just can't imagine him chowing down a granola bar. A monster

30:03.780 --> 30:09.060
elastic. Yeah. I can Douglas. We will have time for a second. And it will be about this now.

30:09.060 --> 30:15.780
And it will be about that. That other studio is also closer to the entrance. So it's like

30:15.780 --> 30:21.220
easy access in easy access. Also, the other studio has a window, which is kind of fun. You can see in.

30:22.260 --> 30:29.060
This is sort of a dark corner lit up. The sound paneling though, it is completely enclosures us.

30:29.060 --> 30:33.700
It's also there's like, you know, like white spaces. It seems like kind of like we put up as much

30:33.700 --> 30:39.780
as we could as quickly as possible, but it's not like professionally done. In the other studio,

30:39.780 --> 30:49.860
everything is flush. 40 seconds. Yeah. Down to a tea. It's cozy. Who wants a podcast with more than three

30:49.860 --> 30:57.060
people on it? It's overkill. And only that studio has money hidden in it. Oh, yeah. There's Jeff

30:57.060 --> 31:02.500
know about the cash. What? It's table behind the drywall. Yeah. It's treasure. You never looked

31:02.500 --> 31:08.340
behind the painting. Very treasure. I never thought you. I mean, open this sheet. It just looks

31:08.340 --> 31:14.740
out into the backyard. It's just there is no that in studio H. You know what I mean? There is just

31:15.700 --> 31:26.020
everything around you is designed. What's that? That really sounds like the camera is

31:26.020 --> 31:31.780
stopped rolling the sound. End of negative construction in first or buttole. Beginning,

31:31.780 --> 31:36.660
cross-examination. Miles, we have 90 seconds. Make them count. When a theme is so

31:36.660 --> 31:46.420
arrived that the Edgham studio. What studio do you want them to sit? G. It's got to be G. It's not a

31:46.420 --> 31:54.740
baby. Because you don't want the famous out of E. G. You don't want the famous to be sitting there

31:54.740 --> 32:02.180
and then what? Keeping Tom's what their penis is out. Looking through the window at them,

32:02.260 --> 32:09.060
Jason Vivian Bateman. You don't want that. You want them in the back with the weird. What's

32:09.060 --> 32:14.980
up up there, by the way? The loft. It looks like it was sealing off and now you can sort of see

32:14.980 --> 32:19.300
through it. There's a fiber glass that lets you see through it. And what's up there though? You can't

32:19.300 --> 32:24.820
act this. You can't. It's an accessible. It's an artificial sealing for that. I didn't want that.

32:25.940 --> 32:31.380
No, he was an hungry. He wasn't comfortable enough to eat in studio H. In here, he would

32:31.460 --> 32:38.020
shout down. It would have been back in Alien. Grinola bites with a yogurt raisin.

32:38.020 --> 32:43.300
Can I have a not a soda after a prebiotic soda until he stayed for an hour? Until he

32:43.300 --> 32:49.220
shit himself wrong. Can I tell you what I saw? What? That's not it. This uh, when I got it.

32:49.220 --> 32:59.220
Exactly Lincoln Douglas, but I'll let it slide. Steevo 8. A goger. No! Out of his ass.

32:59.220 --> 33:04.220
That's really the only thing you can do.

33:04.220 --> 33:06.220
Everybody.

33:06.220 --> 33:08.220
Well, end of cross examination.

33:08.220 --> 33:09.220
Here we go.

33:09.220 --> 33:11.220
First affirmative rebuttal.

33:11.220 --> 33:12.220
What did you see?

33:12.220 --> 33:15.220
We are not adhering to the Owing conduct was done.

33:15.220 --> 33:16.220
Okay.

33:16.220 --> 33:17.220
I don't know.

33:17.220 --> 33:18.220
You can say it because it's our turn, right?

33:18.220 --> 33:19.220
Yeah.

33:19.220 --> 33:20.220
It is not.

33:20.220 --> 33:22.220
And I wish it was.

33:22.220 --> 33:24.220
You were supposed to be asking us questions.

33:24.220 --> 33:26.220
Just then, and then we were supposed to rebutt the questions.

33:26.220 --> 33:27.220
And now what are we doing?

33:27.220 --> 33:29.220
If a whole link in Douglas, I think it's fell on to pieces.

33:29.220 --> 33:30.220
Yeah.

33:30.220 --> 33:31.220
Yeah.

33:31.220 --> 33:32.220
So, how do you tell me your story?

33:32.220 --> 33:33.220
Let's do the cross examination now.

33:33.220 --> 33:34.220
And we'll hear all these stories.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.220
This is so not how I wanted this to go.

33:36.220 --> 33:37.220
Okay.

33:37.220 --> 33:38.220
It never is, man.

33:38.220 --> 33:39.220
It is sometimes.

33:39.220 --> 33:41.220
Dregments was fine.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.220
I know.

33:42.220 --> 33:43.220
Jack.

33:43.220 --> 33:46.220
So, what are we doing now?

33:46.220 --> 33:48.220
Well, we want to hear all these cross examination.

33:48.220 --> 33:49.220
Okay.

33:49.220 --> 33:52.220
So, I opened the door for statement when he came in.

33:52.220 --> 33:56.220
And he, on young Casey, we're already in the studio.

33:56.220 --> 33:57.220
David was in the studio.

33:57.220 --> 34:00.220
So, it was just me and him.

34:00.220 --> 34:03.220
And then David walks out of the studio into the hallway.

34:03.220 --> 34:05.220
So, now it's three of us there.

34:05.220 --> 34:07.220
And David goes,

34:07.220 --> 34:09.220
Jason, bait, man.

34:09.220 --> 34:11.220
Jason, bait, man.

34:11.220 --> 34:13.220
And then Jason, bait, man.

34:13.220 --> 34:15.220
And response lifts up his sweater.

34:15.220 --> 34:16.220
Beautiful blue sweater.

34:16.220 --> 34:17.220
Nips out and goes.

34:17.220 --> 34:21.220
And then I was there, too.

34:21.220 --> 34:24.220
And then I was there, too.

34:24.220 --> 34:25.220
Oh, my.

34:25.220 --> 34:26.220
Was that improvised?

34:26.220 --> 34:27.220
Or was that a thing they do?

34:27.220 --> 34:28.220
One minute left.

34:28.220 --> 34:29.220
Seems improvised.

34:29.220 --> 34:30.220
Cross examination.

34:30.220 --> 34:31.220
It's not cute.

34:31.220 --> 34:32.220
They're that close.

34:32.220 --> 34:33.220
I just feel it.

34:33.220 --> 34:34.220
That's fun.

34:34.220 --> 34:35.220
You know what this is?

34:35.220 --> 34:37.220
This is a Lincoln dumb-ass debate.

34:37.220 --> 34:38.220
Fine.

34:38.220 --> 34:39.220
Not you guys.

34:39.220 --> 34:40.220
Yeah.

34:40.220 --> 34:42.220
Clearly not.

34:42.220 --> 34:43.220
Clearly not.

34:43.220 --> 34:44.220
Let's the question.

34:44.220 --> 34:45.220
We're supposed to ask you guys.

34:45.220 --> 34:47.220
Ask you guys questions about studio age.

34:47.220 --> 34:48.220
Yes.

34:48.220 --> 34:49.220
We try to poke holes in our theater.

34:49.220 --> 34:50.220
Here's, all right.

34:51.220 --> 34:53.220
This is some good for me.

34:53.220 --> 34:54.220
This face?

34:54.220 --> 34:55.220
No.

34:55.220 --> 34:57.220
I worked hard on both of them.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.220
And it looks great.

34:58.220 --> 34:59.220
Thank you.

34:59.220 --> 35:00.220
We still, you look great.

35:00.220 --> 35:01.220
It's clever.

35:01.220 --> 35:02.220
It's really bright in here.

35:02.220 --> 35:08.220
There does need to be a clear choice, which is the flagship studio.

35:08.220 --> 35:11.220
All of Polo Ralph Lauren's stores are amazing.

35:11.220 --> 35:17.220
But the flagship one on 57th and Park is going to be the one they are most excited about.

35:17.220 --> 35:18.220
God.

35:19.220 --> 35:21.220
Oh, what a bummer that you're going to do.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.220
Yeah.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.220
I don't think anything I just said was correct.

35:24.220 --> 35:26.220
57th and Park.

35:26.220 --> 35:28.220
They don't even intersect.

35:28.220 --> 35:29.220
I don't.

35:29.220 --> 35:31.220
The sound makes me think the GoPro is turning off.

35:31.220 --> 35:33.220
It's like really disappointing.

35:33.220 --> 35:34.220
Because what's that?

35:37.220 --> 35:41.220
Moving on to the fucking second negative rebuttal.

35:41.220 --> 35:42.220
Okay.

35:42.220 --> 35:43.220
What are these rules?

35:43.220 --> 35:44.220
Yeah.

35:44.220 --> 35:45.220
Lincoln Douglas.

35:45.220 --> 35:46.220
Yeah.

35:46.220 --> 35:47.220
You say Lincoln Douglas.

35:47.220 --> 35:48.220
No.

35:48.220 --> 35:49.220
It's not going to be perfect.

35:49.220 --> 35:50.220
I'm not going to be perfect.

35:50.220 --> 35:51.220
I did swimming.

35:51.220 --> 35:53.220
I did theater.

35:53.220 --> 35:55.220
I didn't do debate.

35:55.220 --> 35:57.220
So the Lincoln Douglas we're doing today is my first.

35:57.220 --> 35:58.220
It's not going to be perfect.

35:58.220 --> 36:00.220
I'm not getting any help from you guys either.

36:00.220 --> 36:01.220
By the way, it seems like you don't even want to do it.

36:01.220 --> 36:02.220
I was sort of in.

36:02.220 --> 36:04.220
But it wasn't called debate.

36:04.220 --> 36:05.220
What was it called?

36:05.220 --> 36:06.220
Something else.

36:06.220 --> 36:07.220
Math.

36:07.220 --> 36:08.220
No, what's the word?

36:08.220 --> 36:09.220
There's a word for it.

36:09.220 --> 36:10.220
It's like.

36:10.220 --> 36:11.220
That rhetoric.

36:11.220 --> 36:12.220
Something like that.

36:12.220 --> 36:13.220
Like I was on something where we went.

36:13.220 --> 36:14.220
Do you have more trial or something?

36:14.220 --> 36:15.220
Yeah, yeah.

36:15.220 --> 36:16.220
Something like that.

36:16.220 --> 36:17.220
I'm not going to be an counsel.

36:17.220 --> 36:18.220
Lincoln lawyer.

36:18.220 --> 36:19.220
It was Lincoln logs.

36:19.220 --> 36:20.220
We're Lincoln logs.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.220
Yeah.

36:21.220 --> 36:22.220
I lived in a house.

36:22.220 --> 36:24.220
I did swimming.

36:24.220 --> 36:26.220
I did theater.

36:26.220 --> 36:28.220
I did debate.

36:28.220 --> 36:31.220
Who can ask for anything more?

36:31.220 --> 36:33.220
Who can ask for anything more?

36:33.220 --> 36:38.220
Studio G-Wins.

36:38.220 --> 36:40.220
What?

36:40.220 --> 36:41.220
I think so.

36:41.220 --> 36:43.220
I know you think so.

36:43.220 --> 36:44.220
Because you're on your own side.

36:44.220 --> 36:45.220
I'm not even saying that the end of the day.

36:45.220 --> 36:46.460
I'm not even saying that the end of the bait.

36:46.460 --> 36:48.860
I'm just saying Studio G wins, that's my opinion.

36:48.860 --> 36:50.340
Yeah, it obviously is your opinion.

36:50.340 --> 36:51.860
Why don't we let the people decide?

36:51.860 --> 36:52.700
Okay.

36:52.700 --> 36:56.260
I mean, the question I have is when a famous comes and they say,

36:56.260 --> 36:58.900
I want to podcast a head girl, Mr. Amiobluma Feld.

36:58.900 --> 37:00.460
What studio do you put them in?

37:00.460 --> 37:02.900
Sorry, why did the famous person that you just

37:04.020 --> 37:06.180
imitated have like a list for?

37:07.300 --> 37:10.700
I couldn't say there are or something like a five year old.

37:10.700 --> 37:11.900
I'm next question.

37:11.900 --> 37:12.980
There are no questions.

37:12.980 --> 37:15.700
It was supposed to be a Lincoln Douglas debate.

37:15.700 --> 37:16.940
It's done.

37:16.940 --> 37:19.060
Like the people weigh and we'll decide the comment.

37:19.060 --> 37:22.580
Lincoln Douglas, Lincoln Douglas, let's do JFK Nixon.

37:22.580 --> 37:24.500
Yeah, I'm not talking about the GoPro.

37:24.500 --> 37:28.380
And you guys, October and last two hours in ten,

37:28.380 --> 37:30.660
four over below yellow.

37:30.660 --> 37:32.340
And I said, nothing.

37:32.340 --> 37:36.380
No, no, no, no, no.

37:36.380 --> 37:37.820
You was 13 at the time.

37:37.820 --> 37:38.820
That's right.

37:38.820 --> 37:42.860
Oh, and then if you're

37:42.940 --> 37:49.140
listening to this vote in the comments, type studio G or studio H.

37:49.140 --> 37:50.420
And we'll tell you the votes.

37:50.420 --> 37:54.780
And on next week's episode, we will know who won.

37:58.460 --> 38:00.740
What these really, he got to go.

38:00.740 --> 38:03.100
Why do you crazy go bad?

38:03.100 --> 38:04.100
So wait.

38:04.100 --> 38:04.780
Oh, week.

38:04.780 --> 38:07.220
When they go low, we go fine.

38:08.060 --> 38:13.300
I have to pick up my son soon.

38:13.300 --> 38:15.260
Where is he?

38:15.260 --> 38:17.580
I don't know.

38:17.580 --> 38:23.500
I knew this might happen.

38:23.500 --> 38:26.820
I knew the debate might not have been there there.

38:26.820 --> 38:29.260
But there there.

38:29.260 --> 38:30.260
Of course.

38:30.260 --> 38:33.300
I came up with a backup plan.

38:33.300 --> 38:34.300
Uh-oh.

38:34.300 --> 38:36.900
I don't think we laughed enough in this episode.

38:36.980 --> 38:37.900
Laugh.

38:37.900 --> 38:38.900
Literally.

38:38.900 --> 38:39.900
OK.

38:39.900 --> 38:40.900
OK.

38:40.900 --> 38:42.900
Well, the comments are going to disagree, because even when an

38:42.900 --> 38:45.900
episode is perfect in my eyes, people hate it.

38:45.900 --> 38:49.900
What's one perfect episode for you?

38:49.900 --> 38:51.900
The post-nupcial episodes my favorite episode

38:51.900 --> 38:52.900
we've done in a while.

38:52.900 --> 38:53.900
That was a while ago, though.

38:53.900 --> 38:55.900
Dregments was good.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.900
Dregments was fine.

38:58.900 --> 38:59.900
All right.

38:59.900 --> 39:02.900
DreskonsoulSystem.co.uk.

39:02.900 --> 39:05.900
By the way, this is a terrible function of the studio that we're looking

39:06.900 --> 39:07.900
behind the piano.

39:07.900 --> 39:09.900
I have to go like this upside down.

39:09.900 --> 39:10.900
I can't see it.

39:10.900 --> 39:11.900
Yeah.

39:11.900 --> 39:12.900
We didn't laugh a lot during this episode.

39:12.900 --> 39:14.900
We did, but I guess you pre-wrote that.

39:14.900 --> 39:15.900
So we'll go a lot later.

39:15.900 --> 39:16.900
Did you pre-writer?

39:16.900 --> 39:17.900
This is my backup plan.

39:17.900 --> 39:20.900
If the Lincoln Douglas debate was anticipated in well.

39:20.900 --> 39:24.900
Well, I'll participate for about seven more minutes.

39:24.900 --> 39:26.900
This is...

39:26.900 --> 39:27.900
Who is this?

39:27.900 --> 39:29.900
So why don't you guys follow his instructions?

39:29.900 --> 39:31.900
No, seriously.

39:31.900 --> 39:32.900
Put your hands by out.

39:32.900 --> 39:33.900
Follow his instructions.

39:33.900 --> 39:38.900
You might need to push your chairs back a little bit, guys, for this.

39:38.900 --> 39:43.900
And just go out all together.

39:43.900 --> 39:45.900
Good.

39:45.900 --> 39:46.900
That's easy, isn't it?

39:46.900 --> 39:47.900
It does not have to be too hard.

39:47.900 --> 39:49.900
It's once more.

39:49.900 --> 39:51.900
Okay.

39:51.900 --> 39:55.900
Just lift your feet up and put your feet down.

39:55.900 --> 39:58.900
I got it.

39:58.900 --> 40:00.900
But this is boring Simon's arm.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.900
What the fuck is this?

40:03.900 --> 40:04.900
What?

40:04.900 --> 40:05.900
Just the lab?

40:09.900 --> 40:11.900
What I want you to do is push your stomach out.

40:11.900 --> 40:13.900
What is this video called?

40:13.900 --> 40:14.900
It's called how to laugh.

40:14.900 --> 40:16.900
No, please, teaching people how to laugh.

40:16.900 --> 40:17.900
How to laugh?

40:17.900 --> 40:18.900
Up here is the other laugh.

40:18.900 --> 40:20.900
How to make yourself laugh.

40:20.900 --> 40:21.900
It's just...

40:21.900 --> 40:22.900
It leaves stress and worry.

40:22.900 --> 40:23.900
Okay, wait.

40:23.900 --> 40:24.900
Sorry, you're missing me.

40:25.900 --> 40:26.900
No.

40:26.900 --> 40:28.900
You don't know when you're out.

40:28.900 --> 40:29.900
You're stomach.

40:29.900 --> 40:31.900
I think I'm gonna give myself a hernia.

40:31.900 --> 40:33.900
It's forcing the error out.

40:33.900 --> 40:34.900
You can.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.900
Learn how to laugh.

40:36.900 --> 40:40.900
Is this what Kyle was doing when he's got that?

40:40.900 --> 40:46.900
You're gonna take this seriously then.

40:46.900 --> 40:48.900
Maybe you don't deserve to laugh.

40:48.900 --> 40:50.900
We were laughing by God.

40:50.900 --> 40:52.900
Just follow his instruction.

40:52.900 --> 40:53.900
Check it out.

40:53.900 --> 41:10.900
This is the happiest I've seen you this whole time.

41:10.900 --> 41:14.900
This is the happiest I've seen you this whole time.

41:14.900 --> 41:22.900
The happiest I've seen you this whole time.

41:22.900 --> 41:25.900
I don't like this guy.

41:25.900 --> 41:27.900
He's fucking weirdo.

41:27.900 --> 41:30.900
He's teaching alien that a lot.

41:30.900 --> 41:32.900
He's like having breathing.

41:32.900 --> 41:33.900
He's having an engine.

41:33.900 --> 41:35.900
The fuck is that?

41:35.900 --> 41:36.900
We all give him the couch.

41:36.900 --> 41:39.900
I just want all four of us to be doing that.

41:40.900 --> 41:54.900
That was the worst.

41:54.900 --> 41:59.900
Let's see you saying that we weren't laughing enough this whole episode was just building up.

42:09.900 --> 42:15.900
Thanks for watching.

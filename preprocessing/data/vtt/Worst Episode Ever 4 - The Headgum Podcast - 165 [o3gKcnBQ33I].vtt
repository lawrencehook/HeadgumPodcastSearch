00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:02.000 --> 00:29.260
I mean it's another edition of the head-gum podcast with a very special guest Andrew

00:29.260 --> 00:36.260
Pile.

00:36.260 --> 00:37.260
Thanks for having me.

00:37.260 --> 00:39.260
You were just saying that you have some news you wanted to share?

00:39.260 --> 00:41.260
No, it's actually private.

00:41.260 --> 00:43.260
I wanted to leave off the show.

00:43.260 --> 00:44.260
That's what you said.

00:44.260 --> 00:45.260
I thought you said leave off.

00:45.260 --> 00:46.260
Yes.

00:46.260 --> 00:47.260
I could leave the news now.

00:47.260 --> 00:48.260
That's why I said it before.

00:48.260 --> 00:49.260
We had started recording.

00:49.260 --> 00:50.260
Okay.

00:50.260 --> 00:53.260
Well it's just sometimes you like plant ideas that we can kind of call back to.

00:53.260 --> 00:54.260
Okay.

00:54.260 --> 00:55.260
Okay.

00:55.260 --> 00:56.260
Okay.

00:56.260 --> 00:57.260
Okay.

00:57.260 --> 00:58.260
Okay.

00:58.260 --> 00:59.260
Okay.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.260
Okay.

01:00.260 --> 01:01.260
Okay.

01:01.260 --> 01:02.260
Okay.

01:02.260 --> 01:03.260
Okay.

01:03.260 --> 01:04.260
Okay.

01:04.260 --> 01:05.260
Okay.

01:05.260 --> 01:06.260
Okay.

01:06.260 --> 01:07.260
Okay.

01:07.260 --> 01:08.260
Okay.

01:08.260 --> 01:09.260
Okay.

01:09.260 --> 01:10.260
Okay.

01:10.260 --> 01:11.260
Okay.

01:11.260 --> 01:12.260
Okay.

01:12.260 --> 01:13.260
Okay.

01:13.260 --> 01:14.260
Okay.

01:14.260 --> 01:15.260
Okay.

01:15.260 --> 01:16.260
Okay.

01:16.260 --> 01:17.260
Okay.

01:17.260 --> 01:18.260
Okay.

01:18.260 --> 01:19.260
Okay.

01:19.260 --> 01:20.260
Okay.

01:20.260 --> 01:21.260
Okay.

01:22.260 --> 01:24.260
You can register as independent.

01:24.260 --> 01:25.260
Yeah.

01:25.260 --> 01:27.260
Um, what's the point of that?

01:27.260 --> 01:28.260
Yeah.

01:28.260 --> 01:31.260
So it's on the record.

01:31.260 --> 01:33.260
You like when things are on the record.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.260
Is that fair to say?

01:34.260 --> 01:35.260
Sometimes.

01:35.260 --> 01:36.260
Okay.

01:36.260 --> 01:37.260
So I prefer if something's that.

01:37.260 --> 01:38.260
Avenue.

01:38.260 --> 01:39.260
I think we should say.

01:39.260 --> 01:40.260
Avenue.

01:40.260 --> 01:41.260
Is that not where you live?

01:41.260 --> 01:42.260
No.

01:42.260 --> 01:43.260
No.

01:43.260 --> 01:44.260
Maria.

01:44.260 --> 01:46.260
What time is it there?

01:46.260 --> 01:47.260
550.

01:47.260 --> 01:50.260
And then pile where is it where you are?

01:51.260 --> 01:52.260
Um, it is.

01:52.260 --> 01:53.260
Yeah.

01:53.260 --> 01:54.260
It's about 556.

01:54.260 --> 01:55.260
pile.

01:55.260 --> 01:56.260
Why does it look like you're.

01:56.260 --> 01:57.260
There's snow behind you.

01:57.260 --> 01:58.260
That's grass.

01:58.260 --> 02:00.260
I think it's just the light.

02:00.260 --> 02:01.260
I'm in the basement.

02:01.260 --> 02:03.260
So it's very bright out.

02:03.260 --> 02:06.260
These are very special edition of the episodes.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.260
Yeah.

02:07.260 --> 02:09.260
Is that fair to say?

02:09.260 --> 02:11.260
I guess that's fair.

02:11.260 --> 02:12.260
I don't know man.

02:12.260 --> 02:14.260
Welcome to.

02:14.260 --> 02:15.260
Casey.

02:15.260 --> 02:19.260
What do you think this is going to be?

02:19.260 --> 02:20.260
Well.

02:20.260 --> 02:21.260
Wow.

02:21.260 --> 02:23.260
I'm coming in real hot on my own headphones.

02:23.260 --> 02:24.260
Um.

02:24.260 --> 02:25.260
Well.

02:25.260 --> 02:26.260
I know.

02:26.260 --> 02:27.260
I know that.

02:27.260 --> 02:34.260
I'm just said that you requested us specifically.

02:34.260 --> 02:36.260
It's the study hall episode.

02:36.260 --> 02:37.260
Of course.

02:37.260 --> 02:39.260
It's the study hall episode man.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.260
We're going to brush up on some topics that not a lot of people have studied.

02:42.260 --> 02:46.260
Is that why you're dressed like an English teacher?

02:47.260 --> 02:49.260
A cool English teacher.

02:49.260 --> 02:50.260
Yeah.

02:50.260 --> 02:53.260
Although a compliment from you is sort of like an insult from anyone else.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.260
Um.

02:54.260 --> 02:57.260
That is exactly why I went with the professorial vibe.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.260
Right?

02:58.260 --> 03:00.260
Can you explain why?

03:00.260 --> 03:01.260
Can you explain why?

03:01.260 --> 03:02.260
Why us?

03:02.260 --> 03:03.260
Why y'all?

03:03.260 --> 03:05.260
Y'all are the most studious amongst us.

03:05.260 --> 03:06.260
Is that true?

03:06.260 --> 03:08.260
You think Brad Hild could then handle the shit?

03:08.260 --> 03:09.260
He's always climbing.

03:09.260 --> 03:10.260
I don't know what's going to happen.

03:10.260 --> 03:11.260
Joel?

03:11.260 --> 03:14.260
Brad Hild is like a caroac mountain climbing Dharma bomb.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.260
Yeah.

03:15.260 --> 03:18.260
He can't handle actually grinding.

03:18.260 --> 03:19.260
Actually studying shit.

03:19.260 --> 03:20.260
Okay.

03:20.260 --> 03:21.260
Okay.

03:21.260 --> 03:22.260
You agree.

03:22.260 --> 03:24.260
Okay.

03:24.260 --> 03:26.260
Joel is busy.

03:26.260 --> 03:28.260
He's more of an athlete.

03:28.260 --> 03:30.260
He's not so much a athlete.

03:30.260 --> 03:36.260
And if he was a studyer, he would be a athlete because he's sort of more a stem guy.

03:36.260 --> 03:38.260
He's not so much into the humanities I would say.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.260
And he kind of lacks a certain humanity we should say.

03:41.260 --> 03:42.260
Sure.

03:42.260 --> 03:43.260
Sure.

03:43.260 --> 03:44.260
Sure.

03:44.260 --> 03:45.260
Don't just say sure.

03:45.260 --> 03:46.260
Say, I agree.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.260
I agree with part of it.

03:48.260 --> 03:51.260
Pile, how long did it take you to get your master's?

03:51.260 --> 03:53.260
I don't have a master's.

03:53.260 --> 03:55.260
Then why do we get him on the show?

03:55.260 --> 03:56.260
Why are you asking me?

03:56.260 --> 03:57.260
I don't know.

03:57.260 --> 03:58.260
We haven't had him on for a long time.

03:58.260 --> 03:59.260
People are requesting him.

03:59.260 --> 04:00.260
I don't know.

04:00.260 --> 04:01.260
I'm sort of my loyal.

04:01.260 --> 04:02.260
Lesting me.

04:02.260 --> 04:03.260
Well, nobody really.

04:03.260 --> 04:05.260
But people were making fun of you.

04:05.260 --> 04:08.260
We said something on the last week's episode.

04:08.260 --> 04:10.260
We mentioned you and then somebody commented Andrew Pile.

04:10.260 --> 04:13.260
So I was like, oh, we should get Pile back on the show, right?

04:14.260 --> 04:15.260
Last week's episode.

04:15.260 --> 04:18.260
So Friday scheduled this before that one line.

04:18.260 --> 04:20.260
What is this show?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.260
If we're not doing the study well.

04:22.260 --> 04:24.260
Why are we listening to this?

04:24.260 --> 04:28.260
This is ambient music to study too.

04:28.260 --> 04:31.260
I feel like people are now kind of on the low five beats.

04:31.260 --> 04:33.260
You want low five beats?

04:33.260 --> 04:34.260
Yeah.

04:34.260 --> 04:35.260
To chill.

04:35.260 --> 04:36.260
Like the study too.

04:36.260 --> 04:37.260
Yeah.

04:37.260 --> 04:40.260
Low five hip hop radio would be to relax slash study too.

04:40.260 --> 04:41.260
You guys happy now?

04:41.260 --> 04:42.260
Yeah.

04:42.260 --> 04:44.260
Can you turn it down actually a little bit?

04:44.260 --> 04:45.260
Yeah.

04:45.260 --> 04:46.260
I can't hear anything.

04:46.260 --> 04:47.260
God.

04:47.260 --> 04:48.260
How's that?

04:48.260 --> 04:49.260
Hello?

04:49.260 --> 04:50.260
I'd say even a little bit.

04:50.260 --> 04:52.260
Lower than that.

04:52.260 --> 04:53.260
Yeah.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.260
This is not how a study all is supposed to begin.

04:55.260 --> 04:57.260
Well, it's ambient music.

04:57.260 --> 04:59.260
I never had study hall.

04:59.260 --> 05:00.260
You never had a free period?

05:00.260 --> 05:03.260
No, I had had classes every period.

05:03.260 --> 05:06.260
So that's why you're on the show.

05:06.260 --> 05:07.260
Okay.

05:07.260 --> 05:08.260
That's why you're on the show.

05:08.260 --> 05:10.260
Because you took advantage of every block you had.

05:10.260 --> 05:11.260
Yeah.

05:11.260 --> 05:12.260
This one second.

05:12.260 --> 05:13.260
Okay.

05:13.260 --> 05:14.260
So one second.

05:14.260 --> 05:15.260
To better yourself.

05:15.260 --> 05:19.260
To soak the sponge of your brain in the fiery

05:19.260 --> 05:22.260
Spum of joy and wisdom.

05:22.260 --> 05:23.260
Ah.

05:23.260 --> 05:25.260
What?

05:25.260 --> 05:27.260
A fiery Spum?

05:27.260 --> 05:29.260
No, it's like a come rag.

05:29.260 --> 05:30.260
Yeah.

05:30.260 --> 05:31.260
My brain is.

05:31.260 --> 05:32.260
Yes.

05:32.260 --> 05:34.260
Because it's so absorbent.

05:34.260 --> 05:36.260
Let's just get into the study.

05:36.260 --> 05:37.260
Right.

05:37.260 --> 05:38.260
All right.

05:38.260 --> 05:40.260
Let's start things off with a wiki roulette.

05:40.260 --> 05:41.260
All right.

05:41.260 --> 05:43.260
So this is like Russian roulette.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.260
But instead of a bullet, it's sort of like knowledge.

05:45.260 --> 05:46.260
Does that make sense?

05:46.260 --> 05:47.260
Sure.

05:47.260 --> 05:48.260
Yeah.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.260
I feel like we missed an act of the show.

05:50.260 --> 05:53.260
You think this should be like after the break?

05:53.260 --> 05:54.260
What do you guys want?

05:54.260 --> 05:55.260
You want to relax and just chat?

05:55.260 --> 05:56.260
Play with the fuckers up.

05:56.260 --> 05:57.260
I keep going.

05:57.260 --> 05:59.260
The one thing that the one update that pile had.

05:59.260 --> 06:00.260
He doesn't want to talk about.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.260
What else has happened?

06:01.260 --> 06:04.260
Well, it was the last time you were at Rosie's general.

06:06.260 --> 06:07.260
It's been a while.

06:07.260 --> 06:09.260
He's giving us the wrap it up.

06:09.260 --> 06:10.260
Yeah.

06:10.260 --> 06:11.260
And just sure.

06:11.260 --> 06:14.260
I have a limited amount of time because my wife is getting a masters.

06:14.260 --> 06:16.260
And so she has class.

06:16.260 --> 06:17.260
Oh, shit.

06:17.260 --> 06:18.260
And now.

06:18.260 --> 06:20.260
I just cut the black on the.

06:20.260 --> 06:21.260
I didn't know you could do it.

06:21.260 --> 06:22.260
What about us?

06:22.260 --> 06:23.260
No.

06:23.260 --> 06:24.260
We can't do that.

06:24.260 --> 06:25.260
What's she getting her master?

06:25.260 --> 06:27.260
Because Jeff could not figure out his.

06:27.260 --> 06:29.260
Not Jeff could not figure out how she is.

06:29.260 --> 06:31.260
This shit actually didn't work.

06:31.260 --> 06:34.260
We had we called on you in here and she couldn't figure it out either.

06:34.260 --> 06:36.260
Well, that was the most hellish sound check.

06:36.260 --> 06:39.260
I've better have ever been that sound check.

06:39.260 --> 06:40.260
It's just we're not.

06:40.260 --> 06:41.260
This isn't the rock and roll.

06:41.260 --> 06:43.260
It's just plugging and unplugging.

06:43.260 --> 06:44.260
Kind of.

06:44.260 --> 06:46.260
And listening to music between that.

06:46.260 --> 06:48.260
Just explosions and claps.

06:48.260 --> 06:49.260
Test test test.

06:49.260 --> 06:50.260
Test stop.

06:50.260 --> 06:51.260
Yeah.

06:51.260 --> 06:52.260
Power.

06:52.260 --> 06:53.260
Power.

06:53.260 --> 06:54.260
What?

06:54.260 --> 06:56.260
It's an Italian Argentine cook business woman.

06:56.260 --> 06:59.260
Executive and celebrity chef currently based in Brazil.

06:59.260 --> 07:01.260
Paolo was born in Argentina.

07:01.260 --> 07:03.260
The daughter of a middle class family.

07:03.260 --> 07:04.260
Her paternal and maternal.

07:05.260 --> 07:06.260
Reading Wikipedia pages.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.260
And we'll comment on this shit.

07:08.260 --> 07:09.260
It's study.

07:09.260 --> 07:10.260
Just a game.

07:10.260 --> 07:11.260
Is this a game?

07:11.260 --> 07:13.260
Do you think studying is a game?

07:13.260 --> 07:14.260
Sometime.

07:14.260 --> 07:15.260
Wow.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.260
Where'd you go to school?

07:16.260 --> 07:17.260
It can be.

07:17.260 --> 07:18.260
If you're studying to be on jeopardy.

07:18.260 --> 07:19.260
Okay.

07:19.260 --> 07:20.260
Well, that's not what's happening.

07:20.260 --> 07:21.260
It's actually a study.

07:21.260 --> 07:22.260
Where'd you go to school?

07:22.260 --> 07:23.260
Uh-huh.

07:23.260 --> 07:24.260
Massachusetts College of Art.

07:24.260 --> 07:25.260
In design.

07:25.260 --> 07:26.260
Masty.

07:26.260 --> 07:27.260
Mass art.

07:29.260 --> 07:30.260
This is massive.

07:30.260 --> 07:32.260
Not a good episode already.

07:33.260 --> 07:35.260
Why are you going to get you into the medicine?

07:35.260 --> 07:36.260
From the school.

07:36.260 --> 07:37.260
From the school.

07:37.260 --> 07:40.260
I went to Emerson because I went to College in Boston studied film.

07:40.260 --> 07:46.260
And most people in LA who studied filming in College in Boston went to Emerson.

07:46.260 --> 07:47.260
Um, let's fair.

07:47.260 --> 07:49.260
Let's just catch up before you dive into the studies.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.260
This is obviously.

07:50.260 --> 07:51.260
Is this a game?

07:51.260 --> 07:52.260
No, there's no point.

07:52.260 --> 07:53.260
Wait.

07:53.260 --> 07:54.260
What the point?

07:54.260 --> 07:55.260
So you were just reading Wikipedia page.

07:55.260 --> 07:57.260
And then we can discuss.

07:57.260 --> 07:58.260
Okay.

07:58.260 --> 07:59.260
Have you ever been in a class?

07:59.260 --> 08:00.260
What's that?

08:00.260 --> 08:01.260
Or studied.

08:01.260 --> 08:02.260
Or been in a class?

08:02.260 --> 08:03.260
Or studied.

08:03.260 --> 08:04.260
I was in role.

08:04.260 --> 08:05.260
Hmm.

08:05.260 --> 08:06.260
Yeah.

08:06.260 --> 08:10.260
Because like usually usually they say don't use Wikipedia for information.

08:10.260 --> 08:12.260
That was a decade ago, Maria.

08:12.260 --> 08:14.260
Also study hall is usually quiet.

08:14.260 --> 08:15.260
Quiet.

08:15.260 --> 08:16.260
Quiet.

08:16.260 --> 08:17.260
Yeah.

08:17.260 --> 08:18.260
The recipe.

08:18.260 --> 08:19.260
Quiet.

08:19.260 --> 08:21.260
See how that good is for audio.

08:21.260 --> 08:23.260
See how good that is for audio.

08:23.260 --> 08:24.260
Right.

08:24.260 --> 08:26.260
This guy we need to study hall.

08:26.260 --> 08:29.260
You guys didn't dress up at all.

08:29.260 --> 08:30.260
Look at pile.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.260
I'm dressed up.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.260
No.

08:32.260 --> 08:33.260
You didn't tell me anything about it.

08:33.260 --> 08:34.260
Are those from A?

08:34.260 --> 08:35.260
Are those glasses from A?

08:35.260 --> 08:36.260
I'm wearing new socks.

08:36.260 --> 08:37.260
I don't think so.

08:37.260 --> 08:38.260
Hey.

08:38.260 --> 08:39.260
Hey.

08:39.260 --> 08:40.260
Hey.

08:40.260 --> 08:41.260
I thought you meant these.

08:41.260 --> 08:43.260
I was like, hey, doesn't sell glasses.

08:43.260 --> 08:44.260
Oh.

08:44.260 --> 08:45.260
Well, you know what?

08:45.260 --> 08:47.260
For once, Maria goes to one of his mistakes.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.260
I don't know.

08:48.260 --> 08:50.260
Maybe that's why we should brush up on some of our knowledge.

08:50.260 --> 08:52.260
Can you turn off this music?

08:52.260 --> 08:53.260
You said.

08:53.260 --> 08:55.260
You said low five.

08:55.260 --> 08:56.260
I just want to go out.

08:56.260 --> 08:57.260
I just want to go out.

08:57.260 --> 08:58.260
No music.

08:58.260 --> 08:59.260
No music.

09:00.260 --> 09:03.260
She was introduced to the kitchen by her grandmother.

09:03.260 --> 09:04.260
Power.

09:04.260 --> 09:05.260
Yeah.

09:05.260 --> 09:06.260
Caracelola.

09:06.260 --> 09:07.260
Power.

09:07.260 --> 09:08.260
Caracelola.

09:08.260 --> 09:09.260
Not power.

09:09.260 --> 09:10.260
I was paying.

09:10.260 --> 09:11.260
Power.

09:11.260 --> 09:12.260
Yeah.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.260
Caracelola.

09:13.260 --> 09:14.260
Caracelola.

09:14.260 --> 09:18.260
She was a judge on Master Chef Bruce.

09:18.260 --> 09:19.260
No.

09:19.260 --> 09:20.260
No.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.260
No.

09:21.260 --> 09:22.260
No.

09:22.260 --> 09:24.260
Why is it important that we learn about Paula Caracelola?

09:24.260 --> 09:26.260
Maria, you're on a trivia team.

09:27.260 --> 09:29.260
That I was on for a semester.

09:29.260 --> 09:32.260
And you were on for like two nights.

09:32.260 --> 09:33.260
I went.

09:33.260 --> 09:34.260
Yeah.

09:34.260 --> 09:35.260
You're winning a lot recently.

09:35.260 --> 09:36.260
Yes.

09:36.260 --> 09:40.260
And how else do you learn knowledge by just fucking reading random shit

09:40.260 --> 09:41.260
on the internet?

09:41.260 --> 09:42.260
Yeah.

09:42.260 --> 09:43.260
Not this way.

09:43.260 --> 09:45.260
Do you want to read a book?

09:45.260 --> 09:46.260
I guess.

09:46.260 --> 09:47.260
Sure.

09:47.260 --> 09:48.260
I could.

09:48.260 --> 09:49.260
Really?

09:49.260 --> 09:50.260
Have you ever read a book?

09:50.260 --> 09:51.260
I don't really like reading books.

09:51.260 --> 09:52.260
I did do that.

09:52.260 --> 09:53.260
Well, book.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.260
Most recently.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.260
Yeah.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.260
I read Slaughtching towards Bethlehem.

09:57.260 --> 09:58.260
Have you guys read that?

09:58.260 --> 09:59.260
No.

09:59.260 --> 10:00.260
Jon Devi and pile?

10:00.260 --> 10:01.260

10:01.260 --> 10:02.260
Jon Devi and him.

10:02.260 --> 10:03.260

10:05.260 --> 10:06.260
I, that's the other one.

10:06.260 --> 10:07.260
Frustone.

10:07.260 --> 10:09.260
Frustone.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.260
These.

10:11.260 --> 10:12.260
Ambient poses.

10:12.260 --> 10:13.260
Middle of answer.

10:13.260 --> 10:14.260
What are you looking?

10:14.260 --> 10:15.260
Like where are you looking?

10:15.260 --> 10:16.260
Child.

10:16.260 --> 10:17.260

10:17.260 --> 10:18.260
1.

10:18.260 --> 10:19.260
2.

10:19.260 --> 10:20.260
3.

10:20.260 --> 10:21.260
4.

10:21.260 --> 10:23.260
5.

10:23.260 --> 10:24.260
6.

10:24.260 --> 10:30.260
Computer screens. Oh look here. You guys are there. So I'm just kidding. I'm you too.

10:31.540 --> 10:37.700
But we're not on your screen. Yeah, you're screen. You're screen as you

10:39.700 --> 10:45.000
We just scratch the shit people loved the luncheon learn people said oh Jeff when he does a theme

10:45.000 --> 10:48.340
The episodes are good. So I said let me put on a jacket

10:49.340 --> 10:52.340
Let me study up on some knowledge

10:54.340 --> 11:00.140
Sponge of my brain in the boiling hot spring. I play a trivia game. Oh, really?

11:03.340 --> 11:09.900
Okay, let's play a trivia game. All right. I'm mine trivia games. No, boy. The ultimate online trivia quiz

11:10.900 --> 11:16.100
Okay, okay, okay, or let's play. Let's play. Okay. All right. Here we go

11:17.100 --> 11:25.620
Do you guys want to do general knowledge or just history or yeah general knowledge? Okay, because we can also do entertainment science and nature food and drink geography or dictionary

11:26.100 --> 11:28.100
So I don't know which one sparking do we

11:29.100 --> 11:32.420
General knowledge general knowledge reporting for duty

11:34.260 --> 11:40.820
Was that okay in the 1995 Robin Williams flick what was jumanji a board game

11:41.820 --> 11:44.820
Okay, didn't even have to let's stop the answers my desk

11:45.820 --> 11:47.820
19 points for some reason

11:49.820 --> 11:55.540
The headlands that flank the entrance to the straights of your balter not the rock

11:56.100 --> 12:02.860
For once called the pillars of what a Apollo b Olympus

12:03.380 --> 12:06.180
C Hercules or D Zeus

12:06.340 --> 12:08.340
I

12:08.900 --> 12:15.700
Like the length of pillars of Apollo that sounds nice. I'm gonna go with that. Okay, do you guys want to change the answer?

12:15.700 --> 12:17.700
It's majority rules obviously so

12:17.700 --> 12:19.700
Unless you get a lot of reasons

12:19.700 --> 12:23.780
What's that I kind of like this and I like Olympus

12:25.060 --> 12:27.060
I'm gonna say Olympus

12:27.060 --> 12:29.060
That was incorrect

12:29.060 --> 12:31.060
Well, was it it was

12:31.620 --> 12:36.100
Hercules so I all that was my second by the way. It doesn't just say you're wrong on here

12:36.260 --> 12:41.140
It actually just some and you have to guess it until you get it right and if you guess it

12:41.860 --> 12:47.620
Forced you get three points instead of 19 first. Okay. Oh, okay, or this is awesome

12:48.660 --> 12:50.660
This isn't awesome

12:52.660 --> 13:00.740
It is better than in reading you reading us a week of being shown start in the 2007 film no country for old men

13:01.620 --> 13:07.380
Whimmy Lee Joan Tommy Lee Jones is correct Jones. I also heard Joan

13:08.980 --> 13:14.820
Which of these is not a type of kiss? I think pile might want to sit this one out not clearly your expertise

13:15.700 --> 13:19.220
A S cameo B butterfly sea harness D French

13:20.100 --> 13:24.980
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that they're all kisses because if you kiss, you know

13:25.380 --> 13:28.740
If somebody's like strapped up right ready to peg ferris monshi

13:29.060 --> 13:30.740
You could sort of give a smooch to the harness

13:33.780 --> 13:37.140
Sure, Marika is that ever up is that a power you've ever harnessed?

13:41.380 --> 13:48.340
I think harness harness is right answer. Yeah, according I'm so far so we get we got 12 for that one for some reason

13:48.340 --> 13:52.180
I don't understand this at all. I think it's I think it's timing

13:52.820 --> 13:54.820
Okay, this case he insert fast

13:55.620 --> 14:03.300
According to the 2012 CA world fact book which country is the highest life expense expectancy with nearly 94 years for females

14:03.860 --> 14:05.860
A Denmark

14:05.860 --> 14:12.580
That's not it. It's I mean, I mean, I mean Greenland it's Malaysia Morocco Monaco or Madagascar

14:12.580 --> 14:16.820
It's definitely Monaco. I'm gonna say Monaco. Yeah, I said Monaco at 10 points. So yeah

14:17.380 --> 14:22.580
Because there's like no one there. What was the top rated US TV show? Oh rich for the 1990 to 1991

14:22.580 --> 14:29.300
Friends, Frank though friends was not it cheers. Was it this sucks? What are you doing in the answers?

14:29.860 --> 14:31.860
The option you know, I we got to figure this shit

14:31.860 --> 14:33.860
Just find out difference

14:33.860 --> 14:36.660
You had something planned this was the plan

14:37.140 --> 14:39.140
This was the one

14:39.140 --> 14:41.140
What are you plugging 10 things in?

14:41.140 --> 14:43.860
What do you mean? That's what we have to do

14:45.140 --> 14:50.500
You've never been to the L.A. studio in this modern iteration in the post chef Kevin era

14:50.900 --> 14:55.540
All right, he's fucked this whole thing on chef Kevin. No, I love him as a person

14:57.060 --> 15:00.900
What is this? I'm taking a video from what it looks like over here

15:01.540 --> 15:03.540
We got to figure this episode out

15:03.540 --> 15:10.820
I resent the application that I'm the only reason why episodes are bad right?

15:11.380 --> 15:16.820
You guys are bringing the ice today not the heat good not a game

15:17.780 --> 15:19.780
But the ice

15:19.780 --> 15:24.340
What about thing areas of expertise that you guys are already versed in what do you guys want to fucking

15:25.300 --> 15:31.460
Wax about tell me about let's let's spread some knowledge that that's already soaked into the sponges of a rain the warm soapy

15:31.460 --> 15:37.300
Goodness it sounds like like I had the best idea for what this episode could be which is calling

15:37.300 --> 15:41.620
Yeah, do my show that I host with you guys

15:41.860 --> 15:43.860
Let's do that so we don't have to record tomorrow

15:44.820 --> 15:50.500
And then you put it on both feeds why don't you try to come and do everybody?

15:51.060 --> 15:52.420
I feel like

15:52.420 --> 15:56.980
Tension is what this episode is missing right because you guys are all on the same team. Oh, thank you

15:56.980 --> 15:59.940
I'm with you. I don't know right we're all kind of on the same team

16:00.740 --> 16:03.540
So what if it was sort of us are all of us are

16:05.940 --> 16:12.980
I like your question about what what do what knowledge do we all have to share like we all had a power point party

16:13.620 --> 16:19.460
Okay, right and then we can all like sort of try to teach some way the you know the three of us

16:19.620 --> 16:25.540
I've never done one of those power point parties. They seem fun. They seem yeah, I've never done it there. What is that

16:26.420 --> 16:29.060
Like everyone's like a new form of party for

16:30.260 --> 16:32.820
Performing like in your room party

16:32.820 --> 16:36.500
Maria get doesn't get invited to these you can tell the Tom bro

16:37.460 --> 16:44.420
So what you like to do she's gonna invite it to them. I think she'd be great at it. Yeah, by all have you read auto by Nabakov

16:45.540 --> 16:47.540
No, fuck you guys

16:49.780 --> 16:55.780
What if you learned and tell us about it Jeff? I just started it. I'm 49 pages into the shit

16:56.340 --> 17:02.580
I'm very back yesterday. What's the fact? What's the fact? Do I need to put it in the form of like a trivia question?

17:03.540 --> 17:06.580
What is this? No just tell us

17:10.180 --> 17:17.540
I'll always get this it's literally a trivia show so far so I was kind of trying to I'm feeling bad in this moment

17:17.540 --> 17:22.420
Because every episode of I was done in the last year and a half we've been a nothing burger. It's totally

17:22.420 --> 17:27.460
I used to blame it on him but now it's my first episode ever part of this is all you're about it again me yeah

17:28.180 --> 17:30.180
Study hall

17:33.460 --> 17:36.660
Why was the word hello invented what was it invented for?

17:39.060 --> 17:44.340
I'm guessing it has something to do with you know how you wave to show that you don't have any weapons

17:44.340 --> 17:47.780
It's something like that like like invented for the telephone

17:50.020 --> 17:56.820
So you don't have you up in the word hello was like pretty much not in use until a telephone came around

17:56.900 --> 17:59.780
How do you guys all answer the phone? Let's start with KC hello

18:00.820 --> 18:02.820
Rica hello

18:04.580 --> 18:06.100

You yours was great

18:12.900 --> 18:17.700
As the word I didn't say that I said how do you answer the Fender Graham Bell

18:18.500 --> 18:19.700
No

18:19.700 --> 18:23.700
Because his idea was what word he wanted to use howdy a

18:24.420 --> 18:26.420

18:26.900 --> 18:32.180
He wanted to say a hoi. That was funny. Wait say that again KC

18:34.740 --> 18:36.740
Who's he thinking he is a mere blooming field

Now I've never sold with Shopify, but I have bought with Shopify and I have to say sometimes when I'm on the fence about whether or not

20:09.380 --> 20:15.060
I want to buy something online and I see it's a Shopify checkout or it's a Shopify store they run their e-commerce

20:15.460 --> 20:21.540
I'm a little bit more apt to buy because I'm like, okay, I can trust them and I've used Shopify for you know

20:21.540 --> 20:24.820
The trust is a huge issue, but it's also like I don't have to create an account

20:24.820 --> 20:29.860
I don't have to go through this person's like personal, you know POS system or e-commerce system

I know that a Shopify it might even still have my information saved and that's like that saves me like 15 30 seconds

Guys American spend an average of 90% of their time indoors breathing over 30,000 gallons of air daily and according to the EPA

21:31.220 --> 21:36.980
Indoor air could be two to five times more polluted than outdoor air and in some cases

21:36.980 --> 21:41.940
It could be a hundred times more polluted data shows that air pollution is responsible for nearly

21:41.940 --> 21:44.900
7 million premature deaths across the world. I

21:45.780 --> 21:52.500
Lumin Los Angeles it's a highly polluted area and that's why I use air doctors air purifiers because I

21:53.220 --> 21:57.940
Always know that when I walk into my apartment the air is cleaner and I can feel it

21:57.940 --> 22:03.220
I can feel it in my chest I can feel it in my nose a friend of mine doesn't have an air purifier

22:03.220 --> 22:08.980
I was over their house and then I took a COVID test like 15 minutes after I left and there was like black

22:09.540 --> 22:14.020
Dust mole. I don't know what it was they were right off the freeway though and that's not uncommon

22:14.180 --> 22:20.580
We don't always know what we're breathing in especially indoors when you might assume that that air is clean

22:20.900 --> 22:23.540
But it actually might not be and that's where air doctor comes in

23:13.780 --> 23:15.460
That's Jeffs

23:15.460 --> 23:17.700
Do you consider yourself nuts why I said it was bad

23:17.700 --> 23:18.740
Wow

23:19.700 --> 23:23.220
We're gonna name this show Jeff couldn't get a word in edge wise at the hands of

23:23.220 --> 23:25.540
I love that I actually really love that

23:25.540 --> 23:28.740
I'd be really good if we and I think that we should just continue

23:29.380 --> 23:32.820
If we continue talking about things that were really knowledgeable about he can't really like

23:33.300 --> 23:35.300
edge himself in

23:35.300 --> 23:38.820
I mean you don't they have an knowledge base you don't think I have a wide stance when it comes to my brain

23:39.780 --> 23:42.980
Well, I think that no but also

23:44.180 --> 23:50.340
If it's something so niche you wouldn't necessarily be able to like get a get a word and our

23:51.940 --> 23:53.620
Sand art

23:53.620 --> 23:56.500
Does anybody know about that? I haven't done it. I'm asking I want to learn

23:57.460 --> 24:00.420
Yeah one time I put layers of sand in the middle like a bag

24:00.900 --> 24:06.340
I guess you could do it on a bag. You can do it on a bag where it hangs and then it like draw stuff

24:06.900 --> 24:09.780
That kind of sand art would you describe it as a particular at that point?

24:11.220 --> 24:13.220
No, no

24:15.140 --> 24:17.380
Piled you consider yourself top brass that I'd go

24:19.620 --> 24:22.020
I guess so I feel like if you go down the ship

24:24.020 --> 24:25.220
I don't have to

24:25.220 --> 24:29.060
I say I think you go down the ship goes down with you is what I was saying because you

24:29.140 --> 24:31.140
Yes, that's probably the case

24:32.420 --> 24:36.420
That got us the funding I mean angel and series a we should say

24:37.380 --> 24:42.740
None of that happens without any repile and we're not going in a lot, but I think it's actually a pretty cool guy

24:43.700 --> 24:47.620
Who are you talking? Thanks. Where are you going with this? I'm not going anywhere. I was just trying to give you your daps

24:47.620 --> 24:53.060
You do so thank you appreciate last king maybe to you do consider yourself top brass

24:53.700 --> 24:55.700
Why are you sitting down for this yeah?

24:55.700 --> 24:57.700
Guess so

24:58.340 --> 25:02.740
Maybe you should stop documenting him because he's got you got a big head really quickly

25:02.740 --> 25:07.140
I give one government and he's like yeah, I'm kind of top brass. Yeah, well, you keep saying it over again

25:07.140 --> 25:09.140
It's just kind of like I feel suspicious

25:09.700 --> 25:15.140
What do you think the hammer's gonna drop at some point? I guess. I don't know. Why does everyone still shake you around me?

25:16.500 --> 25:18.500
I think you

25:18.500 --> 25:20.500
Put people off

25:20.500 --> 25:26.100
We're on edge because that's that's two different. Oh, but it's not off of the edge. What is it?

25:27.140 --> 25:32.260
And they're the clothes not on stable ground club. Yeah, you don't think I'm around you guy

25:32.500 --> 25:37.700
What's not grounded about the house you kind of build a house with no foundation how so

25:38.740 --> 25:40.740
I don't understand. I genuinely want to know

25:41.540 --> 25:43.940
Or you rip the foundation from under it

25:45.540 --> 25:50.420
People move house like what this people does not rip the foundation up with the house on a truck and drive

25:50.500 --> 25:53.700
To the next location planted in it. Yeah, but they're not living in it

25:54.660 --> 25:56.660
On the truck

25:58.100 --> 26:03.700
What else what else can I be better? You're saying that I need to give people solid we need to teach I don't think we need to

26:04.580 --> 26:06.100
Teach you anything

26:06.100 --> 26:08.100
There's nothing I can teach you

26:08.100 --> 26:13.220
Because you don't have the knowledge base. I don't think any of my knowledge can help you in any way. Yeah

26:14.260 --> 26:16.740
Okay, what if I did have the real estate mentally

26:17.700 --> 26:20.340
For knowledge for bettering myself

26:21.700 --> 26:29.940
You refer to it the same as a comrade about 10 minutes ago. So I don't really know if you're useful absorbent

26:30.660 --> 26:32.660
And I use it every day

26:32.660 --> 26:34.660
You have how do you better yourself?

26:34.660 --> 26:40.820
I try to surround myself with people that are better than me. That's why this episode specifically is a little difficult. See you leech off

26:41.380 --> 26:48.980
He leech off of people leech or I'm a part of a community. It's all that I spin community of leaches. No

26:49.780 --> 26:51.780
two solid guys

26:52.740 --> 26:55.220
The gender neutral and one leech

26:55.940 --> 26:57.940
Two gender neutral solid gangs

26:58.900 --> 27:01.940
And then so things so that's a lot of people actually

27:02.900 --> 27:08.020
Are they rival gangs? I don't know. I just I'm trying to make it so that's what I'm gonna show

27:08.820 --> 27:14.180
That's what I'm trying to figure out. I'm trying to make myself more presentable to y'all so that you guys feel more comfortable sharing

27:14.500 --> 27:19.620
Pile hasn't lowered his shoulders for a decade and I've got a last two and a half years of that is me

27:21.140 --> 27:25.780
Lowered my shoulders. What do you mean? Yeah your tense your frustration hardware behind you

27:27.860 --> 27:34.660
That the couch yeah, I think it is actually top brass it might be top as Brad. It's my mother-in-laws

27:35.460 --> 27:43.540
I didn't know that so when I said top brass just now. I thought you paid for the cut something and I did learn some you learned something about we never talk about you guys

27:44.500 --> 27:50.180
Right how good how you guys could be better pile how has the company not IPO man?

27:51.220 --> 27:53.220
That's on your ass

27:53.620 --> 28:01.060
Well, I only were big enough for an IPO. You need to be pretty large generally then a fucking sale to like I heart radio

28:01.300 --> 28:03.300
serious XM radio

28:03.300 --> 28:04.580
Apple

28:04.980 --> 28:12.100
Cash show man. Yeah, you said you want to move the Massachusetts

28:12.900 --> 28:15.540
Real estate there is pretty expensive compared to the Hudson Valley

28:16.820 --> 28:20.740
Actually the property taxes are a lot lower in Massachusetts than here really

28:21.540 --> 28:23.540
Yeah, part of the reason I'm looking

28:24.420 --> 28:25.540
I think

28:25.540 --> 28:29.940
Something you could learn Jeff is like you'll talk about people

28:30.660 --> 28:32.660
and then incorrectly but you don't

28:33.460 --> 28:38.980
You like make them correct you and then you kind of look the fool. I don't look the fool

28:38.980 --> 28:41.460
Because you know, so maybe you just like ask them

28:42.820 --> 28:44.820
Why does man answer for it?

28:44.820 --> 28:46.820
How much he doesn't know right?

28:47.140 --> 28:51.460
So for me to come in here and be vulnerable with you guys for me to be like teach me better me

28:52.260 --> 28:54.260
better help and

28:54.820 --> 28:59.460
To talk to pile about his finances to learn about his vision for the company

28:59.540 --> 29:03.060
I think is me being open me being vulnerable. I don't see how that's not wrong

29:07.620 --> 29:11.460
I think you're learning I think you're just kind of feeling his mouth with words

29:12.420 --> 29:16.020
That's not me filling his mouth words. This is me filling his mouth words

29:16.900 --> 29:19.620
I'm Andrew pile and I support the death penalty

29:22.820 --> 29:25.300
Do you me pile

29:26.260 --> 29:30.020
Yeah, and I don't think you should pay any property taxes for good lower

29:35.700 --> 29:37.700
Yeah, that's me to a tea. I mean

29:38.980 --> 29:41.860
If you know anything about me, you know I hate taxes and that um

29:43.220 --> 29:46.820
Minor offenders should be put to death just kind of my two two main things

29:47.380 --> 29:49.380
Oh wait to describe your life as death in taxes

29:50.340 --> 29:54.740
In red hooking your skin on my old my whole platform actually yeah

29:55.860 --> 30:02.660
Where do your policies Jeff? No phones

30:04.340 --> 30:06.340
And study home study all

30:07.060 --> 30:12.100
Let's start there. Let's see if it sparks joy or wisdom and then we'll maybe do it for

30:13.140 --> 30:15.140
In perpetuity

30:15.140 --> 30:20.180
So no phones ever at never well not in study hall not at the dinner table and

30:20.180 --> 30:25.780
And definitely not in the presence of anyone that I'm uncomfortable with because

30:28.100 --> 30:33.380
You don't want to be on a phone in the presence of someone you're uncomfortable

30:36.820 --> 30:41.780
Yeah, you know you said face you just said that's literally what you just said by it

30:41.780 --> 30:44.980
Yes, we put it me on the spot right fucking platform. I don't fucking you know

30:44.980 --> 30:47.860
I don't want to be in politics. I did have an idea to become

30:48.820 --> 30:54.420
Nwarren ambassador to the US what does that mean is it not clear?

30:54.420 --> 30:56.660
I thought that was a place noir

30:57.300 --> 30:59.140
Nara like

30:59.140 --> 31:01.140
No, so you

31:01.460 --> 31:06.820
You could film noir maybe that would be part of my ambassador ship, but basically there's this tiny island up the coast of Australia

31:07.380 --> 31:14.780
Called noir you are I'm already forgetting it noir and you a I aren't you don't know this is the first time I'm hearing about it study

31:15.740 --> 31:18.060
Yeah, so yeah, so it's this tiny little

31:19.100 --> 31:21.740
Island off the coast of Australia it's one of the smallest countries in the world

31:22.060 --> 31:26.780
They don't have a lot of money. They don't have a lot of connections either do I right so I think it's perfect fit

31:27.580 --> 31:31.580
And I'm obviously not gonna be a US ambassador to anywhere, but I'd love to become a diplomat

31:31.580 --> 31:36.060
And I feel like noir to the US is my best chance because I know people like pile

31:36.620 --> 31:43.180
He's rich. I know people like Marika diversity and I know people like a mirror who's kind of famous

31:45.180 --> 31:47.180
That's yeah

31:47.820 --> 31:53.820
How's your resume? It looks great and you a are a I want to say

31:55.020 --> 31:59.340
And you are years for some ever hearing about it. Do you guys support my ambassador?

31:59.340 --> 32:03.660
Is that if I have a son? Are you ambassador for head gum there or the United States?

32:04.220 --> 32:08.700
I mean all that connections you named were were people ahead ago. I also know shackle

32:09.580 --> 32:12.140
She also works ahead ago. Yeah, but she's married to a chef

32:12.780 --> 32:18.300
Now we're starting to get into like the Gordon Ramsay territory. I'm sure he's done a fucking stint with Ramsay

32:19.020 --> 32:21.020
I looked up

32:21.020 --> 32:28.700
The place and the first thing that came up was it's immigration detention center, which is 2.5 stars on Google or if you

32:28.700 --> 32:30.700
That's not bad for attention center, though

32:31.340 --> 32:33.340
Anyway, I'm really sending people

32:34.540 --> 32:39.740
I think this like a big thing. It's really sad like yeah, basically Australia

32:39.740 --> 32:41.740
I think this is my theory

32:41.820 --> 32:48.700
They they still have not escaped that, you know, inception story of like the British the British making Australia

32:48.700 --> 32:53.660
Yeah, what do you call it? Yeah, so they you know trauma begets trauma and they if I can do it

32:53.660 --> 32:57.340
Don't want her people her people actually right so I think that I can

32:58.540 --> 33:05.020
Increase the piece when the go she is. Oh, I have another fact about a South Pacific Island that we can do all right

33:05.740 --> 33:07.740
Okay, trivia

33:08.140 --> 33:10.140
Uh

33:10.620 --> 33:12.860
Tovolu. I think is the name of the island

33:14.140 --> 33:19.100
Tyna all in South Pacific. I think it was joining the UN or something and they needed to pay like

33:19.500 --> 33:24.700
$100,000 to do it and they didn't have it. How did they raise the money to join the UN?

33:25.980 --> 33:32.940
You can't start her take service. Good. You go go. They sold their domain

33:33.580 --> 33:35.580
dot TV

33:35.980 --> 33:37.580
For how much?

33:37.580 --> 33:39.740
I don't know enough to join the UN. I guess in the least

33:40.940 --> 33:42.940
Tovolu.tv

33:42.940 --> 33:44.940
I think it's too volatile is the name of the

33:45.820 --> 33:47.820
Preview is supposed to be to all dot TV

33:50.860 --> 33:52.860
Smart

33:52.860 --> 33:54.860
Jack box dot TV

33:54.860 --> 33:56.860
Right

33:56.860 --> 33:59.180
Game right sort of a study all in a bit so

34:23.180 --> 34:25.180
I've talked to you in six months

34:27.180 --> 34:32.620
People keep love people love to keep saying that I don't actually work at the company because I'm a contractor

34:33.020 --> 34:35.580
So that's my scapegoat in this conversation. Is that don't actually work here?

34:36.780 --> 34:37.980
Yeah

34:37.980 --> 34:39.980
Self-employed

34:40.620 --> 34:43.660

Anything else

35:17.740 --> 35:19.740
Broke a sip

35:19.740 --> 35:25.100
That's just fucking federal losses. This is an awful episode. This is all your fault. No, it's not I've brought this

35:25.420 --> 35:28.380
Yeah, that's a study hall. We were going to do random Wikipedia pages

35:28.940 --> 35:31.820
Different guests we might have liked this. You know, I would I think we're like this

35:33.500 --> 35:35.500
Red yeah

35:36.700 --> 35:38.700
There's no way he would have

35:39.740 --> 35:43.900
Pile you look confused can sad like you wish he hadn't done this

35:44.780 --> 35:46.460
I could have talked about so many

35:47.980 --> 35:52.220
Different things in my knowledge base. Yeah, the floor is no problem. I need one of us

35:52.860 --> 35:59.740
Anyone of us could have I could have I could have done the pit wall in the inside of this podcast

36:01.260 --> 36:03.260
Which was my plan

36:03.260 --> 36:08.460
I could have talked about the state of Broadway a New York theater

36:09.580 --> 36:11.580
Let's hear it

36:11.580 --> 36:13.580
Well, that's gonna take too long now

36:14.140 --> 36:17.020
It's hard, you know because like people are like oh, I want to listen to your podcast

36:17.020 --> 36:21.020
I'm like let me make sure I choose which one you will listen to because if it's one like this

36:21.420 --> 36:26.060
They're gonna think it's nothing, but you you you you you plan nothing

36:26.060 --> 36:29.500
Everything in my plan you plan the show. Okay, you host it

36:30.220 --> 36:33.180
You we got we got a message from on you that said

36:34.380 --> 36:39.580
Jeff has requested you three by name me Pile and Marieka to do an episode

36:40.460 --> 36:43.340
Oh the headgun podcast two weeks out

36:43.820 --> 36:50.540
So I was thinking wow Jeff must have something planned and I show up here and you just started reading study

36:51.100 --> 36:56.140
Oh, like a PDF study all man it was supposed to be a whole thing where we all went around and learned shit

36:56.380 --> 37:00.460
But you guys haven't participated you're like I have a wide knowledge base several facts

37:00.460 --> 37:02.060
I've learned

37:02.060 --> 37:05.660
Marieka's like I could have done this like could have waxed about Broadway

37:06.060 --> 37:11.260
Then why didn't you and how's that on me? I said let's all share facts and you didn't

37:12.780 --> 37:16.940
When was when did you say that I've never heard you say let's I'm inserting it right now

37:18.460 --> 37:19.500
At the end

37:19.980 --> 37:21.980
I said it that was audio of me saying

37:24.220 --> 37:26.220
Yeah

37:32.860 --> 37:38.780
What do I want you guys to fucking further the progress of this shit?

37:38.780 --> 37:44.940
We should run a branded show Broadway feeders that have nothing in them right now

37:45.100 --> 37:46.940
Empty

37:50.940 --> 37:58.380
There's shows closing left and right what's happening? Yeah, I thought Broadway was back baby. Yeah

37:58.380 --> 38:03.900
I heard Broadway that's what they'll say that's what they said when you walked into the theater

38:03.900 --> 38:07.100
For the first time in 2021, but let me tell you

38:08.060 --> 38:13.020
It's not doing well or most shows aren't doing well. Why do you think that is Marieka?

38:13.100 --> 38:19.260
You got a lot of shows. What are you seeing out there on shows? Hey look take a prices

38:20.780 --> 38:22.780
too high

38:22.780 --> 38:23.980
not accessible

38:23.980 --> 38:25.980
shows oftentimes

38:27.020 --> 38:29.020
Not good just

38:29.740 --> 38:33.180
Hey sometimes sometimes they're not sometimes they're not and that's why it's okay

38:33.180 --> 38:35.180
Sometimes they're not good

38:36.460 --> 38:38.460
I mean we might have to scrap this

38:38.460 --> 38:40.460
Well nobody's nobody's paying

38:40.460 --> 38:48.140
$200 to see this show so and we also haven't like invited I guess we do invite reviewers every week to

38:49.420 --> 38:52.940
Review this show, but yeah, why don't we just do a call to action man

38:53.500 --> 38:54.780
Guys

38:54.780 --> 38:58.620
Leave some five star reviews. We'll start reading them a lot on the show action

38:59.500 --> 39:03.660
Now in the middle of this episode. I think we should do plus review. What do you think

39:04.300 --> 39:09.340
How do you think you could save this episode Jeff? What what in your mind should I will turn it all out

39:10.540 --> 39:17.100
I did what I planned you guys hated it brick wall ran into it nose first. I there's no way that you planned

39:18.540 --> 39:23.980
You planned the study hall I believe you could have done that. You're wearing the costume land

39:25.660 --> 39:30.140
That the study hall was just going to be reading Wikipedia art. I did actually

39:31.900 --> 39:35.500
All right, so you read one like a five minutes before we read the whole page

39:35.580 --> 39:37.580
Caricella yeah

39:37.900 --> 39:41.660
Are you gonna read the whole page or why don't you guys said you hated it?

39:42.460 --> 39:47.340
Well, you can just skip the next page. You wanted to read the whole page. Let's go to another one

39:48.140 --> 39:51.340
Are you just clicking random article? How are you getting what could you roulette?

39:51.820 --> 39:55.580
List of ambassadors of Canada to Germany. Maybe I could immigrate to Canada

39:56.220 --> 39:59.660
We go that shit out can you I don't think I want to

40:01.740 --> 40:03.740
Canada has no diplomatic mission

40:04.220 --> 40:08.060
Sorry Canada had no diplomatic mission to Germany before the second world war

40:08.620 --> 40:14.220
Oh, it had immigration agents in the country as early as even like this idea they that you wanted to do

40:15.340 --> 40:20.700
Sometimes needing to wait the space sometimes like you're tired of it plan something that I'm like

40:20.700 --> 40:24.460
Oh, this will be bad and then they'll all laugh and jump down my throat and people will like that

40:25.020 --> 40:31.340
This I you know you're seeing how the sausage gets made a little bit too much casey, but this and this was one of those times

40:31.340 --> 40:36.380
Yeah, okay, I just think I really are not jumping down

40:36.380 --> 40:42.140
We're not exactly what you wanted to do in the exact show that you I guess had planned all along

40:42.140 --> 40:45.740
I really think that it doesn't matter what I prepare

40:46.380 --> 40:51.260
It matters if I don't bring anything but if I bring like the luncheon learn was a great episode

40:51.260 --> 40:54.460
That was a very thin premise people liked that one

40:55.420 --> 40:59.740
Somebody commented if Jeff prepares even a little bit the show's good

40:59.820 --> 41:02.140
I thought that was a good episode better than this one by the way

41:03.740 --> 41:11.660
You wanted it to though. No, I thought yeah, you look at a certain it three on one works because there's joy between the three of you you guys are islands

41:15.420 --> 41:23.820
We aren't we are miles apart. Yes, and there's just I don't this could have gone well as my point

41:24.060 --> 41:28.620
I could have done the same thing and if you guys were in different moods it would have been better

41:30.700 --> 41:36.220
You have like a sound when you think of something from that you think are it's like yeah, it's a lot

41:36.780 --> 41:38.780
What do you think affected our mood?

41:39.580 --> 41:42.460
Should I you guys want me to freestyle or I song?

41:44.380 --> 41:46.380
No

41:46.380 --> 41:59.500
So you know what I'm gonna have an update all right. I'm gonna see if I'm gonna see if my cousin can make me a

42:00.540 --> 42:02.540
Like

42:03.100 --> 42:08.060
That webpage what I can't think of what it's called a page on his website

42:09.820 --> 42:11.820
Yes, it is

42:13.580 --> 42:21.180
My cousin grows rice and he started selling it and I'm going to see if he can make a page for the headgump podcast

42:21.180 --> 42:28.300
So we can send people to go buy his rice. That's good. Can we do like a chamberland coffee type thing where it's headgump podcast rice?

42:30.700 --> 42:35.820
Just in bags it's fine right right as opposed to how else

42:38.780 --> 42:40.780
I feel crazy right now

42:41.820 --> 42:49.580
I really feel like it's bad just in bags is fine that's what I'm saying like and then you just like stick the fucking logo

42:49.580 --> 42:52.220
They're sold that's what they're fucking sold right

42:52.220 --> 42:55.820
It's the same rubber hand like things race chain real in topic

42:57.100 --> 42:59.100
Headgump podcast race

42:59.500 --> 43:07.020
People are seeing and changing this shit as they would sand yeah, I think they would post on on line a lot and like use

43:07.660 --> 43:11.500
The songs on TikTok exactly right as they post themselves burning rice

43:11.980 --> 43:14.300
They will get a great idea. Thank you, case

43:14.620 --> 43:18.860
You know what I want to do I want to give a shout out to this guy. He posted it to the Jacob and me a red subreddit

43:19.420 --> 43:21.420

You made it up. No, I did you had a dream about it for you. Okay. Here we go

43:39.020 --> 43:49.980
This is from a U slash aspiring and underscore enthusiast

43:50.540 --> 43:52.540
Wake up every evening

43:54.060 --> 43:58.300
With a big pile on my play a bryside will intake

44:00.300 --> 44:02.300
You're still probably working

44:03.660 --> 44:08.140
With a seared soy base. I wonder how bad that tastes

44:09.020 --> 44:12.780
When you make it to hell by the armoured rice. You burn your rice

44:13.340 --> 44:17.900
Can't tell when you eat. I'm speed. Hope you burn your rice with the burn your rice

44:19.340 --> 44:21.340
Now where's that hoisin bottle

44:23.020 --> 44:25.020
This rice tastes so bland

44:25.580 --> 44:27.580
Did you ever saw your sand

44:28.940 --> 44:30.940
You never ruined your grains

44:32.620 --> 44:34.220
I've never seen all of them

44:34.860 --> 44:36.860
Yeah, it's really good

44:37.340 --> 44:40.380
He's using all the same words. Do you use every time? I love it

44:45.180 --> 44:48.220
I'm proud. I'm proud. I'm proud. I'm proud.

44:48.780 --> 44:51.180
You burn your rice. You burn your rice

44:52.140 --> 44:55.100
And what's again? I'm proud. What are you guys doing?

44:55.100 --> 44:59.580
You're proud. You eat a plan. What am I supposed to plan?

44:59.580 --> 45:01.580
We can't so nice

45:01.580 --> 45:07.980
That's your only food better eat twice. Do you burn your rice? I hope you're pairing your rice

45:10.940 --> 45:12.940
Normal guitars all

45:15.180 --> 45:17.180
Who did that again? That was a

45:18.060 --> 45:20.060
Reddit user aspiring enthusiast

45:20.940 --> 45:25.180
Great job aspiring. He's got a shout out. It was really good. That's Jake's uh

45:26.140 --> 45:29.900
Ensure him it. I thought it was just enthusiast

45:31.100 --> 45:33.100
No

45:33.100 --> 45:40.140
To be that off brass. How do I get in the seas? How do I get in the seas? How do I get in the seas? I think first you have to be a salary employee

45:41.100 --> 45:44.460
That's an insurmountable goal for me. Yeah

45:44.780 --> 45:52.460
Pile let's talk about marriage and red hook. Sure

45:54.860 --> 45:59.740
What are the spots man? Where do you guys go? Oh jeez

46:03.580 --> 46:05.580
Let me think uh

46:07.820 --> 46:09.340
There's a couple nice restaurants around

46:10.300 --> 46:13.020
There's a place called Stissing House just in pine plains

46:13.980 --> 46:16.460
There's a French place in pine plains. There's also a really good

46:17.500 --> 46:21.580
There's uh we've had some noodles. The place called yami um noodles. I think that's in red

46:21.580 --> 46:23.580
out. That was good

46:24.300 --> 46:29.260
Rind back to that spots. It's got a really good full-fleddle place. It's got a really good Indian food place

46:30.140 --> 46:31.180
Careful

46:32.220 --> 46:34.220
What

46:34.220 --> 46:38.140
What do you guys have going on when you want to plant the people towards the start of the pile?

46:38.220 --> 46:43.820
Are you fucking kidding me? You guys are mad that I'm ending the show. I'm trying to cut you guys loose for your Monday evenings

46:43.820 --> 46:45.820
Trying to do something nice for once

46:49.420 --> 46:55.340
Listen the pit wall just not on it. So it's like this should be on tomorrow. I'll be on it tomorrow. I was on it a week ago

46:55.340 --> 46:58.620
I was on it a week ago great episode you're on it two weeks ago

46:59.660 --> 47:04.060
Yeah, we recorded you watch this race Jeff. Yeah, I will tonight

47:04.940 --> 47:07.660
You don't have to but I was just wondering

47:08.300 --> 47:10.300
You look at me while you did that

47:12.060 --> 47:15.500
I think you should watch it. I were going into a podcast about

47:16.780 --> 47:21.500
Also, I don't I don't I don't think he has to watch it. Yeah, this guy's don't argue

47:21.500 --> 47:23.180
I can feel like basically about to get really heated

47:24.380 --> 47:26.380
No, I don't think it will

47:26.380 --> 47:31.500
I think we're mature adults that can discuss things. I think it can be a kind of a fun angle of Jeff

47:31.500 --> 47:33.740
Does on and he hasn't watched it and we're telling him about it

47:33.820 --> 47:35.820
I

47:37.420 --> 47:39.420
agree

47:41.820 --> 47:43.820
But if you want to watch it you can

47:44.220 --> 47:47.260
Follow me on blue sky threads

47:48.300 --> 47:53.020
X slash Twitter letter boxed Instagram

47:53.820 --> 47:56.300
TikTok at Marie Gay line

47:57.260 --> 48:02.220
Buy me a GE ice machine. That's why I have a tick-tock account

48:02.540 --> 48:06.060
Just so I can try and get out and have a ice machine

48:07.340 --> 48:09.340
500 dollars

48:11.500 --> 48:13.500
To make ice. That was a really loud though

48:15.100 --> 48:17.260
I at this point I don't care. I need

48:18.060 --> 48:21.420
Nugget ice. I've wanted it for years and now

48:22.380 --> 48:29.020
The girlies on TikTok are just selling their souls for GE

48:29.340 --> 48:31.340
Opal ice machines

48:31.340 --> 48:32.940
Selling their souls. I want to be that

48:34.460 --> 48:40.380
They're not really they're just doing ads for them and doing giveaways that I can't win. Oh, these are like

48:41.660 --> 48:46.140
You can buy like home versions of this. This isn't like the kind you find in the hallway of a hotel

48:46.860 --> 48:50.860
No, no, no, wow. This is third. Yeah. I'm gonna have to look into this

48:52.140 --> 48:55.500
Yeah, you are because it's great. Nugget ice is great

48:57.100 --> 48:59.100

49:16.620 --> 49:19.260
There's there's always a nice structure to it

49:20.220 --> 49:25.660
We know what we're gonna talk about when we start the show all the way until when we finish the show

49:26.940 --> 49:29.420
We have notes. It's always on track

49:31.020 --> 49:35.260

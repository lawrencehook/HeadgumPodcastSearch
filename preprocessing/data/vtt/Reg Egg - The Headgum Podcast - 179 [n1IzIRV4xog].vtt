00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head gum original.

00:02.000 --> 00:07.000
So it's really funny to me.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
It's impressive.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
What do you do?

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
And I appreciate it.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
I appreciate it.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
I appreciate it.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
When you're driving your car,

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
do you ever...

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Oh, my God.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
But Jeffery does.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Jeffery does.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Jeffery does.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Jeffery does.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
Do you ever just listen to static?

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
For like a radio static?

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Yes.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
It's not everybody can be radio free on you.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
You're obsessed with the radio, man.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
I mean, she's like driving either in thither,

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
park or A to B as complicated as possible.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
They're at the streets of...

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Mind you.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
And it's just static this.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Static that.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Is it AM or FM?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Are you going to say both?

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
You're trying to dox me from my last apartment.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
So you're...

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
I can't remember anything.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
I also do when I am doing this.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
I think I do something really, really weird,

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
which is I often put in my...

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
AirPods, which have the noise canceling feature.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
And I listen to nothing.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I just walk around with those in.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
I do that.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
And they drain the battery.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
I do that.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Well, it's often helpful.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
So no one talks to you out in the city like New York.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Yeah.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
You hear it, right, man?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
It does feel like a...

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
It just feels like some sort of defense mechanism.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
But I'm often...

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
It's often the situation where like...

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
If I'm listening to something and I go in a store,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I turn it off because I'm too...

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Do you guys love them?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
There's a fucking episode to say.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
You guys are still saying the same conversation from before.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Jeff, I don't mean to start off on this note,

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
but there is buzzing on one of the tracks.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
You hate to hear it.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
It's also so jarring, not sing, Jeff.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I fixed it.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Jard.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Oh, that was you.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Jard joy?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Jard joy?

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
Jard joy is when you take something that you love

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
and you put it in a sack.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Okay, for later an assignment.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I wish it was that.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Just for earlier.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Yeah.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
There's putting things somewhere for safe keeping,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
and then there's this, which is entirely different.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
And then you never revisit it again.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
A.M. or F.M.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
On you.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
A.M. radio when you're driving in your car.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Great question.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Jeff.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
There's a time and play on your car.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm static on the radio.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Radio free.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
And on.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
Have you been on before?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I have been on with or.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Okay.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
I couldn't tell if I was like suppose to tell you that that might happen or not.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Rochelle had the classic line of, I don't know what this show is.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
That just brought the house down at minute 38 of her episode.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
That's true.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Yeah.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
That has changed since.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Um, I am loving the energy though today.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
I'm here came in.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Well, you, you kind of had some good energy before we started recording.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Hmm.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
And then you, how's the smart popcorn?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
I don't know if you're crashing or what?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Because now you're like,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
crumbs in the beard, starting to look pissed.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I had to like, fake sort of,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
my guy bird together,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
a lunch out of a series of snacks and potatoes.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
And like, I'm into this weird, like,

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
when you just snack your way through all of breakfast and lunch.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Right.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
So you're not really hungry, but you're not full in a happy way either.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Boy, boy lunch, they call it.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Yes, it's a boy lunch.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Boy lunch is just seemingly grains.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Because you had oatmeal and popcorn.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Yeah.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
And that's also had a banana and a coffee.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Actually, boy lunch is like you can.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Oh, sorry.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
I was all the time.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Your new DJ name is boy lunch.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Yeah.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Find that.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
I don't mind that at all.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
What kind of tracks are you spinning?

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Usually just songs that I listen to in college.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Mashed up.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Like two songs switching in between the two or like every single song you liked in college.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Every single song I liked in college.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
And when people say, what's your own model?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
You often say Berkeley.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
And then they're like, oh, my God, school of music.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
And you don't correct them.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Because I want them to think that I have a specific trader skill.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Where is Berkeley?

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
The one I went to is just open season for anyone who lived in California in the 90s.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
It was also open concept, meaning the library didn't have a lot of walls.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Really.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
And we haven't talked enough about this.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
I thought we brought up Berkeley's library recently, but maybe not.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Libraries have to be open concept.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Right.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
I just want to.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
It's just one big one.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Yeah.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
You.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Every library architect has the choice to drywall over the due edesimal system.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
They just don't.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
I mean, my school had a library that was a glass egg.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
So let's hear more about that.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Because I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Was it really a glass egg?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Yeah.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Man, Swato library.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Well, let's feature it in the movie.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Divergent.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
How do you spell that?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Very good.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
We're going to get a numbers.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Let's move it.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
The library is man.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
M-A-N-S-U-E.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Man's spreado college.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Truly crazy for both of you to think that I thought

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Marie go into divergent college.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Well, you just said.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I thought Marie could actually.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
I just thought you were.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
I just thought you were spoiling.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
I'm going to break.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Let's start in this moment.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Because it feels bad to all of us.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Why?

05:33.000 --> 05:43.240
Just say just type in a rag, R-E-G, just type in a rag, rag, rag.

05:43.240 --> 05:43.680
Just type in a rag.

05:43.680 --> 05:44.680
A ratchet, rag.

05:44.680 --> 05:48.640
A rag, a library from the movie, divergent, a university.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.640
I have a question.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.640
A rag, a rag, a rag, a rag, a rag.

05:50.640 --> 05:51.640
Man, sweet a library.

05:51.640 --> 05:52.640
Here we go.

05:52.640 --> 05:53.640
All right.

05:53.640 --> 05:54.640
Oh, wow.

05:54.640 --> 05:55.640
Look at that.

05:55.640 --> 05:56.640
A library.

05:56.640 --> 05:57.640
Why am I going to?

05:57.640 --> 05:58.640
Why don't you say that?

05:58.640 --> 06:01.000
I don't mind that from a rag, a library.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
That's what she calls it up here.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.600
That's really good.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.000
Babibli attack don't.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Slowly.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Rachelle, let's dive into your past.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Let's talk about who we loved the most.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
We're moving on from our library at that fast.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
What?

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Where is there to see what the library do?

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
I just got a robot arm that gets books from underground.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
It's pretty good.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
What the fuck is this?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Any of this.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Marika went to college in the future.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
And now she's back to tell us about it.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
We're talking about a robot arm.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
Big big library.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Egg big dome energy.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Yeah, this really does say library dome.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Reg egg igloo.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
That's the same.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Quickly as students have dreamed up pet names for Men's Swaydo.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
They've adopted the futuristic library as their own.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Versus doing what?

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
I mean, they need to create a high thing.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah, I mean, this has got to be like 50 grand a year for you.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
I think the robot.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
More than 50.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
It was more expensive than USC.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
It was like 60.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Maybe USC was 60.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
But I had a 50% scholarship.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
It doesn't matter.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Really?

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Not married.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
It was threatened based.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
You blackmailed them for the other side.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Yeah.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
My school actually recently was like part of a lawsuit.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
We're apparently they have to pay.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
People's like student loans.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Like someone want to lawsuit.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
And now you Chicago owes students like hundreds of thousands of dollars.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
That's not a lot.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
For the whole university to owe.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Yeah, that's like that's that's too.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Yeah, but it's like I should be getting money from them.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
And I have a gotten my email about it yet.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
You're going to.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
And nevermind.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Well, that's here.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
Anyway, but anyway, back to you.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
But I'm saying, the library don't work is where you would.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
The next for that.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
I've, well, first of all, no, because I know an ever called it the library dome.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
And I hate that.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
They called it what real egg or whatever.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Just egg.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
It was called it the mega egg or man's way though.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
It really is reminiscent of that like mayo shit.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
It's like just egg.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
What's the egg?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yeah.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Yeah.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
That's right.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
You're going to start there.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
What?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
I was just going to see.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Because you have the Reagan library.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
And then you have the just red library.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Well, it was the Reagan Stein library, but yeah.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Okay.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
So.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
It was made later.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Yeah.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Yeah.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
This is very confusing.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
The red egg library.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Right.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
It stands for Reagan Stein.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Because it's the Reagan Stein library.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
But it's also called men's way though.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Right.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
The library.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
We have to understand that.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
The Reagan Stein library.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
You have to walk down the glass hallway.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
And then enter the glass dome with the robot arm.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
So the man, the Reagan Stein was like.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
The really should be robot arm egg.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
There should also be Reagan Stein's in addition before that was a egg.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
There was Reagan Stein and they were like inspired by his last name.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
And they built it into shape.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
I didn't even inspired.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
It was something I was inspired.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
And he also was like no Reagan Stein.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
That the library looks like an egg.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
I mean, don't get me started on the Riven David Logan Center.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
I'll tell you what.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
And we won't get you started on that.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
My last question is crass, but I have to ask.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
Uh, did anybody, did you or anybody you know ever get dome in the library dome?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Wow.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Um, don't get up to me.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
I assume somebody did.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I got laughing.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Drag me by quoting me.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Rachelle is.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Oh, my god.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Oh, let's build a pint of cold brew.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Are you younger than Jeff in a cool fashion?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Or are you sort of the same age?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I'm hoping somebody is a younger.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
I think I'm older than you.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
And yeah, you still made fun of it.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
You're 28.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
I'm 30.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Okay.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
I'm 25.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
So what she made fun of you saying dome.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Well, I don't know that song.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
We're like, uh, we've got trucks.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
We've got jeeps.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Plus dome.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
No.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
It's the first song I've ever heard.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
This is the actual song.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
That is the song.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
That is the song.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
We're not jeeps.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
We don't.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
That is song.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Yes.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Was that you singing?

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Yeah.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
It's Camron.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Okay.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
She's like that.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
What?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Eyes.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
And that was all for this.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
And I think it all was song.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Your decision is going to be tight.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Listen to that.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
We got trucks.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
We got jeeps.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Pregnant pause.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Go.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I, it's not even.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
Oh, and he also has a song called losing weight.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Really?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
It sort of took the trickle.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
Trilogy about fucking exercising.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Okay.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
That's not bad.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
That's all good so far.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
And then here it is.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Wait.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
It's not bad.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Where's the dome?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
There's no dome.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
You made up the dome.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
No, the dome is over here.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Please talk about trucks and jeeps again.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Yes.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
No, the dome is over here.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
So the pregnant pauses.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
I'll lip-sees.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
This is it.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
This is it.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
This is it.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
This is it.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
This is it.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
This is it.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
That's right.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
To call up.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
You'll have.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
I hate what else.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Plus don't say.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
You got it.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I'm really the part of the song.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Yeah.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
That's like the gist of it.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
It's like, we were in the range range rover talking about an SUV.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
And then it's like, we hooked up.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Plus dome.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I get that that part of the song.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
But when you said it was, we got trucks.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
We got jeeps.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Dog.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
All of your stuff.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
She was friend.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
He's struggling to her friend.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Yeah.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
This is what's up.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
What's up.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
And he's like.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Plus dome.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
And this one's like.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
And this one's like.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
He's like.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
He's like.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
He's like.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
He's like.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
And he's like.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
He's like.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
And he's like.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
And he's like.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
He's killing him.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Right.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Got trucks.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Right.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Like we got trucks.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Well, shut down.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Plus dome.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Plus dome.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Plus rice.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Yeah.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I were going to burn rice tonight.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Uh.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Um.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
You guys were on the episode.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
It comes out.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
I think this Friday.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
But um, we did uh.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Rice parody, which we haven't done for a while.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
And it was walking on the wildside.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Uh huh.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
But it was.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Use a walk to insherborn char.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
No.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
So.

13:04.000 --> 13:15.000
I love rice. I just think it is best served. It's a dish best served charred. Does that make sense?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
So basically it's like not crispy.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Not fried rice.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
No, still crispy is not good.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Or it's burnt black.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Caught rice.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
It's also crispy.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
It's so sweet.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Yeah.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
We remember.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Yeah.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
When you said a little crispy, it's sort of like giving him too much credit.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Yeah.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
A little crispy is good.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Yeah.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
It's not what we're talking about.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
We're talking about fusion rice dish.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
That's like.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Oh, yeah.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Do you kind of burn it on the bottom?

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Yeah.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Yeah.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
It's like saffron rice.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Tajine.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Tajine is a spice.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
No.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
No.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
You look right at me.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Is it Tajine's a spice?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
It's a spice.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Plus dome.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
The dome I could play fond

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
burnt rice.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
It's good.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
It's good.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
It's good.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
It's good.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
It's good.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
It's good.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
It's good.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
It's good.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Inside a rag.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
No.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
It sounds like that.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
But Tajine is the spice.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Let's get a numbers crunch on this fuck.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
I love it.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
It is the spice.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
But it's also.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Tajine.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Tajine is the thing that you cook at home.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Right.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
There's no spice.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Tajine is the thing that you cook at home.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Right.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
There's no spice.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Yeah.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Tajine.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Yes.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
That's it.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Tajine.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
So it's like.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
But I think it's also called.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Got jeeps.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Got trucks.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Libertone.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Tajine.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Right.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Right.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
It does crispy.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
It does crispy.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
It's also spelled.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
T-A-C-H-I-N.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
So.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
T-A-H-T-I-G.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
T-Shot.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
T-A-H-T-I-G.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
T-Shot.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
All right.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
This is fucked up.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Got lost translation.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Yeah.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
I guess so.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
And speaking of.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Did you just a vapor?

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
No.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
He said lost in translation.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
So I went.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Oh.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Like at the end where you can't hear what he's saying.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
At the end of what?

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
I mean, you see the Priscilla moving.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
I'm getting a little bit.

15:26.000 --> 15:36.000
I almost went this weekend.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
This week my mother week is on his boyfriend.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Why?

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Because he's handsome he's swath.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
And he knows when and how to give others the floor.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Just like James.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
What?

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
What?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
What?

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
What did you need him?

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
When did I, when did you even meet him?

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
She didn't even know that I had come happy our last talk to over.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
Kidding me was in passing 19 months ago.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
That's what I was trying to figure out.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
No, he was saying why he's in your kind of mental zeitgeist.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Front 12 vortex.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Yeah.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Yeah.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
And you know, left and right side brain.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Me thinking about what's his name, Sandy?

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
No.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
No.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
That's what.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
But thank you.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
I'll tell him.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Well, he doesn't know.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Not yet.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
He's not until you tell us that.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
Because I didn't, we didn't come over that time united just me and him.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
No.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Yeah.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
There was a day in the studio.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
We've talked about it before, but this is just for a show.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
I was, I was going to move to Laurel Canyon.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
That's a brag.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
That's a lease.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
And I was like telling on your about it because I was like, I have to move.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
And she was like, where are you moving?

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
I said, Laurel Canyon.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
We talked about how we love Laurel Canyon.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I said, you and your boyfriend should come over.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Yeah.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
In case he was right next to me.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Unbelievable HR violation of me.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
It was so funny.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
It was like, okay.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
It was easy.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
But I love it.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
That's the invitation.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
And my boyfriend who he, oh, it hasn't met once in passing.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
19 months ago.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
And then what ended up really stopping came out of sense.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Was that we went to a mirror's wedding in Laurel Canyon.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
And it was me and Casey.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Weirdly.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
So it ended up not being ideal for anyone involved.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
And I didn't even move to Laurel Canyon.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
And we weren't invited to the wedding.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Oh.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Yeah.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Or my boyfriend.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Richelle was there.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
And your boyfriend.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Everyone was sent the registry, which seemed fucked.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
I agree.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
If you're not there in spirit, you can be there in cash.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Can I ask you a question in a mirror?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Sure.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I got an email last night.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
That said.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Oh, that was a thank you note.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Yeah.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
You're gift.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Can I also.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Can I follow up ask you a question?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
I also have a question.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
It says.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Okay.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
This question.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
This says.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Thank you.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
You gave dollar sign.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Low tier.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Thank you.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
That's for God's host.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
PS anecdote.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Did you say that to everybody or just me?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I copy and paste it.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
And then I was supposed to update it depending on who gave what and stuff like that.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
But I might have accidentally sent it to the little bit too early.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
There's no way.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
There's no way.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
I was like everyone else.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Just yeah.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
What was yours?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
I forgot.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
To do the registry.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
You forgot to do it late.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
It's not too late.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Your money is no good here.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
It's just wasn't quite enough.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
So right.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Between the two of you.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
I got you the blender, right?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
The blender that you've slacked about today.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
I do have two blenders now because somebody gave us a blender and we already had one.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
So if anybody won't blend.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Because you're late.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Did someone give you a blender off registry?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Yes.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
That's crazy.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Didn't I think I thought it was me that gave you the blender.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Because I thought it was like 50 bucks.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
No.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
You got low tier.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
I don't know who your friend.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
You got a nice blender.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Did you have to stuff on your registry?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Like, did you have items on the registry?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
No, it was just that.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Okay.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
That's what I thought.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Mine.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Yeah.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Okay.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
I just gave cash.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
I would love for that.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
So what my initial plan was do you want a blender?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
What's that?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Do you want a blender?

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
I have a blender.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
So unless it is a vitamin.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
It's not.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
But it looks like one.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Do you think that person re-gifted?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Like what's up with that?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
It was like a family friend.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
So it was like an older couple.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
So they were just like, I don't give you shit about the registry.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
I don't know what I'm doing.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Can I pitch a business idea on this note?

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
On yes note?

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
So obviously there's a lot of times that gifts are warranted to somebody to say thank you.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
You know?

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
And we did send you a thank you card.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Right.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
And it was hurtful to hear and read.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
Basically gift backstits are a thing.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Like cookies, wine, cheese, crackers, whatever.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Crackers.

19:37.000 --> 19:44.000
I wonder just from a sustainability standpoint and price.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
If we create thrift baskets.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
So it's like a Harry and David, you know, gift arrangement but it's mostly garbage.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
A lot of people think gift baskets are already mostly garbage.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
So yeah.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Did you have a question or was it about the blender?

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
There were three questions queued and Marie because of the second.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
I'm sorry.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
She already asked her.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Yeah Marie.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
So it's your turn.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
So it was my turn.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I actually was wondering what they gifted you.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
I didn't realize you had a honey fund.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
And now I'm kind of fixing it on this couple.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
It gives blenders to everybody.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
I think that's crazy.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Yeah.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
I had another idea to get you for the registry before it was just like,

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
I'll give us cash.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
It was going to be kind of it.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
It's own gift basket.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Not a thrift basket.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
A different idea of like, you know, formula, nursery wallpaper,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
diapers, etc.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Stuff to like incentivize having kids.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Not even incentivize more so pressure.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Right.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Like now we have all the stuff.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
So like let's have this serious talk because Jeff sort of.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Let's have the serious type.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Right.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Let's get a kid in that back yard.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
In that basket.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
You should give a kid.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
That's good.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Kid basket.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
That's really good.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Like a fire station situation.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Yeah.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Pick them up from the fire station on the way.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Play mobile meets Play Do.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Yes.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Marika's pissed.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
God.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Um.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
I just realized there's a way for Marika to see you.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Awesome.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
I just put it on my laptop.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
No.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Switch the input video on the zoom.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
You can get this out and switch it to the.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Um.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
The webcam.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
You should be able to do it.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Oh, but then you will see us.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Forget it.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
All right.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
The way for her to see me would be for on my laptop to stay on the zoom.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Yeah.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
But I just feel bad for her because it's about a giant year.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
It's such an important part of this.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
True.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
True.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Are you going to talk about your Halloween costume?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Because it looks like you still have arrested.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Oh.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
I'm going to talk about the episode where you're supposed to record a part of it.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Yeah.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
I would love to see you to work on your Halloween costume.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
I need to give you a chance.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
You know, this one you called me while I was in a session to see if it was in

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Convenienting me.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
But you were cancel.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
It's not last month.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
No.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
We're not going to talk about it.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
I think for Grace cut that out.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
I think.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Um.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Basically with it.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I was Mugato from Zulander.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Do you have pictures or anything?

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Not on my phone.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
You still have the island or something.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
I know.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Like mad about that.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
I'm not mad.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
I'm like, I don't have the fucking receipts yet.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
So did you think about it last minute?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Is that why you have to push them?

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
No.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
I ordered it a week in advance.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
It just didn't come.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
It was supposed to come Wednesday.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Didn't come.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
It's supposed to come Thursday.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
It didn't come.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
It's supposed to come Friday.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
I was like, that's my last fucking chance.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Didn't come.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
So I had a good drive here.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Other than the spirit Halloween.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
It's at our Instagram.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Not what you want to avoid.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
It's a courting.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
What?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
The fucking lettering.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Right?

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Okay.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Tap on M.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
You.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
G.A.T.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
And here's what I'll say.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
And I'll, you know, what's that?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
All individual or individual.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Yeah.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Someone came up to me.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Well, forget it.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I'm not going to tell this story.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
I do have a photo of it though.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
On your also said, all will be forgiven if I get a photo of that costume.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
So I will give it to you.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
So I don't know for forgiveness yet.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Not yet.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
I don't really remember saying that.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
I have the receipts.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
How long?

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
Ultimately, how long did it take you to pull together for us in the past?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Jesus.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Jesus.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Was it worth it?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Let me work it.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Yeah.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
It's a commercial.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Because you did.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
You did cancel like an hour before the recording.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
So, and I, and I know.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
Are you a millennial who misses what life was like in the 2000s?

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Have you had a hard time finding new or curated music?

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
Are you interested in multiple perspectives on relationships dating and music?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000

Twice a week, Bridget and Mandy have nostalgic conversations in their grown segments.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
Political pop culture conversations in their honest segments and relationship hot take

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
Conversations in the slightly toxic segment.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000

Each week you'll leave with some new music wrecks or a curated playlist that you didn't

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
even know you needed in their freshly squeezed music segment.

24:10.000 --> 24:16.000
Most recently, the ladies have sat down with Ari Lennox, Big Freedia, Remi Ma and Van Lathen.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
So, you're going to want to check it out.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Check it out.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Guys, there was a time when I didn't really feel like I was at my best.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I wasn't sleeping very well.

24:36.000 --> 24:42.000
I wasn't getting that real clarifying sleep that helps you kind of digest your dreams.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
I don't know what else to say.

24:43.000 --> 24:50.000
And I woke up feeling sluggish and like I wasn't really supporting myself in the best way possible

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
getting all the things that I need from what I was consuming every day to have good sleep

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
and to have that mental clarity.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
But if you're a long time listening to the show, you know that I've been drinking

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
AG1 for almost two years now.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
I started drinking AG1 every day when I was living in New York and I could just feel

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
a real difference in my sleep schedule, my daily health and I noticed that a lot more energy.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
I figured that I could focus more.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
I was really on it, you know, and a lot of regards.

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
And that's because AG1 is a foundational nutritional supplement that supports your body's universal

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
needs, like gut optimization, stress management, and immune support.

25:28.000 --> 25:34.000
Since 2010, AG1 has led the future of the foundational nutrition industry.

25:34.000 --> 25:41.000
Continuously refining their formula to create a smarter, better way to elevate everyone's baseline health.

25:41.000 --> 25:47.000
I was taking a lot of pills and supplements during the lockdown part of COVID, but it ended up being really expensive.

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
And also, you don't want to be, you know, accounting for that many pills and vitamins every day.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
It's just too much work to really sustain.

25:55.000 --> 26:02.000
But with AG1, it's just one scoop in a cup of water every day, which I appreciate because I'm getting my magnesium,

26:02.000 --> 26:08.000
I'm getting all my B vitamins, I'm getting vitamin C, ways to support my immunity for sure.

26:08.000 --> 26:15.000
I've been recommending AG1 to all my family and friends because of the effect that it's had, specifically on my sleep quality.

26:16.000 --> 26:23.000
I have a lot of friends who are stressed all the time and, you know, I've been recommending AG1 to them because I'm like, hey, this really helps me sleep better.

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
And that's why AG1 is the supplement I trust to provide the support that my body needs every day.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
And that's why they've been a partner of the show for so long.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
So if you want to take ownership of your health, it starts with AG1.

26:34.000 --> 26:42.000
Try AG1 and get a free one-year supply of vitamin D3K2 and 5 free AG1 travel packs with your first purchase.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
Go to drinkag1.com slash what's that?

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
Again, that's drinkag1.com slash what's that?

Check it out.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
According to the last hour, so he could have ultimately day only a few hours.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
We'll give you an extra hour for pairing.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
I don't know if Mereka's not hearing the sound effects, but she's just specific.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
I'm not.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Which I tried to say.

27:03.000 --> 27:09.000
It says, it says, caring if you're audio.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
No.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
You're not.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
You're not sharing it.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I actually do think I know why this is.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Do you want to fix it?

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Yeah.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Go to settings.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Okay.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
This is the most.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
No settings on the computer.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Yep.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
On the computer settings.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
It's at the bottom.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Go to audio.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
It's not muted.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Is the output muted?

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
It's not so no explanation.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
This is awful.

27:36.000 --> 27:42.000
Moving on slash circling back to, and I'm, I didn't mean to be rude to show.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
But let's skip back into the question, which is diving into your past.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
Let's see what, you know, it's Halloween tomorrow.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Not when this episode comes out.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
But let's check in on those skeletons in the closet.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
You obviously don't answer that.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Naturally.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Yeah.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I will share this one because I got solved.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
But I officiated my friends wedding.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
And I lost the ring.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Wow.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
That's pretty good.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
But then we found it.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Oh, that's good.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Where was it?

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Um, so I had a,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
I had a few drinks.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
And I still got the little orange shot.

28:24.000 --> 28:32.000
I had dropped the ring in my car in between the, the console and the little, you know,

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
the little black hole.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Yeah.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
And then, you know, tried to find it.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
It wasn't there.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Did everything.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
I could mark even.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
My mark, my boyfriend brought the car to Jiffy Loom to remove the car seat.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
This is like two hours before the wedding.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Wow.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
And they, they couldn't find it.

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
And me and other brides made went back to see where we parked the car and see if we could

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
find anything.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
And the sold couple walks by.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
And they are like, what are you looking for?

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
And I'm crying on the floor.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
I'm very stressed.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
And we're like, we're looking for wedding ring.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
They're like, oh, oh, wow.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Um, well, don't worry.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
We want to only one.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
And then this old lady looks down.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
And the wedding ring is right by her feet.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Oh, my god.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Destiny.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
And that old lady married my brother.

29:23.000 --> 29:29.000
That's the worst thing you've ever done.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
That's the worst thing I've ever done.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
That was hard for you to talk to.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
You talk in a bow.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Um, that's pretty good.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
That's, if that's the worst thing you've ever done.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Yeah, I'm a really good person.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
It was a good honest mistake.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Yeah.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
Um, this isn't like the post post post, not sure episode or whatever.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
But how do you feel being married?

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Do you feel like a different man or the salt the same?

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
You just have a, you don't have a ring on by the way.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
There it is.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
You were concealing it though.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
There was some kind of level of embarrassment.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Because I'm still trying to hit on chicks.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
So like I'm trying to hide it for them.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
In case any like the YouTube commenters,

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
want to slide into my G chat DM.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
People that just walks around like this.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
You want people to see.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
So this female message you.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
G chat.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
G chat.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Yeah.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Even me sure, I think, less used.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Yeah, for sure, for sure.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
That's cool.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
Because that means he's only targeting women, his age and older.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Yeah.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Yeah.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Yeah.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Yeah.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
You look married.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Thank you.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
That was not a comment.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
You have been different.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Really?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Mm.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
That's cool.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
In a positive way.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Or moving on.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Yeah.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
That's a new thing that we do.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
That's a new thing that we do.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Or dot, dot, dot, dot.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
This one.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
This one.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Um, solid bit.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
Let's talk company reports.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
Um, I feel like we're not really talked about what's going on at the network recently.

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
And I feel like the listeners not only deserve to know, but are well overdue to know.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Are you going to ask for something?

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Plus don't.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
I don't know what most of you all do.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
That's so clear.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Ultimately.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Sorry for got Marika was here.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Then she came in with that.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
Every time you do this.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Yeah.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
That's pointless.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
It's pointless.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Because there's no union between us.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
What do you mean?

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
It's kind of a new report.

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
What you want to see checking in is all on teams.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Microsoft or otherwise.

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
I'm wondering what Rachelle does and how it's been going for Rachelle.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
I don't work here.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Well, time.

31:43.000 --> 31:47.000
So you're a freelance producer.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
I'm a freelance producer.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Yeah.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
And you work on handbook.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
You work on.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Got you.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
A little gossip King.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Just gossip King.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Uh, actually.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Definitely.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
And then you show.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
You sure.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
You sure.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Who's all that's right?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
It's the.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
No.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
No.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Jeff.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
I'm begging you.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
I'm.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
I'm.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Back on track.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
I don't know what's happening.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
I'm just trying to ask her, does she let her come put your

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
report and it's going off the rails.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Get played.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
We can talk about it.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
Yeah, paid.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
We haven't announced.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
We haven't announced.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
We've cut this out.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Segment or.

32:21.000 --> 32:26.040
But it's an exciting show and it's coming soon and you guys are going to be excited and we're

32:26.040 --> 32:27.040
shall's working on it.

32:27.040 --> 32:30.040
Not much of a company report for the public if they don't even know what the name of the show

32:30.040 --> 32:31.040
show.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.720
Which is what we say every single time we're like, you don't know what you're talking

32:33.720 --> 32:34.720
about.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.720
Why don't you bring us all the same thing?

32:36.720 --> 32:37.720
I don't know.

32:37.720 --> 32:40.760
I don't really say why I'm so happy public knowledge.

32:40.760 --> 32:42.560
Build some hype over this shit.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.560
It will be hype when you leave everything.

32:44.560 --> 32:45.560
Yeah, true.

32:45.560 --> 32:46.560
It's true.

32:46.560 --> 32:50.160
This episode could be coming out and like, literally, it will be already lodged by the

32:50.160 --> 32:51.160
show launch.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.160
When does the show launch?

32:52.160 --> 32:53.160
When does the show launch?

32:53.160 --> 32:54.160
When does the show launch?

32:54.160 --> 32:56.160
When does the company launch?

32:56.160 --> 32:57.160
We've been live for a while.

32:57.160 --> 32:58.160
For years.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.160
For almost a decade.

32:59.160 --> 33:00.160
Yeah.

33:00.160 --> 33:02.160
November 6th.

33:02.160 --> 33:03.160
This will definitely.

33:03.160 --> 33:04.160
It'll be well.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.160
It'll all be over.

33:05.160 --> 33:07.160
This show will be canceled by the time.

33:07.160 --> 33:08.160
It's actually right.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.160
Jeff, what's your job?

33:10.160 --> 33:14.160
I am a freelance producer only on this show.

33:14.160 --> 33:21.160
And I edit the sketches and miscellaneous videos.

33:21.160 --> 33:22.160
Okay.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.160
Here's a question.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.160
And I write them.

33:24.160 --> 33:25.160
I'm in them.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.160
For real.

33:26.160 --> 33:27.160
A real question.

33:27.160 --> 33:28.160
For real.

33:28.160 --> 33:31.160
I think I should get adult braces for the bit.

33:31.160 --> 33:32.160
First of all.

33:32.160 --> 33:33.160
I had one tooth.

33:33.160 --> 33:35.160
It's like a little bit out of whack.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.160
I don't like how they look on this camera.

33:37.160 --> 33:40.160
Did you say for the bit or for a bit?

33:40.160 --> 33:41.160
I think it's a small bit.

33:41.160 --> 33:42.160
For the bit.

33:42.160 --> 33:45.160
So like for a year I would have adult braces.

33:45.160 --> 33:48.160
I mean, that's fine because you're 25.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.160
That's still young enough to have adult braces.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.160
I feel like that's well past the color.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.160
No, I think isn't it like cool right now?

33:53.160 --> 33:54.160
To have braces.

33:54.160 --> 33:55.160
Yeah.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.160
I feel like I see a lot of.

33:56.160 --> 33:58.160
I feel like I might get like a grill.

33:58.160 --> 34:00.160
I don't know about that.

34:00.160 --> 34:03.160
Can you get like one brace?

34:03.160 --> 34:04.160
It's crazy.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.160
It's crazy.

34:05.160 --> 34:06.160
It's crazy.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.160
It's crazy.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.160
It's crazy.

34:08.160 --> 34:09.160
It's crazy.

34:09.160 --> 34:10.160
It's crazy.

34:10.160 --> 34:11.160
It's crazy.

34:11.160 --> 34:13.160
I have cancer.

34:13.160 --> 34:14.160
All right.

34:14.160 --> 34:15.160
New DNA in Vizoline.

34:15.160 --> 34:18.160
I do have a question for Jeff.

34:18.160 --> 34:19.160
Actually, it's for the listeners.

34:19.160 --> 34:21.160
Do the listeners think that you work your full time.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.160
The listeners know that I barely work here at all I think.

34:23.160 --> 34:26.160
or do you think some of them are like.

34:26.160 --> 34:29.160
Get mad at the company for not giving me healthcare.

34:29.160 --> 34:31.160
And I'm like, I don't, I'm not an employee.

34:31.160 --> 34:32.160
I'm a contract.

34:32.160 --> 34:34.160
And how do they know that we don't give you health?

34:34.160 --> 34:35.160
I know.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.160
Because I've complained about it on the show.

34:37.160 --> 34:38.160
Oh.

34:38.160 --> 34:39.160
So that's.

34:39.160 --> 34:40.000
because it's on my mind,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.360
because I'm 26, some show you weeks.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.600
Well, what are you going to do for healthcare?

34:44.600 --> 34:46.800
The probably the cal thing that everybody does.

34:46.800 --> 34:47.800
Cal, hell, cal.

34:47.800 --> 34:48.640
Covered cal for anyone.

34:48.640 --> 34:50.920
Covered cal for, they keep changing the name I feel like too,

34:50.920 --> 34:51.760
but whatever the thing is.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.400
You're still covered under your parents and parents.

34:53.400 --> 34:54.720
But for only three more weeks.

34:54.720 --> 34:55.800
And then it'll be a problem.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.080
So what is everyone upset about?

34:57.080 --> 34:58.920
Because it's very much not long time.

34:58.920 --> 35:01.280
And what if I fall off a ledge?

35:01.280 --> 35:02.640
He is often on ledges.

35:02.640 --> 35:04.960
People never talk, you know, off either way.

35:04.960 --> 35:05.800
Yeah.

35:05.800 --> 35:08.040
Imagine being at a ledge at the red edge.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.680
I really feel like I might end up

35:10.680 --> 35:12.760
on the edge of the red.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.040
I'm dyslexic visually.

35:16.040 --> 35:16.880
Yeah.

35:16.880 --> 35:19.640
What is that mean?

35:19.640 --> 35:21.160
He thinks eggs have less.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.760
It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like,

35:23.760 --> 35:27.160
I really do wish that people would talk me off the ledge

35:27.160 --> 35:28.240
back into the building.

35:28.240 --> 35:31.240
I feel like people chant for me to get off the ledge

35:31.240 --> 35:32.920
towards the death.

35:32.920 --> 35:35.080
This is like your second Joker reference.

35:35.560 --> 35:39.600
That would be really funny costume for tomorrow.

35:39.600 --> 35:42.640
Is me walking into the office for the Halloween happy hour.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.520
Like, let's say.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.360
Yeah.

35:45.360 --> 35:46.360
What do you know?

35:46.360 --> 35:47.400
We're going to be jumping.

35:47.400 --> 35:48.400
Good.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.840
Thank you.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.240
Good.

35:51.240 --> 35:53.480
Gary, he's going to be at Gary Glitter.

35:53.480 --> 35:54.240
That's cool.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.680
That's really cool.

35:56.680 --> 35:58.640
Um, he, because he's the guy that.

35:58.640 --> 36:01.480
What did you guys do in the break between when you had health care

36:01.480 --> 36:03.240
and when you got it from company?

36:03.240 --> 36:04.520
Gary Glitter did about that.

36:04.520 --> 36:05.520
He had a bad thing.

36:05.520 --> 36:06.520
Yeah.

36:06.520 --> 36:07.520
So don't dress up.

36:07.520 --> 36:09.520
I'll just cut this out entirely.

36:09.520 --> 36:11.520
I'll turn it to certain.

36:11.520 --> 36:12.920
Probably, well, we had the break egg.

36:12.920 --> 36:13.920
That's gone.

36:13.920 --> 36:16.320
We shall didn't want to talk about the skeletons in her closet.

36:16.320 --> 36:18.320
It made up some bullshit about losing the rings.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.320
I'm like, well, keep that in.

36:19.320 --> 36:20.320
I guess.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.920
But just so that people can know how fake you are.

36:22.920 --> 36:23.920
I killed the person.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.920
Oh, I got that out.

36:25.920 --> 36:26.920
Oh, I got that out.

36:26.920 --> 36:27.920
Damn.

36:27.920 --> 36:28.920
Damn.

36:28.920 --> 36:29.920
Damn.

36:29.920 --> 36:30.920
Um.

36:30.920 --> 36:33.920
No, wait.

36:33.920 --> 36:34.920
Yeah.

36:34.920 --> 36:36.920
Everyone here didn't have health care for a minute.

36:36.920 --> 36:37.920
What do you do?

36:37.920 --> 36:38.920
You just do the medical covered thing.

36:38.920 --> 36:39.920
Michelle, you don't have health care.

36:39.920 --> 36:40.920
What does that mean?

36:40.920 --> 36:41.920
Yeah.

36:41.920 --> 36:42.920
I pay for a car won't cover California.

36:42.920 --> 36:43.920
And how is that for you?

36:43.920 --> 36:44.920
Do you have dental?

36:44.920 --> 36:45.920
I do.

36:45.920 --> 36:46.920
I have everything.

36:46.920 --> 36:47.920
It's kind of expensive.

36:47.920 --> 36:48.920
How much is it per month?

36:48.920 --> 36:49.920
I'll bleep it out.

36:49.920 --> 36:50.920
Um, like 275.

36:50.920 --> 36:51.920
He's not going to bleep it out.

36:51.920 --> 36:52.920
What does it matter that to bleep out?

36:52.920 --> 36:54.920
Let me say so much worse things.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.920
And I was asking the price of health insurance.

36:56.920 --> 37:01.920
I will say when you do it, you should get PPO even though it's kind of expensive.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.920
Well, I think they always ask you at the doctor's office.

37:04.920 --> 37:08.920
My parents insurance hasn't always paid for everything out here because it's like regional

37:08.920 --> 37:09.920
to Ohio.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.920
So like my eye doctor does this.

37:11.920 --> 37:12.920
Maybe you should go back.

37:12.920 --> 37:13.920
Yeah.

37:13.920 --> 37:14.920
Yeah.

37:14.920 --> 37:15.920
Close with a red egg.

37:15.920 --> 37:16.920
First of all.

37:16.920 --> 37:19.920
Maybe I'll be Magneto, Ohio, tomorrow.

37:19.920 --> 37:28.920
So I'm being magnetically pulled to failure, left for turning home.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.920
I'll be Magneto, Ohio.

37:31.920 --> 37:32.920
Not tomorrow.

37:32.920 --> 37:36.920
I feel like we're covering up.

37:36.920 --> 37:37.920
I feel like we're covering up.

37:37.920 --> 37:38.920
No member.

37:38.920 --> 37:39.920
And we're talking about Halloween.

37:39.920 --> 37:40.920
True.

37:40.920 --> 37:42.920
Did you plan anything for this one?

37:42.920 --> 37:44.920
Uh, I did company reports.

37:44.920 --> 37:46.920
And we've gotten through just for shells.

37:46.920 --> 37:48.920
Which I do appreciate it for shell.

37:48.920 --> 37:49.920
Your last name is Chen.

37:49.920 --> 37:50.920
Chen.

37:50.920 --> 37:55.920
Um, I just didn't know her last name because I wanted to call her by her last name.

37:55.920 --> 37:57.920
Like we're all on a team sport, right?

37:57.920 --> 37:59.920
What about Rishel Zero?

37:59.920 --> 38:00.920
It's pretty cool.

38:00.920 --> 38:01.920
Who says no to that?

38:01.920 --> 38:02.920
No for day.

38:02.920 --> 38:04.920
Are you from, don't tell us where you're from.

38:04.920 --> 38:06.920
Are you, are you from California?

38:06.920 --> 38:08.920
Like, did you go to high school in California?

38:08.920 --> 38:09.920
Right.

38:09.920 --> 38:10.920
I didn't go to California high school.

38:10.920 --> 38:11.920
Okay.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.920
So maybe we can guess what state Rishel into high school.

38:14.920 --> 38:15.920
Well, you went to read.

38:15.920 --> 38:16.920
We know that.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.920
Um,

38:18.920 --> 38:21.920
It's either read or Lewis and Clark.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.920
And don't even tell me which because I just want to believe you went to read.

38:24.920 --> 38:25.920
Okay.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.920
So your guess is read that.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.920
Your guess is what?

38:30.920 --> 38:31.920
Or again?

38:31.920 --> 38:32.920
Yeah, Portland.

38:32.920 --> 38:33.920
No.

38:33.920 --> 38:34.920
Not working.

38:34.920 --> 38:35.920
You guys are not going to get it.

38:35.920 --> 38:36.920
Wow.

38:36.920 --> 38:37.920
Let's go.

38:37.920 --> 38:38.920
What's your guess?

38:38.920 --> 38:39.920
That's not a state.

38:39.920 --> 38:40.920
No.

38:40.920 --> 38:41.920
I'll do it.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.920
State of mind.

38:43.920 --> 38:44.920
Um, then.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.920
State of mind.

38:46.920 --> 38:47.920
Say of mind.

38:47.920 --> 38:48.920
Okay.

38:48.920 --> 38:49.920
Let's describe that.

38:49.920 --> 38:50.920
Uh, we are a state of mind.

38:50.920 --> 38:51.920
But from tell a house.

38:51.920 --> 38:52.920
No.

38:52.920 --> 38:53.920
What would, what would tell a house.

38:53.920 --> 38:54.920
A state of mind.

38:54.920 --> 38:55.920
I've got a bunch of football related.

38:55.920 --> 38:56.920
I've got a bunch of.

38:56.920 --> 38:57.920
No, not even.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.920
So it's somebody who works out of water milling farm.

38:59.920 --> 39:00.920
And tell a house.

39:00.920 --> 39:01.920
Okay.

39:01.920 --> 39:02.920
I'm in a tell a house.

39:02.920 --> 39:04.920
See, state of Ryan.

39:04.920 --> 39:05.920
Love it.

39:05.920 --> 39:06.920
And those coming.

39:06.920 --> 39:07.920
Yeah.

39:07.920 --> 39:08.920
Maricus.

39:08.920 --> 39:09.920
Maricus.

39:09.920 --> 39:10.920
What do you say?

39:10.920 --> 39:12.920
I don't know.

39:12.920 --> 39:14.920
I feel like we're getting get there eventually.

39:14.920 --> 39:15.920
There's only 50 options.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.920
We've already eliminated too.

39:17.920 --> 39:18.920
Georgia.

39:18.920 --> 39:19.920
No.

39:19.920 --> 39:20.920
You guys aren't going to get it.

39:20.920 --> 39:21.920
You know?

39:21.920 --> 39:22.920
Yes.

39:22.920 --> 39:23.920
Yeah.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.920
Well, because like, I kind of ask Michelle questions.

39:25.920 --> 39:28.920
Like I was asking me for it.

39:28.920 --> 39:30.920
I'm asking her great questions.

39:30.920 --> 39:35.920
I mean, we'll question equally great expectations.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.920
Uh, Marie.

39:37.920 --> 39:38.920
Mm-hmm.

39:38.920 --> 39:39.920
Getting me.

39:39.920 --> 39:40.920
Yeah.

39:40.920 --> 39:41.920
Did you know?

39:41.920 --> 39:42.920
This is an ambush.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.920
Because Tom is right.

39:44.920 --> 39:45.920
Mariki.

39:45.920 --> 39:46.920
You haven't guessed one yet.

39:46.920 --> 39:47.920
Yeah.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.920
Because I haven't had a chance to get a word.

39:49.920 --> 39:50.920
And this is bullshit.

39:50.920 --> 39:51.920
Yeah.

39:51.920 --> 39:52.920
Like just again overlapping dial.

39:52.920 --> 39:53.920
Can I get?

39:53.920 --> 39:54.920
No.

39:54.920 --> 39:55.920
San Francisco.

39:55.920 --> 39:56.920
No.

39:56.920 --> 39:57.920
You are simply never going to get it.

39:57.920 --> 39:58.920
I was born in San Francisco.

39:58.920 --> 39:59.920
Oh.

39:59.920 --> 40:00.920
Or at the Bay Area.

40:00.920 --> 40:01.920
Nevada.

40:01.920 --> 40:02.920
No.

40:02.920 --> 40:03.920
No.

40:03.920 --> 40:04.920
I already could just.

40:04.920 --> 40:05.920
No.

40:05.920 --> 40:06.920
No.

40:06.920 --> 40:07.920
No.

40:07.920 --> 40:08.920
No.

40:08.920 --> 40:09.920
There's a chance.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.920
It's not a state.

40:11.920 --> 40:12.920
Oh.

40:12.920 --> 40:13.920
Where do you go?

40:13.920 --> 40:14.920
Wait.

40:14.920 --> 40:15.920
That was a red herring.

40:15.920 --> 40:16.920
Florida.

40:16.920 --> 40:17.920
Yes.

40:17.920 --> 40:19.920
I can do it.

40:19.920 --> 40:20.920
Can I do it?

40:20.920 --> 40:21.920
No.

40:21.920 --> 40:22.920
Are you fucking Canada?

40:22.920 --> 40:23.920
No.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.920
Well, it wasn't a lot of America.

40:25.920 --> 40:26.920
No.

40:26.920 --> 40:27.920
It was not America.

40:27.920 --> 40:28.920
It's got to be gone.

40:28.920 --> 40:29.920
Look at me.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.920
I don't understand what you guys can't.

40:31.920 --> 40:32.920
I can't do it.

40:32.920 --> 40:34.920
I feel offensive.

40:34.920 --> 40:35.920
Guess it.

40:35.920 --> 40:36.920
I should have went to the fence.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.920
Why would you think it's a fence?

40:38.920 --> 40:39.920
I think it's a fence.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.920
I'll say china.

40:41.920 --> 40:42.920
Like if I said this.

40:42.920 --> 40:43.920
That we are offensive.

40:43.920 --> 40:44.920
What's that?

40:44.920 --> 40:45.920
Sing a port?

40:45.920 --> 40:46.920
No.

40:46.920 --> 40:47.920
Your clothes.

40:47.920 --> 40:48.920
Do you know?

40:48.920 --> 40:49.760
No.

40:49.760 --> 40:54.560
now. This is wrong. That's what I thought of me

40:54.560 --> 41:01.400
I was asking. He was like, no offense, but where did you go to high school? It was

41:01.400 --> 41:06.440
Portugal, you asked. It was Portland. He was like, don't have to answer, but it was

41:06.440 --> 41:13.880
where you call high school lives. Okay, we give up. Thailand, Thailand. Okay. Wow.

41:13.880 --> 41:17.400
But I went to high school in Thailand. Yeah. But you're all born

41:17.400 --> 41:24.840
American citizens. My parents separated. And we did Thailand with my mom at eight.

41:24.840 --> 41:30.880
Do you have dual citizenship? No. Okay. Do you have dual fuel gas range? Yes, actually.

41:30.880 --> 41:34.920
Really? Do you speak fluent Thai or real perfectly?

41:34.920 --> 41:41.000
Um, I actually don't know what that one. I guess I guess that one. Yeah, right.

41:41.000 --> 41:50.000
Yeah, I just think I don't feel the country school. Got it.

41:50.000 --> 41:55.640
Yeah. Natural gas coming through the burners and there's electric induction.

41:55.640 --> 42:00.520
Can you elect an iron gas? Do you like Thai food? I love the food.

42:00.520 --> 42:03.720
Do you? What's the best Thai food in LA? Wait, I can tell you. I'll try

42:03.720 --> 42:08.080
to get the name of the place. She answered that for me before it's a lie town.

42:08.080 --> 42:13.360
It's in Taito and it's called. Is it Jill? That word. That's it. That word.

42:13.360 --> 42:17.560
It's not a little three. She never names Jill a lot. Wow. Is that the one

42:17.560 --> 42:21.640
that used to be a windshields? Like there's a, no. But you know, I don't know

42:21.640 --> 42:25.640
what your mother is. Is this the one that Amir got the green curry

42:25.640 --> 42:31.720
thrown on his windshields? He wronged. I love her. And yes, she tossed

42:32.680 --> 42:34.920
Is that real? Of course. It's real.

42:36.920 --> 42:40.680
The word is your favorite. He's another personal question for a show. And I don't

42:40.680 --> 42:45.280
want to cross any boundaries, but have you ever dated a famous? A famous person.

42:45.280 --> 42:51.120
Oh, or conversely, who's the most famous person you've ever. It was a good

42:51.120 --> 42:58.720
horse in a van. Whoa. That's cool. How do you spell Belle? What? Who's your

42:58.720 --> 43:05.920
real? Can you believe it? Yeah. I don't know. I don't believe it. It was a

43:05.920 --> 43:09.960
with a band that I really liked. So it was the big deal to me. That's cool. I

43:09.960 --> 43:16.560
from part of them. Is it PA or? PA or? God. This is okay. We have to move on

43:16.560 --> 43:20.000
company. I will. I'll probably go to the band or the food. The food on the

43:20.000 --> 43:23.520
menu. Company report. Right? What has been going on beyond the studio

43:23.520 --> 43:27.360
following a part of the scenes? So here's my question back to you. Yeah.

43:27.360 --> 43:31.120
Is company report what do you do with this company or how the company is doing?

43:31.120 --> 43:34.320
Because you both. It's it's it's it's it's three things. It's what do you do

43:34.320 --> 43:38.160
the company? How is your job going at the company? And then how are you

43:38.160 --> 43:42.160
affecting the company's success negatively or positively? This looks really good.

43:42.240 --> 43:47.200
All right. It's good. For this. So here's what's happening to me positively.

43:47.200 --> 43:52.000
Okay. Personally at the company. Sure. I hope Martin Cohen don't see this.

43:52.000 --> 43:57.920
They definitely will not. So I went to party city a couple weeks ago and I got

43:57.920 --> 44:02.000
two Halloween costumes. Sure. In two different, one Halloween costume two

44:02.000 --> 44:06.640
sizes because I wanted to try the one. I didn't like either of them. And so I

44:06.640 --> 44:11.120
but I forgot to return them. Of course. And after certain day you can only get

44:11.200 --> 44:15.120
store credit. And I was like, what am I going to do with $90 in store credit to

44:15.120 --> 44:22.240
party city? So I messaged Martin Cohen. And I said, do we need any Halloween

44:22.240 --> 44:27.520
decorations from party city? And they said, yes, that's awesome. That's so nice

44:27.520 --> 44:30.160
that you went out of your way to kind of like volunteer to go shopping for

44:30.160 --> 44:34.560
decorations for us. 100%. And so I was like this no problem to be a budget. I

44:34.560 --> 44:39.440
got a budget. It's above $90. I went. I got the decorations. I used my

44:39.440 --> 44:44.640
merchandise credit. And I'm going to get expense back for that fire. So that was

44:44.640 --> 44:51.920
awesome for me. Do you say the thing? What is she talking about? Am I crazy to think that

44:51.920 --> 45:02.800
she's like, don't. Don't eat it. No, no, no. So yeah, so for me this week is

45:02.800 --> 45:07.760
really good company wise and personally my position in the company. Okay. Well,

45:07.840 --> 45:13.520
that was probably yeah of the two. Maybe the better company before. Okay. That's

45:13.520 --> 45:19.120
that's not nice. It's not unkind. No, it is unkind. That's exactly what it is.

45:19.120 --> 45:23.680
Really? I'm sorry, Rachelle. Did you take a fence or did you kind of dissociate?

45:23.680 --> 45:27.920
I honestly don't know what we should do. We should do it in a go.

45:29.120 --> 45:33.920
We should do an episode where you just make a men's. That's really funny. You know,

45:33.920 --> 45:37.760
wait, what's is there like a day of atonement? Yeah, I'm going to pour. Really? Yeah, that

45:37.760 --> 45:42.480
is. Wait, really? Yes. Okay, so we'll have to wait a whole

45:42.480 --> 45:46.480
other year. That's another year to rack up wrongdoings. Yeah, you go do your own

45:46.480 --> 45:54.240
yam keeper. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Let's go Jeff. What about yams? Don't

45:54.240 --> 46:01.600
get it for. Don't Jeff is my day of atonement. Plus atonement. Don't

46:01.600 --> 46:08.400
men. I'm your company report. You're technically still an owner. Did you sell your

46:08.400 --> 46:14.480
stakes last stock? He's still stake. And if you haven't yet, why not? Then

46:16.880 --> 46:21.760
everything's going well. Yeah, except for a few things, obviously. There are a few

46:21.760 --> 46:26.480
cancers within the company that are wondering who they want to know. Yeah, that's mostly

46:26.480 --> 46:32.800
Jeff. Yeah, but it's also Angie because she was born on July 9. What's wrong with that?

46:32.800 --> 46:37.600
She's a cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer. I didn't get that. I'm usually pretty quick to

46:37.600 --> 46:42.720
the joke, so I think I'm slipping in my old age. She's a strategy is more of a young man's

46:42.720 --> 46:47.760
game. Yeah, but just the fact that I didn't get the joke and everybody else did. It's like

46:47.760 --> 46:51.680
earlier when you thought I thought, you thought I thought, Marie can want to divert

46:51.680 --> 46:57.520
it in a university. No, I didn't think that. Yeah, I'm very good at it.

46:58.480 --> 47:07.920
Uh, my, I don't know. I've doing a lot of stuff. I'm doing work right now. She's like too busy

47:07.920 --> 47:13.520
to make a joke. Do you think I'm getting in trouble for the party?

47:13.520 --> 47:21.440
Is that a scam? Do I scam? No, I think you're fine. I mean, obviously some that

47:21.440 --> 47:26.000
clipped a coin, but I think your white whale, your Moby Dick Jeff, is getting

47:26.000 --> 47:31.040
Cohen on this show because he refused us to do it. Yeah, but for him, it's like a non-starter.

47:31.040 --> 47:35.040
Exactly. He's like, I will never do it. And it's plain and it's not like a bit. Like Angie didn't

47:35.040 --> 47:38.560
want to do it, but we got her. Yeah, like some people are playful about not wanting to do it. He's

47:38.560 --> 47:43.120
like very like that's why you got to try harder. Here's what we'll also say is that shackles

47:43.120 --> 47:49.600
no more. Yeah. That's sort of a company report. Oh, because you changed the last thing. Yeah.

47:49.600 --> 47:54.480
Yeah. I wanted people to think she got fired, but yeah, no, shackles is now masa.

47:56.320 --> 48:02.720
It's like a restaurant banner. Shackles now, masa. Same place.

48:02.720 --> 48:11.520
Yeah. Angie's list is now just Angie. Angie Garcia is. I keep feeling like your

48:11.600 --> 48:16.160
doxing people by saying their last names, but yeah, I don't know why. It just feels wrong.

48:16.560 --> 48:21.440
Website, I think. Oh, yeah, I should probably update a lot of people. This just in

48:22.000 --> 48:30.640
shackles, masa. I really want to have masa, not shackle on again to wax all things,

48:31.760 --> 48:39.520
masa corn. That's after you get through the rice and you go to corn. Corn meal.

48:40.480 --> 48:46.160
What about unicorn is your costume? I just am worried. I'll be propositioned to many times tomorrow night.

48:46.160 --> 48:50.800
Beal have like a hat. The company happy hour that starts at 4 p.m. Yeah. That was no

48:50.800 --> 48:54.960
mostly children. That's mostly coupled people. Are you wearing a costume?

48:54.960 --> 49:00.560
A couple of old people. Exactly right. And I'm going to be the unicorn. You know, corn on the cob is

49:00.560 --> 49:06.080
the complete. That's not bad at all. I did think about just being corn. Oh, like the corn kid.

49:06.080 --> 49:11.760
The kind where you just like put a giant felt costume over your body. The kind where I roll and

49:11.760 --> 49:19.600
raw egg and then corn. What? You know, how when you're trying to like fry a chicken? Yeah, like a

49:19.600 --> 49:25.760
schnitzel put it egg and then like rub it and corn meal and then deep fry it. I don't mind that as a

49:25.760 --> 49:32.240
costume. He's saying corn, but he said corn first. What if it's not even a costume for tomorrow?

49:32.240 --> 49:35.360
I guess that's what's more interesting to me. Did you have anything planned for this episode?

49:35.360 --> 49:41.520
Because so far we've been company reports. That's not a plan so much company. Okay. Well, I tried.

49:41.520 --> 49:46.080
I tried to talk more about the company. I tried to make it not so much random shit. I tried to say

49:46.080 --> 49:49.920
let's talk about headgum and where we're headed. Are we headed towards the red or towards the

49:50.000 --> 50:02.880
carers? Say what you mean. Where did that come from? You've been supportive all

50:02.880 --> 50:12.320
hour. Where's how? Coming from America. I am. Feel like you're not going to show up. Yeah, it does

50:12.320 --> 50:17.520
get that vibe. Yeah, I did. He'll text us at six. Like, hey, sorry. I'm running late because I

50:17.520 --> 50:24.160
had to do X Y. Yeah, like my accountant died and I had to. Yeah. Little do we know Rochelle assassinated him?

50:24.160 --> 50:30.320
Or her? Do you think if Rochelle killed my ass, she would be revered as a euro. Statue in the

50:30.320 --> 50:39.360
parking lot, et cetera. I would hope so. Yeah. I think we should we should put a statue of the parking lot.

50:39.360 --> 50:44.240
Oh, someone regardless. Wait, I don't mind. I do. Let's take let's vote on which to be.

50:44.480 --> 50:50.480
All hands for Jeff. Raise your hand for Jeff. I kind of think it's got to be D.

50:52.480 --> 50:59.920
Is D still alive? Yeah. Yeah. Last time saw her. See? Parties dog. Oh, Delilah. Yeah. She's like,

50:59.920 --> 51:04.960
she's alive. All right, last question. This is just a whole for the random one. Would you

51:04.960 --> 51:08.640
rather, this is a real genuine road you're out there that was talking with my friends about the other

51:09.360 --> 51:18.080
would you rather have every statue come to life in the world? And the personality slash

51:18.080 --> 51:23.360
energy they bring is the energy and personality of what the statue is. So if there's like a

51:23.360 --> 51:30.400
statue of like Mars, like the Roman god, that's going to be a God of war coming to life. But

51:30.400 --> 51:38.240
these statues can't leave like a half mile radius of themselves. Or would you rather every

51:38.480 --> 51:48.080
word your favorite. Oh, my god, forgive me for trying to put some water. God, forgive me.

51:48.880 --> 51:56.960
Pa, or forgive me. Or would you rather every bug in the world be three times is or sorry,

51:56.960 --> 52:03.600
10 times is big. Obviously, that one's awful. That's a nonsense. Have hands the size of dogs everywhere.

52:03.680 --> 52:10.640
They would invest three times. Well, I question is like numbers wise, right? So like let's not follow

52:10.640 --> 52:16.960
Amir's logic too quickly. Let's all form our own opinions. I didn't turn my the size of a fucking

52:16.960 --> 52:22.160
throw pillow. That would be so small. They were like this big. They were 10x. That's fine.

52:26.080 --> 52:31.280
But let me talk to you about this shit. There's already a risk in this. He's just doing this.

52:34.080 --> 52:40.400
He's just changing his mind. Oh, exactly right. My god, rather there'd be a God of war that

52:40.400 --> 52:45.920
can't leave a one mile radius of fucking. I don't know. My old radius. Yeah. I mean, once you

52:45.920 --> 52:51.600
once you even rode it around it, once you put the radius around it, like I feel like the worst

52:51.600 --> 52:56.480
it's going to happen is some blocks of major cities might get a little fucked up.

52:57.440 --> 53:03.600
Go there. Yeah. But that's the thing. How many statues do you think are in the world versus how

53:03.600 --> 53:05.680
many bugs do you think are in the world? Because I think that there's like

53:06.960 --> 53:10.720
millions of bugs. And I think that there's like a couple hundred thousand statues.

53:14.720 --> 53:20.960
Anyone to be influenced by Amir just because he technically pays us all billions of bugs. Really.

53:21.920 --> 53:28.000
Absolutely. Just like just learning this for the first time. This just a lot of the statue.

53:30.960 --> 53:36.960
Bad and racist, but you could just avoid their. That's not their radius. Yeah. You can avoid a

53:36.960 --> 53:43.440
bee. Our size. They're probably going to be in the same like radiuses will overlap.

53:44.320 --> 53:49.440
Possibly with some of their enemies or big personalities that they won't get along with. And you

53:49.440 --> 53:53.520
can just like watch them fight it out. They just melted down one of the statues.

53:53.520 --> 54:00.560
Did my Robert Ely I think they melted it? Jeff is currently googling. I'm sure if a company sucks

54:00.560 --> 54:10.800
and you tell the CEO honestly. What did it say? What does it say? It says feedback to the CEO.

54:11.680 --> 54:16.000
Directly to the CEO or anyone in senior leadership. Are you talking about like a company you

54:16.000 --> 54:20.880
work at or a company you don't like? I just think like Coca-Cola. Nestle does bad stuff. You're

54:20.880 --> 54:24.560
going to tell the CEO. I just don't know how many pull there, but I feel like I could like pull

54:25.280 --> 54:31.280
fucking nothing here. Really? No. Also ultimately the culture is pretty good. Yeah.

54:31.280 --> 54:38.320
Ultimately. Yeah. And I think that statues coming to life bugs three times the size 10 times.

54:38.320 --> 54:44.400
It doesn't matter. Yeah. Because camaraderie have different conversations with your friends.

54:44.480 --> 54:49.120
Definitely. What should I ask about? My Instagram is at the mirror.

54:51.200 --> 54:57.520
I self-plugged. That's the self-plugged. Yeah. Let's talk about it segments. Only on head

54:57.520 --> 55:04.960
gum break. It did the what's the concert for it. Jake and I have an ever changing podcast every

55:04.960 --> 55:10.320
10 or so minutes a completely new segment to keep things fresh and fierce.

55:11.280 --> 55:18.000
Marieka to the heart for it. So we appreciate that. That's Ferris Monchi. Old head gum all star

55:18.640 --> 55:24.720
for this show too. Did the the theme song for it? So check that out. That song is great. Yeah.

55:24.720 --> 55:30.640
Jeff, that's kind of what you try to do, but now they're doing it. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like the

55:30.640 --> 55:35.600
segments of the head gum podcast are only a little more structure and Jake and I are on a friendly and

55:36.080 --> 55:40.000
good. And like you guys plan it. Yes. Exactly. Right. Company reports I did plan.

55:40.000 --> 55:45.040
Company reports I did plan. That was two words. Yeah. I said about the week. I said on your

55:45.040 --> 55:49.040
boyfriend. Yeah, we did. But you didn't ask us what are about the week. I said he was swath. Yeah. We

55:49.040 --> 55:53.440
said he knew how to give other people the floor. Our segment is a little more structure. Just like

55:53.440 --> 55:58.000
there's a beginning, middle and end, everyone. Absolutely. There was guide. They were in

55:58.000 --> 56:01.200
the show. I said welcome to the show. Here you go. Please chat. I'm also going to

56:01.200 --> 56:09.120
Michelle Chen there. I said welcome. Yeah. Zero. I said welcome. I'm talking about the worst thing

56:09.120 --> 56:14.160
we're talking about. Right. And that was sort of like the emotional crisis episode. Towards the end,

56:14.160 --> 56:18.160
we started to get into like some more late hearted show. I have to go. First of all, once we

56:18.160 --> 56:27.840
just sounds like I have YouTube to YouTube. Sorry. It's on a tab. I can't find you.

56:28.480 --> 56:37.520
You should as a tab you can't find. Everyone's laughing at you. It's an ad playing in a tab you

56:37.520 --> 56:45.120
can't find. I see that there's like an audio thing on the phone. But I can't fucking figure out

56:45.120 --> 56:52.080
how to stop it. Yeah. I have to go. I literally have to leave. All right. Tell me. I'm meeting somebody

56:52.080 --> 57:00.400
at 3 p.m. All right. On your plug. You can head out. Radio Free Onya. Big news show coming. January,

57:00.400 --> 57:11.200
right, Marika. We decided to get on this feed because I'll be back to no. Sorry. On you zero will return.

57:11.200 --> 57:17.520
Yeah. It's the on you zero hour on the other. On the other. Every hour on the other.

57:17.600 --> 57:23.600
Um, Rochelle, what do you got? Um, my Instagram is at your underscore, underscore,

57:23.600 --> 57:30.320
sard, and my yard. Have you ever seen the, the yard sale signs that are actually that say

57:30.320 --> 57:36.160
your third. Oh, no. Okay. It's that. It's an old meme. Meaging a mirror yet again.

57:36.240 --> 57:45.280
Let's see. And I'm looking at me. And my bond of the week is a Jeff Spun.

57:47.840 --> 57:52.240
You can't say that. That's where I draw the line.

57:53.680 --> 57:58.800
Yeah, there's a man bun. Nice. And imagine if that man bun was a man bun.

57:58.800 --> 58:07.280
Man bun. Man bun. Man bun. Man bun. Man bun. You and shit. See how you're nothing.

58:08.880 --> 58:15.360
Marika. Take a single home. Take a single home. Take a single home.

58:15.360 --> 58:23.200
Follow me. I'm Marika. I'm on. I broke down. Sorry. High school Tyler.

58:23.200 --> 58:33.680
You should go. I'm real dead. I mean, or sorry, Marika, what do you got? I already

58:33.680 --> 58:39.120
fucking said it. So it doesn't matter. We're free. I got a picture. Every James on Instagram.

58:39.120 --> 58:43.280

58:43.280 --> 58:45.280
Jesus Christ.

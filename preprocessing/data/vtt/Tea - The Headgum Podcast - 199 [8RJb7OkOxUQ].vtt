00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:29.500
I had to put this on my cat tree, my cat's cat tree, sorry.

00:29.500 --> 00:33.200
And now she's on the second tier, and she's shaking it all about.

00:33.200 --> 00:37.700
So if you guys are sorry, and now I'm seeing Joel, and he's sitting and leaning like he's

00:37.700 --> 00:38.700
in a press junket.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.700
Do you have something to say, Joel?

00:40.700 --> 00:42.700
What's a press junket?

00:42.700 --> 00:46.200
You gotta be cheating me without this episode has started.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.700
We started?

00:47.700 --> 00:48.700
Kidding me?

00:48.700 --> 00:49.700
Oh, you guys didn't hear the sound.

00:49.700 --> 00:50.700
Okay.

00:50.700 --> 00:51.700
Yeah.

00:51.700 --> 00:52.700
Got it.

00:52.700 --> 00:53.700
No, we're going.

00:53.700 --> 00:54.700
We're absolutely going.

00:54.700 --> 00:58.700
I thought that that was the energy that Joel you wanted to have going through.

00:58.700 --> 00:59.700
Now you can hear this, right?

00:59.700 --> 01:03.200
So is that part where you put off Ali right as Susan the middle of talking?

01:03.200 --> 01:04.200
Was that the beginning of the film?

01:04.200 --> 01:05.200
That was the theme song.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.200
Yeah.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.200
Got it.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.200
That's exactly right.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.200
I didn't hear that.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.200
Yeah.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.200
None of us did.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.200
My hair is wet.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.200
I'm a little self conscious about it.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.200
We're not going to talk about it.

01:14.200 --> 01:19.200
What we are going to talk about is gratitude.

01:19.200 --> 01:22.700
I think we should explain to Joel what a press junket is.

01:22.700 --> 01:24.200
Take it away, Marika.

01:24.700 --> 01:31.400
It's when, like, for a movie or a TV show, there's people being interviewed for, like,

01:31.400 --> 01:34.200
from the cast or director, whatever.

01:34.200 --> 01:38.700
A lot of times now they're on Zoom and you just look like you're one of those people

01:38.700 --> 01:45.200
that's just waiting for questions from bustle or something like that.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.200
Peanut gallery.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.200
No, exactly.

01:48.200 --> 01:51.200
No, you're the star of the show.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.200
Okay.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.200
I'll take it.

01:53.200 --> 01:57.700
And everyone else is waiting to ask you a question for five minutes before they have to leave

01:57.700 --> 02:00.700
and someone else comes in and that's your entire day.

02:00.700 --> 02:01.700
You're just sitting here.

02:01.700 --> 02:05.700
It's basically the surprise 24 hour live stream.

02:05.700 --> 02:13.200
Joel, was it hard leaving your character behind once filming wrapped?

02:13.200 --> 02:18.200
It was hard at first, but I decided to just still wear the clothes and still live my

02:18.200 --> 02:22.200
life by a script, which kind of made the adjustment easier.

02:22.200 --> 02:25.200
So what you're considering now is that you keep the clothes?

02:25.200 --> 02:27.200
Yeah, this was all pre-scripted.

02:27.200 --> 02:32.200
So how do you know that, because we're asking you questions and you're responding perfectly?

02:32.200 --> 02:37.200
You're actually where you, he was a featured extra and silver lining's playbook.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.200
And he still hasn't let it go.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.200
That's a great pull.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.200
You should get out of it.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.200
That reminds me.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.200
I'm not sure.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.200
Feature extra.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.200
Sorry, it was just like what was created.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.200
It involves the eagles and then that's when I came up with it.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.200
That was a great pull.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.200
That's a great pull.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.200
No bond of the week.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.200
Right.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.200
The whole thing is on hold.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.200
Because now it's seemingly killing and Murphy though.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.200
We can check it out.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.200
Can I say one thing?

03:03.200 --> 03:04.200
Yeah.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.200
As soon as we stop doing it, everybody's like, wait, can I give a bond of the week?

03:07.200 --> 03:08.200
When did we stop doing it?

03:08.200 --> 03:09.200
Or why?

03:09.200 --> 03:10.200
Okay.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.200
So, Murphy could listen to the show.

03:11.200 --> 03:15.200
So, Murphy could listen to the show week two week because I said two weeks ago.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.200
Three weeks ago.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.200
It's on hold.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.200
Oh, like that.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.200
Okay.

03:21.200 --> 03:26.200
Well, even though it's on hold, I do have to say, okay.

03:26.200 --> 03:32.200
So both of my family dogs just passed away in like these last couple of weeks.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.200
And so that has been brutal.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.200
Thank you.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.200
But it's not okay, but it's okay, you know.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.200
But anyway, I was talking to my dad on the phone yesterday.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.200
And he was, and I mentioned that I was doing this this week.

03:41.200 --> 03:46.200
And he was like, okay, well, if you do bond of the week, could you just say,

03:46.200 --> 03:49.200
he literally was like, can you just say stand in George?

03:49.200 --> 03:51.200
And they're the bond of the week.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.200
So we have to do a proper one then.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.200
Yeah.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.200
Bond of the week.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.200
Okay.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.200
But my two dogs who are no longer with us stand in George.

04:07.200 --> 04:10.200
They would have killed it if they were still around to be cast.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.200
The fact they did.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.200
That's good.

04:13.200 --> 04:17.200
All throw in another dog messy from an anime of a fall.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.200
The dog played Snoop.

04:19.200 --> 04:23.200
And all throw in a person who's got that dog in him.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.200
Leo messy.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.200
Very nice.

04:28.200 --> 04:33.200
And I'll do funky girl 10, 20 in her time with morning.

04:33.200 --> 04:38.200
Kind of gone like Snoop dog or something.

04:38.200 --> 04:43.200
That would be a clatter.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.200
Still in a press drunk it.

04:47.200 --> 04:54.200
Joel, have you been to Philadelphia this year?

04:54.200 --> 04:56.200
Several times, I have a new nephew.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.200
So there's been a lot of back and forth.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.200
All right.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.200
I couldn't do that.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.200
I couldn't do that.

05:04.200 --> 05:08.200
I put him in the waiting room because he wasn't supposed to go.

05:08.200 --> 05:11.200
He was supposed to stay put a lot.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.200
Right.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.200
You're supposed to stay put a lot.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.200
Joel, I put him in the spot.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.200
I put him to the test.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.200
And yeah, first of all, you should have lied.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.200
Second of all, you said you've been a ton of times.

05:21.200 --> 05:25.200
Yeah, several like almost not quite every weekend.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.200
But a week has noticed.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.200
To it though.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.200
I haven't been in the office quite as much.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.200
A lot of people thought I moved actually.

05:32.200 --> 05:36.200
I don't think that, but I know the rumors swirling.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.200
Everyone was like, Joel, you freaking moved.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.200
I was like, no.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.200
I don't think there were.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.200
Who started this?

05:41.200 --> 05:42.200
There were rumors.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.200
It wasn't safe.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.200
I didn't start them.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.200
Who started it?

05:46.200 --> 05:47.200
I don't know.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.200
So that's the thing about rumors.

05:48.200 --> 05:49.200
You never know.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.200
Like you can find that.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.200
You can find that.

05:52.200 --> 05:55.200
There's a place where you can find a telephone thing.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.200
And how has Sage reacted, Marika?

05:58.200 --> 06:01.200
Have you heard any word from Sage in terms of winning the headgun

06:01.200 --> 06:02.200
March madness bracket?

06:02.200 --> 06:04.200
Joel, how did you see this?

06:04.200 --> 06:05.200
No.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.200
Did you see this?

06:06.200 --> 06:07.200
Did you see this?

06:07.200 --> 06:09.200
Did you get a lot of this garbage?

06:09.200 --> 06:10.200
Yeah, no.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.200
I told her last week right after.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.200
Yeah.

06:14.200 --> 06:17.200
I'll pull up the slack that she responded with.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.200
But she hasn't seen it happen because it was kind of a moment

06:20.200 --> 06:21.200
of education.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.200
You obviously came in second.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.200
I didn't even ask you how you felt about that.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.200
And you were on the fucking Zoom.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.200
I thought you did ask me.

06:29.200 --> 06:32.200
I mean, I'm happy someone on my team won.

06:32.200 --> 06:35.200
That's a really big, really big deal.

06:35.200 --> 06:38.200
I feel like I've fostered that.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.200
So that's good.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.200
Yeah.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.200
It's kind of nice to see the next generation sort of.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.200
You serve your ass.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.200
Sure.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.200
Sure.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.200
Yeah.

06:48.200 --> 06:52.200
Like is it resounding or is it kind of resolute?

06:52.200 --> 06:53.200
Is it resounding?

06:53.200 --> 06:54.200
Yeah.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.200
Is it resounding?

06:55.200 --> 06:56.200
Yes.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.200
Or is it like five?

06:58.200 --> 06:59.200
Okay.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.200
All right.

07:01.200 --> 07:05.200
Today we're going to talk about gratitude for no reason.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.200
Are you guys familiar with Plum Deluxe?

07:08.200 --> 07:09.200
No.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.200
No.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.200
No.

07:11.200 --> 07:16.200
So Plum Deluxe is sort of a community that sells tea.

07:16.200 --> 07:19.200
Loose leaf or loose leaf.

07:19.200 --> 07:25.200
I remember when you bought 30 dollars of Cornfield's tea or was it no.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.200
$100.

07:26.200 --> 07:30.200
That's a lot of tea.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.200
That's a lot of tea.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.200
Or no.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.200
It was an outstanding amount.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.200
Yeah.

07:36.200 --> 07:39.200
And I tried to get him to reimburse me and he didn't.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.200
So.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.200
But he paid me 30 dollars.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.200
Oh, yeah.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.200
Yeah.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.200
No.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.200
Yeah.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.200
The try guys are on my shirt list.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.200
I'm down to try and start some action.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.200
I'm dead, though.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.200
No.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.200
I love Ned.

07:53.200 --> 07:58.200
Mostly his interpersonal relationships.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.200
Okay.

07:59.200 --> 08:08.200
So Plum Deluxe is a tea store slash club slash community community.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.200
And they part of the community is that they have this kind of online journal.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.200
Right.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.200
So I found this article for Mandy Hayes that says the gratitude dinner.

08:15.200 --> 08:19.200
Mindful conversations starters for your next gathering.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.200
So, you know, it's Friday.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.200
I think we all have that Friday feeling.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.200
I know that a lot of the show is conversation enders.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.200
So I'm trying to actually.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.200
Let's try to have a good episode today.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.200
Let's try to actually talk about stuff.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.200
Let's try to be a little earnest.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.200
Let's try to be a little grateful.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.200
We're going to just go through this article and we're going to follow.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.200
How Andy Hayes thinks that a small gathering should go.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.200
Is everyone on board?

08:44.200 --> 08:45.200
I guess.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.200
Yeah.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.200
Okay.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.200
Sure.

08:49.200 --> 08:53.200
So the first prompt is past.

08:53.200 --> 09:00.200
We all have to say one thing that we appreciate about the other three.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.200
Marika, do you want to start?

09:02.200 --> 09:06.200
The first prompt is past.

09:06.200 --> 09:12.200
So basically it's an opportunity to open up the gratitude pipeline about the drug flow.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.200
No, Joel explained it much better.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.200
How did Joel say?

09:16.200 --> 09:17.200
What did he say?

09:17.200 --> 09:20.200
He said it's past or one person to the next.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.200
So no one's going to say it.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.200
So you're all going to pass on past.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.200
There's a terrible start.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.200
Pat.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.200
Oh my God.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.200
I have to say something about everybody.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.200
All three of you.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.200
Sorry.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.200
All four of us have to say something.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.200
We one thing we appreciate about the other three.

09:37.200 --> 09:41.400
So Marika, you're going to go down the line and then Alio will go down the line and then Joel

09:41.400 --> 09:42.400
go down the line.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.700
What if you chose to choose one?

09:45.700 --> 09:48.200
I just I definitely want to keep it together.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.200
I'm really trying to keep it together.

09:50.200 --> 09:53.200
But you guys are already like changing the game.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.200
Yeah.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.200
Let's do one.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.200
So I like you joined the idea that.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.200
And there were two things that happened.

09:58.200 --> 10:02.200
One was that Alie thought the first thing I said was how much I missed her, which I

10:02.200 --> 10:05.200
I wasn't actually saying, or that is true.

10:05.200 --> 10:08.360
And then at the same time, we also have the same plan.

10:08.360 --> 10:11.040
So I'm feeling very bonded with Alice.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.440
We pull it out.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.600
Get your be a boot.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.680
OK, I'm going to amend my bond of the week

10:15.680 --> 10:18.440
to the bond between Joel and Ali's plans.

10:18.440 --> 10:21.240
It's really good.

10:21.240 --> 10:24.040
I want to also say one, if we can get to more

10:24.040 --> 10:27.200
than be great, but Marieka won't you just pass it off?

10:27.200 --> 10:30.360
Yeah, I guess this is kind of a round about thing,

10:30.360 --> 10:35.560
but it basically, I was trying to book this

10:35.560 --> 10:38.600
help on you with booking guests for this episode.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.720
And I was like, you know, who'd be good together,

10:40.720 --> 10:42.600
Ali and Joel never been done.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.000
I guess by the way, we should say.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.280
Yeah, so I was thinking about that.

10:45.280 --> 10:50.200
So ultimately, that's an on-year compliment for setting that up.

10:50.200 --> 10:53.640
But by way of on-year, Jeff being the host,

10:53.640 --> 10:56.120
bringing us all here together, that's your compliment.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.920
Just bringing Ali and Joel together for this episode.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.680
So you're, sorry, I'm really, again,

11:00.680 --> 11:01.960
I'm really going to try and keep it straight

11:01.960 --> 11:06.120
later today, but already your compliment is to me.

11:06.120 --> 11:09.160
But it's really that you like hanging out with Ali and Joel.

11:09.160 --> 11:13.160
Well, I'm happy that you, by way of on-year, brought them together.

11:13.160 --> 11:15.840
So it's more compliment to on-year Ali and Joel.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.840
You're just packaging it up and saying it's a compliment to me.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.600
I don't appreciate it, but we will.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.520
I'm grateful for it, whatever.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.520
Ali.

11:24.520 --> 11:28.080
OK, I'll start with you, Jeff.

11:28.080 --> 11:34.080
I'm so grateful for you for the time that I was having my job

11:34.080 --> 11:36.960
interview here, and you happened to walk into the studio

11:36.960 --> 11:39.600
while Casey and On-Yo were on Zoom and said,

11:39.600 --> 11:45.280
hey, Ali, and not really, I think, helped me get some good

11:45.280 --> 11:47.120
conversational flow going where I was like,

11:47.120 --> 11:49.440
see, it's already makes so much sense.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.000
I don't think that's the reason you got the job.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.440
I don't think it is either, but I think that that's a

11:55.520 --> 11:57.520
Charlotte letter on your job interview.

11:57.520 --> 12:00.880
That was the only calm I see in your last name.

12:00.880 --> 12:06.800
I think that me saying, oh, I've actually gotten answers from Jeffrey James for years

12:06.800 --> 12:08.960
is helpful.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.960
That was so true.

12:10.960 --> 12:14.560
It might not be answers you like, but I can get it.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.680
He sometimes, you can get them down for a decade.

12:17.680 --> 12:21.200
Yeah, I can do it.

12:21.200 --> 12:25.280
All right, so Ali's compliment to me is again sort of backhanded

12:25.280 --> 12:30.000
in that you slipped in a thing at the end there that I'm not good at my job.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Joel?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
I already gave one to Ali.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.240
What is this?

12:36.240 --> 12:37.680
I'm literally starting this.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.080
Yeah, the whole task is what I think.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.320
And I think we did it because we all did one.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.800
I didn't do one, and nobody prompted me, too.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.040
Can we talk about how we're doing the fucking prompts from a T

12:47.040 --> 12:48.240
company? Why are we doing it?

12:48.240 --> 12:50.240
We're going to be dinner party from us.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.280
I do it all the way.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.560
There's no dinner party.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.520
Okay, I was going to say this guy knows nothing about dinner parties.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.880
He probably knows about tea parties.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.200
He's the one to say Republican in the house.

13:02.880 --> 13:08.000
I also want to say, when I'm with friends and we have to do a gratitude thing,

13:08.720 --> 13:09.600
I don't like it.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.360
Yeah, it's like me too.

13:11.360 --> 13:15.360
Yeah, I have to share our best memory.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.560
I don't like it.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.600
I feel like there are some people who say they don't like it, but secretly like it.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.560
Sure.

13:20.720 --> 13:23.200
You know, there's always that the kid like to receive it.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.040
I think Ali might be like that.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.240
I believe you, Maria.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.840
No, no, no, no, no.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.760
I'm never one of those.

13:29.760 --> 13:33.760
I'm thankful I didn't grow up in a family that was like the roses and thorns at the dinner table.

13:33.760 --> 13:34.560
Mm-hmm.

13:34.560 --> 13:34.960
I don't really...

13:34.960 --> 13:35.360
I don't really...

13:35.360 --> 13:36.160
I don't really...

13:36.160 --> 13:40.240
I really don't like planned part like force participation in that way.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.240
My attitude was always like, if something happened,

13:42.240 --> 13:44.080
and I want to tell you, I'll tell you.

13:44.080 --> 13:47.040
This whole podcast is forced participation by the way.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.520
I really am a problem with it.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.000
All right, I appreciate that you guys...

13:54.000 --> 13:55.280
No, I have to give you one compliment.

13:55.280 --> 13:58.560
All right, Joel, I appreciate that you were honest

13:58.560 --> 14:03.120
about not following through and making good

14:03.120 --> 14:05.760
on your doled-out resolution.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.040
Your doled-out resolution.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.160
But I do expect maybe for the...

14:10.160 --> 14:12.960
You can make up for it for the rest of the year if you just don't could have filled it with you.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.720
And don't say the holidays are really important.

14:15.600 --> 14:16.320
Right.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.080
Don't say my dad is turning 60.

14:18.720 --> 14:19.280
Right.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.800
I'm on the Plum Deluxe website.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.840
Can we take their T quiz?

14:27.200 --> 14:27.840
I'll answer.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.120
Which T are you?

14:29.120 --> 14:29.680
Yeah.

14:29.680 --> 14:32.320
I'm obviously grateful for the innovation here, Murika,

14:32.320 --> 14:34.080
but you're kind of like slowing us down.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.080
You're sitting us down and you're not sitting down.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.120
You're not sitting down.

14:38.800 --> 14:39.520
You're not sitting down.

14:39.520 --> 14:40.240
You're not taking it again?

14:41.120 --> 14:42.480
You're slowing us down.

14:43.440 --> 14:47.280
You're sitting down and you're reconnecting with the wrong things.

14:48.640 --> 14:52.240
I feel like I'm connecting with everyone by this.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.240
We're going to find out our collective T.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.280
But we are as a group as T.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.160
Fine, fine.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.520
Let's take the fucking quiz.

14:59.520 --> 15:00.800
Are you new to T?

15:01.920 --> 15:02.880
No, no.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.160
I've been in this meeting.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.160
No, T knowledge whatsoever.

15:06.160 --> 15:06.880
What do you mean?

15:06.880 --> 15:08.640
Consider myself a T-in-office.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.160
Or is it a sign like a T?

15:10.160 --> 15:11.360
Strong disagree.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.240
That's an off-screen.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.600
Doesn't it sound like a nudity?

15:15.920 --> 15:17.280
Did anyone else get mad?

15:17.360 --> 15:19.040
Do you enjoy new to T?

15:21.360 --> 15:22.480
Something I love more than a T.

15:22.480 --> 15:25.040
Sure, I'd be sure we would just go T-in-office.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.560
Or do we all know our way around T?

15:27.600 --> 15:28.640
Nava's fine.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.680
I'd say I'm intermediate.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.800
Nava's is also like kind of a novelty office,

15:34.800 --> 15:37.040
which I would say the union square office kind of is

15:37.840 --> 15:39.040
It's what she was saying.

15:39.040 --> 15:39.840
It's a little sweet.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.040
It sounds a little sweet.

15:41.040 --> 15:41.840
Do you think we should say it?

15:41.840 --> 15:42.880
That's a slight tip.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.800
Is it the only one that's your goal by put up?

15:44.880 --> 15:47.360
You should be fucking blessed that we have a

15:47.360 --> 15:49.200
Shine Green Studio.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.640
I do appreciate them.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.880
Well, you know, it's more of a doop for Shine,

15:52.880 --> 15:53.600
but I'll take it.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.280
The New York Studio looks better on camera.

15:58.880 --> 15:59.760
Well, don't say that.

16:01.360 --> 16:01.760
Okay.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.280
What type of T do you like?

16:03.280 --> 16:05.600
Black, Ulong Green, White, Erbil,

16:05.600 --> 16:07.840
Chai, Pura, or D-Cashiff?

16:07.840 --> 16:09.440
Sorry, it's gossip and option.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.240
No.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.640
Is there one that's like the frog emoji next to it?

16:12.720 --> 16:14.400
Well, cup, I don't mind that.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.560
Yeah, kind of a global village coffee house thing.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.800
Is sleepy time an option?

16:18.800 --> 16:19.600
That's true.

16:19.600 --> 16:20.080
That's true.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.280
I guess it's herbal.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.440
We're all such different personalities.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.040
Why are we taking this together?

16:25.040 --> 16:26.880
We should all be very separately.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.680
I think we're all, I think we're all agreed on herbal.

16:29.680 --> 16:30.720
And we're in unity.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.680
Unity, new to you.

16:34.720 --> 16:35.840
What do you prefer?

16:35.840 --> 16:37.840
Hot, iced, I enjoy both.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.160
I enjoy both.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.240
Hot, hot.

16:42.720 --> 16:43.360
Hot.

16:43.360 --> 16:43.760
Okay.

16:43.760 --> 16:44.720
It was sounding hot.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.280
It was sounding hot.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.560
We're sounding hot.

16:48.560 --> 16:49.840
It's a good band name.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.280
That's not bad at all.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.720
Or is it Resilute hot?

16:53.680 --> 16:54.320
No.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.680
I like resounding hot.

16:56.240 --> 16:56.480
Yeah.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.080
Because it also sounds like we're sounding.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.520
How do you take your tea?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.720
Playing with milk, with sugar, with milk and sugar.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.400
I enjoy a tea.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.240
I enjoy tea a variety of ways.

17:08.240 --> 17:08.880
I don't know.

17:09.600 --> 17:10.720
Slash, I don't know.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.080
With a friend.

17:13.120 --> 17:13.600
Yeah.

17:13.600 --> 17:13.760
Yeah.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.200
Can you ride in with a friend?

17:15.200 --> 17:15.760
Yeah.

17:15.760 --> 17:16.800
There's no ride-in-op.

17:16.800 --> 17:17.840
That's a variety of ways.

17:17.840 --> 17:18.960
Maybe with sugar?

17:18.960 --> 17:20.400
No, sugar.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.760
Fine, a variety of ways.

17:23.760 --> 17:24.880
Slash, I don't know.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.920
What do your favorite flavors?

17:27.920 --> 17:30.560
We have any idea, how many more questions there are?

17:30.560 --> 17:31.440
Probably like three.

17:32.160 --> 17:36.320
Fruity, floral, citrus, nutty, spicy, sweet, tart, nutty.

17:36.480 --> 17:46.160
I think I'm a spicy, but I can go citrus.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.600
Caffeine or no caffeine?

17:49.600 --> 17:50.560
No.

17:50.560 --> 17:51.120
Caffeine!

17:52.560 --> 17:55.280
If it's tea-no, because I want to also have like a cafe.

17:56.000 --> 17:56.800
Got it.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.800
Caffeine does a great thing to me.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.520
I enjoy both with and without caffeine.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.280
Yeah, that's all right.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.160
I mean, if we're doing like a collective work for answers,

18:06.160 --> 18:08.160
we should just always do the one with the size.

18:08.160 --> 18:11.280
Yeah, it's Malgamon, all the above.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.160
A Malgamon in the middle.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.840
That's nothing.

18:15.840 --> 18:21.200
Sorry, that's a good pun, but it has nothing to do with the tea quiz.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.200
I'm doing our results.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.440
But it does have to do with the witch Malcolm in the middle brush.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.240
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.280
We're doing the results, Marika.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.240
Oh, I would love to do it before we go.

18:30.240 --> 18:30.480
Here we go.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.880
We've never done this on the show.

18:33.840 --> 18:34.640
Caffeine.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.600
This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.720
Guys, how is your social battery right now?

18:44.720 --> 18:47.280
Because mine is at an all-time mid.

18:48.080 --> 18:50.960
It can be easy to ignore that social battery, though,

18:50.960 --> 18:55.360
and spread ourselves thin, especially with social gatherings picking up after the winter.

18:55.360 --> 18:59.120
You know, invitations are going out, not necessarily to Joel's house,

18:59.120 --> 19:01.120
cooling party, but still.

19:01.120 --> 19:05.520
And it's hard to figure out what the right amount of socializing is for you.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.040
Like, how do you like to recharge?

19:07.040 --> 19:10.720
Maybe you thrive around people, or maybe you need some more alone time.

19:10.720 --> 19:16.080
And therapy can give you the self-awareness to build a social life that doesn't drain your battery.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.360
I'm in therapy every week.

19:17.360 --> 19:22.880
I benefited from it greatly, and I would highly recommend to anyone thinking of giving

19:22.880 --> 19:25.920
therapy a try that you start with BetterHelp.

19:48.080 --> 19:48.720
Thanks, BetterHelp.

19:51.360 --> 19:52.240
And we're back.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.200
Drumroll, please!

19:57.280 --> 20:04.320
Our best matches, delightful morning blend, parentheses, Earl Grey Lavender.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.040
I thought it was going to be like, U-Long, and then it was going to be bomb drop, and then

20:13.040 --> 20:13.760
them.

20:13.760 --> 20:16.800
Yeah, I mean, I have the name was U-Long.

20:18.320 --> 20:19.680
The name was U-Long, yeah.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.640
Or should we say too long?

20:22.640 --> 20:23.760
No, I got it.

20:23.760 --> 20:24.240
Nice.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.920
That's really good.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.920
I got it without the explanation.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.120
Good day Jeff, didn't it?

20:29.120 --> 20:32.160
I haven't seen you in too long.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.680
Joel, is that anything Jeff?

20:35.680 --> 20:41.920
That was really good, but that part isn't in the episode.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.960
So it's an inside joke to just normal conversation.

20:44.960 --> 20:48.880
And for dinner, we'll have a full-long from Subway.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.600
Maria, what was the tea?

20:54.880 --> 20:57.600
Delightful morning blend, Earl Grey Lavender.

21:01.040 --> 21:06.080
Not an herbal tea, but let's just continue on with the gratitude,

21:06.080 --> 21:07.600
small gathering article for you.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.840
And I really want to do a Malcolm and middle close.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.800
Is that what's happening fine?

21:12.880 --> 21:13.680
I'll stay flexible.

21:13.680 --> 21:14.400
Please, no.

21:14.400 --> 21:14.880
It's not.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.400
I'll stay flexible.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.080
I did watch a bunch of Malcolm and the middle.

21:20.800 --> 21:21.440
A few days ago.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.200
It's a great show.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.120
Everyone should watch it.

21:26.240 --> 21:27.840
Bright Princeton has range.

21:28.880 --> 21:29.200
Yeah.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.840
Comedy and drama.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.040
Not many people can say it.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.000
You're so right, ultimately.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.600
Still in Joel's press jacket.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.840
He's like, sorry, he talked about me for a second.

21:42.960 --> 21:43.760
It's on Stan.

21:46.480 --> 21:47.360
All right, present.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.040
While you search for a Malcolm and the middle quiz,

21:51.040 --> 21:53.200
I'll also continue on with the plumb deluxe,

21:53.200 --> 21:55.120
gratitude gathering guide.

21:56.240 --> 21:57.760
Pile on the compliments.

21:58.480 --> 22:01.360
Now, I'm going to amend this because of the pun.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.280
Let's pile on the compliments to pile.

22:07.920 --> 22:08.320
Right?

22:08.960 --> 22:17.600
Andrew Pile made the LA office Wi-Fi run so much faster than it ever has before.

22:18.320 --> 22:22.400
And I am sincerely impressed that he knows how to do that.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.760
Maria, um, Andrew.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.560
I just want to tell for you, but you have to give Pile compliment.

22:31.360 --> 22:34.240
Pile gave me access to his Plex server.

22:35.200 --> 22:40.480
So now I can watch a lot of obscure movies and TV shows that I couldn't have found

22:40.480 --> 22:43.440
otherwise, so really, really happy about that.

22:44.640 --> 22:44.960
Joel.

22:46.320 --> 22:52.000
You know, Pile's been a father figure to not only his three sons, but also me,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.560
where I feel treated pretty equally.

22:54.560 --> 22:57.280
Like, we all get comments, not follow reviews.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.840
We all get design reviews, sort of a collaborative approach to everything.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.200
So it's great.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.720
Yeah, love Pile.

23:06.720 --> 23:07.920
Do you call Pile Dad?

23:09.280 --> 23:12.000
How do you ever done it like on accident?

23:12.000 --> 23:14.640
Dad, I mean, Pile, ah, that's so embarrassing.

23:14.640 --> 23:20.320
He tends to not like it, especially if Peter's around, but sometimes

23:20.320 --> 23:21.280
those one-on-one.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.400
We should say, Peter's not around.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.040
Peter's in France.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.000
So I wouldn't worry about Peter.

23:24.640 --> 23:28.640
And we haven't been in this regard.

23:29.120 --> 23:35.280
How do you think Peter is fairing in France based on your daily interactions with him at work?

23:35.840 --> 23:37.600
Is he, he's loving me?

23:37.600 --> 23:39.360
He's swimming in the local pool.

23:39.360 --> 23:40.960
He's going for bike rides.

23:40.960 --> 23:46.000
He's getting his haircut and asking for what he wants in French and getting roughly what he asks for.

23:48.400 --> 23:49.040
He's definitely not.

23:49.040 --> 23:52.720
You haven't seen his hair lately, but it's, uh, it's interesting.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.400
I haven't.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.200
Does it look bad?

23:56.400 --> 23:57.120
It's interesting.

23:57.760 --> 23:58.400
Interesting.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.520
Um, people are going to hate this episode.

24:01.520 --> 24:02.800
So let's salvage it somehow.

24:02.800 --> 24:03.840
I'm really good to have any ideas.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.800
Why are people going to hate it?

24:06.800 --> 24:09.520
It's too real.

24:11.120 --> 24:13.680
I wanted to kind of put another game or something.

24:14.240 --> 24:18.720
Another game because you told us to complement each other for the entire time.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.400
Come on, each other for Pile.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.400
Let's be grat, grateful.

24:22.400 --> 24:26.640
Let's express gratitude for some deluxe style with the reason for that again.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.320
I'm forgetting because I'm trying it.

24:28.320 --> 24:31.440
Like this is a kind of like, you know, you guys are all very kind.

24:31.440 --> 24:37.360
So I'm trying to like be normal for once, but not so normal that the content suffers.

24:37.360 --> 24:37.680
Right?

24:38.320 --> 24:42.640
Plum deluxe, T, club, community.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.280
I found a random article.

24:45.280 --> 24:46.640
I based the entire episode.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.360
Fienders, sucks.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.520
I'm looking forward to.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.120
Tonight, we got a housechooling party,

24:59.120 --> 25:03.920
Park East Manhattan, everything must go.

25:04.960 --> 25:05.920
Is this your place?

25:06.480 --> 25:07.520
This is my place.

25:07.520 --> 25:08.880
I was uninvited.

25:08.880 --> 25:11.200
You want the, do you want the lucky bamboo?

25:11.200 --> 25:12.640
You can probably have it.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.640
Um, and where did he, he heard you?

25:17.040 --> 25:18.000
Yeah, go ahead.

25:18.000 --> 25:18.480
I could tell.

25:18.480 --> 25:22.800
So you are welcome as I said, you know, last minute invites are basically

25:23.680 --> 25:25.760
a nice way of saying stay the fuck away.

25:25.840 --> 25:29.200
Yeah, last time I had a party market and I didn't, I knew you were going to say this.

25:29.200 --> 25:32.000
I knew you were going to bring it up and I knew that was why you didn't invite me.

25:32.000 --> 25:38.400
And I knew that this episode would need saving midway through,

25:38.400 --> 25:40.800
because every story needs a conflict,

25:40.800 --> 25:43.600
because every hero had a comeback.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.600
Joel still at his press conference.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.240
Joel, did you guys play pranks on set?

25:51.200 --> 25:51.840
Sorry, Jeff.

25:52.720 --> 26:03.440
We did the thing where, so I peed in everyone's conditioner, which actually no one knew

26:03.440 --> 26:08.400
and so this, like, now they'll find out that there were pranks on set,

26:08.400 --> 26:15.040
but at the time, I think people just thought that their conditioner was sort of

26:15.200 --> 26:17.200
you're in need.

26:21.200 --> 26:25.440
All right, what's the worst slash weirdest job you've ever had at headgum?

26:28.160 --> 26:30.880
Let's say task, right?

26:30.880 --> 26:33.120
I can go, I can go worst for sure.

26:33.120 --> 26:34.240
I don't know, it's a weirdness.

26:34.240 --> 26:35.840
What about the one that broke your back, right?

26:35.840 --> 26:38.880
Yeah, it's not like that, what?

26:41.120 --> 26:43.680
We have to talk about it, probably wasn't from that.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.800
Let's talk about it.

26:48.800 --> 26:53.840
Basically, we were renovating an old New York studio and right before it.

26:55.440 --> 26:57.280
Everyone was gone except for me.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.440
I was waiting for a delivery from Home Depot.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.640
Delivery arrived.

27:00.640 --> 27:10.640
It was 10 sheets of drywall and 10 sheets of plywood left in front of the building on the

27:11.600 --> 27:13.360
Also, it was raining sheets.

27:13.360 --> 27:20.080
It was a, it was about to start raining sheets and no one was around for a reason I won't

27:20.960 --> 27:27.200
say and a man like walked by and was like, do you need help?

27:27.200 --> 27:33.120
And I was like, please, and I had to bring them all inside and it was rough.

27:33.120 --> 27:33.920
It was hard to do.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.160
So that was broke your back and doing it.

27:36.160 --> 27:37.920
Why didn't you get workers' company?

27:38.000 --> 27:41.200
I don't have to say that I broke my back doing it.

27:42.080 --> 27:46.000
I did get workers' company a previous job before my back.

27:46.000 --> 27:53.440
So it was just, like, something, something got worse after that.

27:54.880 --> 27:58.160
Her needed disc or yeah, I'll five us one.

27:59.040 --> 28:02.000
Reherneated last year or two years ago.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.200
But we've talked about it.

28:04.160 --> 28:04.720
Allie?

28:06.160 --> 28:07.840
Sorry, what's the question?

28:07.840 --> 28:11.680
What's the, we were slash weirdest job you've had at head gum?

28:13.360 --> 28:16.480
Reekers was hauling drywall.

28:20.320 --> 28:23.120
Worst, I don't know, nothing's been that bad.

28:23.760 --> 28:27.040
Weirdest then, that's why there's two to choose from.

28:28.160 --> 28:28.640
Okay.

28:29.600 --> 28:32.880
Well, like ordering shrimp delivery first.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.800
I did have, yeah, I did have to do that.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.560
I did not have to, I randomly said,

28:38.560 --> 28:40.880
oh, I'd love a shrimp cocktail and then it's showed up.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.080
And that's a favorite.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.920
Okay, so I'm sorry that I anticipated needs.

28:51.840 --> 28:54.880
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I tried to make a dream come true.

28:55.600 --> 29:01.520
No, that'll do it ordering a shrimp cocktail that ended up rotting in the bullpen.

29:01.520 --> 29:04.960
Yeah, yeah, no, I was listening.

29:04.960 --> 29:08.880
I was in charge of if, if you said, I need a shrimp cocktail,

29:08.880 --> 29:10.560
making sure that one was on the way.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.560
Making sure, or making shrimp.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.960
Making sure the shrimp.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.640
I'm still on record saying I would do another one.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.320
But for longer, one week.

29:22.960 --> 29:27.040
Either one for 48 hours that I know about or one for 24 again,

29:27.040 --> 29:29.920
that I don't know about as long as my family's not in town.

29:30.480 --> 29:33.520
How long did it take your body to recover from doing?

29:33.520 --> 29:37.040
I haven't been the same since and I think it's a coincidence.

29:37.600 --> 29:41.200
Just based off the normal track of my mental health, the planning last year.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.880
But that's also a good question.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.480
Then well, my mental health started to get better at the end of the year and then I

29:46.480 --> 29:49.600
concussed myself. So now my mental is fine.

29:49.600 --> 29:52.000
My physical is not quite right. Joel style.

29:52.720 --> 29:56.960
Do not feel a hundred percent or you still are used to experiencing the actual

29:56.960 --> 29:59.600
just canceled this because I'm not feeling well.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.960
I just like, Joel, have you read a concussion?

30:02.960 --> 30:03.520
You played sports.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.720
All right, then I don't know what to say because I can't really

30:06.720 --> 30:08.080
unless someone has had a concussion.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.200
I'm really going to have an off guard.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.200
I have another concussion.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.440
But I haven't had eight right now.

30:13.440 --> 30:14.240
That's all.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.000
Is that from the content of the episode or

30:16.240 --> 30:17.520
what is this?

30:17.520 --> 30:18.160
What is this?

30:18.160 --> 30:18.800
This is my OS.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.160
Yeah, I don't have the setting on.

30:22.160 --> 30:22.960
I don't have anything.

30:23.600 --> 30:26.720
What's the, yeah, if you do something, there's like confetti and balloons.

30:27.760 --> 30:28.160
Weird.

30:28.160 --> 30:28.720
Okay.

30:28.720 --> 30:32.320
If you could live anywhere for a year, where would you live?

30:32.320 --> 30:34.560
And why would it be really far from Peter?

30:38.640 --> 30:40.640
I don't think I'd actually be that far from Peter.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.480
I'd probably like go to London for a year.

30:43.280 --> 30:43.680
Okay.

30:43.680 --> 30:45.200
And it wouldn't be you wouldn't do gay parry.

30:46.240 --> 30:49.280
No, I, I don't need to go there.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.360
Again, that need time soon to be honest.

30:51.360 --> 30:52.480
What happened when you were there?

30:52.480 --> 30:52.960
You didn't like.

30:53.760 --> 30:57.680
Oh, you know, they, they don't like you there.

30:57.680 --> 30:58.960
They're mean to me.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.320
Yeah, but wait for a set.

31:00.320 --> 31:01.680
These were now where you were.

31:01.680 --> 31:05.760
Spritz was a touristy drink and that they didn't make cocktails,

31:05.760 --> 31:08.080
even though there was a full bar behind her.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.160
Where, where were you there?

31:11.200 --> 31:12.160
Where was I there?

31:14.160 --> 31:15.040
Where were you?

31:16.160 --> 31:16.880
I was in there.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.000
They said that.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.120
I know.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.000
I don't remember what.

31:20.000 --> 31:20.960
Around this house.

31:20.960 --> 31:21.440
We am.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.680
It was nice to be on these malls.

31:23.680 --> 31:26.080
It was by one of the stations.

31:27.360 --> 31:28.080
Was it the 9th?

31:29.280 --> 31:29.920
I know man.

31:29.920 --> 31:30.960
Yeah, do you know.

31:31.760 --> 31:32.880
Yeah, it was by Gelt, do you know?

31:33.920 --> 31:35.360
Yeah, that's very, yeah.

31:36.560 --> 31:36.960
Yeah.

31:36.960 --> 31:37.440
Probably why.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.160
It was like, no, it was like an old school

31:40.160 --> 31:41.200
French restaurant.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.040
And she was like, oh, cocktails.

31:43.040 --> 31:44.240
And I was like, bizarre.

31:44.240 --> 31:44.720
Okay.

31:45.040 --> 31:45.680
They be safe.

31:46.880 --> 31:47.600
Sure.

31:47.600 --> 31:50.880
I'll go visit Peter, um, like on the coaster

31:50.880 --> 31:51.920
France, that sounds cool.

31:53.760 --> 31:56.240
I got to have Peter on the show to like dissect how he'd

31:56.240 --> 31:57.680
made this whole France thing happen.

31:57.680 --> 31:59.360
Is he on a, how did he get a work visa?

31:59.360 --> 32:02.080
First of all, second of all, he didn't really.

32:03.360 --> 32:06.080
So let's get him on the record on the zoom in the row.

32:06.080 --> 32:07.440
He goes on the lamb.

32:07.440 --> 32:08.480
Yeah, exactly right.

32:11.120 --> 32:11.600
Allie.

32:12.560 --> 32:16.960
Uh, I would live in Italy.

32:19.680 --> 32:20.560
I don't care where.

32:20.560 --> 32:20.880
Joel.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.560
Uh, I think I got skipped for the previous question,

32:24.560 --> 32:32.400
which is when I was, when the sales team from LA was here

32:32.400 --> 32:36.800
and they were all out at some bar slash club.

32:36.800 --> 32:41.040
And I was getting a bunch of texts like Joel,

32:41.120 --> 32:44.320
it's not just like a want, Marty actually requires you

32:44.320 --> 32:48.720
to come to this bar where I, that was like,

32:48.720 --> 32:50.800
did you just think that felt like my job?

32:56.480 --> 32:57.760
All right, um,

33:01.120 --> 33:03.760
and yeah, I'll spend the year in Patagonia.

33:04.480 --> 33:04.960
Nice.

33:05.920 --> 33:12.720
Um, what's one of your most embarrassing memories that had gone?

33:17.920 --> 33:18.480
It's a good.

33:19.600 --> 33:23.440
I'm surprised that Joel doesn't have like 18 to choose from right now.

33:23.440 --> 33:24.720
He's looking like he's stumped.

33:27.040 --> 33:31.200
I feel like I've been on blast for the better part of the last week in our Slack channel,

33:31.200 --> 33:31.840
honestly.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.800
You pass the death of the channel?

33:34.800 --> 33:37.440
No, the East channel.

33:41.440 --> 33:42.080
What did you do?

33:42.880 --> 33:45.120
Nothing, and they're just like photos of me.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.680
Yeah, you're sitting in the park, photos of eating,

33:47.680 --> 33:51.920
shake, shack, mushroom burgers, photos of like yogurt, I bought.

33:52.480 --> 33:53.120
That's funny.

33:53.120 --> 33:55.280
Well, because sage message to you,

33:55.280 --> 33:58.320
it was like who's he yogurt is in the fridge and you put three

33:59.280 --> 34:02.960
court-sized things of yogurt just in the fridge.

34:02.960 --> 34:05.120
Joel, we're living in the New York studio.

34:06.320 --> 34:08.240
I didn't want to bring it up because I don't want to judge him clearly.

34:08.240 --> 34:08.960
It's hard times.

34:08.960 --> 34:11.040
I did a year in the conference room.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.680
Yeah, because now you're saying that you're doing a house cooling.

34:13.680 --> 34:16.400
So I thought that it was that you were without a place to stay.

34:16.400 --> 34:20.320
Now that I see that you're in a different apartment, I don't understand why you've been sleeping over.

34:20.320 --> 34:22.320
When people thought I moved, they were right.

34:23.280 --> 34:24.320
Yeah.

34:25.680 --> 34:28.720
So you don't know if I told me.

34:37.600 --> 34:38.960
Just come to the house for you.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.000
Yeah.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.840
So we need to breathe out.

34:41.840 --> 34:45.760
Well, three of us are so rude for just letting us sit in that.

34:52.560 --> 34:53.280
Yeah.

34:57.280 --> 34:59.760
Jeff, are you, do you want to give anyone a compliment?

35:00.960 --> 35:01.440
I did.

35:03.680 --> 35:06.080
Oh, I didn't want to give me a compliment.

35:06.080 --> 35:07.200
Yeah, but no one gives me some.

35:07.200 --> 35:07.840
Yeah.

35:07.840 --> 35:08.560
That's right.

35:09.360 --> 35:09.760
Yeah.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.600
The assignment was to give a compliment.

35:11.600 --> 35:14.000
It was to give one of you a compliment.

35:14.720 --> 35:17.440
Well, and you, Marie, go with a gotten three compliments.

35:17.440 --> 35:21.120
If you guys hadn't adjusted the course of the entire episode by being like,

35:21.120 --> 35:22.160
let's just all do one.

35:22.160 --> 35:25.520
I think we kind of got back to where we needed to go, right?

35:25.520 --> 35:27.920
We're going to adjust the course of the entire episode.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.280
We took a slate detour.

35:32.720 --> 35:35.680
When you guys are about to go on this Nashville offsite thing.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.040
Yeah, are you telling me?

35:37.040 --> 35:38.880
No, I begged Marty to let me come.

35:38.880 --> 35:43.120
I really wanted to record an episode of the headgun podcast in Nashville,

35:43.120 --> 35:47.360
where it was kind of like a rotating door where everybody had like 10 minutes.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.560
Like on one of those things where we bike around drinking beer.

35:51.360 --> 35:54.160
That's a better idea, maybe, or at the very least different.

35:56.240 --> 35:58.240
No, it's like, you know, we have a setup.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.600
We have the cameras and everything.

35:59.600 --> 36:00.960
There's no time for that.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.480
Because of all the team bonding nonsense that Marty does.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.320
What's what's the schedule? Do you have it?

36:08.320 --> 36:08.960
Yeah.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.360
But Marty should have partying on.

36:12.640 --> 36:14.560
Go through the schedule and be like, why?

36:14.560 --> 36:16.320
Have them explain why each thing.

36:16.960 --> 36:20.000
I'm not going to share what he currently wants to do.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.040
But you should ask him and ask him why.

36:23.600 --> 36:24.080
I'm cloth.

36:26.160 --> 36:28.240
Well, Micah has your dad heard the rice songs?

36:29.520 --> 36:34.400
He hasn't heard them, but I've told him about them.

36:34.400 --> 36:38.640
He actually sent me a magazine that he and his friend are in.

36:39.520 --> 36:40.320
That's over here.

36:40.880 --> 36:42.320
Rice triumphantly.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.280
That's three times a month.

36:45.440 --> 36:45.760
Yeah.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.160
I'll find it.

36:50.160 --> 36:53.120
He was interviewed with his BFF, Hanif.

36:56.880 --> 36:59.120
I imagine Rice will come up somewhere.

37:00.560 --> 37:01.840
Have you read it? The interview?

37:02.480 --> 37:03.920
No, I haven't had the time.

37:04.800 --> 37:05.920
What have you been busy with?

37:07.280 --> 37:07.760
Ork.

37:08.480 --> 37:08.800
Yeah.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.000
There he is.

37:12.000 --> 37:12.640
That's lame.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.640
That's amazing.

37:14.960 --> 37:15.360
Yeah.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.840
It's a great great pick.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.160
Did he also appear on TV once?

37:22.000 --> 37:25.440
Yeah, I mean, he's been in like some new segments.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.120
I think he was on Good Morning America.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.240
He was in Bonapetite.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.240
It's really, I really,

37:33.120 --> 37:35.440
Well, we should say Bonapetite.

37:35.440 --> 37:37.440
Bonapetite, which is the dog version.

37:38.240 --> 37:38.640
Yeah.

37:39.280 --> 37:40.640
I feel like he should frame that.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.080
He made rice flavor dog trees.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.320
And went drier.

37:49.920 --> 37:52.080
I really wanted him to be on the bear somehow.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.200
I think they'll be really funny.

37:53.680 --> 37:58.240
Well, I think they're doing their last two seasons in conjunction, shooting this year.

37:58.240 --> 38:00.800
So get him on there.

38:00.800 --> 38:01.760
Yeah, it's not going to happen.

38:02.400 --> 38:03.920
All right, let's just fucking end it.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.040
Plugs.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.240
I thought this was fine.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.560
I had a nice time.

38:10.560 --> 38:11.040
Yeah.

38:11.520 --> 38:16.240
I think we had a fun conversation mostly, but that's the issue.

38:16.240 --> 38:18.640
The episode where we have the most fun.

38:18.640 --> 38:19.440
Correct.

38:20.640 --> 38:22.080
Are the ones that the fans hate?

38:23.120 --> 38:23.760
I don't know.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.400
Some dry sea or not, vice versa.

38:28.480 --> 38:31.280
My favorite episode to the ones where there's like some kind of theme.

38:33.120 --> 38:35.040
And what was like the even for this episode?

38:35.440 --> 38:36.000
Gratitude.

38:36.720 --> 38:38.720
Gratitude me shedding rigidity.

38:39.520 --> 38:42.960
You're failing as dulling out resolutions.

38:44.000 --> 38:48.080
What I don't really do want to use shedding rigidity.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.680
Yeah, it's on the virus.

38:52.320 --> 38:52.640
Okay.

38:53.520 --> 38:55.280
It's like when tea comes out of the bag.

38:56.480 --> 38:58.000
Brought it back to plumb deluxe.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.520
I don't mind reaching out to plumb deluxe to try and get a sponsorship.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.760
I'd love a tea sponsorship.

39:03.760 --> 39:04.480
Yeah.

39:04.880 --> 39:09.200
You know how, when you guys are about to move, Joel, you might get this.

39:09.200 --> 39:12.400
Do you feel like you're about to change parts of your personality that you want to?

39:13.280 --> 39:14.560
Because you're moving house.

39:15.680 --> 39:17.520
I haven't, but that's a really good idea.

39:19.600 --> 39:20.400
What would you change?

39:20.400 --> 39:21.760
I feel like that every time I move.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.800
I'm like in this new house, I'm going to be totally different.

39:24.800 --> 39:26.240
I'm going to be healthier.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.880
I'm going to drink tea and I'm not a tea guy.

39:29.680 --> 39:33.600
I also feel like you really base your personality on location.

39:34.080 --> 39:34.880
And how do you figure?

39:34.880 --> 39:35.920
Because of Laurel Canyon.

39:39.520 --> 39:42.960
A place I haven't quite been able to get into.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.360
You've been close to it.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.920
Yeah, we drove past it.

39:48.320 --> 39:49.920
That makes sense for you.

39:49.920 --> 39:52.960
With your current hairstyle, you're so Laurel Canyon.

39:53.920 --> 39:54.720
Joel, come on.

39:56.320 --> 39:57.200
Yeah, Joel.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.640
I'll meet a stick up for you at it.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.920
I'm giving you a compliment.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.840
Joel, what neighborhood are you moving to?

40:04.560 --> 40:06.640
Will you first broke you already said that?

40:06.640 --> 40:08.080
I listened to Joel.

40:08.080 --> 40:08.720
When?

40:08.720 --> 40:10.320
I'm not even getting a headphone.

40:10.320 --> 40:11.440
There's something head for the idea.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.160
Yeah, I wasn't.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.120
I didn't hear it.

40:13.120 --> 40:14.960
I didn't know he was moving.

40:14.960 --> 40:15.600
Moving?

40:15.600 --> 40:17.200
Yeah, the point is moved, though.

40:17.200 --> 40:21.760
I don't think you, I don't think you can change

40:21.760 --> 40:23.440
to a Williamsburg person.

40:23.440 --> 40:24.640
Which is a good feeling.

40:24.640 --> 40:25.440
No, I disagree.

40:25.440 --> 40:27.520
I think Joel is Williamsburg now.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.000
Well, we were talking about it.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.680
He's going to get really into overalls.

40:32.720 --> 40:34.320
Ash-Kosh-Bagash, yeah.

40:34.320 --> 40:36.320
Again, I think I don't think.

40:36.320 --> 40:38.960
I don't think overalls were given a thing.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.920
And Williamsburg, I think Williamsburg is parents now.

40:42.720 --> 40:45.680
Joel is going to sneak past the national guard

40:45.680 --> 40:49.120
with one of those things that he places on the tracks of the L.

40:49.120 --> 40:50.400
And goes like this.

40:54.080 --> 40:55.200
On my heart.

40:55.200 --> 40:58.000
Yeah, that'll be Joel and overalls in reals.

41:01.920 --> 41:16.480
That was a hit-dum original.

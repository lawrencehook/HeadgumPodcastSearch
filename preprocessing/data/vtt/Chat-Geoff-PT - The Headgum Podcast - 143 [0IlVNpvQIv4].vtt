00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:32.000 --> 00:43.000
We've got Will Khan over on the show making his head-gum podcast debut.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
We were talking about before we started recording, sorry, just so one second.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
I feel like I need to make this show one of those things where it's like the guests don't talk until they introduce them.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
You know what I mean?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Don't say, don't respond.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
That's what I was just saying.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
It's like let's give it some breathing room where it's just me for the spell.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Right?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Right?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah, totally.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Will.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
We've been all for a week.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
The last time I was on camera on microphone, I got forced to host a 24-hour live stream without knowing about it beforehand.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
And again, it's my will.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
It's hailing outside.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Holy shit.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
How are you feeling?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
How are you feeling?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Yeah, how are you feeling?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Post that.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
You take it paid.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Potentially the worst weekend it could have happened.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
I was told that you guys reached out to my friends.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
They said maybe you don't do it that weekend because this parents are in town.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
And what they said you guys said was, oh, that's all right.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
We already booked people.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
So you didn't actually ask anybody.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
You you planned it.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Then panic to thought maybe we should check to see if he has anything going on in his life.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
And then they were like, he does have something happening.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
And then on you was like, let's just do it anyways.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
No, that's not exactly.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Oh, it went down.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
It wasn't much, right?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
It was originally.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
It was pushed.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
But that was because of not.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Of not.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Jay guy thing.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
That was because of Jay.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
We should say was only in it for 50 minutes.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
He was seriously rescuing a cat.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
He was.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Was that me?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I heard.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
What is that me?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
I'm sorry.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
I didn't hear about that.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah, we should ask when he gets back.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
But then a mirror also had family in town.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
But what happened was we had family in town.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
His family lives in a scene.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
You could see them any time.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
So that was for the other came back for the end.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
That that missed me off genuinely.

03:00.000 --> 03:07.000
I'm sure that there were other people besides his parents, right?

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
But anyway, yeah, I mean, it would have been nice if they were available to come back.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
They'll be back here on the show and you can really roast them for that.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
It would have been obviously, you know.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
That all that aside, it was a hit.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
We raised $10,000 for charity, which is huge.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
And I love to do it again.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I just like to know that it's happening.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Yeah.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Yeah.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Do you think we definitely want to do?

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Money.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
If it was no surprise.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I don't think so.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Oh, really?

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
People on the dough voice rabbit said otherwise.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
They said that if we had marketed it better.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
We could have raised more money.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
So we couldn't market it well because we had to keep it a surprise.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Yeah.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
But then some people came to our defense.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
So, you know, classic, classic parasocial Reddit discussions.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
We love to see them.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Yeah.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
People were going off on the Jake and I'm here read it.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
A little bit too hard in my defense.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Everything was fine.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I just wish it was a different weekend.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I paid hand some Lee.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
I got a raise.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
I got a massage.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
That part was weird and feels illegal because it wasn't.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
You guys said it was going to be a good card.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Casey reached out.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Apparently it's just going to be by his hand.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Casey.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Thanks.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
No.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
But could you imagine?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I need to do something nice.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Casey though, because he's the one.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Actually, you guys should do something nice for Casey.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Not me.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Why should I come out like three days off?

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
That's true.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
That's true.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
That's true.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Yeah.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
I thought it was awesome.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I thought it was a hit.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
I just wish I had known about it and it was on a different weekend.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
I know about it, but it was on any other weekend.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
It would have been stress free for me.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Thoughts definitely fair.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
It would have.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
I would have loved to have it beyond any other weekend and also.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
I am glad it's not.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
It wasn't on my birthday, which some people said it was going to be on my birthday.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Which that would have been fucked.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
I would have left.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I don't know.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
You should have.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Yeah.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
It was a hit though.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I think.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
It was a hit.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
I made it down.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Sorry, well, one second.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Smash.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Sorry, one second for me.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
Unfortunately, some technical difficulties.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
So we actually don't have it.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
YouTube didn't archive it.

05:39.000 --> 05:50.000
We have parts of it that we saved ourselves during the time.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
But we've been emailing back and forth with YouTube.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Did you archive half of it?

05:58.000 --> 06:06.000
Are there any parts like around the parts that we saved that you have available?

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
And they're not being helpful.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Do we have, do we have the headgun podcast episode?

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
Uh, not in video.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
I was recording audio on our end.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I assume on you as maybe as well.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Yeah.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
She did.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Yeah.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
That is tragic.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
And I think we should release it as an audio episode.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
We should.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
That being said, the best part of it is that I had a baby on my lap.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Yeah.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
At least this story could do like a, yeah.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
We could do it a little like photo month.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Let's do that.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
I'll edit that together.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I just, that was an episode.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
I thought and I don't want to not release it.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
And a lot of people in here.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Yeah.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Everybody.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
That's true.

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
Uh, Micah, how the heck are you?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Great.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Dude.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Good.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Life is good.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Um, you're free to land.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Yes, extrapolate expand.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
I haven't been drinking for like the last month.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
And, uh, everything in my life is improved.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
When?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Really?

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
When has it improved or when did I start?

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Intervert that question as you must.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Well, I said I haven't been drinking for a month.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
So I've been.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Then went, okay.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
So you, it's been a month.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
When did things start to improve?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I think after like a week.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Okay.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
And that's you being honest?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Yeah.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Anyway.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
That's cool.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
I.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Yeah.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Yeah.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
I just, I don't drink that often.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
So I wish that I.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Sorry.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
I.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
I've never been a loser for that.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Yeah.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
When I did this.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
You've definitely done it.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Right.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
For sure.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
But when I, yeah, when I go for long spells of not having a beverage,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I don't feel any different, which sucks.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
I feel like I should be like at my peak.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
You drink responsibly.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
So you just have that.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Already.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Hmm.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
So you're kind of just like hitting the baseline.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Well, what are your vices?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Vice.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Alcohol.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Women.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
No.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Okay.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Do you say lunch?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Yeah.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Lunch is a vise.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I think that's a meal you have to eat every day.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
You don't have to.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
You have breakfast and dinner.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
That's pretty much okay.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
But on a good day, all the little lunch.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I went home.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
And it's been all my life.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
That's an instant out of context.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I think you'll like trying to say as far away as possible.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
But you drag me.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Where do you learn and ask?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Yeah.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Like you live in like Connecticut or something.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Yeah.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Nice.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
No, Chicago.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Okay.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Oh.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Damn.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Damn.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Chicago.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Yeah.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
I mean, my.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
What they call the three season room.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
And I'm using it all four.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
It.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Yeah.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
That is nice.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Yes.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Yeah.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
That's cool.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Thanks.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
I actually saw a bunch of headgum people at the headgum live in Chicago.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
It was the weekend I graduated from college.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Oh.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
It was graduation.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Don't live in Chicago.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Wow.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Yeah.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Yeah.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
But you had fun, right?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Yeah.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
I mean, it's good.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
I mean, the show.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Oh.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
But the graduation was actually.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
The ceremony was in the hotel.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
I don't know where he stayed.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Yeah.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
So I like that's the rose.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
The sauce.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Yeah.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
I got it.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
I saw the Rosenberg's while I was in full cap and gown.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
And you got the innovation fan.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
I had to say.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
What's up?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Yeah.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
But.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Yeah.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
I don't know.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
I kind of haven't been dead against cap and gowns because it hides my thigh

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
and cap and frowns.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
So people don't know that I'm pissed and sort of not eating enough.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Yeah.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
It sounds like I'm more like a cap.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Like the cap's not really good.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
That's not bad.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
No.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
The cap hides my frown.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
It comes down.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Oh, sorry.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Yeah.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Um.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
On the week.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I'm nominating Daniel Radcliffe.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Yeah.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
And then it could be James wand.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Oh, James wand.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Daniel Radcliffe.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Yeah.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
As James wand.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Yeah.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Because of the spells.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
What do you mean?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Like Harry Potter.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Left guardian.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Let me ask.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
How's it really good?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Maria, who do you got?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
My bond is going to be Ariana Dibos.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
What was that?

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
Because Angela Bassett did the thing.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
And viola Davis is my woman king.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Michael, what's wrong?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
What's wrong?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
You mean pensioners.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
Who's your brother the week?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Let's hear it.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Theo James.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
It's been lobbed up a while.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I think we made from divergent.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Yeah.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Somebody already mentioned it.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
I think Jake mentioned him and a mirror mentioned him.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
If Jake mentioned him, it's because I said it to Jake.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Mm.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
He took that.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
And I believe it.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
I still look for me.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Um.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
I'll take that.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Yeah.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Is he a Brit?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Yes.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Can I have a new pick?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Yeah.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I think it should be like a complete unknown.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
That's for you.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
Like who?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Someone we don't know yet.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
Nobody.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
I think it should be a complete unknown.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Like who is a parent.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I don't know.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Who's like a British curse?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
What a great heart.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Yeah.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
That she'd be great.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
She'd be great.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Who do you got?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Do you know about the segment?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Every week until the next James Bond is cast.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
We're going to lob up our pick for W7.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Yeah.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
I do a little research.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Alex Murdoch.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Famous Murdoch.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
He's a Murdoch.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Oh my gosh.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
License to kill.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
There he goes.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
All right.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
That's that dumb ass segment.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Barbara Brockley.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Get on your shit.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Stop doing this.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
It's obviously Renée Jean-Page or whatever his name is.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
All right.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
A recent slate-opped title read.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
My ex wants us to vacation.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
Like one big happy family.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
No thanks.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
Would you guys for real like for real?

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Would you guys vacation with an ex?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Where are we going?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
May you orca?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Yeah.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
I think it would depend why we broke up.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Okay.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Let's say irreconcilable difference.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Is it just you and the ex or the other people?

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Well, it's there.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
This article was talking about, you know,

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
ex wives, ex husbands, ex spouses,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
where there's kids involved.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Obviously none of us have kids, right?

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
So in our lives, would you vacation with an ex?

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
And you can set up, you know, the scenario yourself.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
I think in my head, it would be like a group trip where, you know,

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
you might have to like Sam shackle up with the ex though in a room.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
What's funny about that will?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Sam shackle.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Coerker of ours.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
To be honest, this part just like know that.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
I honestly, yes, because she has been on one time.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
You do use that a lot.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Yeah.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
I don't know.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Every time I broke it up with someone,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
it's felt like the shackles have come off.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yeah.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Is it a double room?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Yeah, there's two beds.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Uh-huh.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I feel fine with it.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Yeah, but that's because you have had healthy relationships

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
that have ended mutually.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Like what you got.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I don't think I'd do it.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Yeah.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
America.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Uh-huh.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Yeah, sure.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Okay.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
See, see, do void people on a vacation?

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
Yeah, but what if it's air in the room?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
What if it's eight people?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Yeah.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Are you able to ease here?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Really?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Okay, then let's change it.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
What if it's truly just the two of you,

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
but you guys have like the trip of a lifetime planned?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
That's kind of fun.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
That's like a fun little movie-fan-fix scenario, right?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Yeah.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
X-pray love.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Mm-hmm.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Yeah.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
That's good.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
We should write this.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Great.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
No.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Why not?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Okay.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Okay, so obviously we would all do it with the X of ours

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
that's like we're most amicable with.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
What about like your least favorite X?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Well.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
You really think I got like a roster.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Like a high-end-off list.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Yeah.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
It does have to be like long-term relationships.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
I don't know.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
I would say I would do with any of my X's.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
As long as ground rules were established up front.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Okay, let's say there are no ground rules.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
No rules?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Up front, right?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Yeah.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Okay.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
It's least favorite X.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Opportunities a trip of a lifetime.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
No rules.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
No rules.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Yeah.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
I think I'm still in.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Yeah.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
You got that trip of a lifetime.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Or am I also?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Am I paying for that?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
You're paying for them?

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Why is it possible?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
It's a terrible deal.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
No, this is all expense paid.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
I'm there.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Yeah.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
You got it.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Yeah.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
But then it's like, are you got, yeah.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Are you going to, yeah.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Are we just moving on?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Are we going to ask?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I'm just thinking, like, during the lifetime.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
You might want to have like an Italian fling.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
You know, but you can't, it's kind of awkward because, you know,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
go to the room.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
That's true.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
That's true.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
And it's, you know, it's, you're probably in a place where, like,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
you don't care what your X does in vice versa.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Right.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Right.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Yeah.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
I'm starting to get on board with the whole idea.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Because I was going to say no chance.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Ed Sheeran announces new album.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Dash.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
The album's called Dash.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
I think it's called something.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
It's actually because the pull quote is,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
it's opening the trap door into my soul.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Sheeran said of the last installment

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
in his decade-long mathematical album era.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Oh.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Because he had the division sign.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Right.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Yeah.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
So this is, oh, you know what?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
No, this is called subtract.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Yeah.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Yeah.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
It's like he's getting trapped door to his soul.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Like he's a theater.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Like he's a stage.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
It's like it's mostly taken place on a stage.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
You know what I mean?

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Tracks.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Yeah.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
That's a track.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I keep getting, um.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I keep getting TikToks of people

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
line dancing to the song,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Shiver by Ed Sheeran.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Which one is that?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Because all of his songs kind of make me shiver.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Yeah.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Like, of course.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
I don't know the lyrics.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
It's like.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Yeah.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Yeah.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Yeah.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Yeah.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Yeah.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Yeah.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
I don't know.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Oh.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
This makes you want to line dance.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
He's somebody who I think doesn't have the look or the sound

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
or the talent or the, yeah.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
Like all he has is the success that he somehow got.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
And so now like people like him because he's had the success.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
But before he had the success,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I don't know where he went from zero to hero,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
because he doesn't have any of the traits of one.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Does that make sense?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
You don't think he has talent.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
I think he looks different from what you'd expect him to look like with his voice.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
He doesn't look like a star.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Right.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
That's true.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Yes.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
You kind of shallow, Jeff.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
You look like a frog.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Yeah.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
You know.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
He spent a little too much time at the Guinness Factory.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Was he pre or post one direction?

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Could that have influenced his song?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I think during.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Yeah.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
I think it was a Brit wave.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
We do have to move on.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
I'm sorry.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
Selena Gomez only smiles in the building.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Despite Mean Girls drama.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Have you guys heard about this?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Yeah.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
So the internet.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Oh, you have?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Yeah.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
We got one.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
I have that.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
And I'd like to know.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
The internet thinks Selena Gomez has been in a Mean Girls Tiff

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
with Hailey Bieber and Kylie Jenner.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
Causing her to temporarily shut down not only her social media,

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
but also her, you know, her whole deal.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
But it doesn't seem to have affected her mood in real life.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Because she was seen posing with fans,

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
off the set of, you know,

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
the Hulu show she's on.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Only murderers in the building.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Only murderers in the building.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
TMZ says she looks pretty radiant.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
It's a blessing.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
This is a TMZ article.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
What happened was Selena Gomez posted a TikTok being like,

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
like, I accidentally got my eyebrows threaded.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
And she looks pretty good.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
And so then Hailey Bieber and Kylie Jenner both posted,

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
like the next day being like, this was an act.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
You really poke yourself on.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Yeah.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Shit.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Uh, we got to take a break.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Shit ass.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Why are you keeping the one that you pokes open?

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
This show is brought to you by better help.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
Guys, getting to know yourself as a lifelong process,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
right? You're not the same person that you were a year ago.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
You're not going to be the same person you are today,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
a year from now, right?

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
Especially because we're always growing and changing.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Circumstances change, right?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Uh, you meet new people.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
You form friendships that change you.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
You get into relationships where you're forced to grow.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
And then you become a different version of yourself.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
But therapy is about deepening yourself awareness and

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
understanding so you become the best version of yourself.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Because sometimes we don't know what we want.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Or why we react the way we do until we talk things through.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Right?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
And better help is here to help with exactly that.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
Because better help connects you with a licensed therapist who can take you on that journey

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
of self discovery from wherever you are to wherever you want to go.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
Uh, I'm in therapy every week.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Uh, it is a huge help.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Um, especially in times of stress,

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
especially in times of growth, which honestly oftentimes can feel the same.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
So it's just nice to have an objective perspective.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Uh, and that's where better help comes in.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
You're thinking of starting therapy.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Give better help a try.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
It's entirely online.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Thanks, better help.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
For people listening on audio only,

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
Jeff was describing eyebrow threading and inadvertently

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
poked himself in the eye while it was doing it.

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
H-E-L-P dot com slash what's your audio question real quick, Marika?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Yeah.

22:34.000 --> 22:41.000
Um, is this, are we using the zoom audio for the recording?

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
He usually just uses it.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
We usually send separate tracks,

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
but we can use the zoom audio if.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Necessary.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
And can I use a microphone?

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
Kind of record into a microphone on a day.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Again, and we're back.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
We still have a lot to do.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Uh.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
All right, you know what, here we go.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Holy shit.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
It's a second.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
We've been a couple weeks since we've had it.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Proper segments together.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Yeah, it's here.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
Uh, welcome to Serena Irvingus Williams edition.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
So I'm going to read out a couple quotes.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
Uh, and you guys are going to attribute it to either Serena or Venus Williams.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Are you ready?

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
We haven't done this before.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
We have not.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
Do we do Serena or something else?

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Uh, maybe.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
But probably not.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
I think, because a lot of these Serena quotes were pretty new to me, at least.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Uh.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
All right, here we go.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
I spent my whole life playing sports and training and pushing myself to the limits.

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
We go Serena.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
We go Venus.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
We go Venus.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Marika was correct.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Micah was incorrect.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
That was going to be Venus.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
And we'll say that.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Thank you.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Well, Venus was perfect.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
A V.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
Um, I don't like to lose at anything yet.

24:33.000 --> 24:39.000
I've grown most not from victories, but from setbacks.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Serena.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
That's correct.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Life is challenging.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
But I'm always up for a challenge.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Is that Venus Williams or Serena?

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Okay.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
That was correct.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
That was Venus.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
You have to believe in yourself when no one else does.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Serena.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Correct.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Because we're good at this.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
Victory is very, very sweet.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
It tastes better than any dessert you've ever had.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Venus.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Actually, that's incorrect.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Yeah.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
It was going to say Serena.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
That's Serena.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
And you know, because Serena is slightly better.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
I've developed a karaoke habit.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
I've become a coroner.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Serena.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
Venus.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
That was Serena.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
No one likes getting their nails done more than I do.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Venus.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
That was Serena if you can believe it.

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
Interior design is a business of trust.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
That's got to be Serena.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Serena.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Who?

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Venus has more time on her hands.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
She's the old eldest sister.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Is she really?

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
What's that?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
It's Venus the oldest.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I don't care.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
None of this fucking matters.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
I'm just trying to make money.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Serena.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
I had skate wing in London.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
I had mine grilled with lemon and herbs.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
And it was the perfect seasoning for that fish.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Venus.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
It's Venus.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
It's what context?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
I don't know.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I just, these are all, you know.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
They're all good.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
Inspirational sports quotes.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
To this day, I don't love my arms.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Venus.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
That was Serena.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
Serena is great arms.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
That was Venus of Serena Williams edition.

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
Can you guys guess the 18 best bakeries in Paris?

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
I can guess one of them.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
All right.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Like Razoron?

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Like Razoron?

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Is that...

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Say it one more time?

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Like Razoron?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Like Razoron?

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
What is it?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
No.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
So with what?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Razoron.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
It's not on this list, but I won't give it to you.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
You seem to know what you're talking about.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Wow.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
My mom?

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
That's a bakery in Green Point.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
So nice.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Let's bet this out of here.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
That's absolutely correct.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Oh my god, probably.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
What, can you not look at the list?

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
What did you say?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Lama is wrong.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
What?

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
What?

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
What did he say?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Bontem patissari?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Le patissari?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Le patissari?

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Yeah.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
It was a long time.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
That was a theory.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
That's what you know what he's saying.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
He met that one.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
So that's absolutely correct for Micah.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Well, I haven't really...

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Much out of you since we started talking about Paris.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
I don't know if you're against Gaperie, but let's hear it.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
What about something like Doopary?

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Like Le Poisson Doopary?

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
And Le Fincher?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
What about the air?

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Well, if you were to Chicago, right?

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
So that would be like saying, oh, the best hotdog place in Chicago is of Chicago.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
So that's anything.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Or some Chicago.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
You know what I mean?

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Sure.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Some.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Yeah.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
Do we seriously not know any more of these?

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
You guys are on the court this morning.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Let's just fuck you.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Gatto.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
No, now you're on the exact same list, but I'll give it to you.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
All right.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Here we go.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
And this is the cake.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
I said, here we go.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
We'll steam fucking ahead.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
Welcome to a segment I like to call Chat JFPT.

29:28.000 --> 29:34.000
So I don't think AI is worth a damn to be honest with you.

29:34.000 --> 29:40.000
You know, I feel like we're already using it to what we should use it to and anything further.

29:40.000 --> 29:48.000
It's probably bad for not only humanity, but our sanity as humans.

29:48.000 --> 29:53.000
And those two things are different.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
What do you guys thought that day?

29:55.000 --> 30:01.000
You think we should continue until it kills us?

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
Yes.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
What?

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Do you think we could stop it?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Do you think there's any way to stop it?

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Yes.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
Just shut it all off and plug the computer.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
I think what we have right now won't kill us.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
And so that's a good place to stop because it's still helping us.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
But that's about all we need.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I just don't think they're going to stop.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I think you have to give him a good reason.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Who's there, scientists?

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Chat JFPT.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Chat JFPT.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
So Chat JFPT is my way.

30:29.000 --> 30:35.000
And we might continue checking in as Chat JPT evolves.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
But let's do this.

30:37.000 --> 30:43.000
So this is a segment called Chat JFPT where you guys are going to give me and Chat JFPT a prompt.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
I'm going to type it into Chat JFPT.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
And then it's going to do its thing and I'm going to do my thing.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
Then I'm going to read what it said and I'm going to recite what I think.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
And you guys are going to tell me which one you like better.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Okay.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Easy.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Really?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
What kind of prompt?

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
It could be anything.

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
I'm going to pull them about how, you know,

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
I don't know.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Write a poem about how...

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
It's so far, so good.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
Write a poem about soju or something.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
I don't know.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Yeah.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Right.

31:21.000 --> 31:27.000
The chorus of a blue song about Winnie the Pooh.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
Write the chorus to a blue song about Winnie the Pooh?

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Yes.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
You'd hope not you are.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
That's open to interpretation.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Sorry to give a hint to Chat JFPT.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
All right.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Write the chorus to a blue song about...

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
We need the Pooh.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
So I'm going to do mine first just so I'm not inspired even partially by what's in front of me.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Right.

31:50.000 --> 31:56.000
I'm bad to the shirt.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
I only wear shirts.

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
Don't need to wear shorts.

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
That's mine.

32:10.000 --> 32:16.000
There's Chat JPT.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Oh, Winnie the Pooh.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
You're a bluesy kind of bear.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
With your honey pot and your happy go lucky air.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
You may not have a dollar but you don't seem to care.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Oh, Winnie the Pooh.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
You're a bluesy kind of bear.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
I kind of like...

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
You may not have a dollar.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
But you don't seem to care.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
But I also like...

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
No shorts.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Yeah.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
You're just a good job.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
I like that better.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
Humanity wins round one.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Holy shit.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
All right.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Let's get one from Will.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
What do you want...

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
What do you want to prompt both of us to do?

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Uh, can I get a...

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
A grocery list to make a stir fried dinner?

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Okay.

33:07.000 --> 33:14.000
Can I get a grocery list to make a stir fried dinner?

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
All right.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
So what you're going to want is um...

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
White rice?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Um...

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Soy sauce.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Uh...

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Organic chicken breast.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
Let's be healthy.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
It's a weak night meal I'm thinking.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Um...

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Broccoli florets.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
Um...

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Fresh garlic.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Uh...

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Garlic powder because you have to use both.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
And...

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Um...

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Let's get a little bit of sesame oil in there.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
And...

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Some...

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
Some yellow onions.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Delicious.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
We're going to make a simple, healthy stir fried here.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
So you're...

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
That's the grocery list.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
And you can kind of...

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
I don't...

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
I don't need to tell you how to make it.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
That feels like you get what the thing is.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
This says...

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Uh...

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
One onion, two cloves of garlic.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
One red bell pepper.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
One yellow bell pepper.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
One cup snow peas.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
One cup sliced mushrooms.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Mushrooms.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Two carrots.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Broccoli crown.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
One pound boneless skinless chicken breast.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
Or one found peeled and devane shrimp.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
One tablespoon soy sauce.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Two tablespoons vegetable.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
One tablespoon cornstarch.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Half a tablespoon of salt.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
One quarter teaspoon pepper.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
One quarter teaspoon red pepper flakes.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
And two cups of cooked rice.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
And also as a suggestion.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
It is going back and forth between shopping list and recipe.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
Because you can't buy a tablespoon of any of those.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
Exactly.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Yeah.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
You asked for a grocery list.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
And one of these...

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I didn't even break these up into categories.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Their categories are produce.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Which is a grocery list.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
And then staples.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
Which is measurements of stuff you already probably have at home.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
That's not a grocery list, I would say.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
That is a recipe.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Yeah, but it's not like...

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
And I liked the option of I could go shrimp.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Yeah.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
That's where I started to be like...

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
And I didn't really...

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
I really...

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
Option.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
They added the cornstarch, which is crucial for a thicker sauce.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
That's true.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Humanity loses.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Yeah.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
You can't just decide that.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Because I forgot what that's fine.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
God damn it.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
All right.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
Let's do...

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
How much time do we have?

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Let's do a couple more.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Michael, what do you got?

35:24.000 --> 35:34.000
Right me a list of five activities to do in Los Angeles.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I might have a leg up on chatGPD here.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Here we go.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
ChatGFBT.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Five activities to do in Los Angeles.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I'm going to say the wisdom tree hike.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
It's in the Hollywood Hills.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
It's a medium-strenuous hike.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
But not too long.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
So you got a nice workout in in 30 minutes.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
And you're right up against this cool tree.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
That's kind of famous called the Wisdom Tree.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
And you can see downtown Los Angeles in all the way to the ocean.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
I'm going to say, you got to go to Salazar.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
That's my favorite restaurant in Los Angeles.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Outdoor tacos.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Made on a mosquito grill.

36:05.000 --> 36:10.000
It can accommodate any dietary restriction, including gluten-free, including vegan.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
But also you can get all the meat, your heart desires.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
And you can have as much flour as you can stomach.

36:15.000 --> 36:20.000
I'm going to say, let's go to the Highland Park Bowl.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
That's go to the Highland Park Bowl.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
One of the oldest bowling hours in the United States.

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
And also on your way, you're going to be on the oldest freeway ever.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
Which I think is kind of interesting.

36:32.000 --> 36:39.000
And it's cool because you can get, it's like a bar with that also has these cool bowling lanes.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
What else are we going to want?

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
Let's go with staircase beach in Malibu.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
It's the best surfing Southern California has to offer.

36:47.000 --> 36:52.000
It also is just a dog beach and a nice beach to go to that other people aren't going to be at.

36:52.000 --> 36:57.000
You walk down a natural cliffside staircase that's not man made as far as I know.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
It's just you walk down these little things that like stroll you down to the beach.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
Then you're, there's privacy because there's this bluff.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
It's on the north end of Malibu.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
So there's just not that many people.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
And it is the best surfing.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
The best place to learn how to surf.

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
And even if you're good at surfing, it's just really fun thick rolling waves.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
How many is that for?

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
That's for.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Let's do one more.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
I'm going to say, what's my favorite ball?

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
You got to go to TQT.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
The one of the oldest bars in Los Angeles.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
It's this tiny TQ bar.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
You got to get there around 5 p.m.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
If you want to be able to have a table.

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
But it's just, you know, classic TQ drinks in a classic LA setting.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
All right, here we go.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Here's chat, GPT.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
They're not going to fucking know.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
They're going to say the Hollywood sign, right?

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Oh, here we go.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
This sucks already.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
They're saying, number one, visit the Griffith Observatory.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Nice.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
If you like crowds, hot exposed things without tree cover.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
And a worst view than the wisdom tree hike.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Yeah, why don't you go to the Griffith Observatory?

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
Walk along the Venice Beach Boardwalk.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Yeah, sure.

37:57.000 --> 38:04.000
If you want to go to a more crowded touristy polluted version of staircase beach without any

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
height or differential or privacy or dogs mind you.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Yeah, I'll go to the Venice Beach Boardwalk.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Take a tour of the Getty Center.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
I'll give them that.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
That's cool.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
That's a good art museum.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Yeah.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Visit Lackmont.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
I'll give them that.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
But you have two museums on there.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
So that might be not a varied enough list.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
And then they're saying go to Universal Studios Hollywood.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
I don't think so.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
I actually think Universal Studios is more fun to go to as a local.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Not as someone you're visiting.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Who's visiting LA?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Sorry.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
I don't even realize.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
What's that?

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
What does that mean?

38:32.000 --> 38:37.000
I think it's fun and novel to go to Universal Studios City Walk if you live here.

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
But if you're in LA visiting, like, it's not worth it.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Yeah.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
For Mario?

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
What's that?

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
If I'm visiting a Shenzhi Mario?

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
All right.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Well, it doesn't get about this round.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
I think Jeff Jeff.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Yeah.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Jeff.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Jeff.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
Do you want to do wins again?

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
All right.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Let's do one more.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Right?

39:05.000 --> 39:16.000
Me a list of things to accomplish before you're 30.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
How many things?

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
Four.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
All right.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
Um.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
Fall in love.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
Uh.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
Find the perfect pair of jeans.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
Uh.

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
Uh.

39:48.000 --> 39:57.000
Try a physically challenging activity that you've wanted to try and learn an instrument.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
Yeah.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
Chat GPT says establish a savings plan.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
Setting up a savings plan before you turn 30 can help you achieve your financial goals.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
Travel to a new place.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Traveling can broaden your horizons.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
Expose you to new cultures and experience.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Pursuit personal passion or hobby.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Whether it's painting writing photography or a sport.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
Pursuing a personal passion or hobby can provide a sense of fulfillment.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Establish a healthy lifestyle.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
Establishing a healthy habit before you turn 30 can set you up for a lifetime of good health.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
I think I got to give it to you.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
It's a tough choice.

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
The jeans was so big.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
The jeans was so big.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Yeah.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
That's not really an answer.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Yeah.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
I'm kind of like torn because I kind of.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
I would go with neither but.

40:49.000 --> 40:58.000
I think if I could have all of those things on either list before turning 30, the chat,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
GPT one would be more practical.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Yeah.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Yeah.

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
But I think if I was like getting a card from a friend, I was like, do all these things before your 30,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
it would be funnier to read what you suggested.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Before you're off.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
I'm here for a share.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Well, you're the tiebreaker.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
So far we have neither and one for chat GPT, I think.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
I think I'm going to keep it a tie.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
I have a chat.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
I think I'm going to love his two good.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
Come on.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Everybody here.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
Everybody here.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Everybody here.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Give it to me.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Give it to me.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Give it to me.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
I've never done a good thing.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
I've never done a good thing.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
I've never done a good thing.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
I've never done a good thing.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
We've got to wrap shit up.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Plugs.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
What do you guys have going on?

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
What do you want to point to people to the floor is yours?

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
I'll start just so I can get all my energy out.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
At Jeffrey James on Instagram.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
At Jeff Boyardy on Twitter.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
And I guess that's it.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
If you're, yeah.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
That's it.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
Oh, head game videos.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Headgum.com slash.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Sorry.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
YouTube.com slash headgum.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
And I think we have a headgum happy or coming up in a couple of weeks.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
But we don't have a day for you.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Yeah.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
So headgum happy hour.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
March 30th in New York City.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
At caveat.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
And then in May.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
In Los Angeles.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
Also.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
The pit wall is back for season two.

42:33.000 --> 42:40.000
Audio only because we're now releasing episodes every week.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
In theory, Jeff is on the podcast.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
Jake will be back from Australia.

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
The whole crew talking about drive to survive.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
The races may be some movies.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
It'll be great.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
So listen to that.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
And then follow me on Twitter and Instagram and letter box.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
At Marie Gaylon.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
Really trying to get those letter boxed followers up.

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
Really want to get over a thousand.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
It'll be great.

43:13.000 --> 43:20.000
It'll be fun.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Con over.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I'm trying to get on the circle.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
You know the Netflix show.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Michael.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
If you know anybody.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
If there's any connects out in the audience.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
They shoot in the UK.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
And I would be away from work from a little.

43:36.000 --> 43:42.000
I don't think that would be a problem.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I definitely would.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
I like to imagine you're like audition tape for the circle.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
It has a lot of like verbal typos like that.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
Okay.

43:50.000 --> 43:55.000
That would be really fun if you're on the circle.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
I think you do a good job.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Would you do a fish?

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
Yeah.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
I was going to say would you catfish or not?

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
It's a great question.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
I would be on my way.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
Yeah.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
I would play a fire.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
You don't want to get into it.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
I think you're so sexy.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
That you should just go totally honest up front.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
And people might think that you're trying to catfish.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Those people do really well.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
And I really hate watching them.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
So it's a divide.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
But if people think you're trying to catfish.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
They might try to kick you out.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
So I feel like you got to go.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
You can't be your full self.

44:31.000 --> 44:38.000
I forgot what the objective of that show was.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Michael, what do you got?

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
We got to get the hell out of here.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
Oh yeah.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
Subscribe to my mom's sub-stack.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Sub-stack.loreherwits.com.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Or it might be loreherwits.sub-stack.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
That's sub-stack.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
Yeah.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
And we'll see you guys again next week.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
We'll we'd love to have you on a good soon.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
You killed it.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
I'll jump back.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Michael, email you my notes.

44:59.000 --> 45:03.000
And Maria, I think Mike is now the time to tell her that she's fired.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
You should.

45:04.000 --> 45:14.000
Oh, can I ask you about this dinner reservation that you made under my email address in your name for a restaurant in LA?

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
That's in two days.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
You may not.

45:29.000 --> 45:37.000
That was a hit dumb original.

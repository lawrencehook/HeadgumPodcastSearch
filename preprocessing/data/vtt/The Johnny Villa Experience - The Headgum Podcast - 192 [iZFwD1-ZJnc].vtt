00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Rollin' audio. Rollin' audio.

00:10.000 --> 00:27.000
Rollin' audio.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Is it not time to the shut?

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Sorry. I thought you wanted to take the lead.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
What did I do to say this morning before we started recording that made you think that I wanted you to take the lead?

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
I like you texted me. Can you sort of drive the ship this episode? But maybe I missed read that.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Oh, here. Join our Cloud HD video meeting.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Sorry.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Sorry.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
I thought it was like, yeah, steer the ship as it were.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
Let me read the lead.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
I was going to say, let's bury the lead today

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
for the audio listeners.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
And see how long we can go without saying who the special guest is.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
And don't say it'll be in this book.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Shiny filler, right?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Yeah, hi, everybody.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
It's good to be back.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Yeah, I miss what.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
To play the, um, the everybody song.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
No, you're not allowed to.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I know I'm not allowed to, but then now,

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
do you hear the silence? Do you hear the lack of energy? Like,

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
It's not everybody. Everybody, let's get into it.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Get stoked.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Get stoked.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
We got a little bit of energy.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
We got a little bit of energy from you, M.G.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
That's awesome.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Welcome to the show, Johnny.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
A Karrell and J.ville.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Kind of.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Johnny Villain himself.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
It's good to be back.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Once again.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Thank you for finding out.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
That's the best we can do.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Okay.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
I'll take that.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
That's really sad to be honest.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I would say that Johnny's for the auto listeners.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
He's dressed to the fines.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
It's that less than nine.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Like, Ralph finds.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Yeah, like Ralph.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Ralph.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Ralph is.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Yeah.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Okay.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Um, now, you know, I know everybody's excited for,

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
for Villas return to the villa,

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
which is what I call the New York studio,

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
along with studio hate on the LA coast.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
And studio Jeff.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Those are the three studio names for me.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
I wanted to kind of lay out some ground rules for today's episode,

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
because I feel like the past couple of weeks have been ad hoc slash nausea.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Does that make sense?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
And do you all agree?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
No.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
But continue.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
I'm not going to agree in advance.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Yeah.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
Uh, rule number one.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Or, yeah, ground rule number one.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
What's that?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
I said do that.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
I have fun.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
No, that's absolutely not the first rules overlapping dialogue,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
which we just were doing a good job of there.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
And I feel like there's something out.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
There we go.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
There we go.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Uh, basically let's cut each other off a lot.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Does that make sense?

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Okay.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
I highly do it.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Okay.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Or you love the rule.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
I feel like I can go.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Number two.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
No.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Oh, that was really good with the rule.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Okay.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Number two.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Jinks.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Let's avoid talking too much about my concussion.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Right?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
I feel like everybody keeps going up.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I think any of us were going to start, right?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Yeah.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
It's just hard to get my head again.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Yeah.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
I think regardless, it's going to be a parent that you have a concussion.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
But people are saying that I had brain trauma before.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Sure.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Sure.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Sure.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
And there was that overlapping dialect.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
So I feel like we are, we are abiding a lot by the first rule.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
And I do appreciate it.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
But I feel like the second rule is already kind of gone back on itself,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
because we're all we're talking about as the head injury.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
All the year we're talking about.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Let's move on.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
If possible, this is rule number three.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
If possible, let's switch on, let's switch on over to studio G.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
What is that?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
What do you mean?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
It's the bigger studio in LA.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
I know what it is, because I work for the company.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Okay.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
And we can't do that.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
You're in your house.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
We thought you were going to be in studio.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
I know.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
We could still put a pause.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
We could put a pause on the episode.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
You guys keep recording.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
See whatever, you know, full school you come up with.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
And then a mirror and I drive over to the studio.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
I don't know.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
We take me like, sorry.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Just to get there.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Yeah.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
I don't know.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
For studio G, that's worth it.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Oh, I can't.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Jeff's a real life appears.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Like, getting emerged.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
Ground rule number four, not a peep from Joel.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
Unless he's staying over a lot.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Staying put a lot, what do you mean by that?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
So, and I'm so glad you asked Johnny.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Just for a refresher for everybody.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
I told out New Year's resolutions on the first episode of the year.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
And I gave everybody their own resolution.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Joel was to stay put a lot.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
You wanted me to travel the world.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Become more worldly.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Learn more about different cultures.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
But specifically not to enter Philadelphia.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Oh, okay.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I can abide by that rule.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I think Philadelphia's.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
So Joel, it seems like.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Bad place.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Visually it looks like you're in the New York studio.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
So I think you're good.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
So let's hear a lot from you.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Ground rule number five.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Maria is free to take the reins whenever she wants.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
But if she's going to fucking give your brothers.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Jesus.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Can you do that?

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Well, I'm not going to agree to anything.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
But these are ground rules.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Everybody's supposed to agree.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
We cannot continue the episode.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Unless we all hear them all.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
We already broke a rule.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
I'm also not going to agree.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Because I feel like agreement would be agreement to taking the reins.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Which I'm not going to do because I would rather give

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Reigns to Johnny as our special guest.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
That's humbly appreciate that.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
But it's also sort of yeah.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
It's also sort of what really.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
It's hectic of me.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
The last ground rule is to enjoy the ride.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Can we all just try to have fun today?

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
And not like let all of our real life.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Fisions get in the way.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
I feel like the last one.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
I feel like the last rule of all these always.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
You can get up and go to the bathroom or get a drink of water at any time.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
And you may not ask anything.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
And I meant to add that to the ground rules.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
You can't do any of those.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Yeah.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
To be blocked.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Yeah.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
If you enjoy specifically if you get up to use the bathroom or get a drink.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
If you come back, you're not allowed to speak.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Because that's basically.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
You would be walking in the direction of Philadelphia.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
So anyone that breaks the rule is an allowed to speak.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Is that the case?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
No.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Just draw.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Okay.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Okay.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
All right.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Good.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
So far.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Right.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
There's so much dead area from you.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
What's that?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
So much dead air from you, man.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
No.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Overlapping.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Overlapping.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Dialogue.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
That's part of it.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
That's why it's been said.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
We're doing a lot of overlapping.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
And maybe I should have said it at the exact same time as you.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Because then it would have been real.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
It should be.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
It should be.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
We have a filth.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Three of us.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
That's the thing that I'm actually.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
I'm glad you brought that up.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
I've never said that the show was supposed to be or would be relaxing.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
This is actually supposed to be an anxiety-inducing hour for people on their way to work.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
What's your point?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Yeah.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Yeah.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
It's just going to bond with the weeks.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Yeah.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Johnny, who's your bond with the week?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Uh.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Anybody except Barry Kie again.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Uh.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
We need some stop being in movies, man.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Wow.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Oh.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Wow.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
That's really cool.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
He's bad.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
There it goes.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Um.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
I might be like, what the fuck is that?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Oh.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Stop.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
And then I love the energy.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
What's with the Keegan Hate though, the Keegan Hate?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Uh.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
I've heard that he's a little bit of a little bird on set.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000

Right?

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Keep it on Johnny's return.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Who's Sabrina Carpenter?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Uh.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
She's a Disney star.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Pop star.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Oh.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
You're hard when you're a Disney star.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I gave you was embody young.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
You don't know who Sabrina Carpenter has been six weeks.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Sort of.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
He's sort of.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
He's kind of.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Josh with that.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
So that would be a red re-go thing.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Oh, really.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
That's my.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
That's my.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Also the on the reason I'd ever.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Wow.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Yeah.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
When Emma would you say that she was mother during that.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Or.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Um.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
No.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I wouldn't say she's mother at all.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Yeah.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Sorry.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Is S.E. Cup?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
One of me.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I still think we should get merged.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
That says that.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Um.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
All right.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Marika Joel Emma.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Buddy healed.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Because you're sting.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
Because he just violated the one rule that I can't.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
That makes him worthy of change.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
He's snuck in undetected.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
She'll beat your sensors.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I feel like you're really not getting.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
The rule isn't that nobody can go to Philadelphia.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
I mean, I would love if people go to Philadelphia.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
The rules and you need to stay put a lot, which entails traveling the world.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Just not to.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
You guys prefer Philadelphia or Boston, just by a show of hands.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Philadelphia.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
And now.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
It's interesting.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
No way.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Like Boston.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
We're split.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Sorry.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Wow.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Too Boston too.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Philly.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
That must suck to see in here.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
I mean, we still won the popular vote.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
But the fact that it was that close was kind of embarrassing.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Johnny gets like eight delegates.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I mean, he is Boston.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
I've been Jerry Mandarin.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
I'm the weakest Michael Shannon.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Okay.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Michael Shay.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Shannon.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Michael Shay.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Yeah.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Mine is Michael Shay too.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Yeah.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
I have to say too, because that wasn't mine.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I was going to shave Michael.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Yeah.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Michael Shannon.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Yeah.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Emma.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
So, for this fully.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Um.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Mine.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
On to the week.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
It's going to be.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
I didn't know how it was going to be participating.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
It's by there.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Best.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I just came from therapy because I'm feeling better than I ever do.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
I have a good podcast.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Oh.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
That's actually following in line with this resolution that I do although.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Oh.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
That's true.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I'm only medium upset that it's a beautiful day outside.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Yeah.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
I'm fucking here.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Really?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
To be fair.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
It's like three.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
30.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yeah.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
So I know.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.140
We're gonna have an hour left of daylight by the time we get out of here and we will you guys haven't seen the episode

11:31.140 --> 11:37.280
Hopefully still like the intro this is still the wax portion. So you don't know how much we got a speed. We got to have some

11:37.280 --> 11:39.280
We have to enjoy the ride

11:39.280 --> 11:41.280
I would say

11:41.280 --> 11:45.960
Michael Shae, is that weird to say? Oh, I was gonna say my tool as well. Yeah

11:46.960 --> 11:48.960
Well that shane natural

11:49.760 --> 11:51.760
Maybe don't and she

11:51.760 --> 11:58.680
Either that or Mahari Shima Hashiyogi founder of Transcendental Meditation because it's time for a jane

11:58.680 --> 12:00.680
storm or

12:01.800 --> 12:03.800
Michael Shae

12:03.800 --> 12:05.800
Mahari Shima Hashiyogi

12:05.800 --> 12:13.000
Is a jane no meditation a scam it is, but I just think it's time for a james call my friend paid like $3,000

12:13.000 --> 12:16.840
Just send to tell him the word that he could use to repeat as a mantra

12:17.480 --> 12:19.480
Yeah, believe so

12:21.480 --> 12:23.480
You don't you kind of want to know what you're worried

12:25.640 --> 12:30.920
I would love to know in my word is I'll tell you what's on his word. No, you can't tell

12:30.920 --> 12:32.520
I'll tell you for a half that yeah

12:36.040 --> 12:39.240
I'll pay the paper goalable, I guess. I don't know

12:41.800 --> 12:43.800
Champ goalable

12:44.680 --> 12:48.680
What's those name of 60 minutes? Minutes Carl

12:50.280 --> 12:52.280
What say again

12:54.280 --> 12:56.280
No

12:56.280 --> 13:00.120
Is it a charge of like sending that I have sort of a future to space?

13:01.800 --> 13:08.360
But Carl's sake and was the guy from way away to it's all me now. He's the guy who's like billions and billions of atoms

13:08.360 --> 13:10.840
He's that guy. Yeah, he had to choose what?

13:10.920 --> 13:18.200
Documents, sounds, smells, items would best represent humanity

13:19.560 --> 13:24.600
If they were found thousands of years or so by aliens, kind of interesting if you think about it

13:26.600 --> 13:28.840
America, it co-wrote the first verse

13:30.920 --> 13:32.200
Wow

13:32.200 --> 13:34.200
Okay, I'm I'm stepping into the shot

13:35.160 --> 13:41.320
You've got a hot walk. Is it hot enough to burn all these grains? Maybe we could make them see her

13:42.520 --> 13:46.040
Maybe together we can ruin some rice, poison makes it wetter

13:47.080 --> 13:53.640
Adding soy seeds and various oils when you're done scorching grains the rice should be unrecognizable

13:55.080 --> 13:56.600
Your singing voice has gotten better

13:57.960 --> 13:59.960
You've been doing this so many times

14:00.200 --> 14:02.200
You've just brought been practicing essentially

14:03.160 --> 14:09.960
You've got a patty a patty's a field in which they grow rice imagine farm to table char

14:10.280 --> 14:14.440
To own a patty is a dream of mine most rice is grown and sand

14:15.080 --> 14:19.080
Just kidding that's its consistency rice is grown underwater

14:19.800 --> 14:21.800
That's when rice is furthest from good

14:23.640 --> 14:25.640
Hmm yeah, it's reasonable

14:27.720 --> 14:29.720
Right you guys can make a lot of you know first

14:30.680 --> 14:37.080
Yeah, you see my old man's got a problem. He serves boss body. That is nice and soft. He says no one else

14:37.080 --> 14:42.360
Just likes his rice. I say his way of cooking rice is wrong and bad my mama went off and left him

14:43.000 --> 14:49.400
Actually applying they're still together, but if I had my draw that her's my mom would cheat on him with tons of rice

14:51.240 --> 14:53.880
I'm glad my finally brought it back to marrying rice

14:54.280 --> 14:56.280
Oh

14:57.960 --> 15:03.320
God, he's got the rest of the first time I've all did rice. I was shocked to learn that I'd attained a sear

15:03.480 --> 15:07.960
There's nothing like that first damage as you caught a rise grains the sear is thus

15:13.880 --> 15:15.880
Where's the chorus

15:15.880 --> 15:16.840
That's right

15:16.840 --> 15:21.720
It was so rising when I made rice char bomba so burn I felt like I was drunk

15:22.200 --> 15:26.600
Go to tank drop down to grains and the pan blaze red until the fire alarm went off and

15:28.520 --> 15:31.160
Watch his white rice turn black rose and

15:31.640 --> 15:33.640
Yeah

15:37.640 --> 15:39.640
As a host

15:40.200 --> 15:45.400
My lyric was and rye ice. Yeah, it's much better. Yeah, that would have been awesome

15:45.800 --> 15:55.080
Yeah, you got a fast car you invited me to get into your fast car and I brought a hot plate and I jokingly said

15:55.320 --> 16:01.000
What if I burn rice you vehemently said no way as I pulled out a bag of high-cost grains

16:01.160 --> 16:05.640
And I quickly tore spricy rice in the passenger seat as you found the whole drive

16:07.240 --> 16:09.640
So that's like you're plugging it in in the little gas things

16:11.160 --> 16:17.720
I zoned out like two birds ago and I remember that rice was driving when I made rice char or powerbile

16:17.720 --> 16:23.320
So black I felt like I was drunk chili paste bolted into scraps in the pan burn hot till the house

16:23.480 --> 16:25.480
Fire and I

16:25.880 --> 16:29.240
Was just jazz I tried in the sand and I

16:30.360 --> 16:36.120
Had a feeling that I could serve a cinched round rice to a crowd at a week

16:48.920 --> 16:52.680
You don't have to play the sound we're really far we're actually proud of you, but

16:54.280 --> 16:58.600
Um, we haven't had an actual rice song in a while. We had race harbor

16:59.160 --> 17:01.160
Forcing me to sing a song I didn't know

17:01.800 --> 17:07.080
No, yeah, no, it was like it was a attack. Yeah, yeah

17:08.520 --> 17:11.800
Ultimately the song was my idea

17:12.360 --> 17:17.160
It wasn't just didn't use any of my lyrics my one lyric that I was your one producer

17:18.120 --> 17:21.080
Yeah, but it like it kind of sucks. It hurt in a lot

17:21.720 --> 17:23.080
E I

17:23.080 --> 17:29.480
Have a feeling it should be charred. That's not bad good. It was good. Yeah, I'm spying on you

17:30.040 --> 17:32.680
I have a feeling that it should be jarred

17:34.440 --> 17:36.440
We talked to these lyrics

17:36.440 --> 17:38.440
Oh my god

17:38.440 --> 17:44.600
How about we focus on the far boy line? Yeah, there are people who are boyling is less than boyling

17:45.080 --> 17:50.760
Yeah, yeah, it's like now burning anything. Oh, yeah, it's all right. We'll take our boy going to fry the shit out of it

17:50.760 --> 17:53.800
Yeah, what kind of like if you like cooked risotto

17:54.760 --> 17:57.320
That's usually all done today, but then you make

17:57.960 --> 18:02.360
Maybe make aren't chini you fry it until your ball which is kind of jord

18:03.560 --> 18:07.160
A little bit I had goat cheese balls last weekend

18:07.880 --> 18:11.080
Congrats, that's not right. Okay. You've got a pop-wap

18:11.960 --> 18:17.400
Is that hot enough to burn all these grains? Maybe we could make them see her. Maybe together

18:17.400 --> 18:19.400
We could ruin some rice

18:19.400 --> 18:27.640
Hoisin makes it wetter. Yeah, I did send these lyrics to a lot of people and everyone pointed out that they were uncomfortable with hoisin makes it wetter

18:29.080 --> 18:35.000
Well, this was your favorite line you said from the verse that I sent you which is adding soy seeds and various oils

18:35.240 --> 18:40.920
Yeah, just like various oils and when you're done scorching grains the rice should be unrecognizable

18:42.040 --> 18:48.760
Reisable, riceable, I was also happy right so happy that you

18:50.680 --> 18:57.560
All of the like and the lyrics to the chorus were different words instead of like be someone be someone be someone

18:57.560 --> 19:05.160
I figured that you would do it the way you did it which maybe I'd be I had a feeling that I could serve the dish as a side as a

19:05.160 --> 19:11.880
Way yeah, and then the last one I had a feeling I could serve since brown rice at a to a crowd at a wake

19:12.200 --> 19:14.200
Yeah, but you can't

19:16.200 --> 19:20.040
I don't think we need to go through all the lyrics right all right, then let's take a fucking break

19:20.040 --> 19:21.000
Fuck you guys right

19:25.800 --> 19:30.440
Holy shit guys taking care of your health isn't always easy, right, but it should be simple

19:30.600 --> 19:38.040
That's why for the last three years I've been taking a g1 just one scoop in a cup of water mixed around every day no exceptions

19:38.520 --> 19:44.920
And it helps me feel you know energized focused ready to take on the day like I'm doing one powerfully healthy

19:44.920 --> 19:47.560
Habit that's also powerfully simple

19:48.520 --> 19:54.520
I know that a g1 gives my body high quality nutrition because every batch goes through a rigorous testing process

19:54.600 --> 19:59.480
So that you know it's safe and their ingredients are sourced for potency

19:59.880 --> 20:07.080
Absorption and nutrient density all of which is very important and you don't always get with other leading nutrition brands

20:07.800 --> 20:10.760
I like to drink it first thing in the morning. I'll have a

20:11.640 --> 20:17.640
Glass of water. I'll have my AG one and then I'll have my coffee and it gets me set off to take on the day

And we're back

22:26.040 --> 22:31.720
It's my understanding that you have a segment that you brought in yeah, yeah, I was really excited to come back on

22:32.680 --> 22:35.480
So I haven't been on the podcast in a while obviously

22:36.120 --> 22:43.720
But it seems like in my during my absence headgum has grown a lot you guys got the Jake Johnson podcast

22:43.720 --> 22:45.720
That's pretty big

22:45.800 --> 22:49.160
Yeah, you got the Tomcellic podcast as well, which is really really amazing

22:49.720 --> 22:53.720
Tomcellic go with the mustache friends of Bob Oden crew. You know who he is he doesn't have a show

22:55.240 --> 22:57.240
David cross who

22:57.240 --> 22:59.240
Never mind okay, well anyways

22:59.800 --> 23:03.240
Tom doesn't matter yeah, Tomcellic go with the mustache bald head

23:04.280 --> 23:08.920
He said I don't know who he is he does not have a headgum podcast makes no sense to me, but

23:09.000 --> 23:11.800
Remember this name you get happier expedient

23:13.080 --> 23:15.480
Yeah, he's awesome, but doesn't matter and you love the pot

23:16.440 --> 23:17.800
I do love the pot. It's great

23:18.920 --> 23:25.720
So I haven't been on the podcast in a while and I think I wanted to talk about how much we've all grown

23:26.440 --> 23:31.640
We've grown as a company we've grown as performers and I put together a couple moments

23:31.640 --> 23:36.840
Maybe that aren't our brightest shining moments, but I wanted to talk through them so we can really

23:37.320 --> 23:38.520
Really

23:38.520 --> 23:43.320
Really actualize just how much we've grown since since the start of headgum really

23:43.720 --> 23:48.280
So back. Yeah, look back. I walked down memory lane pretty much and Jeffrey

23:50.360 --> 23:52.360
First I wanted to ask a question where

23:53.560 --> 23:55.560
Was everybody during

23:56.360 --> 24:01.880
The 2017 NBA Eastern Conference finals and quick and loans arena in Cleveland, Ohio

24:02.840 --> 24:04.840
I

24:04.840 --> 24:06.840
I went to a game. I think yeah

24:07.400 --> 24:14.760
Yeah, basketball game right clicking on Loans Arena. Yeah, sure. I think what's the first game? Yeah, yeah, with some friends, but we don't have to pull the image right now

24:14.920 --> 24:16.920
Jeffrey your career has been going off without a hitch

24:17.480 --> 24:20.680
You had the CBS diversity showcase let me finish

24:22.040 --> 24:24.040
You had the CBS diversity showcase

24:24.600 --> 24:30.120
You just finished shooting a movie that's really really exciting, but you know, wasn't all rainbows and butterflies

24:30.600 --> 24:36.840
There was compromise and you had some run-ins with some contentious characters. What do you say that?

24:37.800 --> 24:42.200
I don't think I would say that okay, well, why don't we pull the first image when we can talk through it?

24:42.840 --> 24:44.840
Okay, okay

24:46.520 --> 24:48.520
So yeah, in this image

24:49.560 --> 24:51.560
Unbelievable photo yeah

24:51.560 --> 24:56.120
It is unbelievable this is a real photo. I found out in Google images and in the middle there

24:56.200 --> 25:03.160
We have now canceled celebrity David Chappelle and two David Chappelle's left

25:03.160 --> 25:06.040
We have none other than headgums Jeffrey James

25:06.760 --> 25:15.080
I'm imagining that David's spouting some really really spiteful rhetoric and date and you think you're just sitting there in the in the the stand saying

25:15.320 --> 25:16.680
Transphobic stuff

25:16.680 --> 25:18.040
Absolutely

25:18.040 --> 25:22.920
Is this image you co-signing Amy Schumer's opinions on Israel? Of course not

25:23.960 --> 25:25.960
Are you biting your lips

25:26.280 --> 25:32.760
Tiding your lips because you're losing and it's you're buying your top lip put you as a problem that you had back then

25:34.600 --> 25:36.600
Fuck you

25:36.600 --> 25:38.600
Everyone was like

25:38.600 --> 25:40.600
I like it's like

25:40.600 --> 25:43.720
You did the stupid thing in 2016. You had a bad habit

25:44.680 --> 25:46.680
We had a huge problem with it

25:46.680 --> 25:48.680
We were ever in India

25:48.680 --> 25:53.480
But this is a feeling it looks like he's gearing up to be the Lakers hedge coach

25:53.880 --> 26:00.200
Yeah, exactly you can just sort of tell he has like an vision towards the future. Yeah, he's seeing himself in redondo

26:00.200 --> 26:02.200
But yeah, continue

26:02.520 --> 26:07.800
Yeah, I just wanted you to you know briefly talk about what was going through your mind because you have to you have to

26:07.800 --> 26:13.800
Have to wonder what the hell is going on in your head that you're not speaking out for somebody who can't really defend themselves

26:14.200 --> 26:18.040
Yeah, well, this was like a decade ago, right? Like this is before he came out with all those

26:18.680 --> 26:21.800
Specials where you were saying horrible things. I'm sure there's all that doing

26:22.440 --> 26:24.440
You'll say

26:24.440 --> 26:26.440
In the person's head next to me

26:27.960 --> 26:32.360
That's how you're gonna that's how you're choosing to hold me accountable. There's so many other ways you could

26:33.000 --> 26:36.760
Ultimately I just I just want to say that I feel betrayed

26:37.480 --> 26:41.800
What a pussing this image and I want to know Joel if you feel the same way

26:42.520 --> 26:47.480
I don't think you've seen this image before. Have you I was actually shown it a few weeks ago really? Yes

26:48.280 --> 26:53.560
I was interested in the fact that everyone else is looking up. I assume it means you were shown on the big screen

26:54.680 --> 26:58.120
And so they're looking at themselves and you have no idea you're on the big screen

26:58.120 --> 27:00.120
That's why I still doing the weird upper lip thing

27:01.800 --> 27:03.880
I guess you're doing that subconsciously, so even if you knew

27:04.760 --> 27:06.760
Yeah, maybe doing it

27:06.760 --> 27:09.080
It was definitely a game that we were

27:10.520 --> 27:13.800
Or yeah because we we won the series four and two right this was against the raptors

27:13.960 --> 27:19.160
I'm not sure the 2017 conference finals. Yeah. Yeah. Oh

27:20.760 --> 27:24.440
Then I don't know also who was sitting to your left my dad

27:25.560 --> 27:27.560
Right obviously

27:29.560 --> 27:33.560
Like will the shade I'll prep you best in that right

27:35.640 --> 27:42.200
But yeah, yeah, I sat next to these people by happen stands. What do you want to do on me to say? I just want you to

27:42.600 --> 27:52.120
Admit you're wrong doing and then we can move on from this image. I'm sorry that I sat I was sat next to Dave Shappelle. Okay good and look

27:53.160 --> 28:00.200
I know you're my friend and I know you've grown up since then but even still you dove a little bit deeper in to that community

28:00.760 --> 28:06.200
You came in a sort of edgey comedian who wanted a balance his audience on the left wing and the right wing

28:06.200 --> 28:11.400
You were it's like a down center. I don't care if there's anyone on the right wing in my audience

28:11.480 --> 28:16.120
All right, it doesn't matter what you think because just yeah, I'm that's becoming very clear by the way

28:17.400 --> 28:21.080
Well, yeah, it doesn't matter what you think because ultimately I matters how you act. Yeah. Yeah

28:21.880 --> 28:27.240
You swang a little bit too hard for the fences on your Joe Rogan appearance. Do you remember that? I

28:28.120 --> 28:34.600
Have never done the Joe Rogan experience. Okay. Why don't we open up you Lee the next image and play

28:35.880 --> 28:39.080
Play that first part of that clip from your Joe Rogan appearance

28:39.160 --> 28:43.640
I don't think anyone else has seen it. So maybe we can all be quiet and just let it let it ride

28:44.120 --> 28:50.040
All right, this is not so it's obviously not real right? I don't know second

28:51.720 --> 28:57.160
All right, you worked on man you're a really funny guy truth be told

28:57.880 --> 29:03.960
I learned from the best yeah, I'm curious what kind of comedians were you watching when you were growing up

29:04.280 --> 29:06.120
you know carrot top

29:06.120 --> 29:09.560
Carrot top. Yeah, also Carlos Minceia

29:10.200 --> 29:14.600
Oh, yeah, he's got this really funny song that really punches down

29:15.240 --> 29:17.240
You know cancel poker and all that

29:18.200 --> 29:21.240
Anyway, yeah, I'm blanking on other comedians

29:22.520 --> 29:28.280
The pace of the conversation is indicative. This isn't true. When does that sounded exactly like you?

29:28.280 --> 29:33.800
Yeah, it sounded like Johnny with an AI voice on top of his that sounds a little bit more like me

29:33.800 --> 29:35.800
When was the Johnny when was this

29:36.600 --> 29:40.040
This was a couple years ago. They wiped it really quickly from the Joe Rogan feet

29:40.040 --> 29:43.480
I guess they deleted it from the Joe Rogan feet. They don't do that

29:43.880 --> 29:49.720
They never learn that I assume someone with your interests at heart really cared about you when they wanted this white from the internet

29:49.960 --> 29:55.960
But thankfully we had internet archival experts to have that art yeah archival or we're the archival expert

29:55.960 --> 30:00.600
They're on the deep web of a source matter. I don't want to I don't want to say their names or anything

30:01.240 --> 30:07.560
Wait, you like Carlos Minceia's DDD song, which is about how mentally handicapped people shouldn't

30:07.560 --> 30:13.160
Procreate you thought that was good. I don't know who that is. I've never heard that name before

30:13.960 --> 30:19.560
Well, you sort of co-signed it I can't believe I've never heard of these victim of a deep fake

30:21.560 --> 30:27.080
That's what they say you're interested in these comedians. Which I'm really shocked about. We're close friends

30:27.400 --> 30:29.400
I

30:29.400 --> 30:37.240
Don't I've never seen a carrot top it. What did carrot top do that got him kids? It's a lot of comedy. Yeah. Yeah, so it's just that he's not funny

30:38.360 --> 30:40.360
No, well, I mean

30:40.360 --> 30:46.600
So you're influenced though in a way. Yeah, you know what's funny is that my dad's co-worker is carrot top's brother

30:47.240 --> 30:51.080
Really that is actually kind of insane. Yeah, but he was sitting in a left of your dad

30:51.080 --> 30:53.080
He's just been writing in that row a topic in love

30:54.120 --> 30:58.920
Ultimately I was pretty shocked hearing that and it seems like everyone else was pretty shocked

30:59.240 --> 31:02.040
Why don't we play the second clip and I'll just let it speak for itself

31:02.600 --> 31:07.640
Okay, I I don't like that you're letting the clips speak for themselves because I feel like they need a ton of context

31:08.920 --> 31:13.640
Just a little talk for themselves. All right. You work with Jake and a mirror, right? That was like

31:13.640 --> 31:15.640
He knows you they aren't a chipman

31:16.040 --> 31:18.040
You should feel sorry. I need to start this over

31:18.040 --> 31:25.400
He's so jealous that that happened to be the first internship I did in college

31:26.200 --> 31:29.000
He's like giving me my flowers for no reason

31:29.880 --> 31:34.600
He must know Jake and I'm here, right that was like your first fucking internship man

31:35.240 --> 31:40.840
You should feel total hacks fuck those guys. Oh, okay? I

31:40.840 --> 31:47.640
I feel like I've only heard good things about them. You're the only media personality who's worth a damn in this country

31:48.600 --> 31:52.520
Wow, thank you Jeffrey now. Let's talk about gun control

31:55.240 --> 31:59.400
Dude you are going yeah, you're absolutely biting the hand that feeds you

31:59.960 --> 32:04.440
I don't understand this is your voice with an AI generator on talk of it

32:04.760 --> 32:07.240
I mean now that I hear that I have to

32:07.880 --> 32:12.520
Make some phone calls after this episode and talk to some pretty important people

32:13.080 --> 32:15.400
Yeah, absolutely. I don't I don't blame you

32:16.040 --> 32:18.040
Moose

32:18.040 --> 32:21.160
Is she's the one pulling the strings on this hole endeavor?

32:23.480 --> 32:28.280
I did on this on today's episode. I did say that I wanted to get to get Marieka fired and to

32:30.280 --> 32:32.760
For low the content yeah, you did

32:33.720 --> 32:38.280
That's back. Yeah, bye. Well, okay, what a back with

32:39.320 --> 32:43.400
These clips are a cat that can't be put into the bag. Yeah, absolutely the cats have a

32:43.400 --> 32:47.960
Jeffrey's made mistakes and let's move on. Let's move on from that episode

32:50.520 --> 32:53.080
Yeah, let's move on from this episode because I certainly

32:53.560 --> 33:00.920
Feel the same way. I would love to move on from this. Okay, and it feels like yeah. Yeah, so Jeffrey on review review you

33:01.880 --> 33:08.280
Actually, I will commend you for your ad reads it got to a point where people were making memes about them and I think that really speaks

33:08.680 --> 33:12.440
to how good you are as an entertainer to make something as banal as an

33:12.840 --> 33:15.960
Advertisement very interesting the cats ask as in your face

33:18.440 --> 33:26.200
But yeah, it's good. Yeah, your ad reads are so so well done, but yeah, you know when you first started you had to find your voice

33:26.200 --> 33:29.160
It is kind of weird reading an advertisement, but I think you really

33:29.720 --> 33:38.120
Struck gold and really found your footing with this one advertisement now wanting to pull up the image and once you play your ad read for the cults of America

33:38.360 --> 33:43.480
Okay, I was gonna say yeah, that I was proud that yeah, all I ever did was

33:46.680 --> 33:52.680
You know read ads for brands that have you know integrity and yeah, I mean, this is non-profit

33:53.240 --> 34:01.160
Yeah, it's no way it's real by the way that there's an organization a league and non-profit

34:01.800 --> 34:06.360
Organization that make sure that cults are fine

34:07.320 --> 34:09.320
Here's the ad

34:09.320 --> 34:17.160
This episode of review review is sponsored by the cults of America guys are you looking for something greater than yourself

34:17.720 --> 34:21.960
Come on of course you are we all are

34:22.600 --> 34:28.440
So many girls sink their teeth into religion into their career their hobbies

34:28.760 --> 34:34.600
Thinking that that's going a better explain the world around them and so it sounds like I have a gun point

34:35.560 --> 34:42.280
Any feelings about this information no, no, no, no, no, it doesn't work that way

34:44.280 --> 34:46.440
You gotta go on a little bit with Harry, and I'll just get

34:50.440 --> 34:57.320
Like minded folks who share the same feelings as you so you come out the other side with a real community

34:57.800 --> 35:03.720
This at your local cults of America chapter to learn more about the greater good and be sure to tell him Jeffrey sent you

35:04.360 --> 35:08.680
Man, I love my job now back to the show I

35:10.200 --> 35:15.640
Honestly have no new troll thing to say about this and I understand that I'm the moderator for this discussion

35:15.640 --> 35:18.360
But what the fuck is the matter with you dude?

35:18.360 --> 35:20.040
Are you kidding me also?

35:20.040 --> 35:23.880
It's not like what do you think it is like the free mason's local chapter

35:24.360 --> 35:29.560
Cults are like highly specific things in the mountains that like cut themselves off from greater society

35:29.800 --> 35:31.800
You think they're gonna be advertising

35:31.800 --> 35:34.280
You think they're gonna be like taking from experience

35:35.080 --> 35:36.040
All right

35:36.040 --> 35:40.680
You're the one who's always like don't play copyrighted music and you by the way you haven't taken the reigns or

35:41.080 --> 35:44.040
Take in your brothers, so I don't think you have a like to stand on

35:44.920 --> 35:46.920
All right

35:46.920 --> 35:51.000
Now look and you like sink into yourself and you're like all right. It's like makes me look like an asshole

35:52.360 --> 35:53.720
Yeah

35:54.040 --> 35:59.160
I mean, look, I do read that ad. This is I don't know what you're up. It is so I don't support cults

35:59.160 --> 36:04.440
Like you don't have to continuously deny these things these are just blemishes on your career

36:04.440 --> 36:06.440
That I think ultimately is

36:06.440 --> 36:07.800
Fine

36:07.800 --> 36:09.800
What

36:09.800 --> 36:14.280
The very least net benefits. Yeah. Nice. Thank you

36:15.400 --> 36:20.280
These are like you're trying to get me canceled. You're like and you don't have to deny everything's fine

36:20.760 --> 36:22.760
Yeah, everything's no it is

36:22.840 --> 36:25.160
You're saying I'm friends with trans folks. You're saying that I'm

36:25.720 --> 36:29.960
Gesting on the Joe Rogan podcast and shitting on the people that pay me

36:30.520 --> 36:33.160
You're coming for my job you're coming for my reputation

36:34.600 --> 36:38.760
And I'm not doing anything. It's you who made these decisions

36:39.480 --> 36:43.800
And I'm just just playing them back to the world and we can look we can talk about them

36:43.800 --> 36:48.440
And you can explain your side of the story. I have been and everybody's like no no you did that

36:48.520 --> 36:52.680
You just keep denying it. I think that that is why the story is to deny

36:53.640 --> 36:56.440
Right, what's next? Yeah, ultimately

36:58.040 --> 37:02.440
Thankfully that non-profit will shut down a couple weeks after that but the damage had already been done

37:03.800 --> 37:09.240
It was shut down weeks later. There was no damage done because even if somebody traveled to a coal damage to them

37:10.440 --> 37:13.240
So now you're defending the organization?

37:13.240 --> 37:17.720
Not really. I'm just saying that you kind of shut them down. Yeah. I haven't

37:18.360 --> 37:23.160
Taken anything Marieka said to heart since she started talking about rag egg

37:25.160 --> 37:29.720
Oh, it's lunch. I'm gonna go. All right. Yeah, out with one cult and in with another

37:30.280 --> 37:34.520
meaning do you guys remember when Donald Trump gave head Gamacosa in as well?

37:35.640 --> 37:39.000
No, it doesn't sound like this feels like it happened. Well, I

37:39.800 --> 37:45.320
Seems like everyone wants to deny it but I will say that this was something that I kind of lost a little bit of sleep over

37:45.400 --> 37:47.400
I couldn't eat over this

37:47.400 --> 37:49.400
I felt like I was in the right side of his

37:49.400 --> 37:51.400
Yeah, which Donald Trump was at co-sign

37:51.400 --> 37:54.440
No, you live sleep or you lost your ability

37:54.440 --> 37:58.760
Well, I did both could sleep to your famish. Yeah, I was famish. I was fasting

38:00.120 --> 38:01.640
Really, it is so

38:01.640 --> 38:04.120
But fasting is my dream

38:06.120 --> 38:12.360
Why don't we play we can just play that clip from Trump and we can just play that we can display the image well Donald Trump

38:13.000 --> 38:19.880
I just want to say I believe that head gum is comprised of real American patriots

38:20.440 --> 38:28.040
A mere blooming felt real American patriot Jeffrey James real American patriot and others

38:29.080 --> 38:31.080
Thanks you and Donald Trump

38:32.200 --> 38:34.840
And he said so what he said I'm other lean baby

38:35.560 --> 38:42.040
So we're us three and Emma in the studio. I think we're fine, but it was weird that he did

38:42.440 --> 38:44.440
This co-sign and

38:45.480 --> 38:47.480
It just left this

38:47.480 --> 38:49.480
He posted this on his ex

38:49.480 --> 38:55.080
Formerly known as Twitter. He posted this on his ex, but it didn't really have much to do with his president

38:55.080 --> 38:59.000
He said there was a photo. I don't know. I went with it. Well, it was that photo

38:59.000 --> 39:01.640
It was just a random photo of Trump. I found on the internet

39:03.480 --> 39:05.480
Are you enjoying the show

39:05.480 --> 39:09.320
Refill your popcorn. You'll love the next part. This is kind of a funny image

39:10.040 --> 39:13.400
But anyways, do you guys remember why it's kind of cool. Yeah

39:15.240 --> 39:17.240
Like a me only one is still same

39:17.960 --> 39:19.960
This is nothing

39:19.960 --> 39:25.080
You remember why he gave us that co-sign though? No, I would have assumed he heard about it on Rogan

39:25.880 --> 39:30.040
No, no, I it's smart that you would assume that but he actually didn't

39:30.920 --> 39:37.160
Amir specifically you do you remember why exactly is it because me and Jake were at the insurrection

39:37.800 --> 39:39.800
Oh

39:39.800 --> 39:47.960
Actually six actually. Yeah, so I think similar and it's funny that you do own up to it because you did post an episode entitled Jake and Amir

39:48.200 --> 39:50.200
January 6

39:50.200 --> 39:57.000
Let that clip brief speak for itself as well and Jeffrey you can show the image the thumbnail image from that episode

39:59.000 --> 40:05.320
God we were so hot that day, but on CNN you believe what a rich TV presenter tells you

40:05.800 --> 40:07.800
My god, you're right

40:09.000 --> 40:14.280
I should blindly listen to anonymous whistleblowers on the internet precisely and turning this

40:14.600 --> 40:19.480
Kudetah Kudetah wrong wheel heads roll heads will roll then sign me up

40:20.360 --> 40:24.360
Sign everyone I'm way ahead of you brother now. Let's take the pledge

40:25.240 --> 40:27.240
viewers say it with me

40:27.240 --> 40:29.240
I stand for freedom

40:29.240 --> 40:31.240
I stand for freedom

40:31.240 --> 40:33.240
I stand for freedom

40:33.720 --> 40:35.720
I

40:35.720 --> 40:37.720
Stand for freedom

40:37.720 --> 40:39.720
Enjoy our episode

40:39.720 --> 40:41.720
That was the opening

40:43.720 --> 40:50.600
Never said it was a weird tonal shift especially having a now throw at the end that was a little bit in broken English

40:51.000 --> 40:54.760
But and you start to you know as a Jake and Amir fan yourself Joel you

40:55.480 --> 41:00.760
Listen to the episode you think of this is not real this can't be real and then you hear the crudetah joke which is so fucking funny

41:01.240 --> 41:03.960
Not really classic. It's like

41:03.960 --> 41:08.680
I also say the tonal shift isn't like also it's not just point of view tone

41:08.840 --> 41:12.200
It's also like the tone of their voice is like digital and wrong

41:13.480 --> 41:18.840
I'm not a picture. I say drop something on location like this yeah pictures yassified

41:20.840 --> 41:25.080
I don't know I feel like we look like the property brothers and my jawline has never looked

41:25.080 --> 41:30.680
Yeah, your jawline credible arguably looks worse. I think Jake's jawline looks good

41:31.080 --> 41:33.560
Jake is like he's choosing that thing where he's like

41:34.920 --> 41:36.920
It looks like Tom Brady

41:40.440 --> 41:42.440
Yeah, Amir

41:42.440 --> 41:47.400
You don't have to attend is a parent that you've grown up since then and really started to become

41:48.040 --> 41:51.880
Someone who lives on the right side of history, but I wanted to know how it felt to be

41:52.600 --> 41:57.880
Someone who flew so close to the Q1 on son and came back out the other side, you know

41:58.520 --> 42:06.600
Well, I'm still in the bubble, but I'm also like down to hear other people's opinions and trying to change them from the inside out almost

42:07.160 --> 42:17.000
Okay, I can really kind of like a lone ranger in there. Yes, a vigilante. Yeah, how are you a vigilante? Why are you guys on his side?

42:17.000 --> 42:22.600
I'm not exactly like I'm just asking like he's grown you're honest. You're relaxed. You're like

42:23.480 --> 42:29.480
And you're spewing bullshit. Oh, it's that shit. I was trying to figure out what the situation is

42:30.040 --> 42:32.040
You're deciding what the situation is

42:32.840 --> 42:37.880
This was the difference. Amir's owning up to it. Yeah, Amir's on his phone

42:40.200 --> 42:44.440
Doesn't mean he's coming up to it. He's holding up to it. We're going to have the picture

42:45.080 --> 42:47.080
I took a screen grab

42:47.960 --> 42:52.360
So fucked up. What else? All right, well

42:53.880 --> 42:59.720
Now now that we've gone through that I kind of wanted to lastly play a clip from headgums darling marica

43:01.400 --> 43:06.840
Yeah, Casey Don who sent this to me anonymously after it. Okay, it's not anonymously

43:08.440 --> 43:12.680
Well, I feel I figured since I'm not getting any kind of flack if I do share his name

43:12.680 --> 43:14.680
I'm just a little to share it anyway. Yeah, okay

43:15.640 --> 43:22.040
So this was after one of your recordings and you know, Marica, you're generally kind to us on these recordings

43:23.240 --> 43:29.160
Online through text, but I think that's unrealistic to expect that you don't have any bad days and you don't

43:29.960 --> 43:31.960
Get mad at people

43:31.960 --> 43:38.760
Yeah, Casey decided that it was time to blow the whistle time was up for Marica and let's just play the first clip

43:39.720 --> 43:42.520
Solid FKC, but you're on thin ice

43:43.240 --> 43:48.200
You know how much I don't care about this F1 crap anymore, but you keep

43:48.360 --> 43:53.720
Crying about how I feel about the vagus grand prix. It's just people driving

43:53.720 --> 44:01.000
I can look out my window and see the same thing and you keep quizzing me on these racers and teams

44:01.720 --> 44:07.960
Alpha Romeo this Charles look like that you're telling me that's a real person's name

44:08.520 --> 44:10.520
The whole sport is boulder dash

44:16.760 --> 44:19.000
Jeff looks like he's making fun of Asian people

44:21.960 --> 44:29.480
He looks like the Joker, but like the cartoon version of the Joker. What's what's wrong with my face on my crying?

44:30.040 --> 44:32.040
No, you're extremely sad in this one

44:32.040 --> 44:35.560
Yeah, it's like getting that at your face. Yeah, I get that a lot

44:37.640 --> 44:39.640
Ultimately Jake is the same

44:41.560 --> 44:46.520
Ultimately I I don't think I come up too bad okay

44:48.680 --> 44:54.680
It's okay, look it's okay to hate F1 but I think you taking it out in Casey is a big big

44:54.680 --> 44:57.960
No, no, and that's where I really fucking drive big no, no, no, no, it's a big no

44:58.440 --> 45:04.040
You can't do that you can't get mad at Casey yeah, and okay, so you don't like F1 that's fine

45:04.040 --> 45:09.640
Do and but you I'm sure you like other things. Do you you post a lot on your story about

45:10.680 --> 45:14.440
Broadway shows right you sure yeah like that okay. Why don't you tell me about

45:15.240 --> 45:19.960
I'll show that you like recently and let's turn it into a review of America's

45:20.520 --> 45:26.680
Yeah, we're actually truly can't because I have to go take a call. Oh

45:27.240 --> 45:29.240
Okay, oh

45:29.240 --> 45:31.240
Sorry about that. Yeah

45:31.560 --> 45:43.000
What is funny? It's funny that you say that you like Broadway shows and yet if Jeffrey you play the second clip and how different you continue to bring up Broadway shows

45:43.560 --> 45:49.560
I have much better things to focus my time on like my crypto form and my online tutoring school

45:49.960 --> 45:56.200
Peter is dead long run the TikTok I don't know how many times I have to say it you've never said it just

45:56.200 --> 46:00.680
My talking to just don't talk in a case me Casey all right

46:01.000 --> 46:07.240
But I'm on like my crypto form long live the TikTok I don't know how many times I have to say it

46:08.440 --> 46:09.960
Just wow just

46:09.960 --> 46:13.000
I don't want to be a bug with me Casey all right

46:13.720 --> 46:17.880
Casey or the wire every time you're next the murder. Don't fuck with me. Casey

46:18.520 --> 46:20.680
All right, are you playing better from that last part out?

46:21.400 --> 46:23.400
I need a smoke like

46:24.520 --> 46:31.400
You made really yeah really really awful things and honestly like now that she can't defend herself

46:31.480 --> 46:35.560
I do feel bad for saying it but if she doesn't like Broadway musical first off

46:35.560 --> 46:39.320
She fucking lied to my face about saying she liked Broadway musicals second off

46:39.640 --> 46:44.120
If she likes crypto or she wants to talk about her tutoring school or whatever the fuck

46:44.520 --> 46:46.520
She can talk about that on her own podcast

46:50.120 --> 46:54.840
If she wants to talk about her tutoring school or whatever the fuck that's like the one good thing that she mentioned

46:55.480 --> 46:58.680
She's helping the last fortune it. Okay anyway let's just

46:59.800 --> 47:02.360
So it seems like tensions are high and I want to do

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
I

47:05.000 --> 47:11.400
It feels like there's like a lot of room for people to make missteps at this company and from a pure standpoint

47:11.800 --> 47:17.240
I think it's important that we have something ready to go in case in case one of us really makes a grave

47:17.800 --> 47:23.480
Maybe or maybe someone makes an AI deep fake of us saying something really fucking like a press release

47:24.040 --> 47:30.600
I can't even fucking imagine what that would feel like or how would that would look or it's what's happening in the last 32 minutes

47:30.760 --> 47:37.640
So deeply harmful. Yeah, so what I did was look through the archives and I think I found something that you guys haven't posted before

47:38.280 --> 47:44.040
That will really save your bacon and put you guys because put you guys back in God's good graces should someone make a mistake

47:44.360 --> 47:47.560
So now it's not even the court of public opinion. You're talking about divine intervention

47:48.120 --> 47:54.360
Yeah, it's called the cancellation antidote. Now we'll be able to press play on that MP3 Jeffrey

47:54.920 --> 47:57.960
Do you want me to show the image? Yeah, you can show that image to

48:01.560 --> 48:05.560
And we could talk through this one. It's a month

48:08.760 --> 48:12.760
Really low five 90s space music. I'm really getting chills

48:13.400 --> 48:15.400
You know, this is

48:17.400 --> 48:22.440
I think it's mixed mono. Oh my god. Yeah. This was awesome. What?

48:23.080 --> 48:27.800
So this is it. This is just the slide in the song that comes of time. Oh

48:28.600 --> 48:30.600
I like the song

48:34.840 --> 48:38.920
That's what this is it like a weird. We are the world

48:40.600 --> 48:42.600
It's not weird for sure

48:42.680 --> 48:46.120
Tell so I don't feel like I'm overextending to life

48:47.320 --> 48:49.320
The crazy

48:51.320 --> 48:57.560
It's been 30 minutes like dissecting

48:58.280 --> 49:07.720
Manusha in all of our lives and hit fake histories. Okay, and now you're making the argument that life is the greatest gift of all and that's what we should focus on

49:08.120 --> 49:13.480
You are bad at me because I happen to be sat next to a celebrity that's cancelable

49:14.040 --> 49:19.320
Now you're saying that we should just focus on the fact that life is a precious thing. I don't know why you're

49:19.960 --> 49:24.440
So against having something that will put you in God's good graces. I was like said before

49:29.080 --> 49:33.000
And I think it's also a nice good to have us ready to go

49:33.480 --> 49:36.440
I can't thank you enough for preparing this

49:41.160 --> 49:43.160
Sounds like garbage

49:43.160 --> 49:45.160
Like we've found amazing

49:46.840 --> 49:48.840
That's Jeff singing

49:50.440 --> 49:52.440
Jeff is the world

49:53.080 --> 49:54.440
All right

49:54.440 --> 49:56.440
The children

49:56.440 --> 50:00.760
I want to thank my god to sign it's take us on what you didn't do anything

50:01.400 --> 50:06.840
I think that's not kind of did save everything. Yeah, that's not I think we'll put us in good graces

50:07.400 --> 50:11.000
Thank you mom. This looks like it took you a ton of time to just like

50:12.120 --> 50:16.440
Photoshop LASO tool out from like blocks of black

50:17.320 --> 50:20.440
Well, I LASO tooled off the the head gum logo

50:22.360 --> 50:25.720
And you're not gonna respect the effort that I just asked Rika for the font

50:26.760 --> 50:30.360
You guys have a font they didn't know that I would have been so you have the decks

50:31.240 --> 50:33.240
We have the font

50:38.920 --> 50:43.080
That was funny like we got pretty far guys. I think we can confidently say

50:44.280 --> 50:47.080
It's been a minute for a reason

50:49.080 --> 50:54.360
I understand and I'm kind of felt that way or people have told me straight to my face similar things

50:54.600 --> 50:58.440
No, and all honesty people have been begging for your return and I think um

50:59.080 --> 51:03.080
I didn't appreciate this but I have the audience will okay

51:04.200 --> 51:09.160
Fan service is all all I'm about what's that? I love fan service

51:13.080 --> 51:16.360
Nothing feels like this is that would actually get class

51:20.840 --> 51:25.080
We got canceled one by one we came back and we found out that

51:26.040 --> 51:30.840
Being alive is all you need I think a lot of that was a waste of time, but why don't we

51:31.880 --> 51:33.880
Kind of take it into plugs Johnny

51:34.600 --> 51:38.600
Let's start with you. What do you have going on? What do you want to point the people towards is there pretty

51:39.560 --> 51:40.600
whack

51:40.600 --> 51:42.600
Music coming out soon

51:42.600 --> 51:48.680
Uh, yes, pretty whack is currently on the hunt for a third party contractor. There's far too much work

51:49.000 --> 51:53.080
The paperwork is insane for this company. So you're just a one-of-one company

51:53.160 --> 51:56.200
Have you like you make the paperwork you create the red tape so why is it there?

51:56.760 --> 52:01.480
Well, yeah, I'd like to give myself a challenge obviously so there's a lot of red tape. There's a lot of paperwork

52:02.280 --> 52:06.280
And uh, ultimately they're making an industry by the way because it is pretty whack industries

52:06.280 --> 52:11.480
It could just be pretty whack you as an artist but instead you create all this red tape and all this like hierarchy

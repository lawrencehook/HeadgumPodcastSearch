00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head gamma original.

00:30.000 --> 00:43.760
Why do I record just when on you says, why must I be on screen high-res?

00:43.760 --> 00:50.280
My eyes are dry, why do I try to make quizz?

00:50.280 --> 00:58.800
It's always been, I make shit that y'all hate, has me all like, I won't pull my weight.

00:58.800 --> 01:05.800
Sheel hates me, K.C. hates me, so does my son.

01:05.800 --> 01:15.800
It's hard to be me.

01:15.800 --> 01:22.800
It's hard to be me.

01:22.800 --> 01:26.800
It's not how I sound.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.800
It's not that I'm round.

01:29.800 --> 01:37.800
It's just that I'm me.

01:37.800 --> 01:44.800
Yet I'm filled with glee.

01:44.800 --> 01:51.800
And hoping y'all aren't.

01:51.800 --> 02:06.800
And even our sad, that I have had a song without charm.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.800
It's hard to be me.

02:08.800 --> 02:13.800
What have you become?

02:13.800 --> 02:14.800
What's that?

02:14.800 --> 02:16.800
Sorry, I can't hear anything.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.800
Were you singing?

02:20.800 --> 02:32.800
I thought that sounded really good, Jeff.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.800
Really?

02:34.800 --> 02:36.800
Yeah.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.800
Maybe it's not that hard to be me.

02:38.800 --> 02:43.800
That was awesome of Mike at a say.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.800
Is that a Frank Sinatra song?

02:47.800 --> 02:49.800
It had to be you or something?

02:49.800 --> 02:51.800
It's like an old standard.

02:51.800 --> 02:56.800
I think Harry Connick Jr. might have had it first.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.800
It had to be you, right?

02:59.800 --> 03:01.800
It had to be you.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.800
It's hard to be me.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.800
I don't know which song is more iconic at this point.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.800
In terms of what would we refer to it as?

03:10.800 --> 03:12.800
Yeah, it would be the first.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.800
It would be the the the Connick Sinatra joint.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.800
Yeah, but Johnny be good.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.800
Oh, my God.

03:20.800 --> 03:21.800
What's up there?

03:21.800 --> 03:22.800
It's entire cough.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.800
Oh, my God.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.800
So much of it.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.800
That was a pint.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.800
It was a pint.

03:29.800 --> 03:30.800
Yes.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.800
I was going to comment on how I was a pint last time.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.800
I think he took a huge pint last time.

03:37.800 --> 03:38.800
Oh, my God.

03:38.800 --> 03:39.800
Yeah.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.800
Which is a lot in a glass.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.800
But when it spills, it feels like a lot.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.800
It's actually devastating to lose that much coffee because he needed that.

03:46.800 --> 03:47.800
I don't know what time it is in hell.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.800
I guess it's I mean, it's noon in the light.

03:49.800 --> 03:50.800
He shouldn't need it.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.800
But he planned to be sipping that throughout the whole podcast.

03:53.800 --> 03:54.800
Exactly.

03:54.800 --> 04:00.800
And remember when you spilled that like 16 ounce coke on Ben's rug and it just felt like a lot.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.800
Because like liquid when it spills out.

04:02.800 --> 04:03.800
Just went everywhere.

04:03.800 --> 04:04.800
Yeah.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.800
I tried and that was probably that much to clean that up.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.800
And that's probably that much, right?

04:09.800 --> 04:10.800
Yeah.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.800
I mean, and it's totally directly onto the wires.

04:13.800 --> 04:17.800
Cables and the chair and it's a that's a not of wires, right?

04:17.800 --> 04:19.800
That's the nexus of the microphone.

04:19.800 --> 04:20.800
Impossibly clean wires.

04:20.800 --> 04:24.800
From there under the carpet to the body that you get.

04:24.800 --> 04:25.800
What did you even begin?

04:25.800 --> 04:27.800
It starts with a lot of paper towels.

04:27.800 --> 04:28.800
Maybe the room is so.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.800
The room is so cool.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.800
To clean the came back with.

04:32.800 --> 04:33.800
That is in.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.800
There's no way back with the new caucus.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.800
There aren't paper towels in the office.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.800
So that's it.

04:40.800 --> 04:45.800
We give up that that just needs to be soaked up by a towel.

04:45.800 --> 04:46.800
That's a full.

04:46.800 --> 04:47.800
That's going to be soaked up by the rug.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.800
The thing is about this room is also so small.

04:50.800 --> 04:51.800
So to get back there.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.800
You basically need to take the chairs and couch.

04:54.800 --> 04:55.800
It's never changed.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.800
They have no way to a deep clean right now.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.800
Essentially to clean this studio.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.800
We have to move.

05:00.800 --> 05:01.800
Yes.

05:01.800 --> 05:02.800
Yeah.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.800
There's no way we can move all the furniture and then begin to clean the things.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.800
It would take as long as the podcast would.

05:08.800 --> 05:09.800
Let's see what is come back with.

05:09.800 --> 05:10.800
What is that?

05:10.800 --> 05:11.800
Just napkins.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.800
It's hard napkins with a design.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.800
This whole thing kicked off with him singing a song.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.800
It's hard to beat me.

05:18.800 --> 05:19.800
It's failing.

05:19.800 --> 05:20.800
Those are the least absorbent.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.800
That's basically printer paper.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.800
Don't have paper towels.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.800
The all party napkins.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.800
My experience in the last minute and a half is me like scrambling.

05:29.800 --> 05:33.800
Like swinging open cabinets in the kitchen being like there has to be.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.800
There has to be no.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.800
Yeah.

05:38.800 --> 05:39.800
Luckily caught.

05:39.800 --> 05:40.800
It was a lot.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.800
It's the number one.

05:42.800 --> 05:43.800
Yeah.

05:43.800 --> 05:44.800
I mean it luckily.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.800
It's going to be covered by the.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.800
It's wires plus carpet.

05:48.800 --> 05:49.800
The table.

05:49.800 --> 05:50.800
So we're fine.

05:50.800 --> 05:51.800
He's just loose.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.800
He's not even pressing down like just to dab.

05:53.800 --> 05:54.800
He's just playing on top.

05:54.800 --> 05:55.800
Laying on top.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.800
And it's like decorative napkins which are like super.

05:58.800 --> 06:03.800
Not absorbing you know because you have to print on them.

06:03.800 --> 06:04.800
Look man.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.800
It's the week I guess.

06:07.800 --> 06:08.800
No.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.800
You're just posturing like you're cleaning it up.

06:10.800 --> 06:11.800
It's not going to do anything.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.800
That's what you would have to put down before you spilled.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.800
Sure.

06:15.800 --> 06:16.800
Like that's tarp.

06:16.800 --> 06:17.800
I almost did it.

06:17.800 --> 06:18.800
Yes.

06:18.800 --> 06:23.800
You're putting basically a wee we've had on top of an already spilled area of the rug.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.800
Oh, that's interesting.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.800
I think the biggest bummer here is that.

06:27.800 --> 06:28.800
I had a large loop through that.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.800
I was excited to enjoy and then now it's going on.

06:31.800 --> 06:32.800
That's so.

06:32.800 --> 06:33.800
Where was it from?

06:33.800 --> 06:34.800
It was that lock.

06:34.800 --> 06:35.800
It was from lock alone.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.800
The guys have that in the.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.800
I think lock alone is actually low key that the.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.800
Some of the worst coffee around.

06:41.800 --> 06:42.800
I agree.

06:42.800 --> 06:43.800
I don't like it.

06:43.800 --> 06:44.800
But sometimes too smooth.

06:44.800 --> 06:45.800
Yeah.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.800
It's not.

06:46.800 --> 06:47.800
It needs that bite.

06:47.800 --> 06:48.800
There's nothing.

06:48.800 --> 06:49.800
There's no there there.

06:49.800 --> 06:50.800
Yeah.

06:50.800 --> 06:51.800
Exactly.

06:51.800 --> 06:52.800
I think you fill it up.

06:52.800 --> 06:53.800
Is in our fridge.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.800
I don't trust that there is coffee there either.

06:56.800 --> 06:57.800
There's a lot of office.

06:57.800 --> 06:58.800
There was a paper towel.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.800
Because oftentimes we don't have paper towels.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.800
The keg is often gone.

07:03.800 --> 07:04.800
Yeah.

07:04.800 --> 07:05.800
There and it has coffee.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.800
Yeah.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.800
Um.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.800
Well, good start.

07:09.800 --> 07:10.800
Good stuff.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.800
We should say that.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.800
Yeah.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.800
I'm here.

07:14.800 --> 07:15.800
You're in town for what?

07:15.800 --> 07:17.800
New York comedy festival or something?

07:17.800 --> 07:18.800
Yeah.

07:18.800 --> 07:19.800
We have a head gym show on Monday.

07:19.800 --> 07:20.800
Yeah.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.800
So it's a lot of y'all in the studio and me in the.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.800
LA studio solo solo.

07:24.800 --> 07:25.800
Yeah.

07:25.800 --> 07:26.800
Yeah.

07:26.800 --> 07:27.800
No one to ask.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.800
Hey, are there paper towels?

07:29.800 --> 07:30.800
Hmm.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.800
So nobody knew that you'd be spilling an entire coffee today.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.800
So maybe that paper towels.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.800
I don't know if it's just like the universe trying to balance me out.

07:37.800 --> 07:41.800
Because I was writing that high of how well received the song was.

07:41.800 --> 07:42.800
And will be.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.800
I think only Mike could give you a compliment on it.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.800
Yeah, but Mike accounts for a lot of what.

07:46.800 --> 07:51.800
Honestly, we'll get to how Mike accounts for how life can be good or bad.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.800
Oh, Mike has a bell weather.

07:53.800 --> 07:54.800
It's called to worship.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.800
But actually, I don't mind.

07:57.800 --> 08:04.800
Mike is doing a show at the bell house called Mike is a bell weather.

08:04.800 --> 08:05.800
That's interesting.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.800
Yeah, I don't think it's a show at the bell house.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.800
We're doing a show at caveat.

08:10.800 --> 08:11.800
Yeah.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.800
Mike are those the Clark's wallets?

08:14.800 --> 08:15.800
Yeah, they are.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.800
I just copped a pair of the maple swayed man.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.800
Did you get the high top or the low?

08:20.800 --> 08:24.800
Yeah, the high is a little bit more wearable.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.800
A little too square for me in terms of business attire

08:27.800 --> 08:29.800
and also the way it shaped.

08:29.800 --> 08:30.800
Yeah, though.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.800
Don't get giddy when you talk to my brother.

08:33.800 --> 08:36.800
Be neutral or bad of it.

08:36.800 --> 08:39.800
What's the energy over there?

08:39.800 --> 08:43.800
Usually when people are either on the zoom with me or in the room with me.

08:43.800 --> 08:49.800
I can tell sort of a attempt for three-shirty PM on a Friday afternoon vibe.

08:49.800 --> 08:53.800
So eager to leave and tired to be.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.800
Seeger to Carl.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.800
Fuck you guys.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.800
That was good.

09:03.800 --> 09:04.800
The hard to be eating the car.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.800
The feeling the coffee bit.

09:07.800 --> 09:12.800
And all of it culminating with Seeger to Carl.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.800
I'm happy we got it on video.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.800
I'd like to see how that, how much fell in what it looked like.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.800
Yeah, I don't know if the camera picked up on the floor.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.800
Because there's not a producer here.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.800
Just the shot of you with the glass next to you.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.800
Ultimately, that we can get to the wide.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.800
Does it smell strongly of coffee?

09:31.800 --> 09:33.800
Oh, it wreaks of beans.

09:33.800 --> 09:34.800
Yeah, it's good.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.800
Do you have a wide shot?

09:37.800 --> 09:38.800
I have a wide shot.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.800
I have all I can see how it's going.

09:40.800 --> 09:41.800
And I know angles.

09:41.800 --> 09:42.800
We have it.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.800
We have it on camera for sure.

09:44.800 --> 09:45.800
Great.

09:46.800 --> 09:49.800
I kind of didn't want to talk about the lyrics, though, there.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.800
I do believe those things.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.800
It is hard to be you.

09:53.800 --> 09:54.800
It's hard to be me.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.800
You know, it's like I, you know, everyone hates you.

09:56.800 --> 09:57.800
Yeah.

09:57.800 --> 09:58.800
Oh, not everyone.

09:58.800 --> 10:03.800
It's been a human history that the top 1% of people to be.

10:03.800 --> 10:04.800
Really.

10:04.800 --> 10:08.800
Everything was billions and billions of people have it worse than you.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.800
Yeah.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.800
You were born on third base for sure.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.800
If not already on home.

10:14.800 --> 10:15.800
Right.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.800
So it's not hard to be you.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.800
Well, it's hard in terms of like the day to day.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.800
Maybe not like when we started or where.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.800
Historically, never been easier to be anybody but you.

10:24.800 --> 10:28.800
It's hard to because it's like, well, you know, because you got to like, yeah.

10:28.800 --> 10:29.800
You're not listening.

10:29.800 --> 10:30.800
Why?

10:30.800 --> 10:32.800
It's hard to get harder for everyone.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.800
Nearly everyone else in human history, but you.

10:35.800 --> 10:36.800
Right.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.800
But it's like so hard to be Casey because you make it harder on Casey.

10:39.800 --> 10:40.800
No.

10:40.800 --> 10:41.800
And I get that.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.800
I just want to say is that harder to be on you.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.800
Why do I have to record when on you says I have to.

10:46.800 --> 10:47.800
You know what I mean?

10:47.800 --> 10:53.800
Like, it gets incredible education opportunities that I was afforded and like,

10:53.800 --> 10:56.800
You know, and then you're 25 and you live in Silver Lake.

10:56.800 --> 10:57.800
Exactly right.

10:57.800 --> 11:01.800
And like, I never really had like a real job after high school.

11:01.800 --> 11:02.800
I like.

11:02.800 --> 11:03.800
Yeah.

11:03.800 --> 11:04.800
You haven't had to work hard.

11:04.800 --> 11:05.800
We and you live incredibly comfortable.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.800
Me and I'm your king made you.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.800
Should you believe that?

11:08.800 --> 11:10.800
We're king made you.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.800
Basically, W by accident.

11:12.800 --> 11:16.800
I said, watch this space slash the throne and then sat me on it.

11:16.800 --> 11:20.800
And then it's been, but four years of regret.

11:20.800 --> 11:21.800
More.

11:21.800 --> 11:22.800
The issue was the mic.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.800
I was fine before I had a show.

11:24.800 --> 11:25.800
Yeah.

11:25.800 --> 11:26.800
That's true.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.800
You didn't have a platform.

11:28.800 --> 11:29.800
Right.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.800
I had platform heels that I swapped out for Clark's Wall Obvious.

11:32.800 --> 11:33.800
This show.

11:33.800 --> 11:34.800
Maple.

11:34.800 --> 11:35.800
Yeah.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.800
I heard Emma fairly shuffle like that.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.800
Yeah, Emma's here, but she's been with us for all.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.800
Recording sessions today.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.800
So as we were all excited and tired.

11:46.800 --> 11:47.800
We are sorry.

11:47.800 --> 11:48.800
Yes.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.800
Yeah.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.800
How how the reception of the first episode go.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.800
Do you guys want to talk about that for a bit?

11:53.800 --> 11:54.800
Yeah.

11:54.800 --> 11:55.800
I think it's mostly positive.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.800
I've seen some good comments on YouTube and Twitter and stuff.

11:58.800 --> 11:59.800
Sure.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.800
What about listenership?

12:01.800 --> 12:02.800
Is it bigger than?

12:02.800 --> 12:03.800
Thank you.

12:03.800 --> 12:04.800
Why are you?

12:04.800 --> 12:05.800
Yeah.

12:05.800 --> 12:06.800
What about listenership?

12:06.800 --> 12:09.800
I think on average, this one is bigger because it's like the first one back.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.800
I'd be interested to see where we average out in the long run.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.800
But right.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.800
For now, yeah, higher.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.800
Are you worried that it's going to be like.

12:17.800 --> 12:21.800
Just cliff dive next week.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.800
80,000 impressions to what?

12:23.800 --> 12:24.800
Four.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.800
Right.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.800
That I wouldn't be worried about that.

12:27.800 --> 12:28.800
Okay.

12:28.800 --> 12:29.800
To four?

12:29.800 --> 12:30.800
No.

12:30.800 --> 12:31.800
Yeah.

12:31.800 --> 12:32.800
I don't think 40,000 or four.

12:32.800 --> 12:33.800
Right.

12:33.800 --> 12:34.800
I hear something.

12:34.800 --> 12:35.800
Yeah.

12:35.800 --> 12:36.800
Still not worried about that.

12:36.800 --> 12:37.800
Okay.

12:37.800 --> 12:38.800
No.

12:39.800 --> 12:40.800
Yeah.

12:40.800 --> 12:41.800
Spill it again.

12:41.800 --> 12:42.800
What is it?

12:42.800 --> 12:43.800
Oh.

12:43.800 --> 12:47.800
What about reception to the quality of content in terms of the sentence?

12:47.800 --> 12:48.800
Yeah.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.800
I feel like that was covered in oral censorship.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.800
How are people receiving the show?

12:53.800 --> 12:55.800
We said, people like it.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.800
And then you're drilling down on the detail.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.800
How the quality of the segment?

12:59.800 --> 13:02.800
Nobody waiting on that specific, I guess.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.800
And they definitely didn't weigh on on specifically not that either.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.800
Because other than that, there's not much to comment on.

13:06.800 --> 13:07.800
Okay.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.800
Guys, I'm not your enemy here.

13:09.800 --> 13:10.800
Right?

13:10.800 --> 13:12.800
Like I'm trying to promote your ass.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.800
I'm trying to.

13:14.800 --> 13:15.800
Your show.

13:15.800 --> 13:16.800
I'm trying to shed light on it.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.800
And also, you know, kind of interview you about it in a way.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.800
You know, it's a press drum getting almost.

13:21.800 --> 13:25.800
And you guys are coming at me like you're expecting the other shoe to drop.

13:25.800 --> 13:26.800
Yeah.

13:26.800 --> 13:27.800
No.

13:27.800 --> 13:28.800
I mean, so far you asked.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.800
I think the same question twice.

13:30.800 --> 13:31.800
But you didn't.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.800
I didn't mean to jump down your throat.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.800
You could ask more questions about it.

13:35.800 --> 13:36.800
We're happy to.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.800
Okay.

13:37.800 --> 13:38.800
So like chat.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.800
In terms of like, I don't know, like.

13:40.800 --> 13:41.800
Yeah.

13:41.800 --> 13:42.800
Exactly.

13:42.800 --> 13:43.800
Thank goodness.

13:43.800 --> 13:47.800
Of the density of laughs.

13:47.800 --> 13:48.800
Last permanent.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.800
Where do you think you landed in that?

13:51.800 --> 13:53.800
Because there was the rap for a bit.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.800
But, you know, I don't know much.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.800
You're asking us how many laughs per minute.

13:57.800 --> 13:58.800
Yeah.

13:58.800 --> 13:59.800
It's like laughs per page.

13:59.800 --> 14:00.800
You know what I mean?

14:00.800 --> 14:01.800
Like jokes per page.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.800
Like it's a numbers game ultimately of.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.800
And somebody who was too tune in week after week.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.800
I mean, don't get me started.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.800
They don't track that.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.800
But we thought people are like, no, I'm not saying.

14:13.800 --> 14:14.800
Guys.

14:14.800 --> 14:18.800
I'm not saying like statistically like tracking data.

14:18.800 --> 14:22.800
I mean, your impression of how it went.

14:22.800 --> 14:23.800
Great.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.800
It was joke dense.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.800
It was joke dense.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.800
Let's let's not argue.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.800
That was always as full of jokes.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.800
And we had a good time and it was received well.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.800
I love that.

14:35.800 --> 14:36.800
I love to hear that.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.800
That really does bring me joy.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.800
Mike, I feel like I haven't talked you in a minute.

14:42.800 --> 14:43.800
It's been a while.

14:43.800 --> 14:44.800
Yeah.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.800
Has it felt like a respite to you or have you missed me?

14:47.800 --> 14:49.800
No, I missed you.

14:49.800 --> 14:53.800
It's hard to be me.

14:53.800 --> 14:57.800
Yeah, it's good to see you.

14:58.800 --> 15:03.800
How's uh, what's the worst thing going on in your life right now?

15:03.800 --> 15:08.800
I, um, we, we're going to play Padel.

15:08.800 --> 15:09.800
Sure.

15:09.800 --> 15:10.800
Have you played?

15:10.800 --> 15:11.800
No.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.800
Is that like Roger's battle tennis?

15:13.800 --> 15:14.800
Oh, nice.

15:14.800 --> 15:15.800
But it's called Padel.

15:15.800 --> 15:16.800
It's a different sport.

15:16.800 --> 15:17.800
Okay.

15:17.800 --> 15:18.800
Slightly.

15:18.800 --> 15:19.800
Who's we AD?

15:19.800 --> 15:21.800
The three of us plus Joel.

15:21.800 --> 15:22.800
Hmm.

15:22.800 --> 15:26.800
The worst thing that happened to me is Jake backed out of the second hour of Padel.

15:26.800 --> 15:31.800
Um, because he's feeling sore from a couple of.

15:31.800 --> 15:36.800
A few and I have a flu and I got a flu and COVID vaccine yesterday.

15:36.800 --> 15:37.800
So my body's feeling sore.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.800
So I didn't feel like I could play two hours of Padel.

15:40.800 --> 15:46.800
I get, um, after Mike unilaterally made the decision yesterday to book us for two hours instead of one.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.800
Guys, save it for the courts.

15:48.800 --> 15:49.800
I mean, this is perfect.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.800
You might do a play on the same team.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.800
You hit each other the racket.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.800
Um, so the hardest thing is that Jake can't.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.800
That's a pretty good, you're in a pretty good spot.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.800
Would you say you're very joyful this year?

16:02.800 --> 16:03.800
Yeah.

16:03.800 --> 16:04.800
Things are good.

16:04.800 --> 16:05.800
What about the dog sitting?

16:05.800 --> 16:07.800
That's the dog sitting.

16:07.800 --> 16:12.800
Um, and dog sitting a puppy that has her period.

16:12.800 --> 16:15.800
It's bleeding all over my apartment.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.800
She's shedding.

16:17.800 --> 16:18.800
Is that what you said?

16:18.800 --> 16:19.800
No, she's bleeding.

16:19.800 --> 16:20.800
Oh.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.800
Well, she's shedding her coat and also her uterine lining.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.800
I can't.

16:26.800 --> 16:27.800
I don't know.

16:27.800 --> 16:28.800
Yeah.

16:28.800 --> 16:29.800
That's what it is.

16:29.800 --> 16:30.800
That's right.

16:30.800 --> 16:31.800
Good job.

16:31.800 --> 16:32.800
Even though it's like seeing if you were laughing.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.800
I assume it's the same.

16:34.800 --> 16:35.800
Jeff, I've been like this whole time.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.800
You will know if I'm laughing.

16:37.800 --> 16:38.800
This sucks.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.800
And it's really sensitive.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.800
It picks everything up.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.800
Um, how many minutes has it been?

16:45.800 --> 16:46.800
Like.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.800
I think she started.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.800
You can ask as the host of a podcast.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.800
I'm wondering if it's time for the first segment.

16:54.800 --> 16:55.800
Or if we should still just be laughing.

16:55.800 --> 16:56.800
It's time.

16:56.800 --> 16:57.800
I think it's time.

16:57.800 --> 16:58.800
It's time.

16:58.800 --> 16:59.800
I think it is time.

17:01.800 --> 17:02.800
Perfect.

17:02.800 --> 17:06.800
Episode to dive into that ye old,

17:06.800 --> 17:10.800
harkened debate of New York versus LA.

17:10.800 --> 17:11.800
Because I'm right.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.800
What's that?

17:12.800 --> 17:13.800
I tried.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.800
I said all right.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.800
I was encouraging you to move forward.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.800
Sort of dating up on me so far.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.800
People in New York kind of coming at me.

17:22.800 --> 17:26.800
I don't know if it's because I'm in LA or.

17:26.800 --> 17:30.800
Because you trash the office while we weren't there.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.800
Well, you're even going to do with those.

17:32.800 --> 17:33.800
Uh, napkins.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.800
You think you'll keep them there on the floor.

17:35.800 --> 17:36.800
So come in.

17:36.800 --> 17:37.800
They.

17:37.800 --> 17:38.800
They've been soaking.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.800
You can't really tell me.

17:39.800 --> 17:40.800
They look bone dry.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.800
You didn't step on them till like sort of.

17:42.800 --> 17:43.800
You know when you spell something on a carpet.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.800
Yes, well, I'm just done in step on it.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.800
She was a dab, not wrong.

17:48.800 --> 17:49.800
I didn't.

17:49.800 --> 17:50.800
I didn't.

17:50.800 --> 17:51.800
Guys.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.800
Let's get into the debate.

17:55.800 --> 17:56.800
All right.

17:56.800 --> 17:57.800
Okay.

17:57.800 --> 17:58.800
New York versus LA.

17:58.800 --> 17:59.800
Y'all are in New York.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.800
Is that fair to say?

18:01.800 --> 18:02.800
Yeah.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.800
You said let's get into the debate.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.800
So let's get into the debate.

18:06.800 --> 18:10.800
You're still clear if you're anything new or is it just an open concept.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.800
We'll talk about the things people always say about.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.800
It's an open dialogue.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.800
Our pinch pointed fucking debate points here.

18:17.800 --> 18:18.800
Go on.

18:18.800 --> 18:19.800
What is traffic for New York?

18:19.800 --> 18:20.800
Yes.

18:20.800 --> 18:21.800
Of course.

18:21.800 --> 18:26.800
But I'm going to play devil's advocate because it's a debate.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.800
So traffic.

18:28.800 --> 18:29.800
And it's worse where.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.800
That's what we have to figure out.

18:32.800 --> 18:37.800
I'm going to say LA because there's not really public transport.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.800
There is, but it's not ideal.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.800
And even if you take the bus here in the traffic.

18:41.800 --> 18:42.800
If you're New York.

18:42.800 --> 18:43.800
Yeah.

18:43.800 --> 18:44.800
There's traffic.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.800
But it's driving like a nobody.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.800
If you're not in the U.S.

18:48.800 --> 18:53.800
You're not in the car.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.800
The worst.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.800
Do you want to have a debate or do you want to just yell at us?

18:56.800 --> 19:04.800
The worst I've seen or experienced has been the L stopping at 330 in the morning for maintenance.

19:04.800 --> 19:10.800
And then I have to go upstairs to the street level and take a lift back to AJ and Johnny's house.

19:10.800 --> 19:11.800
Yeah.

19:11.800 --> 19:12.800
Which isn't bad because at that point.

19:12.800 --> 19:13.800
No traffic.

19:13.800 --> 19:14.800
Exactly.

19:14.800 --> 19:15.800
Yeah.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.800
And I'm already in Williamsburg and I only have to get out to Ridgewood.

19:17.800 --> 19:18.800
Right.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.800
Seems like the hardest is getting to the airport.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.800
Seems like the hardest for PM flight.

19:22.800 --> 19:23.800
Yeah.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.800
It's being you.

19:24.800 --> 19:25.800
Is that what you're going to say?

19:25.800 --> 19:27.800
Well, I was going to say, yeah.

19:27.800 --> 19:28.800
It's hard to be me.

19:28.800 --> 19:29.800
Yeah.

19:29.800 --> 19:30.800
But that's not related to the city.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.800
So that's why I stopped myself sort of self edited.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.800
Um, Micah traffic.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.800
Yeah.

19:35.800 --> 19:36.800
I think, um.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.800
There's a lot of traffic.

19:38.800 --> 19:39.800
Car traffic.

19:39.800 --> 19:40.800
Sure.

19:40.800 --> 19:41.800
There's a lot of car traffic in New York.

19:41.800 --> 19:42.300
Definitely.

19:42.300 --> 19:45.300
But I think it's justified because the city is so dense.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.300
Yeah.

19:46.300 --> 19:51.300
In LA, it seems more like this traffic because the city's so poorly organized.

19:51.300 --> 19:52.300
Thank you.

19:52.300 --> 19:53.300
You know.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.300
Thank you for saying that.

19:54.300 --> 19:55.300
Is that fair?

19:55.300 --> 19:56.300
That is fair.

19:56.300 --> 20:00.300
And that way, I didn't have to say it because I'm so worried in this segment that it

20:00.300 --> 20:03.300
Amir's going to fucking blow up at me because I know he loves LA because he grew up in LA.

20:03.300 --> 20:05.300
What born and raised?

20:05.300 --> 20:08.300
I mean, I understand that traffic is hard.

20:08.300 --> 20:09.300
Yeah.

20:09.300 --> 20:10.300
I'm not mad at you saying that.

20:10.300 --> 20:11.300
Okay.

20:11.300 --> 20:15.300
Moving on to quality of dash slash ass.

20:15.300 --> 20:16.300
Yeah.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.300
That's an interesting question.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.300
What were the two words?

20:19.300 --> 20:20.300
dash slash.

20:20.300 --> 20:21.300
Sash.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.300
Gash.

20:22.300 --> 20:23.300
Gash.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.300
Sash.

20:24.300 --> 20:28.300
It's really that you never messed up because it's always an essay.

20:28.300 --> 20:29.300
Yeah.

20:29.300 --> 20:32.300
When he asked you what the words were, you messed up several additional times.

20:32.300 --> 20:33.300
And it's never.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.300
It's never the S.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.300
It's always S.H.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.300
Yeah.

20:36.300 --> 20:37.300
It shouldn't trip you up.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.300
Okay.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.300
Anyone else that?

20:40.300 --> 20:41.300
I'm not going to let the word.

20:41.300 --> 20:42.300
I said that.

20:42.300 --> 20:43.300
That's the answer.

20:43.300 --> 20:44.300
That's.

20:44.300 --> 20:45.300
Ash.

20:45.300 --> 20:46.300
S or Ash.

20:46.300 --> 20:47.300
Ash.

20:47.300 --> 20:48.300
Gash.

20:48.300 --> 20:49.300
I thought he was saying so.

20:49.300 --> 20:50.300
Like which which.

20:50.300 --> 20:51.300
She's a scraze.

20:51.300 --> 20:52.300
That was so well.

20:52.300 --> 20:55.300
Which city has better quality.

20:55.300 --> 20:56.300
Oh.

20:56.300 --> 20:57.300
These actual partners.

20:57.300 --> 20:58.300
Exactly.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.300
Who's hotter, New York Railways?

20:59.300 --> 21:01.300
But are you saying slash ass or Ash?

21:01.300 --> 21:02.300
Ash.

21:02.300 --> 21:03.300
But it spelled.

21:03.300 --> 21:04.300
I got it.

21:04.300 --> 21:05.300
Are we not accurate?

21:05.300 --> 21:06.300
I'm not accurate.

21:06.300 --> 21:07.300
Personality.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.300
Yeah.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.580
I think New York wins.

21:10.580 --> 21:11.940
New York for sure.

21:11.940 --> 21:12.740
Yeah.

21:12.740 --> 21:14.540
That seemed like an insult towards New York

21:14.540 --> 21:16.660
because you had to specify personality, though.

21:16.660 --> 21:19.300
Well, I mean, it's a toss-up if you're not.

21:19.300 --> 21:22.580
If it just looks, I think if it's just look-

21:22.580 --> 21:23.580
I think if it's just-

21:23.580 --> 21:24.580
I think if it's just-

21:24.580 --> 21:26.820
Yeah, Newton, New York, New Yorkers are hotter.

21:26.820 --> 21:27.860
I think they're hotter.

21:27.860 --> 21:29.780
And I don't know if it's just that you're on the subway

21:29.780 --> 21:31.420
and you're seeing everybody that's attractive

21:31.420 --> 21:33.100
or if you're versus, you know,

21:33.100 --> 21:36.620
you're just seeing you and your rear view mirror,

21:37.100 --> 21:39.020
or what.

21:39.020 --> 21:40.700
But I do think that I'm like in New York

21:40.700 --> 21:42.860
and I'm always like, oh, wow, everybody's hot.

21:42.860 --> 21:45.300
And then I know that I'm like, everybody's trying to be hot.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.260
But they're actually not.

21:47.260 --> 21:47.900
Interesting.

21:47.900 --> 21:49.300
I feel like when I went to that bar with you,

21:49.300 --> 21:50.780
there's a lot of hot people there.

21:50.780 --> 21:52.460
Which bar?

21:52.460 --> 21:54.540
Uh, the Zebulon?

21:54.540 --> 21:56.140
Yeah.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.900
Do we have the Zebulon people show out?

21:57.900 --> 21:59.340
But it still is so-

21:59.340 --> 22:01.580
There's an air of desperation.

22:01.580 --> 22:02.380
Mm-hmm.

22:02.380 --> 22:04.460
New York. I mean, that's very LA in general.

22:04.460 --> 22:04.940
For sure.

22:04.940 --> 22:05.740
It's a desperate city.

22:05.820 --> 22:06.860
It's a desperate city.

22:06.860 --> 22:09.140
That's why I've calmed into what I am today,

22:09.140 --> 22:13.220
which is sort of like a Zen version of myself.

22:13.220 --> 22:15.780
Where it's like, I don't, I could take or leave anything.

22:15.780 --> 22:17.900
Like, ask me if I care about something.

22:17.900 --> 22:18.980
It seems like you hold a grudge.

22:18.980 --> 22:21.180
You named three or four people that hate you

22:21.180 --> 22:22.380
and you're song up top.

22:22.380 --> 22:24.700
And that's only, that's three of many.

22:24.700 --> 22:25.540
Yeah.

22:25.540 --> 22:27.020
That I could explain things effect you.

22:27.020 --> 22:30.180
Chambers hasn't returned any of my calls.

22:30.180 --> 22:30.380
Right.

22:30.380 --> 22:31.820
Chambers are ahead of sales.

22:31.820 --> 22:33.620
Yeah.

22:33.620 --> 22:34.820
Can't leave you have a number.

22:34.820 --> 22:37.660
Angie moved to Ventura because of me.

22:37.660 --> 22:41.060
I've fucked up as that.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.780
That's really messed up.

22:42.780 --> 22:44.020
That's so far away.

22:44.020 --> 22:45.380
Moving on to affordability.

22:47.780 --> 22:49.020
L.A. I think.

22:51.020 --> 22:52.340
Oh, they're both very expensive.

22:52.340 --> 22:53.180
See me.

22:53.180 --> 22:54.020
Yeah.

22:54.020 --> 22:54.660
Especially since COVID.

22:54.660 --> 22:56.340
The day-to-day expenses, though,

22:56.340 --> 22:57.220
when I lived in New York,

22:57.220 --> 23:00.140
were far exceeded the day-to-day expenses of L.A.

23:00.140 --> 23:02.460
Also rent is like $400 cheaper

23:02.460 --> 23:03.300
for what you get.

23:03.300 --> 23:04.300
I think in New York.

23:05.060 --> 23:06.380
Yeah, I think rent, no.

23:06.380 --> 23:08.060
I think rent's more expensive in New York.

23:08.060 --> 23:09.220
Yeah.

23:09.220 --> 23:09.580
Yeah.

23:09.580 --> 23:10.740
That's what I meant to say.

23:10.740 --> 23:11.100
Yeah.

23:11.100 --> 23:11.620
OK.

23:11.620 --> 23:14.540
Have you looked at like one bedroom apartments in New York?

23:14.540 --> 23:15.740
Of course.

23:15.740 --> 23:18.580
There's a perfect one on Manhattan Ave.

23:18.580 --> 23:20.540
Greenpoint, Prime Greenpoint.

23:20.540 --> 23:21.940
How do you $3,500 a month?

23:21.940 --> 23:22.780
$24,500 a month.

23:22.780 --> 23:23.780
But that's a studio.

23:23.780 --> 23:25.580
It's like the equivalence of what I have here.

23:25.580 --> 23:25.940
Yeah.

23:25.940 --> 23:27.940
$800 more per month.

23:27.940 --> 23:28.620
Yeah.

23:28.620 --> 23:31.620
If you want a one bedroom, I don't think you can find one

23:31.620 --> 23:33.540
in Williamsburg, Greenpoint, under three.

23:33.540 --> 23:34.540
That's crazy.

23:34.940 --> 23:37.580
I live in a one bedroom in the East Village for $22.

23:37.580 --> 23:38.100
Wow.

23:38.100 --> 23:38.620
Yeah.

23:38.620 --> 23:41.020
And Manhattan is cheaper than Brooklyn, right?

23:41.020 --> 23:41.820
I guess maybe that's why.

23:41.820 --> 23:42.420
Yeah.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.180
There you go.

23:44.180 --> 23:48.740
Which city has better century eggs?

23:48.740 --> 23:50.860
I was a century egg.

23:50.860 --> 23:53.020
Century eggs is like a fermented duck egg

23:53.020 --> 23:55.380
in, uh, who don't cuisine?

23:55.380 --> 23:56.780
Probably New York.

23:56.780 --> 23:58.140
I think New York.

23:58.140 --> 24:00.780
Because I haven't found good Chinese food in L.A.

24:00.780 --> 24:01.980
Yeah.

24:01.980 --> 24:03.420
Well, it's unlike the San Gabriel Valley,

24:03.420 --> 24:04.860
you include that as L.A.

24:04.860 --> 24:05.220
Yeah.

24:05.220 --> 24:06.020
I just haven't made it up.

24:06.020 --> 24:06.220
Sorry.

24:06.220 --> 24:07.220
Yep.

24:07.220 --> 24:08.380
I don't think you can.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.980
I don't think you can include like something

24:10.980 --> 24:14.540
in Los Angeles counties as L.A.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.580
Like does the New York have good grass?

24:16.580 --> 24:17.020
No.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.700
But what if you count the Hudson Valley?

24:19.700 --> 24:21.700
That's cheating, I'm here.

24:21.700 --> 24:23.540
Or kind of like Brooklyn and New York.

24:23.540 --> 24:24.060
Yeah.

24:24.060 --> 24:24.260
Yeah.

24:24.260 --> 24:24.980
Maybe prosper.

24:24.980 --> 24:25.980
That's part of the, yeah.

24:28.980 --> 24:29.980
Emma.

24:29.980 --> 24:31.540
Have you had a century egg?

24:32.060 --> 24:35.660
I don't know what that means.

24:35.660 --> 24:36.940
Okay, I'm moving on to climate.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.300
It's got to be New York, right?

24:41.500 --> 24:43.020
Yeah, I mean, I think it's New York.

24:43.020 --> 24:44.340
I like I enjoy the season.

24:44.340 --> 24:46.940
It's though I will say it's getting cold right now

24:46.940 --> 24:48.900
and I'm not happy about your pissed.

24:48.900 --> 24:49.820
Yeah.

24:49.820 --> 24:51.020
I'm cold over it.

24:51.020 --> 24:51.380
Yes.

24:51.380 --> 24:52.180
I'm chilly.

24:52.180 --> 24:55.980
It's and has been a rougher transition this year

24:55.980 --> 24:57.020
than years previous.

24:57.020 --> 24:57.860
100%.

24:57.860 --> 25:00.140
You're cold open of it.

25:00.140 --> 25:00.980
Nice.

25:00.980 --> 25:03.420
Because it's yeah, the beginning of winter.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.060
Yeah, but climate is actually,

25:05.060 --> 25:07.140
LA is on fire half the year.

25:07.140 --> 25:07.980
Yeah.

25:07.980 --> 25:11.060
You're dealing with mudslides earthquakes

25:11.060 --> 25:12.820
drought then also flooding.

25:12.820 --> 25:15.620
So I think doom at literally any second.

25:15.620 --> 25:17.540
Still just waiting for the big one to hit.

25:17.540 --> 25:19.460
We should die any minute now.

25:19.460 --> 25:20.300
Yeah.

25:20.300 --> 25:22.580
I, yeah, you're 100 years past too

25:22.580 --> 25:25.700
for your catastrophic earthquake.

25:25.700 --> 25:26.540
Yeah.

25:26.540 --> 25:28.740
So yeah, let's say LA's worse climate wise.

25:28.740 --> 25:29.580
Yeah.

25:29.740 --> 25:31.140
So it will be getting worse.

25:31.140 --> 25:34.540
New York will be getting kind maybe not better,

25:34.540 --> 25:36.060
but it'll be different problems.

25:36.060 --> 25:40.380
So will be Miami by the time my daughter's in college.

25:40.380 --> 25:42.100
It'll be so heat.

25:42.100 --> 25:42.780
Yes.

25:42.780 --> 25:43.940
It's good.

25:43.940 --> 25:45.260
Um,

25:45.260 --> 25:47.100
Micah, climate.

25:47.100 --> 25:48.580
Yeah.

25:48.580 --> 25:53.180
I think New York is like immune to whatever

25:53.180 --> 25:54.220
the climate is doing.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.140
If it's snowing, if it's raining,

25:56.140 --> 25:57.620
if it's sunny, if it's cloudy,

25:57.620 --> 25:59.300
it doesn't matter New York is awesome.

26:00.180 --> 26:00.860
For sure.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.460
Uh, what about ease of retreat?

26:04.700 --> 26:06.140
How many of you have, by the way?

26:06.140 --> 26:07.940
This is one of our training.

26:07.940 --> 26:11.820
Has to be New York because there's a lot of,

26:11.820 --> 26:13.340
you can go,

26:13.340 --> 26:16.220
there's a lot of different exit points

26:16.220 --> 26:20.020
from the city and LA.

26:20.020 --> 26:21.700
We already talked about the traffic.

26:21.700 --> 26:24.260
You know, I was trying to get to Palm Springs on a Friday night

26:24.260 --> 26:26.820
and took me almost two and a half, three hours.

26:26.820 --> 26:28.220
I want to go to Portland tomorrow.

26:28.220 --> 26:29.060
Go apple picking.

26:29.060 --> 26:31.740
It's going to take me in a whole last day.

26:31.740 --> 26:32.740
Oakland?

26:32.740 --> 26:33.540
Oh, go go go.

26:33.540 --> 26:34.700
America.

26:34.700 --> 26:36.340
Oh, Oakland.

26:36.340 --> 26:37.860
Got it.

26:37.860 --> 26:43.500
My own body, my own body, breathe.

26:43.500 --> 26:44.460
Infrastructure.

26:44.460 --> 26:46.220
Let's talk about it.

26:46.220 --> 26:47.060
Meaning.

26:47.060 --> 26:48.460
Equal, I think.

26:48.460 --> 26:49.300
They're both pretty good.

26:49.300 --> 26:50.380
Yeah, you don't really know

26:50.380 --> 26:52.820
because you don't know where it means really.

26:52.820 --> 26:53.940
What do you mean by fine?

26:53.940 --> 26:55.540
The bridges are okay.

26:55.540 --> 26:57.100
Uh-huh.

26:57.140 --> 26:59.380
Public public transport, though.

26:59.380 --> 27:00.220
All right, New York.

27:00.220 --> 27:03.140
We're going to have to go New York city work, city parks.

27:03.140 --> 27:04.060
Right?

27:04.060 --> 27:05.660
Have you had a century egg?

27:05.660 --> 27:07.820
I've never tried the century egg.

27:07.820 --> 27:08.780
I've never really had the,

27:08.780 --> 27:10.300
because I'm always just like,

27:10.300 --> 27:12.620
I'd rather have the general sales.

27:12.620 --> 27:13.460
All right.

27:13.460 --> 27:16.180
Now, maybe ask them to show over cook some fried rice.

27:16.180 --> 27:17.860
Yeah, a char.

27:17.860 --> 27:18.980
Piece of rind.

27:20.300 --> 27:21.140
What is that?

27:21.140 --> 27:24.660
It means how easy can you get fruit on the street.

27:25.660 --> 27:27.860
LA takes the cake for sure.

27:29.460 --> 27:29.980
I don't know.

27:29.980 --> 27:31.460
I think New York actually does.

27:31.460 --> 27:34.460
I best several fruit stands on my way home from work.

27:34.460 --> 27:35.220
Really?

27:35.220 --> 27:37.420
LA, your, your only fruit stands.

27:37.420 --> 27:38.780
You can get your driving.

27:38.780 --> 27:40.300
You have to, I kind of pull over.

27:40.300 --> 27:40.820
Yeah.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.620
But there's the one on, there's the one on Benton,

27:42.620 --> 27:43.620
near the 101.

27:43.620 --> 27:44.900
I can't think of another one.

27:44.900 --> 27:46.820
I called the city on that one.

27:46.820 --> 27:48.740
The fruit can be, I should have moved down.

27:48.740 --> 27:49.940
Yeah.

27:49.940 --> 27:51.140
Right.

27:51.140 --> 27:52.820
That sucks of you.

27:52.820 --> 27:54.100
Yeah.

27:54.260 --> 27:54.940
Tax rates.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.860
My own bond.

27:56.860 --> 27:58.540
LA's better.

27:58.540 --> 27:59.380
Is it?

27:59.380 --> 28:00.700
Yep.

28:00.700 --> 28:01.540
Okay.

28:01.540 --> 28:02.380
She's like that.

28:02.380 --> 28:03.900
That was the first one that was quantifiable.

28:03.900 --> 28:05.900
Everything else so far has been increased.

28:05.900 --> 28:07.260
That's why it's a debate.

28:08.380 --> 28:09.220
That's why it's a debate.

28:09.220 --> 28:10.060
That's why it's a debate.

28:10.060 --> 28:10.900
That's why it's a debate.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.820
If Marika brought this segment in,

28:12.820 --> 28:13.980
you guys would be like, yeah,

28:13.980 --> 28:14.820
let's really get into it.

28:14.820 --> 28:15.660
That's really interesting.

28:15.660 --> 28:16.500
Marika instead.

28:16.500 --> 28:17.780
If it is a debate,

28:17.780 --> 28:19.980
you would agree with everything that we said.

28:19.980 --> 28:21.140
Because I'm always the answer to it.

28:21.140 --> 28:22.140
I'm conflictive.

28:22.140 --> 28:23.300
I'm conflictive.

28:23.780 --> 28:25.660
You're playing Angel's best friend.

28:25.660 --> 28:27.180
I already sang a verse,

28:27.180 --> 28:28.460
so I'm conflictive it.

28:31.740 --> 28:33.460
That's the commercial point, right?

28:35.460 --> 28:36.460
We will be right back,

28:36.460 --> 28:38.660
but we're not gonna leave this segment.

28:38.660 --> 28:41.060
We've got a lot of our points to get to.

28:41.060 --> 28:43.620
This show is sponsored by BetterHelp, guys.

28:44.740 --> 28:48.180
You ever feel a little off about the end of your season, right?

28:48.180 --> 28:50.540
Do you ever not look forward to the holidays?

28:50.540 --> 28:53.020
Maybe you struggle with seasonal blues?

28:53.100 --> 28:57.180
Maybe the sun's setting at 5.55 each day

28:57.180 --> 28:59.100
and only getting darker from here

28:59.100 --> 29:01.780
until December 21st.

29:01.780 --> 29:04.900
Or 22nd, I can't remember which.

29:04.900 --> 29:07.340
Maybe makes you sad.

29:07.340 --> 29:09.140
Whether that's seasonal effective disorder

29:09.140 --> 29:10.820
or just the emotion.

29:10.820 --> 29:13.100
Well, either way, in any case,

29:13.100 --> 29:15.100
this time of year can be a lot

29:15.100 --> 29:17.100
and it's natural to feel some sadness

29:17.100 --> 29:18.820
or anxiety about it.

29:18.820 --> 29:21.740
But adding something new and positive to your life

29:21.740 --> 29:24.340
can counteract some of those feelings.

29:24.340 --> 29:26.740
And therapy can be that bright spot,

29:26.740 --> 29:28.740
amid all the stress and change.

29:28.740 --> 29:31.900
Something to look forward to to make you feel grounded

29:31.900 --> 29:36.420
and to give you the tools to manage everything going on, right?

29:36.420 --> 29:40.580
I've actually up to my therapy to twice a week, fortunately,

29:40.580 --> 29:44.540
because of the darker times, both outside,

29:44.540 --> 29:47.580
my window and also inside my mind's eye.

29:47.580 --> 29:49.220
And I'm better fitting from it.

29:49.220 --> 29:51.340
So if you're thinking of starting therapy,

29:51.340 --> 29:52.580
give better help a try.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.820
was like in the 2000s?

30:18.820 --> 30:23.820
Have you had a hard time finding new or curated music?

30:23.820 --> 30:25.660
Are you interested in multiple perspectives

in their honest segments, and relationship hot take conversations

Each week you'll leave with some new music recommendations

30:59.980 --> 31:02.500
or a curated playlist that you didn't even know

31:02.500 --> 31:05.300
you needed in their freshly squeezed music segment.

31:05.300 --> 31:08.500
Most recently, the ladies have sat down with mooney long,

31:08.500 --> 31:10.420
Chloe Bailey and Derey McKesson.

31:10.420 --> 31:13.180

Check it out.

31:28.620 --> 31:29.460
And we're back.

31:29.460 --> 31:33.020
Let's talk about sand or not.

31:34.020 --> 31:35.220
You suck, man.

31:36.580 --> 31:38.220
You made me deaf.

31:38.220 --> 31:40.580
And then the first thing I hear back,

31:40.580 --> 31:42.020
sand or not.

31:43.380 --> 31:46.260
How do we, how do we debate that?

31:46.260 --> 31:49.220
Are there beaches or not?

31:49.220 --> 31:52.060
There's beaches in both places.

31:52.060 --> 31:54.980
Better beaches in LA.

31:54.980 --> 31:57.860
Yeah, according to the better beaches bureau.

31:57.860 --> 31:59.420
I agree.

31:59.420 --> 32:00.260
I agree.

32:00.260 --> 32:01.100
Get to.

32:01.100 --> 32:01.940
Here's the thing.

32:01.940 --> 32:03.500
I do really want to move to New York.

32:03.500 --> 32:06.260
I don't think I should yet.

32:06.260 --> 32:07.180
We talked about the waiting.

32:07.180 --> 32:08.180
Why yet?

32:08.180 --> 32:11.140
I want to make a ton of money doing what I love in my career.

32:11.140 --> 32:11.820
And then I'm okay.

32:11.820 --> 32:14.220
So you'll never move to New York.

32:14.220 --> 32:15.060
Yeah.

32:15.060 --> 32:16.660
It's better when you're dirt poor

32:16.660 --> 32:18.860
because you don't mind all the inconveniences.

32:18.860 --> 32:22.020
And like, what about the conveniences of the Penns?

32:22.020 --> 32:24.540
Yeah, you have to be so rich to be rich in New York.

32:24.540 --> 32:25.420
How rich do you have to have?

32:25.420 --> 32:26.980
How much money do you think you have to have?

32:26.980 --> 32:27.540
$1,000,000.

32:27.540 --> 32:29.620
Probably like five million dollars.

32:29.620 --> 32:31.420
You have to have five million dollars.

32:31.420 --> 32:33.420
You can't have fun in New York without five million dollars.

32:33.420 --> 32:35.260
You can't have a lot of fun.

32:35.260 --> 32:38.500
But if you want to be rich and live like a baller lifestyle

32:38.500 --> 32:41.100
and like have a cool house and a car and like,

32:41.100 --> 32:42.420
you know, eat wherever you want.

32:42.420 --> 32:44.660
It's a lot, a lot more expensive here.

32:45.300 --> 32:47.660
I feel like Micah lives the perfect life in New York

32:47.660 --> 32:49.820
though and he doesn't have five million dollars.

32:49.820 --> 32:51.460
No.

32:51.460 --> 32:52.820
Micah?

32:52.820 --> 32:55.660
I don't, well, didn't you say like to ball out?

32:55.660 --> 32:56.540
Yeah, you said you want to.

32:56.540 --> 32:57.900
You said you wanted to be rich.

32:57.900 --> 33:00.540
Yeah, I don't, I'm not rich.

33:00.540 --> 33:01.380
Okay, so you have what?

33:01.380 --> 33:02.540
Like three and a half or four million dollars.

33:02.540 --> 33:03.180
That's a lot.

33:03.180 --> 33:04.180
That's a lot.

33:04.180 --> 33:05.180
That's a lot.

33:05.180 --> 33:06.180
He can't ball out.

33:06.180 --> 33:07.180
He can't ball out.

33:07.180 --> 33:08.180
Not on three and a half.

33:08.180 --> 33:09.380
But yeah.

33:09.380 --> 33:11.300
All right, well, yeah, let me make five million dollars

33:11.300 --> 33:12.740
and then I'll move to New York.

33:12.740 --> 33:13.980
I think you can do it.

33:13.980 --> 33:17.500
You shouldn't tie it to any kind of benchmark.

33:17.500 --> 33:17.860
Right.

33:17.860 --> 33:19.860
Because then you'll keep on moving the goal post.

33:19.860 --> 33:21.260
You ought to just move out here.

33:21.260 --> 33:23.020
It should be in your 20s I would think.

33:23.020 --> 33:24.540
Yeah, the younger the better.

33:24.540 --> 33:25.780
Yeah, really?

33:25.780 --> 33:27.220
And now you have a significant other.

33:27.220 --> 33:29.060
It's actually cheaper than ever to move here.

33:29.060 --> 33:30.820
You couldn't have done it when you were single

33:30.820 --> 33:34.660
because you'd have to spend three grand to live in a studio.

33:34.660 --> 33:38.220
But now you can split that with a loved one or a lover.

33:38.220 --> 33:39.340
I thought you were going to say he,

33:39.340 --> 33:41.420
because he would be just pouring money out

33:41.500 --> 33:42.820
and trying to get it to date.

33:42.820 --> 33:43.780
Yeah, that's it.

33:43.780 --> 33:45.100
Now it's cheaper to do that.

33:45.100 --> 33:46.860
See, like, what are those kinds of quips?

33:46.860 --> 33:48.700
Like no one would ever say that to Micah.

33:48.700 --> 33:50.380
But then, like, I'm going to, like,

33:50.380 --> 33:53.500
he loses at me and I came and see you're on the camera.

33:53.500 --> 33:54.980
Yeah.

33:54.980 --> 33:56.100
Sorry.

33:56.100 --> 33:59.420
They all need about he's half ass, sorry.

33:59.420 --> 34:00.460
Sand or not.

34:00.460 --> 34:02.620
I brought that up though to be like,

34:02.620 --> 34:04.180
the one time that I'm in LA

34:04.180 --> 34:06.660
and I'm like, there's no place like this in the world

34:06.660 --> 34:08.460
is when I'm at the beach.

34:08.900 --> 34:12.380
Yeah, there's no else in the world of beaches.

34:12.380 --> 34:15.260
Well, no, I mean, he's right.

34:15.260 --> 34:17.660
He's, there are places with beaches,

34:17.660 --> 34:22.620
but where you can like, you know, have your job career be on your tap.

34:22.620 --> 34:24.780
Uh, yeah, excuse me.

34:24.780 --> 34:26.380
I'm trying to defend you, man.

34:26.380 --> 34:29.820
I'm like, if you're trying to be on the ground right now,

34:29.820 --> 34:32.780
right or actor, he's like, he's living in the best possible place

34:32.780 --> 34:37.220
for him career wise and also enjoying nature in that way.

34:37.220 --> 34:38.060
Sand, yeah.

34:38.060 --> 34:42.100
Sand being a tiny rock, so I think it's like Rick Mankin.

34:42.100 --> 34:43.780
That's a great year.

34:43.780 --> 34:44.940
I'm coming.

34:44.940 --> 34:45.740
I'm coming.

34:45.740 --> 34:46.580
I'm coming.

34:46.580 --> 34:47.860
Landmarks.

34:47.860 --> 34:48.740
Or not.

34:48.740 --> 34:49.740
Or not.

34:49.740 --> 34:51.460
It's got to be New York.

34:51.460 --> 34:53.380
I mean, we work right around the corner

34:53.380 --> 34:55.580
from Teddy Roosevelt's birthplace.

34:55.580 --> 34:56.780
You literally Teddy.

34:56.780 --> 34:57.940
Yeah.

34:57.940 --> 34:58.780
I'm all in LA.

34:58.780 --> 35:02.740
You could just find where a fucking triple X movie salon

35:02.740 --> 35:05.340
that Richard Nixon got caught cranking it.

35:05.340 --> 35:06.180
Yeah.

35:06.180 --> 35:09.300
There's still the after birth at the Teddy Roosevelt House

35:09.300 --> 35:10.620
on the floor.

35:10.620 --> 35:11.820
It refused to clean it up.

35:11.820 --> 35:12.660
Yeah.

35:12.660 --> 35:16.540
I found the iconic landmarks in the LA to be just very strange.

35:16.540 --> 35:17.900
Like the Hollywood sign was just like,

35:17.900 --> 35:22.980
and it was like a makeshift billboard for like a gated community.

35:22.980 --> 35:26.780
And then yeah, like, I guess the grip of the observatory is cool.

35:26.780 --> 35:28.700
But the James Dean statue.

35:28.700 --> 35:29.860
Yeah, why?

35:29.860 --> 35:34.980
And then like the lamp post art thing at Lachmys Fine.

35:34.980 --> 35:39.260
And yeah, the playboy mansion is like a house that was built to look

35:39.260 --> 35:41.500
100 years older than it actually is.

35:41.500 --> 35:42.820
Meanwhile in like,

35:42.820 --> 35:47.100
Rye and Bedford, New York, every single house next to each other

35:47.100 --> 35:49.420
is bigger and better than the playboy mansion.

35:49.420 --> 35:51.140
Yeah, there's more history out here.

35:51.140 --> 35:51.980
Exactly right.

35:51.980 --> 35:52.820
It's an older city.

35:52.820 --> 35:56.540
There's never been an oil barion to live in Los Angeles.

35:56.540 --> 35:58.620
Uh, uh,

35:59.620 --> 36:02.220
the stuff isn't uninteresting if you engage.

36:02.220 --> 36:03.620
Let's just move on to a preview.

36:04.620 --> 36:05.900
Appreciating value.

36:08.260 --> 36:11.140
That was double on Tondra slash edge sword.

36:11.140 --> 36:12.140
Basically.

36:13.780 --> 36:17.620
Yeah, the city is the, are the property values appreciating.

36:17.620 --> 36:23.220
And then also is the city's value appreciating in the eyes of the younger generations

36:23.220 --> 36:24.860
in terms of cool and cash.

36:24.860 --> 36:27.020
Yeah, New York is a global brand.

36:27.020 --> 36:33.020
LA is kind of a hack city piece of shit, second rate wannabe.

36:33.020 --> 36:34.420
Nothing town.

36:34.420 --> 36:39.740
It wishes it was Italian eight, but what it ends up being is just neat.

36:39.740 --> 36:40.340
Yeah.

36:40.340 --> 36:41.660
What's Italian eight?

36:41.660 --> 36:44.540
It's like of Italian, like,

36:44.540 --> 36:45.700
this fear.

36:47.700 --> 36:50.380
It's like, it's like, he's not a Italian.

36:50.380 --> 36:51.820
It's a Italian eight.

36:51.820 --> 36:53.020
Isn't it just Italian?

36:53.020 --> 36:54.580
Italian it.

36:54.580 --> 36:57.300
It's like architecture.

36:58.580 --> 37:02.300
It's like, you're sorry to infect Jake.

37:02.300 --> 37:08.100
Italian eight definition, conforming to the Italian type or style or custom in manners.

37:08.100 --> 37:08.740
Nice.

37:08.740 --> 37:09.900
Nice.

37:09.900 --> 37:12.180
Century egg on a mirror space.

37:12.180 --> 37:13.820
It's hoping you'd say that.

37:13.820 --> 37:18.100
Um, iconic bag stores.

37:18.100 --> 37:20.700
I think that's got to be equal.

37:20.700 --> 37:21.220
Yeah.

37:21.220 --> 37:22.740
No, I think it's New York.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.700
So though it's a mall Beverly Hills is just a mall.

37:25.700 --> 37:29.900
So is, you can go to Chinatown and get like the best knockoffs on the street.

37:29.900 --> 37:30.900
Yeah.

37:30.900 --> 37:31.900
I think New York.

37:32.500 --> 37:37.420
If we're not talking knockoffs, if we're talking about the best actual bags, okay.

37:37.420 --> 37:39.140
We're talking about LVM8.

37:39.140 --> 37:39.420
Sure.

37:39.420 --> 37:41.940
If we're talking about, because we're talking about in the coach,

37:41.940 --> 37:43.900
error met, excuse me, error met.

37:43.900 --> 37:47.340
Then I feel like we're, you're talking about Rodeo drive,

37:47.340 --> 37:49.180
just as much as you're talking about fit the avenue,

37:49.180 --> 37:51.020
just as much as you're talking about so ho,

37:51.020 --> 37:53.540
just as much as you're talking about help has a dean of for that matter.

37:53.540 --> 37:55.060
I think they're on equal footing.

37:55.060 --> 37:58.860
I just, Rodeo drive is like, 100 yards long.

37:58.860 --> 38:00.820
Fifth Avenue is like four miles.

38:02.500 --> 38:09.900
I can't say I'm that I agree to change your mind.

38:09.900 --> 38:11.020
I think they're equal.

38:11.020 --> 38:12.060
I think they're equal.

38:12.060 --> 38:13.900
Wow.

38:13.900 --> 38:14.900
All right.

38:14.900 --> 38:16.300
Let's end it on Rinder's sand.

38:16.300 --> 38:20.300
He's that way.

38:20.300 --> 38:23.900
Let's just, let's end this the way everyone wants.

38:23.900 --> 38:25.900
Like we're going for this big.

38:25.900 --> 38:32.900
We're moving on to a segment that I like to call.

38:32.900 --> 38:40.900
We're moving on to a segment that I like to call.

38:40.900 --> 38:46.900
Micah credit scores.

38:46.900 --> 38:49.900
I can't hear anything you're saying.

38:49.900 --> 38:51.900
You can't talk during the sound effects,

38:51.900 --> 38:52.900
because they drowns you out.

38:52.900 --> 38:54.900
You all have heard of the FICO credit score?

38:54.900 --> 38:55.900
Uh-huh.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.900
This is the Micah credit score.

38:57.900 --> 39:00.900
Why did it have that intro?

39:00.900 --> 39:04.900
It was just the first song button that I saw.

39:04.900 --> 39:05.900
Got it.

39:05.900 --> 39:06.900
And I fell on Fox.

39:06.900 --> 39:07.900
Yeah.

39:07.900 --> 39:08.900
So, how do you play it?

39:08.900 --> 39:09.900
How do you play it?

39:09.900 --> 39:11.900
Basically we're going to go down and Micah,

39:11.900 --> 39:12.900
I want you.

39:12.900 --> 39:13.900
You're kind of at the helm here.

39:13.900 --> 39:15.900
It's almost a Micah takes the reins,

39:15.900 --> 39:17.900
but I will be guiding your ass.

39:17.900 --> 39:20.900
You're going to give each and every one of us on the room.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.900
On the zoomer in the room, a Micah credit score.

39:23.900 --> 39:25.900
Based on these line items.

39:25.900 --> 39:26.900
So, let's start with the mirror.

39:26.900 --> 39:32.900
And that's start with what this is broken down into what most conventional credit scores are based on.

39:32.900 --> 39:34.900
But this is going to be for basically our personalities,

39:34.900 --> 39:36.900
slash us as people holistically, right?

39:36.900 --> 39:37.900
So, let's start with the mirror.

39:37.900 --> 39:38.900
Uh-huh.

39:38.900 --> 39:42.900
A 35% of most credit scoring apps use payment history.

39:42.900 --> 39:45.900
As, you know, sort of a barometer.

39:45.900 --> 39:49.900
The Micah credit score is going to be based on payment

39:49.900 --> 39:53.900
history.

39:53.900 --> 39:54.900
Payment what?

39:54.900 --> 39:57.900
In the episode ends right there.

39:57.900 --> 39:59.900
Payment history.

39:59.900 --> 40:02.900
Basically, how fresh do they keep?

40:02.900 --> 40:04.900
Not only their breath, but also their perspectives,

40:04.900 --> 40:06.900
their clothes, their house, their digs, etc.

40:06.900 --> 40:09.900
Taylor otherwise.

40:09.900 --> 40:10.900
Okay.

40:10.900 --> 40:11.900
And he's answering about a mirror.

40:11.900 --> 40:13.900
This is just for a mirror for now.

40:13.900 --> 40:16.900
How fresh do I keep my digs?

40:17.900 --> 40:18.900
Is the question?

40:18.900 --> 40:22.900
We're trying to sort of sift through the shit to find a little

40:22.900 --> 40:25.900
kernel of question that Micah can actually answer.

40:25.900 --> 40:26.900
Exactly right.

40:30.900 --> 40:32.900
That's a question too.

40:32.900 --> 40:33.900
That's up to you.

40:33.900 --> 40:36.900
That's how fresh doesn't mirror keep his digs.

40:36.900 --> 40:39.900
And I have to give him a score out of 35.

40:43.900 --> 40:44.900
Think about it.

40:44.900 --> 40:47.900
This is like, I know it sounds crazy, but you can really do this.

40:47.900 --> 40:48.900
Yeah, it does sound crazy.

40:48.900 --> 40:49.900
It's like, it does.

40:49.900 --> 40:50.900
But that's for the community.

40:50.900 --> 40:51.900
Interesting.

40:51.900 --> 40:52.900
The easiest interesting.

40:52.900 --> 40:53.900
Yeah.

40:53.900 --> 40:55.900
We're trying to see if you how fresh you keep it.

40:55.900 --> 40:56.900
He has to see my house.

40:56.900 --> 40:58.900
Have you not seen Amir's house?

40:58.900 --> 41:00.900
He has never been in the house.

41:00.900 --> 41:01.900
It's the vibe you put off.

41:01.900 --> 41:02.900
Yep.

41:02.900 --> 41:03.900
Just 28.

41:03.900 --> 41:04.900
Twenty eight.

41:04.900 --> 41:07.900
Amir had the same backpack for 15 years.

41:07.900 --> 41:08.900
What does fresh mean?

41:08.900 --> 41:10.900
Does fresh mean like stylish?

41:10.900 --> 41:11.900
Or does it mean clean?

41:11.900 --> 41:13.900
That's where you're at that level.

41:13.900 --> 41:15.900
You're like fresh fruit.

41:15.900 --> 41:17.900
That's where Mike is at that home.

41:17.900 --> 41:18.900
And it's up to your tidy.

41:18.900 --> 41:20.900
You think he's neat?

41:20.900 --> 41:21.900
Relatively.

41:21.900 --> 41:23.900
Well, this is the microcredits.

41:23.900 --> 41:24.900
This is the microcredits.

41:24.900 --> 41:25.900
It's not the Amirium.

41:25.900 --> 41:26.900
All right.

41:26.900 --> 41:27.900
It's not the exterior.

41:27.900 --> 41:28.900
The Amirium.

41:28.900 --> 41:29.900
Right.

41:29.900 --> 41:30.900
This is the microcredits score.

41:30.900 --> 41:31.900
So like, all right.

41:31.900 --> 41:33.900
And I'm trying to, I'm trying to influence it.

41:33.900 --> 41:34.900
And I should stop.

41:34.900 --> 41:35.900
No.

41:35.900 --> 41:36.900
You have that.

41:36.900 --> 41:37.900
I feel you're a 14.

41:37.900 --> 41:39.900
But let's, that's like a Jacob credits.

41:39.900 --> 41:40.900
That's Mike.

41:40.900 --> 41:41.900
Mike has said 29.

41:41.900 --> 41:42.900
28.

41:42.900 --> 41:43.900
All right.

41:43.900 --> 41:44.900
All right.

41:44.900 --> 41:46.900
Moving on to amounts owed.

41:46.900 --> 41:48.900
Now, basically, this is going to be like,

41:48.900 --> 41:52.900
Did you guys see that speech that Obama gave like eight years ago where he was like,

41:52.900 --> 41:55.900
if you have a business, you didn't build that.

41:55.900 --> 41:59.900
And then like, the Republicans got all upset because it goes against this like pull yourself

41:59.900 --> 42:01.900
up by your bootstraps mentality.

42:01.900 --> 42:02.900
Yeah.

42:02.900 --> 42:06.900
The same idea here where it's not what are your debts in terms of cash.

42:06.900 --> 42:10.900
It's what are, how much do you owe to your upbringing, to your circumstance?

42:10.900 --> 42:14.900
To the people that helped you along the way.

42:14.900 --> 42:19.900
So what's your impression there in terms of a mirror's debts owed to others?

42:19.900 --> 42:20.900
Is there a number?

42:20.900 --> 42:21.900
Sorry.

42:21.900 --> 42:25.900
He's not a 30.

42:25.900 --> 42:27.900
Uh, nonsense.

42:27.900 --> 42:28.900
Question.

42:28.900 --> 42:30.900
20.

42:30.900 --> 42:32.900
Amir, would you agree with that?

42:32.900 --> 42:33.900
I don't even know what you're asking.

42:33.900 --> 42:39.900
I'm asking how much do you owe your success and joy to others versus just all your own

42:39.900 --> 42:41.900
ingenious behavior.

42:41.900 --> 42:43.900
I would owe a 30 out of 30 to others.

42:43.900 --> 42:44.900
Okay.

42:44.900 --> 42:45.900
But Mike, I did.

42:45.900 --> 42:46.900
Already graded you a 20.

42:46.900 --> 42:47.900
So let's move on.

42:47.900 --> 42:48.900
Okay.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.900
I guess lower is better because it means like you did it yourself.

42:50.900 --> 42:51.900
Yeah.

42:51.900 --> 42:54.900
But now because it means you lack community.

42:54.900 --> 42:55.900
Not really.

42:55.900 --> 42:57.900
I think 20 is a really nice.

42:57.900 --> 42:58.900
Good score.

42:58.900 --> 42:59.900
You have a great support system.

42:59.900 --> 43:01.900
And you did a little bit yourself.

43:01.900 --> 43:02.900
I think that's really.

43:02.900 --> 43:05.900
Which is interesting because now that lower is the score over the credit.

43:05.900 --> 43:13.900
It's like in any in essence that is that being probably the best number to give and get because it's bound should get you a 30 sure.

43:13.900 --> 43:14.900
Yeah.

43:14.900 --> 43:16.900
Well, we do have to move on to.

43:16.900 --> 43:19.900
So a lot of these credit scores used credit history length.

43:19.900 --> 43:22.900
This is going to be fabric length.

43:22.900 --> 43:24.900
And are we doing this for all of us?

43:24.900 --> 43:25.900
They're just a mirror.

43:25.900 --> 43:27.900
I was ideally going to do this for everyone.

43:27.900 --> 43:29.900
But if we only get to Amir, I won't be mad at that.

43:29.900 --> 43:30.900
All right.

43:30.900 --> 43:33.900
It sounds like you want to do a dick measuring contest of one.

43:33.900 --> 43:35.900
Family length out of 15.

43:35.900 --> 43:36.900
Micah.

43:36.900 --> 43:38.900
Jesus 15.

43:38.900 --> 43:39.900
Not inches.

43:39.900 --> 43:40.900
Just like score.

43:40.900 --> 43:41.900
Yeah.

43:41.900 --> 43:42.900
scale.

43:42.900 --> 43:43.900
Let's say.

43:43.900 --> 43:44.900
Yeah.

43:44.900 --> 43:46.900
Think like a nine.

43:46.900 --> 43:48.900
Nine is bigger than average.

43:48.900 --> 43:49.900
Yeah.

43:49.900 --> 43:50.900
Slightly.

43:50.900 --> 43:52.900
Credit mix.

43:52.900 --> 43:55.900
This is often 10% of credit scores.

43:55.900 --> 43:58.900
This is going to be are you mixed.

43:59.900 --> 44:03.900
Like we'll eat at mix to the salad place near the office.

44:03.900 --> 44:07.900
Like is your ethnicity all won?

44:07.900 --> 44:09.900
Oh, no.

44:09.900 --> 44:10.900
This is to me.

44:10.900 --> 44:11.900
And he's getting what?

44:11.900 --> 44:15.900
This is Micah ascertaining and deciding of Amir's.

44:15.900 --> 44:17.900
Ethnic background.

44:17.900 --> 44:18.900
Out of what number?

44:18.900 --> 44:20.900
That's going to be out of 10.

44:20.900 --> 44:22.900
10.

44:22.900 --> 44:24.900
5.

44:24.900 --> 44:25.900
So he is.

44:25.900 --> 44:27.900
Are you saying he is mixed or he's not?

44:28.900 --> 44:29.900
Mixed of things.

44:29.900 --> 44:30.900
All right.

44:30.900 --> 44:31.900
5.

44:31.900 --> 44:33.900
I don't want to disagree with.

44:33.900 --> 44:37.900
23 and me says I'm 100% Ashkenazi Jew.

44:37.900 --> 44:39.900
So that wasn't even an accurate assessment on like this part.

44:39.900 --> 44:40.900
Why are we doing?

44:40.900 --> 44:41.900
Yeah.

44:41.900 --> 44:42.900
I mean, that's a great question.

44:42.900 --> 44:43.900
Why are we doing this?

44:43.900 --> 44:45.900
But the other stuff was also pretty random.

44:45.900 --> 44:48.900
It seemed new credit.

44:48.900 --> 44:49.900
Right?

44:49.900 --> 44:52.900
This is often also 10% of a credit score.

44:52.900 --> 44:56.900
And I think this usually ducks something.

44:56.900 --> 45:03.900
But this question is more like how often does Amir strive for new?

45:03.900 --> 45:05.900
Is he adventurous?

45:05.900 --> 45:07.900
Does he go out of his comfort zone or not?

45:07.900 --> 45:08.900
Is he.

45:08.900 --> 45:10.900
This is what number 10?

45:10.900 --> 45:11.900
4.

45:11.900 --> 45:12.900
10.

45:12.900 --> 45:14.900
10 is being the most adventurous?

45:14.900 --> 45:15.900
Absolutely.

45:15.900 --> 45:17.900
It is.

45:17.900 --> 45:20.900
Like a two.

45:20.900 --> 45:21.900
Yeah.

45:21.900 --> 45:22.900
That's pretty accurate.

45:22.900 --> 45:23.900
Yeah.

45:23.900 --> 45:24.900
Yeah.

45:25.900 --> 45:26.900
Mr. Payman's.

45:26.900 --> 45:28.900
Mr. Taxes.

45:31.900 --> 45:35.900
How often does Amir miss his parents?

45:35.900 --> 45:38.900
I was feeling wondering there.

45:38.900 --> 45:42.900
How homesick does Amir get.

45:42.900 --> 45:45.900
Mr. Payman's.

45:45.900 --> 45:46.900
Mr. Taxes.

45:46.900 --> 45:49.900
How often does he miss slash long for others?

45:49.900 --> 45:52.900
This is out of whatever you decide.

45:52.900 --> 45:53.900
So just this is all bonus.

45:53.900 --> 45:54.900
This is all great.

45:54.900 --> 45:55.900
This could be a million.

45:55.900 --> 45:57.900
So if it's zero, it's he never longs or never misses.

45:57.900 --> 45:58.900
Exactly right.

45:58.900 --> 46:01.900
So you can, this is, this is truly gravy.

46:01.900 --> 46:02.900
Zero.

46:02.900 --> 46:03.900
Okay.

46:03.900 --> 46:05.900
Not getting any points there.

46:05.900 --> 46:06.900
Two minute.

46:06.900 --> 46:08.900
Too many inquiries.

46:08.900 --> 46:16.900
Meaning how many hard credit asks has hit your social security numbers.

46:17.900 --> 46:19.900
So this is the last tax ID.

46:19.900 --> 46:22.900
Basically, there's no socially equivalent to this one.

46:22.900 --> 46:24.900
It's absolutely is.

46:24.900 --> 46:27.900
And it's a pull up your credit karma score.

46:27.900 --> 46:28.900
Let's get the real number here.

46:28.900 --> 46:31.900
You mean, this is not even close, right?

46:31.900 --> 46:32.900
There's two more.

46:32.900 --> 46:33.900
This is too many inquiries.

46:33.900 --> 46:37.900
What I've gleaned for my social interactions with humans, my entire life.

46:37.900 --> 46:40.900
People don't like when you ask them questions about themselves.

46:40.900 --> 46:43.900
Or at the very least, there's like a threshold where,

46:43.900 --> 46:44.900
there's too many.

46:44.900 --> 46:45.900
Right?

46:45.900 --> 46:46.900
And then people start to get a little abusive.

46:46.900 --> 46:47.900
What's that?

46:47.900 --> 46:48.900
It feels invasive.

46:48.900 --> 46:49.900
Yeah.

46:49.900 --> 46:50.900
I don't know.

46:50.900 --> 46:52.900
So too many inquiries.

46:52.900 --> 46:55.900
The last time that we were at dinner remembered off now was, it wasn't a work dinner

46:55.900 --> 46:57.900
per se, but it was everyone that we worked with.

46:57.900 --> 47:01.900
Well, it was a work dinner at per se.

47:01.900 --> 47:02.900
Okay.

47:02.900 --> 47:07.900
In, in during which you asked everyone to save their favorite thing about themselves,

47:07.900 --> 47:11.900
both like personality trait and physically.

47:11.900 --> 47:14.900
Which I thought was a weird.

47:14.900 --> 47:16.900
Fine of inquiry to your conversation.

47:16.900 --> 47:19.900
Well, clearly you've committed it to memory and are holding it against me in some way.

47:19.900 --> 47:21.900
I didn't remember saying that.

47:21.900 --> 47:23.900
We were at Mazel by the way.

47:23.900 --> 47:24.900
Ta-da.

47:24.900 --> 47:26.900
Right.

47:26.900 --> 47:27.900
I didn't.

47:27.900 --> 47:28.900
Yeah, nobody answered it.

47:28.900 --> 47:30.900
So I don't know why anyone's upset.

47:30.900 --> 47:31.900
I can say it.

47:31.900 --> 47:32.900
What's my favorite thing about myself?

47:32.900 --> 47:34.900
That's sad because they didn't answer.

47:34.900 --> 47:35.900
Why did you say you were upset?

47:35.900 --> 47:38.900
You pulled out a form of your ass.

47:38.900 --> 47:39.900
Really?

47:39.900 --> 47:40.900
Yes.

47:40.900 --> 47:41.900
That's physically.

47:41.900 --> 47:42.900
That's no problem.

47:42.900 --> 47:43.900
Dad.

47:43.900 --> 47:44.900
Dad.

47:44.900 --> 47:45.900
Dad.

47:45.900 --> 47:46.900
As in, he's let it go.

47:46.900 --> 47:47.900
Dad.

47:47.900 --> 47:48.900
Let it go.

47:48.900 --> 47:49.900
Let it go.

47:49.900 --> 47:50.900
Let us go.

47:50.900 --> 47:51.900
Don't do that, man.

47:51.900 --> 47:53.900
He squats.

47:53.900 --> 47:55.900
Micah.

47:55.900 --> 48:00.900
Because I'm here to ask too many questions of others.

48:00.900 --> 48:03.900
What is the scale for this?

48:03.900 --> 48:05.900
I'm just doing zero.

48:05.900 --> 48:07.900
Outstanding debt.

48:07.900 --> 48:09.900
What more does he have?

48:10.900 --> 48:11.900
To give.

48:11.900 --> 48:13.900
Yes.

48:13.900 --> 48:14.900
Ten.

48:14.900 --> 48:15.900
Got it.

48:15.900 --> 48:16.900
All right.

48:16.900 --> 48:22.900
So calculating this out of the possible points percentage points of 35.

48:22.900 --> 48:23.900
What number do you say?

48:23.900 --> 48:24.900
Thirty, meaning less.

48:24.900 --> 48:25.900
Fifteen.

48:25.900 --> 48:27.900
Ten and ten.

48:27.900 --> 48:28.900
Out of a hundred.

48:28.900 --> 48:30.900
This score is going to be out of a hundred.

48:30.900 --> 48:31.900
Twenty eight.

48:31.900 --> 48:32.900
It's not just working parallel.

48:32.900 --> 48:33.900
Plus ten.

48:33.900 --> 48:34.900
Plus four.

48:34.900 --> 48:35.900
Plus ten.

48:35.900 --> 48:36.900
It is.

48:36.900 --> 48:37.900
Four percent.

48:37.900 --> 48:40.900
So we're going to do 0.74 times.

48:40.900 --> 48:41.900
What is it?

48:41.900 --> 48:42.900
Eight hundred.

48:42.900 --> 48:43.900
Fifteen.

48:43.900 --> 48:44.900
Fifteen.

48:44.900 --> 48:45.900
A mere.

48:45.900 --> 48:46.900
Buddy.

48:46.900 --> 48:47.900
That.

48:47.900 --> 48:49.900
I'm not affected by that.

48:49.900 --> 48:51.900
Because it's been gibberish until now.

48:51.900 --> 48:53.900
Your Micah credit score.

48:53.900 --> 48:55.900
Ehh.

48:55.900 --> 48:57.900
Drum roll.

48:57.900 --> 48:58.900
Quief.

48:58.900 --> 49:00.900
Drum roll quiz.

49:01.900 --> 49:04.900
Are.

49:04.900 --> 49:05.900
Beat the file.

49:05.900 --> 49:08.900
Six two ninth.

49:08.900 --> 49:09.900
Better.

49:09.900 --> 49:14.900
You're not getting that advantage, Elanne.

49:14.900 --> 49:17.900
Not getting that advantage.

49:17.900 --> 49:18.900
Start pretty fast.

49:18.900 --> 49:19.900
Not getting.

49:19.900 --> 49:20.900
First.

49:20.900 --> 49:23.900
When did you number drop grand the biggest prize congratulations.

49:23.900 --> 49:24.900
Okay.

49:24.900 --> 49:25.900
Anything.

49:25.900 --> 49:26.900
No one getting here you.

49:26.900 --> 49:28.900
You're the finance be it.

49:28.900 --> 49:29.900
Secure.

49:29.900 --> 49:32.700
You're not going to be able to finance the Jordan.

49:32.700 --> 49:34.900
You're not going to be putting things on the way.

49:34.900 --> 49:36.900
You're going to be on food stamps.

49:36.900 --> 49:37.900
What do you say?

49:37.900 --> 49:38.900
What is that?

49:38.900 --> 49:39.900
Six what?

49:39.900 --> 49:42.900
I said your your Micah credit score is six twenty nine.

49:42.900 --> 49:44.900
So you did it out of eight hundred ninety fifty.

49:44.900 --> 49:45.900
No, I did it out of eight fifty.

49:45.900 --> 49:47.900
I did point them out of eight hundred.

49:47.900 --> 49:48.900
Some of them.

49:48.900 --> 49:49.900
Seven five percent of eight fifty.

49:49.900 --> 49:50.900
Yep.

49:52.900 --> 49:54.900
And I said you're not going to be able to finance.

49:54.900 --> 49:55.900
You're not going to be able to refinance.

49:55.900 --> 49:57.900
You're not going to be able to get the lower interest rate.

49:57.900 --> 49:59.900
Like twenty twenty one January style.

49:59.900 --> 50:03.900
You're not going to be able to do the clarina when you're trying to buy some kind of ring or

50:03.900 --> 50:05.900
Cuban link designer mink.

50:05.900 --> 50:11.900
You can't finance Jack because people don't think that you can pay for it in earnest or kind.

50:11.900 --> 50:14.900
Uh, okay.

50:14.900 --> 50:15.900
Or maybe not.

50:15.900 --> 50:17.900
But at the very least, Micah.

50:17.900 --> 50:18.900
Yeah.

50:18.900 --> 50:20.900
Maybe not people is right.

50:20.900 --> 50:24.900
Um, that seems like it's about enough.

50:24.900 --> 50:25.900
Uh, plugs.

50:25.900 --> 50:26.900
What do you guys have going on?

50:26.900 --> 50:28.900
What do you want to point the people towards that start with Emma?

50:28.900 --> 50:31.900
Then go Micah and then we'll end things with Jake and Amir as a duo.

50:31.900 --> 50:32.900
Wow.

50:32.900 --> 50:35.900
I have, I have no plugs.

50:35.900 --> 50:38.900
You can follow me on Instagram at Emma Rosfolie.

50:38.900 --> 50:42.900
You asshole.

50:42.900 --> 50:43.900
Sorry.

50:43.900 --> 50:46.900
Micah.

50:46.900 --> 50:47.900
Micah go ahead.

50:47.900 --> 50:48.900
I have no plugs.

50:48.900 --> 50:49.900
Don't follow me.

50:49.900 --> 50:50.900
Don't ask me.

50:50.900 --> 50:51.900
Don't talk to me.

50:51.900 --> 50:52.900
Don't find me anywhere.

50:52.900 --> 50:53.900
I'm just happy to be here.

50:53.900 --> 50:54.900
Thanks.

50:54.900 --> 50:55.900
That was easy.

50:55.900 --> 50:56.900
I'm here.

50:56.900 --> 50:58.900
I'm on Instagram.

50:58.900 --> 50:59.900
I don't know how else to say it.

50:59.900 --> 51:01.900
I'm fucking happy to be on the gram.

51:01.900 --> 51:02.900
It's at a mirror.

51:02.900 --> 51:04.900
We have a new podcast segment.

51:04.900 --> 51:05.900
You got to watch it.

51:05.900 --> 51:08.900
Subscribe to the channel that it's on on YouTube.

51:08.900 --> 51:11.900
It's like Jake and Amir podcast or something.

51:11.900 --> 51:12.900
So find it on Instagram.

51:12.900 --> 51:15.900
Are you talking about Jake?

51:15.900 --> 51:16.900
Is that Casey?

51:16.900 --> 51:17.900
That's Casey.

51:17.900 --> 51:19.900
What is this episode coming out?

51:19.900 --> 51:20.900
This is coming.

51:21.900 --> 51:25.900
24th November 24th Thanksgiving day.

51:25.900 --> 51:26.900
Yep.

51:26.900 --> 51:28.900
Then you're really bearing this one.

51:28.900 --> 51:30.900
Then I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving.

51:30.900 --> 51:34.900
You'll have missed me in New Orleans or Lando and Fort Lauderdale.

51:34.900 --> 51:36.900
So don't bother buying tickets.

51:36.900 --> 51:38.900
The shows already have been slaughtered.

51:38.900 --> 51:39.900
Oh, come on.

51:39.900 --> 51:41.900
At Jeffrey James on Instagram.

51:41.900 --> 51:44.900
Watch this space.

51:44.900 --> 51:45.900
I don't know what else to say.

51:45.900 --> 51:47.900
There's some exciting stuff coming down the pipeline for the show.

51:47.900 --> 51:48.900
No.

51:49.900 --> 51:50.900
What?

51:52.900 --> 51:54.900
One of the budgets.

51:54.900 --> 51:56.900
Do you don't have the budget?

51:56.900 --> 51:58.900
I tried to make this weekend.

51:58.900 --> 52:00.900
I tried to make it something happen literally tomorrow.

52:00.900 --> 52:02.900
When we're recording and it didn't.

52:02.900 --> 52:03.900
What are you trying to make happen?

52:03.900 --> 52:06.900
I tried to do a live show at Madison Square Garden.

52:06.900 --> 52:08.900
Yeah.

52:08.900 --> 52:10.900
We don't have the budget for that.

52:10.900 --> 52:11.900
Really?

52:11.900 --> 52:13.900
There should be a live show.

52:13.900 --> 52:17.900
I don't know why that you guys are trying to do a mini tour next year according to Katie.

52:17.900 --> 52:20.900
But I've a lot of over promising a lot of under delivering.

52:20.900 --> 52:21.900
Yeah.

52:21.900 --> 52:22.900
Katie.

52:22.900 --> 52:23.900
I think you set your sights on that.

52:23.900 --> 52:24.900
That's everything.

52:24.900 --> 52:26.900
Everything she says she's going to be.

52:26.900 --> 52:30.900
So if you're not going on tour, it's because Katie doesn't want you there.

52:30.900 --> 52:31.900
Yeah.

52:31.900 --> 52:32.900
So you're going to have to find out why.

52:32.900 --> 52:33.900
SF sketch fest.

52:33.900 --> 52:36.900
She says we're submitting.

52:36.900 --> 52:37.900
Also, a mirror.

52:37.900 --> 52:39.900
Can I nail you down in a veil right now?

52:39.900 --> 52:41.900
Well, actually, I'll text you.

52:41.900 --> 52:42.900
Namaste.

52:42.900 --> 52:43.900
That's does folks.

52:43.900 --> 52:44.900
Don't.

52:45.900 --> 52:46.900
Be upset.

52:46.900 --> 52:48.900
Don't take that energy into the weekend.

52:48.900 --> 52:49.900
I'm here.

52:49.900 --> 53:07.900
That was a hit-dum original.

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:05.000 --> 00:12.000
I've never started out by saying this, but this whole show is going to be

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
out.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
What's that is, does me?

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
There we go.

00:24.000 --> 00:48.000
Sorry, Marika, sorry, Marty.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
No YouTube ad revenue, which I did historically think was negligible, and Marika said it's

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
not.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
So it's at least a couple hundred dollars an episode, and that's down the drain because

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I just used copyrighted music.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
We've got Joel Dunno for turning into the show, arguably two often, your guest.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
Ali Conno is a joy, and we've got Dean Cardiel on the show for the first time in a year.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
Here's the thing, Dean being upstate makes me forget that he's an option.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
And then somebody tweeted a day and said, when are you going to be on the head-gum podcast?

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
And Dean expressed enthusiasm for being here.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
And I always want people who, you know, it's not pulling teeth to get them on the show.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
So we've got Dean on the show.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
This episode comes out tomorrow.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
So what's that?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Oh, I said hell yeah.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Oh hell affirmative.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Yes.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
I love that.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
What's that?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
What's that?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
What's that?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
What's that?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
This is, you know what?

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Maybe this show should be one of those podcasts where it's like, oh,

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
yes, don't talk until I introduce you.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
You introduce us to you, but you did introduce us.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Really?

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
Ali, what's too much money to spend on a necklace?

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
I guess it's all relative based on your bank account.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Okay, percentage wise.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
So let's say you make $70,000 a year.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
How much of that should be?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
What's that?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
I said, okay.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
How much do you make?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
I can't ask.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
You can't tell me.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
I feel like, and Dan, you can speak to this is like employee solidarity.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Like, let's fucking talk about this stuff because I got a raise two years.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Or, yeah, almost two years ago.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
You're in a half ago.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
And it's because of Dan, because Dan sat me down.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
He said, look, this is what you could be making.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Because producers at I heart radio make this much.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
You can use that stat.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
I should believe all this out.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Because you told me also not to tell anybody that you told me that.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
No, I don't know.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
We can talk about this.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Again, employers holiday.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
It's I think it's good to talk about these things.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Absolutely.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
And I think you actually negotiate below what I recommend it.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
I did because I couldn't go from what I was making to what you said I should make.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Because that's like an over 200% increase.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
But now you're a CBS showcase.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
You got a lot of things going for you.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
They barely know anything.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
And I had to work for four months straight.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
But it looks good.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
It looks great.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
It looks great.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
You make what?

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
$10,000.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Jeff, also your raise was before inflation.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
You have to think about that too.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Like, I agree.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
So you're encouraging me to ask for another raise.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I just feel like I want thin ice every year.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
It should be at least like 3%.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
3% to 5%.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
But with inflation, you're probably, you know,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
justified asking for a 10% raise.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Well, at least.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Maybe next year.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
I feel like you have to ask around the end of the year.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Yeah.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
For most people, it's every year.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
And for you, it's every three and a half years.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Yeah.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
What's that times 1.03?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Yeah.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
It's not worth.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
That's a dollar an hour.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
It's not worth it.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Do you answer your question?

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
I personally, I wouldn't spend more than $100 on a necklace.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
It's a wall.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
It's great.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
I think I spent $80 on a bracelet once.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Do love it.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
I think I spent $80 on a bracelet once.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Do love it.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
It's a gift.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
For myself.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
For myself.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
It was an alley you thing.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Like, one of those hairy styles, Johns.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
And I'm using the word John because we got Joel in the house.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
You stay.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I'll thumbs up it.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Thumbs up it.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
We've got a lot to get to.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
But I want to take our time with it.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
I want to, you know, ease into it.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
I want there to be a texture.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
This episode.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Dane came into the zoom.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
He said, I'm, what did you say you're in high spirits today?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Nothing good break your spirit.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Yeah.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
I feel great.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Let's put it in a break.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
Let's see what if we can break Dane on this episode.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
What do you guys, yeah?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
What do you guys, is like, I'm not.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
You'd need your resolutions, but intentions for the new year.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Like, in a word, or maybe more.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Well, the tweet that I, I sent out was just about like,

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
uh, how good this year feels in the conversation that I'm having.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Like, people are like, really, you know, work stuff is important.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
But, you know, we're not just work.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
What's like personal well-being, friends and family, a side project.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
I feel like there's a lot of good energy toward, like, that balance.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Absolutely.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Yeah.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I think it has a good, uh, good as a good energy.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Your intention is to find that work life balance and foster your hobbies.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Then you know, I have a pretty good work life balance.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
I feel like I can, like, operate at, like, 70% in my, in my role,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
which is like, which actually is difficult to do.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
I think for a lot of people.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Like, a lot of people that I know are like, I'm fucking exhausted by my job.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
And I'm like, yeah, but I also hear you're talking about it.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
Like, and thinking about it all the time, like, 10 PM, you've been off work for four hours.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Like, uh, every time I'm out into your slackness for this,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
and being at one o'clock in the morning in my time.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
So.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
That's true.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
That's true.

05:46.000 --> 05:52.000
I was, um, I was a little drunk because it's kind of been a fun week for me.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
But, uh, Joel, what are your, what are your intentions?

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Is it, is it mostly sexual, or is it, uh, you know, more about work, or is it more about play?

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
Obviously, there's a lot of sexual stuff to get to in the next 11 1 half months.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Just a little crazy.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Obviously, starting the year off, right?

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
It's sexually, but I'm, I'm.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
I figured out what to pack my Argentina trip, my apartment.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yes.

06:16.000 --> 06:25.400
So a lot going on, obviously was happy to make the time for this, but, you know, a lot of

06:25.400 --> 06:29.800
packing, a bunch of things, a lot of setting up, all that sort of stuff.

06:29.800 --> 06:36.240
Any dates before Argentina, the next 48 hours, no, but I mean, hey, we're hosting a party.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.720
So who knows what could happen?

06:38.720 --> 06:39.720
Who's we?

06:39.720 --> 06:40.720
Your roommate?

06:40.720 --> 06:41.720
Yes.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.000
Oh, yeah, you have a going away party.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
I did hear that.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.200
And I was like, how long is he going to be gone for?

06:47.200 --> 06:50.000
Because I was like, if you're gone for like 10 days or less, like, you're an asshole for

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
doing it.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
It's a weekend trip.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
You asshole.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
No, it's for a month, right?

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
It's for a month, but then also it's my roommate's birthday, and then also

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
are even more of an asshole to encroach on their birthday.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
It's there for the announcement party.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Joel's going away, John.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Yeah, it's to be clear.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
It's Joel's going away, John, and also Simone's birthday that weekend.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Yeah.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Oh, okay.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
All right.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
And then I'm our debatable third roommate, meaning the person who's subletting

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
my room, or debatable fourth roommate, my friend and Nisha who's subletting our room,

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
is dropping a new song tomorrow too.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
So release party, perhaps?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
You gotta have wider friends.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Go on.

07:35.000 --> 07:42.000
Just saying, like, you gotta have like, like, where are the shons?

07:42.000 --> 07:52.000
That would have made a mirror laugh.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
That would have made a mirror laugh.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
I think everyone here's a little too socially informed.

07:58.000 --> 08:06.000
Myself included, which is why I'm going to cut that out.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Allie, intentions for the new year, what do you got?

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
My new year's resolutions are always really small and achievable.

08:14.000 --> 08:22.000
And like last year, it was to actually start washing my face every night before I went to bed.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
I was pretty lacs.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
This year, my goal is to finally nail down.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
It's all, I guess it's all skin care related.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
I want to finally have a link in it.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Good afternoon.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Good afternoon.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Joel, shut the fight up for a second.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Can I put my mind's important, actually?

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
Allie, I screenshoted your Instagram story of your new year's resolutions.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Illegal.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
Because I want to go back to it, because I liked it.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Right, and that's really nice.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
That's really nice.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Your nails were really good.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Thank you.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
You were very good.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Thank you.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
How long have you had the ends?

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
I thought about it yesterday because I did leave the house after a really long time.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
And I thought, oh, that was one of my things.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
I just, that was my only goal.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Just leave that house one today.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
That's fine.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
It's much easier.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
It's really hard to get me to go anywhere.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I'm not like, I'm not an easy hang.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
That's really rude to yourself, I think.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I think you're a joyful hang.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I mean, easy to nail down.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
No, yeah, I'm not easy to do.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Okay.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
I'm not like, yeah.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Wow.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
I think I'd like to think I'm an easy conversation loss.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
But I'm not, it's not easy to get me to leave the house.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
And I'm trying to be better about that.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
Maybe that's another one along with my regimen.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Servy, right?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Plends the dish.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Moisturizer.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Easy.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Little under eye cream.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
If you're like me with a little bit of bags.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Top it all off with the vitamin C serum.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
That's all you need.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
That is all you need.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
You're missing a critical piece here.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Boy.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Sunscreen.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Sunscreen.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Yeah, you're supposed to do that.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
I don't know.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
I'm brown.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Hot take.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I kind of like eye bags.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Oh.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I think they're.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I think I need to.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Thank you.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Keep Davidson.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Thank you.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Machine gun Kelly.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Now I can take the sunglasses off.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Yeah.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
If you look tired, I'll probably think you're more attractive.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
First time.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
You're taking the sunglasses off, right, Jack?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Because I've been crying.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Yeah.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Because I've been depressed as shit, right?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
We'll totally helping the overall cause.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
You're attractive, Miss.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Yeah.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
We do have to move on.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I think it'd be fun to actually dive into those ins and outs.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Because Ali, they were very good.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
And I know that not a lot of people, but not everyone who watched this is this show.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Follows you on Instagram.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
So I think we should dive into that after the ad break.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
But let's keep it going with everybody's.

10:52.000 --> 11:03.000
I don't know where in this limbo where it feels like we all know it's going to be

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Air and Taylor Johnson.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
So I don't want to be an idiot and not say him.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
I also learned something about him today, which is that when he was 18 years old.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
He started dating a 42 year old.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
So I don't know.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I think that that's not cool.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Maybe that's like one of those age gaps that's like.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
Maybe he was groomed a little bit because also that was his boss on this film.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
Because I saw on Twitter that there's these rumors that he and Joey King hadn't affair,

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
which I think are not true.

11:27.000 --> 11:33.000
But everybody's just kind of like cheating's bad unless you're dating someone 20 years

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
or senior.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
So yeah, that's my bond of the week is Aaron Taylor Johnson,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
but maybe a single Aaron Taylor Johnson.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
Maybe once he's bond, he'll kind of regain that childhood whimsy that he lost

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
when he started dating Sam.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Cool.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Sorry.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
I'm going to go with Reeve Carney.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Who?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I love Reeve Carney.

12:00.000 --> 12:07.000
I was being made fun of by Marika and others.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
For not knowing who the actors of any of the fighter men's were.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
And then who else this?

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
I was like, oh, I really liked Reeve Carney when I saw that in seventh grade.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
And I'm like, oh, you haven't seen the Spider-Man movie,

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
but you saw the Broadway show in seventh grade.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
He was also one of the leads in Hades Town.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Yeah, sorry.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I did not know this face.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
And you know what?

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
When I saw how so Gucci in theater, he made a brief cameo.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
And there was one person sitting behind me who gasped and then went,

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
is that Reeve Carney?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
And I was like, I have one other person in this movie.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
And I could talk about this way.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
That's very funny.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
He's hot.

12:46.000 --> 12:57.000
I would go with any member of Boy Genius.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Oh, yeah.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
RIP David Crosby.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
I tweeted this earlier.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I don't think it was funny enough to keep up.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
So I deleted it instantly.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
But David Crosby, he died the way he lived,

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
trying to divert attention away from Phoebe Bridgers.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
Because the Boy Genius cover came out tonight.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
That's great.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
I am a huge Crosby sales in Ashfan.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Honestly, a huge solo fan of a solo music.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
I think he's a bad person, but RIP.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Well, he died today.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
He died today for real.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Yeah, shout out Phoebe.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
And I think she'd be great with Lucy.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
I probably, I, you know, land on Lucy more or more so than the others.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
That's a good move.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
I think Phoebe's great.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I love her music, but I think she's a little over saturated.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
And I think a Lucy dick is bond.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
Nobody's fucking seeing that company coming.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
What's the other person's name, Julian Baker?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Yeah.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
She's too sad.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
She's too sad to be bond.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
She may not have to.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Yeah.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Yeah.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
The in post.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Issues of that.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Yeah.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
But again, she could be the gadgets person.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
There you go.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Maybe they're all bond.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Actually, they're sisters.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
We're lovers.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Right, man.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Yeah.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Alex, who's your bond of the week?

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
I think it's inspired by the calendar behind me, which is for her be fully loaded.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
I saw on TikTok that it calendars from two to nothing.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Fixed the dates match up with 2023.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
So I went on eBay.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
So my bond of the week is Lindsay Lohan.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
That's.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
That's like, maybe the best time to make this in history.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Here.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
Your new year's resolution is to live 2023 as if it's 2023 or 2006.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Yeah.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
I'm buying all low-rise pants again.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Watch out, world.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
It's not a bad.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
It's not a bad move.

14:48.000 --> 14:54.000
I think that that's a really interesting way to pack your way into having a bond pick.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
I always get.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
Herbie fully loaded confused with like a blackout drunk.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Herbie Hancock.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
I don't know who Herbie Hancock is.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Why are to ask?

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
Does dry January really make people healthier?

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Obstaining from alcohol can have immediate benefits.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
But lasting gains is where you make lasting change.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
You know, I actually have a few guys.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
I, I, I, I have a thought about this, which is over Christmas break.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
I was a hangout in my few friends at a parent house.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
And one of his favorite things to do when he's out of parent house.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Maybe you're a little high.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Whatever is turn on Fox News.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Take it.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
And I just had a label.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
So I haven't heard anything you've said because you really just have learned to power through the bullshit on the show.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
And it's impressive.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
It's impressive to be.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
What did you actually?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Sorry.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
So just know that me and a few of my friends were a little high.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
We're watching Fox News mostly for the ads because they're just incredible.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
If no one's ever from the late night Fox News ads.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Turns out there was this like show on.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I want to say it was called gut failed.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
And we're like two minutes into watching it.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
And I'm like, this is essentially the head gum podcast.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
No.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
He shows like a screen.

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
He's like, you know, 30% of adults report that they spend more time.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
They really need to in the bathroom just to avoid their family.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Thoughts.

16:36.000 --> 16:46.000
You only difference is a follow on jokes from the other people present are far more off color.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Yeah.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
So you know, they're like, ah, you would too if you live with my wife.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Oh, whatever.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Well, that's funny.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Yeah.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
That's just comedy.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Hmm.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Yeah.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
But anyway, I was like, hey, this is like kind of similar.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
And I know you've struggled explaining it to people.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
So you could be like, hey, it's kind of like the Fox News film.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Oh, gut felt.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Yeah.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
What does gut felt mean?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Is that somebody's name?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
I think he's like some former wrestler guy.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Weird.

17:15.000 --> 17:22.000
Um, per vulture, 25 years later, no one knows who spiked the Titanic Chowder.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Oh, PCP.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I didn't even know that was a thing.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
This I can speak on.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Yeah.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
I couldn't.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Please.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
It was you.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Ha ha ha.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Guilty.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I did a thing.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
That would be so funny if that's how they came out with it.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Did a thing.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Yeah.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Um, I think it was a.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
I rumors I think are pointing to a disgruntled crew member who hated James Cameron,

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
but the most important piece of that story that's really important to include is that the old woman,

17:54.000 --> 18:00.000
old rose who drops the necklace at the end, not involved had a different lunch that day.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
And how do you know that fact?

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
Because I've read every article about this incident.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Okay.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
Was obviously my first question like, what about what about this lady?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Yeah.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
They don't want her to trip and not realize it more than anybody else in a submarine.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Are they were they underwater or the water?

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
Okay. So it happened there last day of filming in Nova Scotia.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
And.

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
I don't know underwater scenes, but no, no, but there was a crew.

18:31.000 --> 18:38.000
Well, I was a disgruntled crew member who just like poured a ton of PCP into the shared crew lunch,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
which was Chowder.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Disgusting.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
So everybody ate their Chowder and then tripped balls the rest of the day.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
And it was like own intense spectrum of reactions.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Like some people were vomiting off the side of the fake ship.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
There was like a conglign going through like every some people were weeping.

18:57.000 --> 19:03.000
Some people were like, I think making out like it was just a crazy drug adult to like,

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
best aboard the Titanic, which by the way,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
for shooting, they only could make half of the books.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
It's so expensive.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
So it's really half the shit.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
I mean, you can die from having too much PCP, right?

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Probably.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
That's that's fucked up.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
No, it was that's that's a that prank couldn't happen.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Now.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
The.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
The.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
Can you make the office now it is?

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
And you couldn't spike Chowder with these.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
I don't think I think it's now officially uncouth,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
but back then you could get away with much more.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I'm told about a third of the way through that.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
I thought we were talking about this got spiked on the actual Titanic.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Me too.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
At first, but then I remember the story that I read like three weeks ago.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Yeah.

19:53.000 --> 20:03.000
Why didn't the people had Jones town or in Jones town drink Jones.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
The soda.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I think it spikes anything it's my point.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Or like a malt.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
You know, it's your last meal.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
It's your last drink.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
You don't want to have like a milkshake.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
You've ever worked at a concession stand.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I worked at a cafe.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
Making maltz is really time intensive for that big of a village.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Got a six to powder.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
I mean, they're about to die like they have literally all the time in the world.

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
I call me Grant leaders not taking the time to like whip up multiple

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
hours.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
Just satisfy everybody with a mole.

20:36.000 --> 20:41.000
That's just not practical draft.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
Nobody's ever talked to me like that before.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
You've humbled me this day.

20:47.000 --> 20:52.000
During when I first moved to LA and I was very unemployed and had so much time on my hands.

20:52.000 --> 20:58.000
I knew it was really time to like figure it out when I went to the museum of death on a Monday morning.

20:58.000 --> 21:05.000
I was like, don't open up this place, Ellie.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Are you feeling better now?

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
No, I've since gotten a job and I'm doing better, but yeah.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
Did you get there before the hours opened?

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Oh yeah, I was waiting outside.

21:16.000 --> 21:23.000
Sorry, my computer's lagging and so that should have happened three seconds earlier.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Let's do it.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
That's fine.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
I was door outside waiting for them to unlock so I could go learn.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
Incredible.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
According to Grubstreet, Gen Z is housing and mass martinis.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Hey, they're then they're left and right.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
What is your guys' cocktail of choice?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Let's start Joel.

21:44.000 --> 21:53.000
I like a classic whiskey sour, whiskey ginger, something that people think you know what you're

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
like.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
That's cool.

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
I go with a mezcal fashion and every one will drink.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
Everyone loves when I say it.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
It's just like, it is the drink.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
It is cool.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
I feel like that's also blending your environments, right?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Because you're from San Diego, kind of a mezcal.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
Early Southern California because I haven't lived in San Diego, but it's like a very

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
mezcal town LA.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
So I assume that that extends to Southern California.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
And then I feel like New York City for sure, but also upstate.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
It's kind of more of an old fashion territory.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
You've blended the two.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
I would say, Dane Cardio is a mezcal old fashion.

22:34.000 --> 22:49.000
Our next partners, I've let a greens guys.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
I obviously love athletic greens.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
They're a huge sporter of the show.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
And it's a product that I truly use every day.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
I'm in my 20s.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
So I started taking athletic greens because I don't always ticker myself in every other regard.

23:00.000 --> 23:06.000
So I was like, let me do something for my physical and mental well-being every single day.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
And athletic greens is that product for me.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
Where I know I'm getting high quality vitamins, minerals and whole-food source superfoods every

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
single day.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
I wake up.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
I have my water and then I have my AG1 and then I have my cold brew and it gets me off to a solid

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
start.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
It's also hard for me to keep up with this supplement routine when I have to take a bunch

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
of different pills and supplements.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
And it's really hard to source those things and make sure that they're all high quality.

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
And I realize very quickly that AG1 has all those things and then some things that I maybe

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
would be like, oh, I'm not going to buy a whole pill bottle of that because who needs it.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
AG1 has it.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
It has everything you need.

23:41.000 --> 23:46.000
And I truly have noticed a difference in my sleep quality and in my mental clarity and alertness.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Also just convenience, right?

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
Why would you take a bunch of things down your throat when you could really just do it

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
once with the powder in water?

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
It really makes a lot of sense and it's also cheaper.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
I was spending so much money before when I was getting vitamins all separately.

24:01.000 --> 24:07.000
Now I just have AG1 and it gets everything done nutritionally and financially.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
I'm always looking for life hacks and that's why I love and trust AG1.

24:10.000 --> 24:15.800
By athletic greens because it's an all in one formula that makes it easy for me to cover my nutritional

24:15.800 --> 24:16.800
basis.

24:16.800 --> 24:20.800
Like I said every day, every scoop is packed with 75 vitamins, minerals, and whole food

24:20.800 --> 24:25.800
sourced ingredients of the highest quality of the highest caliber and calendar that

24:25.800 --> 24:27.800
give me major benefits.

24:27.800 --> 24:32.800
Like gut and mood support boosted energy and even healthier looking skin hair and nails.

24:32.800 --> 24:36.800
I mean, nobody said anything but I know you're thinking it.

24:36.800 --> 24:40.800
So if you're looking for an easier way to take supplements, athletic greens is giving you a free

24:40.800 --> 24:45.800
one year supply of vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase of athletic

24:45.800 --> 24:46.800
greens AG1.

It's a new year.

24:55.800 --> 24:56.800
New year.

24:56.800 --> 24:57.800
Come aboard.

24:57.800 --> 24:58.800
Thanks, athleticgreens.

24:58.800 --> 25:01.800
This show is sponsored by Better Help.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.800
Guys, I'm in therapy every week.

25:03.800 --> 25:06.800
Again, I say this every time but I truly believe in therapy.

25:06.800 --> 25:10.800
I've seen myself go through a personal transformation in my relationships.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.800
My friendships, my relationships, my family.

25:13.800 --> 25:17.800
All of those things have become stronger because I know myself better.

25:17.800 --> 25:18.800
Right?

25:18.800 --> 25:19.800
I know my triggers.

25:19.800 --> 25:22.800
I understand my trauma is more and that can only come from therapy.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.800
It can't come from your friends alone.

25:24.800 --> 25:27.800
Obviously they're part of your support system as well.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.800
But you also don't want to burden people with too much.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.800
You know, they're there for you, but to a point.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.800
And that's where therapy can come in.

25:34.800 --> 25:37.800
So when you're at your best, you can do great things.

25:37.800 --> 25:43.800
But sometimes life gets you bogged down and you may feel overwhelmed or like you're not showing up again in the way that you want to.

25:43.800 --> 25:48.800
And working with a therapist can help you get closer to the best version of you.

25:48.800 --> 25:53.800
Because when you feel empowered, you're more prepared to take on everything that life throws at you.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.800
And it just makes life feel a little less serious.

25:55.800 --> 25:58.800
You know, you hear the word therapy and you're like, I don't know.

25:58.800 --> 26:01.800
I'm not dealing with something that I need to go to therapy for.

26:01.800 --> 26:06.800
But I don't know, you don't need to be dealing with a huge trauma.

26:06.800 --> 26:09.800
You know, I think just, well, first of all, we all have traumas.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.800
But second of all, I think you can just, you know, with things come up every week.

26:12.800 --> 26:17.800
Things come up that if you can just talk it out with somebody for 45, 50 minutes.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.800
You know, it just makes life feel lighter.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.800
So, you know, I know we all want that.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.800
That's what I try to do with this show.

26:23.800 --> 26:30.800
I try to make y'all's life lighter by making people on the show's lives harder and heavier if that makes any sense.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.800
Anyway, I digress.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.800
If you're thinking of giving therapy a try, better help is a great option.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.800
It's convenient, flexible, affordable, and entirely online.

26:38.800 --> 26:44.800
Just fill out a brief, questionnaire, a brief questionnaire to get matched with the license therapist

26:44.800 --> 26:47.800
and switch therapists at any time for no additional charge if it's not working out.

26:47.800 --> 26:51.800
So you have nothing to lose if you want to live a more empowered life.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.800
Empowered life, Jesus.

26:54.800 --> 26:55.800

And we're back.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.800
You know, when you're hosting this show, you kind of have to be like, what's a good cut point?

27:13.800 --> 27:14.800
What's an edit point?

27:14.800 --> 27:16.800
What's the funniest thing that's been said for 10 minutes?

27:16.800 --> 27:19.800
And that's the best thing to like go to the break on.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.800
You know what I mean?

27:21.800 --> 27:23.800
Do we get to hear Alice?

27:23.800 --> 27:24.800
I don't think so.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.800
It's a little, yeah.

27:27.800 --> 27:29.800
Let's cut the hat right now.

27:29.800 --> 27:30.800
I guess a chance.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.800
What is your drink of choice, Kong?

27:33.800 --> 27:35.800
Similarly, the jewel.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.800
I like a whiskey, ginger ale.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.800
I dated a guy once in college who introduced me to that drink.

27:40.800 --> 27:43.800
And it's the one thing I took from that brief relationship.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.800
You know, like, I genuinely like it.

27:46.800 --> 27:50.800
But then when I have it, I'm like, oh, memories.

27:51.800 --> 27:58.800
A Harvard study found that deep relationships, quote unquote, are the key to a longer life.

27:58.800 --> 28:06.800
How do you guys develop and then foster a nurture deep relationships that start a jewel?

28:06.800 --> 28:10.800
You know, it takes doing the work.

28:10.800 --> 28:15.800
You got to show up, takes consistency, consistency is key.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.800
Got to reach out to people.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.800
You know, you can't always be waiting for people to reach out to you.

28:19.800 --> 28:20.800
You got to text them.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.800
Hey, what do you up to this week?

28:22.800 --> 28:27.800
Let's make dinner together.

28:27.800 --> 28:28.800
You're texting.

28:28.800 --> 28:29.800
Are you asking that?

28:29.800 --> 28:30.800
Sorry.

28:30.800 --> 28:31.800
Yeah.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.800
That was rude.

28:33.800 --> 28:36.800
Good to know.

28:36.800 --> 28:37.800
I got nothing else.

28:37.800 --> 28:41.800
You got it.

28:41.800 --> 28:42.800
Not.

28:42.800 --> 28:43.800
You got to pay attention.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.800
I'm talking.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.800
That helps.

28:48.800 --> 28:53.800
Something that's in for me this year is a poppin.

28:53.800 --> 28:58.800
But you need to have the deep relationship, I think, for the poppin to work.

28:58.800 --> 29:06.800
So like the quantity of poppins I can do in 2023 will correlate to the deep relationships that I have.

29:06.800 --> 29:12.800
Like just going to someone's house and saying, hey, and hanging out for an hour or two.

29:12.800 --> 29:13.800
That is frightening.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.800
I think to 99% of Americans today.

29:15.800 --> 29:16.800
Yeah.

29:16.800 --> 29:17.800
I got it.

29:17.800 --> 29:18.800
We got to do more poppins.

29:18.800 --> 29:23.800
I like that, actually, because one of the best nights that I not nights after news that I had last

29:23.800 --> 29:30.080
fall was my friend Sarah was like, hey, my washer, dryer is broken and can I come over

29:30.080 --> 29:31.480
and do laundry at your place.

29:31.480 --> 29:32.480
She comes over.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.800
My other friend was going to come over anyways and we're going to get lunch and then we're

29:34.800 --> 29:36.680
just like because of Sarah's poppin.

29:36.680 --> 29:37.680
We just all got lunch.

29:37.680 --> 29:38.680
It was great.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.680
That's not up.

29:40.680 --> 29:41.680
Is that?

29:41.680 --> 29:44.680
I said, that's really nice.

29:44.680 --> 29:45.680
Yeah.

29:45.680 --> 29:50.680
I agree with both of you guys.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.680
I think it's, it loves a verb.

29:52.680 --> 29:54.680
It's about active intent.

29:54.680 --> 30:01.680
And I'm a big fan of small acts of service coupled with like, you know, a heart to heart

30:01.680 --> 30:04.680
then I know we're really good friends.

30:04.680 --> 30:09.680
And I'm pretty, I'm, I'm pretty, I'm an over share and it's easy for me to just say things

30:09.680 --> 30:13.680
about myself very fast and the hope that, you know, maybe we'll see what sticks.

30:13.680 --> 30:19.680
But when I have someone else reciprocate that and meet me trying to go, then I feel like

30:19.680 --> 30:23.680
we are in a shared place of understanding and intent.

30:23.680 --> 30:24.680
I'm just a little bit.

30:24.680 --> 30:30.680
I'm the same way of like, I, I kind of lost interest in surface level friendships and

30:30.680 --> 30:33.680
some people just can't give you that, which is fine.

30:33.680 --> 30:34.680
But, you know, setting your own boundaries.

30:34.680 --> 30:38.680
I'm like, I don't want, I can't be friends with you in the way that you think we're

30:38.680 --> 30:39.680
friends.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.680
I can be like, I know that person.

30:41.680 --> 30:44.680
I'm not friends because we don't participate in a shared vulnerability, right?

30:44.680 --> 30:47.680
I don't know anything about you, Jack.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.680
I don't like friend breakups though.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.680
I think that's super cringe.

30:51.680 --> 30:55.680
Like, like sitting down with a friend and saying, we can no longer be friends.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.680
I've never done that in my life.

30:57.680 --> 30:58.680
Me.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.680
I've seen that as like a trend.

31:00.680 --> 31:04.680
Like you just like part ways, but this whole like, oh, I thought this was a

31:04.680 --> 31:05.680
deep relationship.

31:05.680 --> 31:06.680
It wasn't reciprocated.

31:06.680 --> 31:10.680
It's I need to tell you you're no longer a person in my life.

31:10.680 --> 31:13.680
I move on, sweetie.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.680
Joel, are you listening?

31:15.680 --> 31:18.680
That was you telling me to move on?

31:18.680 --> 31:20.680
Here we go.

31:20.680 --> 31:24.680
I can't share my screen right now because I'm afraid my laptop's going to freak out.

31:24.680 --> 31:25.680
But here's the audio.

31:25.680 --> 31:28.680
It's the unsinking of the Titanic.

31:31.680 --> 31:34.680
Time to coincide with the movie's 25th anniversary.

31:34.680 --> 31:39.680
The film's director is trying to finally slam the door.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.680
Well done.

31:42.680 --> 31:45.680
On that age old question about the door.

31:45.680 --> 31:46.680
Jack.

31:46.680 --> 31:50.680
Did Rose hog it when Jack could have fit?

31:50.680 --> 31:53.680
Room on that door for a family of four.

31:53.680 --> 31:54.680
Are you critics?

31:54.680 --> 31:56.680
Adding poochies to prove the point.

31:56.680 --> 32:01.680
But now Matt Gio presents a scientific reenactment.

32:01.680 --> 32:02.680
Yeah.

32:02.680 --> 32:05.680
Using stunt doubles plastered with sensors,

32:05.680 --> 32:07.680
floundering in cold water.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.680
This is the teaser.

32:09.680 --> 32:12.680
They consulted an expert on hypothermia.

32:12.680 --> 32:16.680
Within eight minutes, Jack would have been unconscious in that position.

32:16.680 --> 32:19.680
And by the way, director James Cameron told reporters,

32:19.680 --> 32:22.680
It's technically not a door.

32:22.680 --> 32:25.680
It's a piece of panelling from the first class lounge.

32:25.680 --> 32:26.680
Yeah.

32:26.680 --> 32:30.680
Well, whatever it was, it's been put to the test before.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.680
I think Jack's death was needless.

32:32.680 --> 32:36.680
Mythbusters determined that if only they'd tied Rose's life jacket,

32:36.680 --> 32:41.680
underneath the wood, the additional buoyancy could have supported them both.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.680
But director Cameron was unmoved.

32:44.680 --> 32:46.680
She has to die.

32:46.680 --> 32:47.680
The dude's going down.

32:47.680 --> 32:50.680
Cameron compares it to Romeo and Juliet.

32:50.680 --> 32:53.680
In the famous line, you say, I'll never let you go, Jack.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.680
I'll never let go.

32:55.680 --> 32:56.680
I promise you.

32:56.680 --> 32:58.680
But you do.

32:58.680 --> 32:59.680
I like it.

33:00.680 --> 33:03.680
This is one movie controversy that just won't sink.

33:05.680 --> 33:07.680
Colbert and Kate Winslet.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.680
Come on, darling.

33:09.680 --> 33:10.680
Let's run for two.

33:10.680 --> 33:14.680
Have already done their own reenactment and no life boats were needed.

33:14.680 --> 33:16.680
Oh, hands on death.

33:16.680 --> 33:17.680
Yes!

33:17.680 --> 33:18.680
Genie moats.

33:18.680 --> 33:19.680
CNN.

33:19.680 --> 33:20.680
New York.

33:24.680 --> 33:25.680
Comments?

33:25.680 --> 33:26.680
I don't know.

33:27.680 --> 33:33.680
I would have never thought to tie the life jacket underneath the wood.

33:33.680 --> 33:36.680
That's a weird thing for Mythbusters to be like,

33:36.680 --> 33:39.680
they should have just done this thing everyone would have thought of.

33:39.680 --> 33:40.680
I wouldn't have thought of that?

33:40.680 --> 33:41.680
No!

33:41.680 --> 33:43.680
I'm not taking off my life jacket.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.680
That seems to be step one.

33:45.680 --> 33:46.680
Yeah.

33:51.680 --> 33:54.680
I guess this is more of a Titanic, sorry.

33:54.680 --> 33:58.680
So I just, I, he was going to die.

33:58.680 --> 33:59.680
And what did she supposed to do?

33:59.680 --> 34:00.680
And he's dead.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.680
Keep his body there and hang out.

34:02.680 --> 34:05.680
Swim over to the captain with him to go get the whistle.

34:05.680 --> 34:06.680
That was never going to happen.

34:06.680 --> 34:07.680
Yeah.

34:07.680 --> 34:10.680
I really can't agree more with Ali right now.

34:10.680 --> 34:14.680
It's kind of been her life was better to after the fact.

34:14.680 --> 34:15.680
Honestly.

34:15.680 --> 34:18.680
Like, that was a fling.

34:18.680 --> 34:19.680
That was a moment.

34:19.680 --> 34:22.680
That was a summer camp rendezvous.

34:23.680 --> 34:25.680
She had much better relationship.

34:30.680 --> 34:32.680
Yeah, who cares about Jack?

34:35.680 --> 34:38.680
I guess this date line, I don't know where that came from,

34:38.680 --> 34:42.680
but that was Genie Moose.

34:42.680 --> 34:44.680
My favorite CNN reporter.

34:44.680 --> 34:47.680
Or at least top three.

34:49.680 --> 34:51.680
That's really sweet of you.

34:51.680 --> 34:52.680
You're right.

34:53.680 --> 34:54.680
Constantly.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.680
That was it for News of the Day.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.680
The rest was just relaxing.

35:01.680 --> 35:05.680
So I was wondering, maybe we could talk about your ins and outs.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.680
Ali, do you want to read them out?

35:07.680 --> 35:08.680
No, we can discuss.

35:08.680 --> 35:10.680
Because they weren't earnestly very good.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.680
Everybody did them this year.

35:12.680 --> 35:14.680
Which I did not like yours were good.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.680
And I mean that truly.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.680
Like yours are the only ones that I was like,

35:18.680 --> 35:19.680
Oh, this is funny.

35:19.680 --> 35:20.680
That's actually pointing in.

35:20.680 --> 35:21.680
I agree with that.

35:21.680 --> 35:22.680
That's cool.

35:22.680 --> 35:23.680
You seemed like an arbiter.

35:23.680 --> 35:24.680
At least of taste.

35:24.680 --> 35:27.680
But if not a lot of different other things.

35:27.680 --> 35:28.680
Let me try to find it.

35:28.680 --> 35:31.680
If anyone else wants to to go.

35:31.680 --> 35:33.680
I mean, hey, maybe I got the screenshot on deck.

35:33.680 --> 35:34.680
You have it.

35:34.680 --> 35:35.680
Pull that up already.

35:35.680 --> 35:36.680
Oh, my gosh.

35:36.680 --> 35:37.680
Come on, guys.

35:37.680 --> 35:40.680
So I actually have it.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.680
Okay.

35:42.680 --> 35:43.680
Okay.

35:43.680 --> 35:44.680
Number one.

35:44.680 --> 35:45.680
In.

35:45.680 --> 35:46.680
In for 2023.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.680
Expanded flower budget.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.680
Import it.

35:51.680 --> 35:52.680
I agree.

35:52.680 --> 35:53.680
I didn't got it.

35:53.680 --> 35:54.680
What's that?

35:54.680 --> 35:56.680
I was going to ask, like, what's your routine, though?

35:56.680 --> 36:00.680
Is it like a, you know, a Sunday, you know, before the farmers market?

36:00.680 --> 36:02.680
Is it a random Tuesday?

36:02.680 --> 36:03.680
I'll do so.

36:03.680 --> 36:07.680
I love a Sunday flower at the farmers market.

36:07.680 --> 36:10.680
But also any time I met the grocery store when I.

36:10.680 --> 36:11.680
Yeah.

36:11.680 --> 36:12.680
My card.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.680
It always makes me feel better after.

36:14.680 --> 36:16.680
And then I feel like I'm living in my house.

36:16.680 --> 36:17.680
This is no home.

36:17.680 --> 36:20.680
And by the house, I mean, apart.

36:20.680 --> 36:26.680
I like to imagine Ali walking through a gelsan's AirPods in just like, it's time to make

36:26.680 --> 36:27.680
your house your home.

36:27.680 --> 36:28.680
Pick up the phone.

36:28.680 --> 36:37.680
And then yeah, you grab a bouquet of pee and ease.

36:37.680 --> 36:42.680
Number two, dinner parties.

36:42.680 --> 36:44.680
The pacing of this episode is crazy.

36:45.680 --> 36:47.680
Somehow I'm the host now.

36:47.680 --> 36:48.680
Yeah.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.680
I have a thought on this.

36:50.680 --> 36:51.680
Yeah.

36:51.680 --> 36:53.680
You know, I'll jump in.

36:53.680 --> 36:56.680
Personal chef dinner parties.

36:56.680 --> 36:57.680
Yeah.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.680
That is like a good power move.

36:59.680 --> 37:02.680
I think where it's like not that much more expensive.

37:02.680 --> 37:03.680
Yeah.

37:03.680 --> 37:04.680
Getting pretty go.

37:04.680 --> 37:05.680
Yeah.

37:05.680 --> 37:06.680
Well, it's going to be expensive.

37:06.680 --> 37:11.680
But like, no, it's an experience that I think would be as expensive as a nice restaurant,

37:11.680 --> 37:12.680
right?

37:12.680 --> 37:13.680
Yeah.

37:13.680 --> 37:14.680
Yeah.

37:14.680 --> 37:19.680
I feel like you live the life that I want to live when I'm your age.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.680
I haven't done a dinner party yet like that.

37:21.680 --> 37:23.680
But, no.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.680
Well, I've been to one.

37:25.680 --> 37:26.680
It was lovely.

37:26.680 --> 37:29.680
Well, you live where I want to live when I'm in my 30s.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.680
I guess my point.

37:30.680 --> 37:33.680
Well, I might be renting my house by then.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.680
So that could work.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.680
That could work out.

37:38.680 --> 37:41.680
What's your dress?

37:41.680 --> 37:42.680
I almost gave it.

37:42.680 --> 37:43.680
Oh, my.

37:43.680 --> 37:44.680
Um.

37:44.680 --> 37:45.680
Okay.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.680
I found it if we want to.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.680
Joel has had it.

37:49.680 --> 37:50.680
You didn't believe me.

37:50.680 --> 37:56.680
You didn't believe that these were actually on your list after I said them.

37:56.680 --> 37:57.680
No.

37:57.680 --> 37:58.680
I believed them.

37:58.680 --> 38:01.680
I was like, when I remember doing flowers is the first one.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.680
And when you said it, I went, oh, in my head.

38:04.680 --> 38:05.680
Oh.

38:05.680 --> 38:06.680
Yeah.

38:06.680 --> 38:07.680
That's it.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.680
What's the second one?

38:10.680 --> 38:11.680
I'm psychone was dinner parties.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.680
I'm just going to choose the other ones that I like.

38:14.680 --> 38:15.680
Yeah.

38:15.680 --> 38:17.680
What do you like?

38:17.680 --> 38:19.680
Uh, aportivo's.

38:19.680 --> 38:21.680
That was one of them.

38:21.680 --> 38:22.680
Important.

38:22.680 --> 38:23.680
Yeah.

38:23.680 --> 38:24.680
Important.

38:24.680 --> 38:25.680
Important.

38:25.680 --> 38:26.680
We're talking Italian Amaro.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.680
Amarii, rather.

38:28.680 --> 38:29.680
For the road slash ages.

38:29.680 --> 38:30.680
Well, maybe not for the road.

38:30.680 --> 38:31.680
Because it is alcohol.

38:31.680 --> 38:34.680
You've also already done the large sunglasses one.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.680
Yeah.

38:35.680 --> 38:36.680
I'm over tiny sunglasses.

38:36.680 --> 38:38.680
I don't look good in them.

38:38.680 --> 38:39.680
That's too wide for my face.

38:39.680 --> 38:40.680
Continue.

38:40.680 --> 38:42.680
I liked.

38:42.680 --> 38:49.680
Well, I liked niche movie nights because, I had a few walk party last year, because I was realised

38:49.680 --> 38:52.680
I'd never seen Le Mes the movie.

38:52.680 --> 38:55.680
And I was like, when the helmet I ever going to take the time to do this, it's like a four hour

38:55.680 --> 38:56.680
thing.

38:56.680 --> 38:57.680
Yeah.

38:57.680 --> 39:01.680
Okay, we'll do it as if I like created an adventure around it, so I invited a bunch

39:01.680 --> 39:05.680
of people to my house to watch Le Mes and I only served a loaf of bread.

39:05.680 --> 39:06.680
Yeah.

39:06.680 --> 39:13.080
face. It was really fun. That's very funny. I like when people do shit like that. My friends just did like a

39:13.080 --> 39:23.240
Heather's table read for no reason. Yeah. And I had a panic attack so I didn't end up going. But that's that that's that cool stuff.

39:24.680 --> 39:29.800
I don't know why I'd said it like that. That's the cool shit. That's that cool shit. Yeah, it's awesome.

39:30.760 --> 39:37.160
Oh, no, no, no. What else do you got? What else does Ali have we should say? The search for a signature scent.

39:39.240 --> 39:44.760
Do you guys have a signature scent? Ali have you found it yet? No, I'm always looking though. I keep trying things.

39:44.760 --> 39:52.040
And I have a lot of her. It's also, I have to figure out like a budget situation because perfumes are not. It's so expensive.

39:52.040 --> 39:58.440
And I'm very scared to take a risk. You don't have to hand it to the flower budget. Yeah. Yeah.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.840
But at least perfume lasts. Flowers are fleeting. I'm not arguing for perfume over flowers. I just think

40:05.960 --> 40:11.400
you can justify the price a little bit more. Here's what I also say. Layer. Right? Because everybody wears

40:11.960 --> 40:16.760
you know, certain things and you know, everybody smells the same. You got a layer. So it's like,

40:16.760 --> 40:21.160
that smells good. And like this one thing I've smelled before. But there's that extra little sauce, right?

40:21.160 --> 40:25.480
It's that salt bay thing which Dana and I understand because people come up to us on the street. They say,

40:25.560 --> 40:31.080
are you salt bay? We say, how dare you? Absolutely not. That's why Dana lived up state.

40:31.080 --> 40:35.080
Because he got it too much on the streets of Brooklyn. You gotta get away from Ali attention.

40:37.080 --> 40:38.920
Citrus herbal must for me.

40:41.880 --> 40:49.080
Everybody's trudging through the humidity of me today. No, not at all. I'm so impressed. No, I

40:49.800 --> 40:58.600
definitely add all. And it's impressive. Citrus herbal must. Yes. It's great. It smells good.

41:00.120 --> 41:07.720
But I need a scent, too. But that's probably 24 for me to be honest. I would love to be. Maybe

41:07.720 --> 41:13.000
that's my new goal. My my resolution for this year. I want to be someone we walk by and someone

41:13.000 --> 41:20.360
goes, you smell really good. Yeah. I mean, that's like one of the hottest things that anyone can do

41:20.360 --> 41:30.840
with your cash. It's true. Yeah, I want, I'm going to buy fair mobs. Yeah, done off? No one's ever said that to me.

41:31.800 --> 41:44.600
You're okay? I mean either. I'm not so into the, I've never had a signature scent. I like

41:44.600 --> 41:57.880
always buy deodorant and wear it 75% of the days. And that's that. I did have that phase of like

41:57.880 --> 42:03.800
in high school where if I use Cologne and that's going to increase my chances with women. What a,

42:05.960 --> 42:10.200
as a traumatic experience, probably why I don't go back to Cologne or anything like that because it's just

42:10.920 --> 42:16.360
ski-bee. There was a really powerful and beautiful time in 2007 when I feel like all of the

42:16.360 --> 42:24.040
boys and my grades smelled like Hollister and Abercrombies. Yeah. I felt afraid of the Hollister

42:25.000 --> 42:31.720
thing, but yeah, it, you know, it doesn't work when you're like a 13-year-old

42:32.840 --> 42:37.880
Shelby kid, like it just doesn't work. You're not fit. Let alone Abercrombie.

42:39.880 --> 42:44.760
You're not that guy. Pelt trust me. You're not that guy. Let's keep it going, Joel.

42:46.600 --> 42:52.360
Let's talk about some of the outs. I actually didn't screenshot the outs. The outs are out for me.

42:55.000 --> 43:02.200
Really? Um, nice. That must be what it feels like for you guys on this show. Like here in Joel

43:02.200 --> 43:07.720
say that, I was like, climb in. That's must be how you guys feel every time I say anything, huh?

43:09.400 --> 43:15.240
Yeah, it's kind of interesting playing host. Is, is the head come podcast out in 2023 or

43:16.200 --> 43:18.920
can it be out in 2024? Please can we just get one more year?

43:21.560 --> 43:26.040
I think it was a question for you. Yeah, for video conversation with you. It's in for me.

43:26.040 --> 43:35.240
I really wait. What's that? Holy shit. I have a ton of ideas for this year. So for me, it's in.

43:35.240 --> 43:40.440
I mean, I, I, I cleared up things in my schedule. I want to do a, I want to do a west coast tour

43:40.440 --> 43:46.360
if possible. At the very least, I want to do a show. And then I also want to, I don't want to,

43:46.360 --> 43:51.960
I don't want even want to talk about my ideas for it. I was, I was talking to on yet KC Katie and

43:51.960 --> 43:57.480
Marieka about this last week. Yes. I have an idea for like a mini thing, which I also don't,

43:57.480 --> 44:01.080
I'm going to cut this out because otherwise people are going to be like, yeah, haven't done it yet.

44:01.080 --> 44:05.720
I'm like, I'm fucking going to. It's just what I have in mind requires a little bit of money. And I don't

44:05.800 --> 44:09.320
have a lot of it right now. And the network's not going to give it to me.

44:18.840 --> 44:21.640
Is that all we want to wax about? Is that all you liked about her ins and outs? Because that wasn't

44:21.640 --> 44:25.880
very many drill on. You said you loved it so much so that you screenshot it. Yeah, I really like the

44:25.880 --> 44:32.840
nightlights and the bathrooms one. I did that. I got one and it looks like a candle and it's

44:32.920 --> 44:38.680
light sensitive. So it only turns on when it's dark. And it's like a little flickering flame.

44:38.680 --> 44:45.000
It's also been too because you also have candelabras on here. Oh, yeah. I'm really big into

44:45.000 --> 44:51.480
fanom of the opera decor. Opera core. Opera core, yeah. Phantom core, Phantom of the opera core.

44:52.760 --> 44:57.400
I love that arc for you. I'd love to see. So this is what you, this is what your room looks like now.

44:57.720 --> 45:02.920
This is what you look like now. We'll check in on December. It's just it's January 19th.

45:02.920 --> 45:09.000
Let's we'll check in on November 19th. How about that? I'm setting an actual reminder right now.

45:09.000 --> 45:25.400
Check in with Ali about Phantom of the opera core. Part of what I'm hoping for is that I don't

45:25.400 --> 45:31.720
know what the fuck that means by November. You know, make sure it's for men. I think is

45:31.720 --> 45:35.800
fans of the opera core. I feel like a lot of them have tucked in shirts. That's true.

45:36.600 --> 45:39.560

WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Where is everyone?

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
We're supposed to have Emma Foley in Casey Donnie here on this episode.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
And I have been told that they're in a meeting that's running late, but I was told that at 130.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
It's 153.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Right.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
I don't think meetings run 23 minutes late.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
That's late.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Especially for like a half hour long meeting.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
That's like an extra.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
That feels like a choice.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
This is my point.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Right.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Like they know that they're supposed to be here and they're actively choosing not to.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
And actually feels like the choice.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Ha ha ha.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Here we go.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Hey baby.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
It's hockey's.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Oh.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
And everyone.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
We're all obsessed with your delicate skin.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
So we made our softest diaper ever to help take care of it.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Because when your skin's healthy, you're happy.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Huggies.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
We got you, baby.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
That commercial should be illegal, right?

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Don't talk about my baby's skin.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
It was supposed to be the choice call back.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
And then I was like, uh, now the end is near.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
It's like the prank.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Yeah.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
My way.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Oh, I see.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Frank Sinatra's my way.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Or the 110 North Highway.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Let's get specific.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Yeah.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
It's not just my way or the highway.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
It's a specific song called my way or it's a specific freeway called highway.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Yeah.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Yeah.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Yeah.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
It's a really strange to do this one on one.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Right.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
It feels like more combative.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Because everything is sort of geared focus laser.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Sure.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
At you.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
On me.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Right.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Yeah.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
You guys could have me, but you shouldn't have me.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Do you mind if I.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
If I do folly for this episode.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
For Emma.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
That's pretty good.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
The Emma folly episode.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
You can't just push a record 25 minutes.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
I'm sorry.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Like, you're going to have to hold me back once they do join.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
So that I don't say something uncouth or uncalled for her.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Well, there's a chance they just don't show up right at this point.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
And then what do we do?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
We do this for one minute.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
It's just you and me.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
It could be an interesting special episode.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Yes.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
A one on one.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
A one off.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Right.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
One on one.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Yes.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Exactly.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
You're having a bad time.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Well, I need.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I have an out and 45 minutes.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
I'm going to get a haircut.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Where?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
I do.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
It's sort of near the office.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
But you can see what's going on here.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
It's kind of a.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
It's getting on the longer side of Rully.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
It's getting on the kioserd.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
As in it's absurd that it's on the side of kio.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Thank you.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
That was kiosir doing now today.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
I looked it up today.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
And he's not doing well.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
It seems.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Really.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Like, do you want to see one of his latest TikToks?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
It's just kind of sad.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Like, um.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
It feels like he lost his following.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Oh, it's interesting.

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
Now that we've had TikTok long enough to have somebody rise and fall in fame.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Um, here we go.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Where is the.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Okay.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
So like this is something that he did the other day.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Are you certain?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
No, what was my hug?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
It's got my joy.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Scott, my new this year.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Yeah.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
I like car.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
This is a good haircut in spout for me.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
I guess the bowl is back.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
This one got me.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
No joke.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Like, none of these are setups.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
It's not actually jokes.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
You can say kio v.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
This that and the other.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
But if there isn't something funny, then it was just a setup.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
And that's coming from me, the host of this show.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Mio and kio.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Um.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Your camera is wobbling.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Like, is it on a very loose desk or something?

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
It's on a sofa arm.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Oh, yeah.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
I can see that.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Yeah.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Um, this is just the best lighting in the house right now.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
It kind of changes throughout the day because I live in Laurel Canyon.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
No.

05:14.000 --> 05:22.000
But I wonder if you, your sacrificing a stable angle for the the goat lighting.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I mean, what is what's worse.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
I feel like the dark grainyness of it is not worth the stability of the the shot.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Right.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
The truth.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Sorry.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Let me finish.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I was just saying the stability of the shot.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
To who?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
To you?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
He said to Billy.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
No, I said this stability of the shot.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
That's not like if you're not actually.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Sorry, because I actually put a lot of time and energy and effort into these episodes.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Right.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
So if you're not going to like listen to what I say to you on the show.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Let's just call it a day.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
I'm listening.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
You leave the zoom and that's the episode.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Let's call it a day then.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
I don't want to be here either.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Six, eleven, twenty, five seconds.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I'm so happy to be here.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
This is amazing.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
My bond of the week is key.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Quam.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Was that an impression of him at the top?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Like, what was that?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I'm so happy to be here.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
This is amazing.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Yeah.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
Like he kind of has that unbridled joy for an ungurdled goi.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
This is not Jewish.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Right.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
And he doesn't wear a belt.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
I guess he doesn't have a corset.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Yeah.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Record that.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Okay.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
You can be in big movies and not necessarily be rich about it.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
I was talking to Billy Brickett.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
So you were talking to Billy.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
It's the ability.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
I was talking to the ability.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
And he was like, yeah, did the Jesse Eisenberg movie.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
And now it's like, I'm not rich.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Yeah.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Yeah.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
You can be famous, but not rich.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
And you can be rich, but not famous.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yes.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Yes.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Of course.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Right.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
You know, there's a lot of, what's that?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Which one would you rather be?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I want to be Jim Stire.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Who?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
The presidential billionaire?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Can't do that.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Got it.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
So you want to be so rich.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
You can occasionally run for president, but ultimately not so famous that you can't just go out.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Probably.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Exactly right.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
So Jim Stire can go to the grocery store.

07:35.000 --> 07:42.000
You can go to a lot of lessons, but also you want to go to Alaska.

07:42.000 --> 07:51.000
He can equal parts go to a lot of lessons or Alaska to campaign alongside Tim King.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
The pride.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Right.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
You're real to live as being whittled down.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Right.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Right.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I guess I would go.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
Who's the go bond of the week?

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
You don't have to put that much pressure on it.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
It really doesn't have to be the best one we've ever done.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Is this episode coming out tomorrow or a week from tomorrow?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
A week from tomorrow?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Who's on tomorrow's it?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
It's the live stream episode.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Hmm.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
So I wasn't there for that.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
No.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
Let's go.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
John.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Rees.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Davies.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Who?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
John.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
I heard you.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I don't know who that is.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Yeah.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
I'm not really sure either.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Let me look it up.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Probably an actor.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
I think.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
On you says sorry.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
They're still going.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
How pissed is a mirror.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
John rees Davies.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
All right.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
He's an actor from all over Indiana Jones.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
So he actually worked with Key.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Key.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Key.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Keygan Michael.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Key.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Yes.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Exactly.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Yeah.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Yes.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
John rees Davies.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
They sit on your text at you and said that they're still running late.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
But planning on coming or it's like it's not.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
It's not Casey's fault.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
I have to blame anyone.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Let's blame Emma.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Right?

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Because she hasn't been there for me in the way Casey has.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Yeah.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Here he is.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Yes.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
We're rolling.

09:30.000 --> 09:38.000
Welcome to the new age to the new age to the big show.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
No, we are rolling.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Nine minutes deep.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I was talking to somebody the other day and they were like,

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Oh, they're a photographer.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Or no, sorry.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
They're a hair stylist on like photo shoots.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
And I was like, oh, I could be done any like big shoots.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
And they were like, I would usually work with Imagine Dragons.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
And I was like, okay.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
So you're like a millionaire.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
How much do you think a hair stylist gets paid per shoot?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
I don't know.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Fifty hundred grand.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
That's a lot.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
It's a lot.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
A lot of grand.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Yeah.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
A lot.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Sure.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
A hair stylist.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Casey, who's your bond of the week?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Oh, my god.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Right.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Okay.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Casey was in a meeting 28 seconds.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Yeah.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
I feel like you made that louder on my end.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
You're just not active.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I only made it one second.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
I only made it louder on the high end.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
My bond.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Oh, you guys.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
No.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
That was.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
I was a not joke.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
You shouldn't have been mad at us for that.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Em was not even here.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
It's five PM there.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Yeah.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
It's late.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
We're just in a meeting.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
I was in a meeting with Emma.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
So what was the meeting?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
I was curious.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
What is the meeting?

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Because it ran so late.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
We were talking live stream ideas.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Classic.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Yeah.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Sorry.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Jeff, you don't have to know about it.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Because it's, let's just say, no.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I'm surprised.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Let's call it double trouble.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Jeff's 48 hour lives.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
He thinks.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
It's funny.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Because surprising you again, would almost be equally as surprising as surprise.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
Because there's no way we would do it twice.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.400
What I will say is I would be down to do it again.

11:34.400 --> 11:38.000
You guys just picked the worst weekend it could have possibly been.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
No.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
And if it had more time to do it again.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I think that's true.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
I'm just always like not only cranky, but aching for some hanky pinky.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Well, this is actually good time.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah.

11:51.000 --> 11:58.000
That was episode is the live stream episode of the headgun podcast.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
And it was mostly you and Casey on the show.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Yeah.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
And I actually got grief for not coming back and doing the headgun podcast.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
But I didn't even know that you guys were doing it at the end of a stream.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
So like when I had family in town, like yeah, I can get brunch with my brothers and my

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
sisters.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
And then I'm like checking Twitter.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
And they're like, I can't fucking believe a mirror didn't come back.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
And I'm like, come back, come back for what?

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
And it was this whole like controversy that spiraled out there.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
So I'm curious to listen to this episode, which I guess people can now listen to.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
Because it came out last week by the time we did this.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I'm curious.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
I thought you knew what the schedule was because I was told that you were it was your idea

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
to surprise me.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
So I was angry that you had that episode.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
I'm curious.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
What is this idea?

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
Well, I pitched doing a 24 hour live stream.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
But then you said, and we shouldn't tell Jeff about it.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
I'll take credit for it because that is a funny idea.

13:02.000 --> 13:08.000
Well, I, the karma of it all is that I feel like in a content meeting last summer,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
I pitched the idea of doing a headgum all nighter.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Not what I meant though.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
I didn't mean this.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Right.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Because the power is probably what it's the face.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Twelve hours is an all night warning.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
But the 24 hour plus the surprise.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Yeah.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Also, I wouldn't have done it for charity.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Like, I'm sorry, but why?

13:26.000 --> 13:33.000
There shouldn't have been that element to it of like helping people who kind of need, you know, access or expanded access.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Are you able to still take in donations?

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Yeah.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
You know, why would we not?

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
There's, there has to be cash involved to the rise.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
The cows can't come home.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
And Emma's still not here.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
The meeting that Casey was just in that we confirmed is over.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Emma's not here.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
36 minutes late past the time.

13:56.000 --> 14:04.000
And I guess at a certain point, my time becomes not even devalue, but invaluable.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Because it's awesome.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
Amir, what did you think the ending of the live stream was going to be?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
I don't know.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
Because people were working very hard on the schedule of it.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Like, the things that would happen every hour.

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
It was, I think you, in Ania, Katie, a lot of people were working behind the scenes on.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
Pack, making sure that there was something for every hour that Jeff is in there mostly.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Right.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
But I wasn't entirely hands-on on like, oh, we should do this.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
10 this at 11 this at noon or midnight, whenever.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
So I was sort of hearing it as it was coming on.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
And I would like, you know, check in on the live stream.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
I called in once or twice.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
But I didn't like have planned in my schedule.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Like, oh, come back at 11 for the headgon podcast.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Because again, for sure.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I had this family brunch situation.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
So tell me who did work on the schedule the most?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Uh, yeah.

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
It was, uh, Ania, Allie, me, Katie.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Absolutely you.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
You were there the entire 24 hours.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
They did more scheduling.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
And I was there physically making sure everything stayed on schedule.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
But your plan was not to stay the whole time, right?

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
You were like, yeah, I'll stay to late night and then leave and come back occasionally.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Uh, yeah, originally.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
I mean, honestly, I kind of expected if I was going to sleep,

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
I would have maybe taken an app on a couch.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Uh, for a little bit.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Uh, I think there should have been like a Betty by segment.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Right?

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
We're like, we did give you a sleeping bag and pajamas at one point.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Right.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
But then there was no time built in.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Yeah.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Yeah.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
There was no time that there wasn't something happening.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Yeah.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
I think there should have been like a Betty by segment.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
Like who's somebody that with like a notoriously relaxing voice?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Um, Joe La Truglio.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
I was going to say Joe Paras famous for really.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Oh, four.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Like he has like specials that are like Joe talks to you to sleeper.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
And we could have gotten him easily.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
This is just Jake's brother and law is his best friend.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Hey.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
Um, but yeah, I think I was expecting more out of Emma.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
You know, in general, like not only on the stream, but also like going forward

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
hence their after.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
And then it just, she's kind of let me down in that specific regard.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Um, pretty consistently too.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
So I don't even feel bad saying that.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
I'm sorry.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Did I interrupt?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Did I interrupt anything?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
No, no.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
We were talking about baseball.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
We were talking about live stream and you said that Emma let you down.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
No, it was just like, America's past time pretty much.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
And what way?

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
Me, I'm all letting you down.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
No, I just said that because you were joining.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
And I wanted you to think we were talking about you.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
He hasn't been talking about you.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Jokes on you because I didn't even hear.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Hmm.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Shit.

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
Emma, if you had any tweaks or suggestions to change about the 24 hour

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
Jeff stream, what would you say was the biggest issue that we could have avoided?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Hmm.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
I think for Jeff's sake.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
And I'm going to extend an olive branch branch to Jeff.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
Despite how I was, uh, how I was graded.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
I would put the people that Jeff didn't know as well earlier in the live stream

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
to cause him less kind of emotional pain.

17:41.000 --> 17:47.000
God, it's the more strangers up top because you can coast on a natural adrenaline of hosting the stream.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
And then late at night, slash early morning when he needed the emotional support to have a friendly face.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Yeah.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Yeah.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Did that?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Is that resonating with you, Jeff?

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
That ring's true.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah.

17:59.000 --> 18:07.000
That would have probably solved slash solved all.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
We are recording.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
We should say.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Yeah.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
I mean, I don't think what Emma said was too.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Rists.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
No, I mean, just to make sure that she's recording sound.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Hi, Emma.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
I'm sorry.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
It's more visually.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
I'm having some trouble with this.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
It's time for an Oscar's recap.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
The Oscars were when you're hearing this two Sundays ago.

18:35.000 --> 18:42.000
But for us recording it today, it was five days ago.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Um, what did you guys think?

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
I mean, in case you're like pretty close with the Daniels, no?

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Pretty close is an exaggeration.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
But I have known them for for a very long time.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
I was very, very proud of my boys.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Did you go to Emma's award?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Did you know that?

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
No.

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
I actually know them through Vimeo back back in the day when I worked at Vimeo.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
They started putting their stuff out.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Then.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
And so we would like to have them at the content stuff.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Yeah.

19:16.000 --> 19:23.000
So yeah, I met, I met them through that.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
And it's funny.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
No, not actually.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I don't know them for, I didn't go to Emerson.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
So I don't know them from that.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
I actually know them from this kink club in the valley.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
I used to go to these sensation play, Johns.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
And I used to see if not quann, definitely the other one.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Shiner.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Shiner.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Yeah.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
Shiner's after some impact play sessions too.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
He likes to get the shit beat out of him on camera.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
He's sort of camboying.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I mean, yeah.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
That's in the movie.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Like.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
What movie are you talking about?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
I have no idea.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Oh, that's picture.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Oscar award winning everything everywhere.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
All the ones.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
I didn't see it.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
I didn't see it.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
This is great.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Um, Emma, how are you?

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I'm doing all right.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Yeah.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
How's that short film that you're working on?

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Good.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
I'm getting the edit back on Tuesday, actually.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
What's the, is the tone of it?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Is it a comedy?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Or is it more hard drama?

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Is it drama?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
No, I think, no, it's funny.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I wouldn't call it a drama.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
It's funny.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
The annoying way that I've been pitching it is, uh,

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
like kind of like a mumble core with like a very high octane

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
through line narrative.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
That's fun.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Wow.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
So it's kind of like,

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
that's kind of a juxtaposition in the way.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Yeah.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
And the tone is dead, Pan.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
But the actions happening are crazy to have.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Yes.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Yeah.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Should we do a lot?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Sorry.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
One second.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Should we do?

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Go on.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Should we do a live?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Go on.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
Directors commentary when it comes out on the show.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
If you want to do that, I'll let you watch it first.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
If you want to do that, I'm gay.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
All right.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Cool.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
We do really have to move on.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
It doesn't seem like we have that much time for this Oscars recap.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Uh, basically, what do we, what do we get to?

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
That Casey knows them from fucking Vimeo staff fix?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Like, what even is that?

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
Like, we didn't even talk about Paul Mescal's Cartier Tanks Genoa.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
We didn't even talk about how Michelle, Michelle, Michelle, you know, according

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
to RM exudes luxury, which is probably probably the highest compliment someone can receive.

21:47.000 --> 21:55.000
We didn't even talk about Kiwi quans rise from the ashes of Phoenician.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Is that the right word?

21:57.000 --> 22:04.800
Um, tail, arc, Noah's or otherwise, and also we didn't talk about how according to

22:04.800 --> 22:10.000
the producer of everything, if you were all at once, never put a human being ahead of

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
profits.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.400
Do you want to talk about that?

22:18.400 --> 22:19.400
He missedpoke.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.200
Did you guys catch that?

22:21.200 --> 22:26.320
He was like, and it's like my old, my dad always said, never put a human being ahead

22:26.320 --> 22:27.320
of profits.

22:27.320 --> 22:33.320
I'm like, your dad was an asshole, I think.

22:33.320 --> 22:36.320
I didn't, I didn't know that that was part of the speech.

22:36.320 --> 22:39.320
I couldn't, I couldn't hear the speech.

22:39.320 --> 22:40.320
I'm here.

22:40.320 --> 22:44.320
Never put a human being.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.320
Sorry, you're muted.

22:46.320 --> 22:52.320
Why is that a mistake never put a human being ahead of profits?

22:52.320 --> 22:54.320
This is why, this is why he's the boss.

22:54.320 --> 22:55.320
Yeah.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.320
It sounds like that's the correct thing.

22:58.320 --> 23:04.320
Like, don't put people in front of money or something.

23:04.320 --> 23:05.320
Right.

23:05.320 --> 23:09.320
I just think most people would say, like, you know, humans are important in cash.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.320
I see.

23:10.320 --> 23:15.320
Did he mean profit like the profit?

23:15.320 --> 23:16.320
Oh, yeah.

23:16.320 --> 23:19.320
Yeah.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.320
Okay.

23:20.320 --> 23:21.320
So just.

23:26.320 --> 23:28.320
Onto we are back.

23:28.320 --> 23:31.320
I'm going to Paris in a week.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.320
Why?

23:36.320 --> 23:38.320
It's actually a good question.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.320
It's pretty far away.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.320
Uh, Jevus Ray.

23:47.320 --> 23:49.320
Are you going to vomit?

23:49.320 --> 23:52.320
You're going to work on Mont francé.

23:52.320 --> 23:54.320
A Vec.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.320
Lé.

23:55.320 --> 23:56.320
Parisians.

23:59.320 --> 24:02.320
You're going to work on your French in Paris.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.320
Yeah.

24:03.320 --> 24:05.320
With Parisians.

24:05.320 --> 24:08.320
I took a use of French in high school.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.320
Because I didn't.

24:09.320 --> 24:11.320
Eight years of English.

24:11.320 --> 24:12.320
Middle school.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.320
The end of high school.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.320
Uh-huh.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.320
Uh, we do really have to move on.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.320
Let's talk about March madness.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.320
Brackets.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.320
Headgums doing a March madness.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.320
Bracket challenge.

24:24.320 --> 24:25.320
Emma, did you do one?

24:25.320 --> 24:26.320
No.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.320
I didn't.

24:27.320 --> 24:28.320
Okay.

24:28.320 --> 24:29.320
So let's make this quick.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.320
Sorry.

24:30.320 --> 24:35.320
Uh, Ryan Chambers already busted because he had UVA winning.

24:35.320 --> 24:36.320
I did hear that.

24:36.320 --> 24:40.320
And if I could just pull up what happened today.

24:40.320 --> 24:45.320
Uh, it's pretty funny if you had UVA going all the way.

24:46.320 --> 24:47.320
Uh, go, you know.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.320
Go cabs.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.320
A crazy pick.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.320
This is what.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.320
We're going out there.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.320
Along with Shepherd.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.320
But if that's free to shoot.

24:55.320 --> 24:56.320
Make it to your turn.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.320
Wow.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.320
What a shot.

25:05.320 --> 25:06.320
Just Ryan.

25:06.320 --> 25:07.320
Like.

25:13.320 --> 25:14.320
All right.

25:14.320 --> 25:14.820
Let's keep it going.

25:14.820 --> 25:15.820
Uh, Mexico City.

25:15.820 --> 25:16.820
Let's start.

25:16.820 --> 25:17.820
Let's talk about it.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.820
It was your sports report.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.820
Mexico City, CDMX.

25:23.820 --> 25:25.820
Why does everybody keep visiting there?

25:28.820 --> 25:30.820
I mean, you've been twice in two years.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.820
That's not true.

25:32.820 --> 25:33.820
It's not true.

25:33.820 --> 25:34.820
Yeah.

25:34.820 --> 25:35.820
Yeah.

25:35.820 --> 25:36.820
You're all over the place, man.

25:36.820 --> 25:38.820
First you said, I'm going to Paris.

25:38.820 --> 25:41.820
Then you're like, let's watch your basketball highlight.

25:41.820 --> 25:43.820
Now we're going back to Mexico City.

25:43.820 --> 25:45.820
It's like hanging out with my five year old nephew.

25:45.820 --> 25:46.820
Yeah.

25:46.820 --> 25:47.820
Black little.

25:47.820 --> 25:50.820
Just you have to just kind of let me tire myself out.

25:50.820 --> 25:51.820
Yeah.

25:51.820 --> 25:52.820
Usually, but.

25:52.820 --> 25:57.820
I think what's nice about Mexico City is that it feels like a very European city.

25:57.820 --> 25:59.820
Like you're transported halfway across the world.

25:59.820 --> 26:01.820
But it's like three hour flight from LA.

26:01.820 --> 26:03.820
It feels like a huge.

26:03.820 --> 26:07.820
Cultural geographical flipping the off.

26:07.820 --> 26:10.820
Shift on such a short flight.

26:10.820 --> 26:11.820
Sure.

26:11.820 --> 26:12.820
Besides like, you know,

26:12.820 --> 26:16.820
the normal things like the food, the people, the architecture.

26:16.820 --> 26:20.820
It's a very nice, walkable, affordable city.

26:20.820 --> 26:21.820
Yeah.

26:21.820 --> 26:23.820
The dollar goes pretty far there.

26:23.820 --> 26:24.820
If I'm not mistaken.

26:24.820 --> 26:25.820
Yeah.

26:25.820 --> 26:28.820
You don't have to fly to Paris, basically.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.820
I feel like you're traveling very far.

26:30.820 --> 26:31.820
Yeah.

26:31.820 --> 26:33.820
They don't speak French and Mexico City now.

26:33.820 --> 26:34.820
Yeah.

26:34.820 --> 26:36.820
You're going to go into Montreal or something.

26:38.820 --> 26:39.820
Really?

26:39.820 --> 26:40.820
Sure.

26:40.820 --> 26:41.820
Sure.

26:42.820 --> 26:47.820
What's the bare minimum occasion that calls for champagne?

26:58.820 --> 27:00.820
Answer me.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.820
You're thirsty?

27:03.820 --> 27:05.820
It's pretty good.

27:05.820 --> 27:07.820
It's pretty good.

27:12.820 --> 27:16.820
I'm a what's your answer?

27:16.820 --> 27:18.820
I really like champagne.

27:18.820 --> 27:21.820
So I actually would drink it.

27:21.820 --> 27:23.820
Not to quench thirst, but on any,

27:23.820 --> 27:25.820
any night that I was having a drink,

27:25.820 --> 27:26.820
I'd be happy to drink champagne.

27:26.820 --> 27:27.820
So like you go out,

27:27.820 --> 27:29.820
you get one drink with a friend.

27:29.820 --> 27:31.820
You got a glass of champagne?

27:31.820 --> 27:32.820
No.

27:32.820 --> 27:33.820
Well, no.

27:33.820 --> 27:34.820
I can't do that.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.820
But I will get a compari spritz.

27:37.820 --> 27:38.820
Compari spritz.

27:38.820 --> 27:39.820
Very good.

27:40.820 --> 27:41.820
Which is just like,

27:41.820 --> 27:42.820
yeah.

27:42.820 --> 27:43.820
Sorry.

27:43.820 --> 27:44.820
Sorry.

27:44.820 --> 27:46.820
Where'd you go?

27:46.820 --> 27:50.820
I went to a cafe,

27:50.820 --> 27:51.820
the other day,

27:51.820 --> 27:53.820
and they had compari spritz.

27:53.820 --> 27:54.820
And,

27:54.820 --> 27:56.820
$18.

27:56.820 --> 27:58.820
They're going to say,

27:58.820 --> 27:59.820
18 spritzes.

27:59.820 --> 28:00.820
I wish.

28:00.820 --> 28:02.820
Maybe if you want to spend half your months

28:02.820 --> 28:05.820
and rent on compari and soda water.

28:05.820 --> 28:08.820
Be my guest.

28:09.820 --> 28:12.820
What?

28:12.820 --> 28:15.820
Well,

28:15.820 --> 28:17.820
was that leading into something?

28:17.820 --> 28:18.820
No, that wasn't anything.

28:18.820 --> 28:20.820
Let's just move on.

28:20.820 --> 28:22.820
First Republic Bank reached a rescue deal

28:22.820 --> 28:23.820
with other lenders,

28:23.820 --> 28:27.820
and we'll receive $30 billion in deposits.

28:27.820 --> 28:30.820
Why don't I ever get $30 billion in deposits?

28:30.820 --> 28:34.820
I fuck up all the time.

28:34.820 --> 28:37.820
Banks get bailed out,

28:37.820 --> 28:39.820
but then I forget to upload the headgum podcast

28:39.820 --> 28:40.820
on a Friday,

28:40.820 --> 28:42.820
and I don't get a fucking stipend.

28:42.820 --> 28:43.820
Yeah.

28:43.820 --> 28:44.820
Yeah.

28:44.820 --> 28:45.820
Really?

28:45.820 --> 28:48.820
The rich get richer, I guess.

28:48.820 --> 28:49.820
Right.

28:49.820 --> 28:50.820
What about the rich get bad?

28:50.820 --> 28:52.820
What about the rich get Richard?

28:52.820 --> 28:53.820
Meaning?

28:53.820 --> 28:54.820
Richard kind?

28:54.820 --> 28:56.820
Yeah.

28:56.820 --> 28:57.820
No.

28:57.820 --> 29:00.820
I love that.

29:00.820 --> 29:01.820
He is great.

29:01.820 --> 29:02.820
He's great in the other two.

29:02.820 --> 29:04.820
You guys ever see the other two?

29:04.820 --> 29:05.820
Yeah.

29:07.820 --> 29:08.820
No.

29:08.820 --> 29:10.820
He's great in everything.

29:22.820 --> 29:25.820
Welcome to Confucius or Lucius.

29:25.820 --> 29:27.820
Have you guys ever played this game?

29:27.820 --> 29:28.820
No.

29:28.820 --> 29:30.820
Only on my own.

29:30.820 --> 29:31.820
Of course.

29:31.820 --> 29:32.820
And you can do it on your own.

29:32.820 --> 29:33.820
It's just kind of,

29:33.820 --> 29:35.820
it's already sad to play with other people

29:35.820 --> 29:36.820
to do it on your own.

29:37.820 --> 29:38.820
It's like hot.

29:38.820 --> 29:41.820
I'm going to list out some quotes.

29:41.820 --> 29:45.820
And you guys have to attribute them to either Confucius.

29:45.820 --> 29:47.820
The, I think,

29:47.820 --> 29:51.820
Taoist philosopher or Lucius,

29:51.820 --> 29:53.820
the Brooklyn-based indie band,

29:53.820 --> 29:55.820
that scored,

29:55.820 --> 29:56.820
basically,

29:56.820 --> 29:57.820
Lonely and Horny,

29:57.820 --> 29:59.820
Amir's Vimeo series.

29:59.820 --> 30:00.820
Yeah.

30:00.820 --> 30:02.820
We actually got connected with them.

30:02.820 --> 30:04.820
Because their family,

30:05.820 --> 30:08.820
my mom and friends with friends with her dentist.

30:08.820 --> 30:09.820
Yeah.

30:09.820 --> 30:11.820
Her aunt or something Jessica's,

30:11.820 --> 30:13.820
who's in the band,

30:13.820 --> 30:14.820
her aunt.

30:14.820 --> 30:17.820
And then we just became fans of theirs.

30:17.820 --> 30:18.820
Yeah.

30:18.820 --> 30:19.820
That music's really good.

30:19.820 --> 30:20.820
Here we go.

30:20.820 --> 30:21.820
And up since then, you know.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.820
Sure.

30:22.820 --> 30:27.820
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.

30:27.820 --> 30:29.820
Confucius or Lucius.

30:30.820 --> 30:32.820
I'm going Confucius.

30:33.820 --> 30:34.820
Same.

30:34.820 --> 30:36.820
I mean, you wouldn't have said it in those words.

30:36.820 --> 30:39.820
Girl!

30:39.820 --> 30:42.820
Yeah, he would have used Mandarin Chinese.

30:42.820 --> 30:44.820
Yeah, totally.

30:44.820 --> 30:49.820
We'll only be bound by the things we choose.

30:52.820 --> 30:54.820
I'll go Lucius.

30:54.820 --> 30:56.820
I'll say Confucius.

30:56.820 --> 30:58.820
Sure.

30:58.820 --> 31:01.820
Confucius again.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.820
Who ever said Lucius is correct.

31:06.820 --> 31:08.820
All right.

31:08.820 --> 31:12.820
Dusty trails can lead you to a golden road.

31:16.820 --> 31:17.820
Well.

31:17.820 --> 31:19.820
Lucius again.

31:19.820 --> 31:20.820
Yeah, I'll say Lucius.

31:20.820 --> 31:22.820
Show me Lucius.

31:24.820 --> 31:27.820
That's absolutely correct.

31:27.820 --> 31:29.820
Um.

31:29.820 --> 31:30.820
Sorry.

31:32.820 --> 31:35.820
Never give a sword to a man who can't dance.

31:39.820 --> 31:42.820
Never give a sword to a man who can't dance.

31:44.820 --> 31:45.820
Lucius.

31:45.820 --> 31:47.820
I don't know your, but it feels like a song there.

31:47.820 --> 31:48.820
Yeah.

31:48.820 --> 31:51.820
I'll think Confucius.

31:51.820 --> 31:53.820
Oh, let's correct.

31:53.820 --> 31:55.820
That was Confucius.

31:55.820 --> 31:56.820
You must never give this one.

31:56.820 --> 31:57.820
You must never give this one.

31:57.820 --> 31:58.820
You must never give this one.

31:58.820 --> 31:59.820
Yeah.

31:59.820 --> 32:01.820
He sort of he would often speak and rhyming.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.820
I think I was going to do this.

32:03.820 --> 32:04.820
Uh.

32:04.820 --> 32:07.820
We could live forever if only we closed our eyes.

32:11.820 --> 32:12.820
Yeah.

32:12.820 --> 32:14.820
That's god of elusius.

32:14.820 --> 32:16.820
I guess this game sucks.

32:16.820 --> 32:17.820
Uh.

32:17.820 --> 32:18.820
All right.

32:18.820 --> 32:20.820
I want you to.

32:22.820 --> 32:24.820
I want you to.

32:24.820 --> 32:26.820
I want you to be everything.

32:26.820 --> 32:28.820
That's you.

32:28.820 --> 32:32.180
you to be everything that's you.

32:35.780 --> 32:37.380
I hope it's not conditions.

32:40.100 --> 32:41.140
That's Lucius.

32:44.740 --> 32:46.020
Yeah, yeah, it's Lucius.

32:47.060 --> 32:49.220
Lucius says that.

32:49.700 --> 32:55.860
Wow. He's been saying that. I want you to be everything that's you.

32:59.220 --> 33:00.340
Done, honey.

33:00.340 --> 33:00.900
It's enough.

33:00.900 --> 33:01.380
I want to put them in.

33:03.060 --> 33:06.260
Silence is a true friend who never betrays.

33:11.460 --> 33:11.940
Lucius?

33:13.220 --> 33:18.660
I'll go Confucius. I keep going Lucius. Confucius to me too. Confucius said that.

33:19.380 --> 33:20.740
So bad at this game.

33:20.740 --> 33:22.820
Pretty late. It's so many times on my own.

33:25.220 --> 33:26.820
Ah, it's Confucius.

33:26.900 --> 33:27.380
Shit!

33:29.060 --> 33:30.740
Better give your heart than never give it all.

33:36.100 --> 33:36.740
Confucius.

33:37.700 --> 33:38.100
Wrong.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.300
Actually, that was Lucius.

33:39.300 --> 33:41.220
I was just so ready for you guys to get it right.

33:41.540 --> 33:43.060
That was Confucius or Lucius.

33:43.620 --> 33:46.340
We've got one last segment coming up. This one's going to take about an hour and a half.

33:46.340 --> 33:46.820
Is that all right?

33:50.580 --> 33:51.780
Are we watching a movie?

33:52.660 --> 33:54.900
Yeah, do you guys might be watching Speed Racer again?

33:55.300 --> 33:55.860
Yeah.

33:56.500 --> 33:57.140
Um...

33:58.820 --> 34:00.420
Let's get ready to home-bomb!

34:07.380 --> 34:08.020
Speed Racer!

34:09.540 --> 34:11.220
This is a segment I like to call,

34:11.220 --> 34:12.740
let's get ready to crumble,

34:12.740 --> 34:15.700
which is about humbling me until I mumble and grumble.

34:20.180 --> 34:20.820
Okay.

34:20.820 --> 34:23.460
One by one, you guys have to humble me

34:23.540 --> 34:25.700
until I sort of crumble and grumble.

34:26.900 --> 34:27.940
How do we humble you?

34:28.820 --> 34:30.660
That's where the fun of it is.

34:33.620 --> 34:36.100
By insulting you, like the opposite.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.860
I don't think it should just be insults,

34:37.860 --> 34:40.500
because if they're just insulting, I'll be all like shut down

34:40.500 --> 34:41.940
and I won't hear the feedback.

34:41.940 --> 34:46.260
If it's genuine feedback, then I will have to not only be humbled,

34:46.260 --> 34:48.420
but also I'll eventually crumble and grumble.

34:48.500 --> 34:53.460
Mm-hmm, okay.

34:54.500 --> 34:56.340
That's also, let's hold all ships to the end.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.300
I've been drinking the entire episode.

35:00.180 --> 35:00.980
Mike, just cut out.

35:04.980 --> 35:05.700
Sorry, Casey.

35:12.740 --> 35:16.900
I'll go to the, you know, everyone's old favorite song.

35:16.900 --> 35:18.900
You're, you're really bad communicator.

35:20.500 --> 35:25.380
Even even in the meeting Emma and I were in before this,

35:26.260 --> 35:30.180
Anil was was saying, like, well, I texted Jeff that you'd be late,

35:30.180 --> 35:32.980
but he hasn't given any sort of response.

35:34.340 --> 35:37.060
So it's so hard to talk to you because

35:38.580 --> 35:40.980
we never know if you're even listening.

35:40.980 --> 35:42.020
Here's what I'll say.

35:43.620 --> 35:45.300
Look at these timestamps.

35:47.140 --> 35:48.660
I can't really see that.

35:48.660 --> 35:51.700
133 she texted me and I responded at 133.

35:52.820 --> 35:53.540
Wow.

35:53.540 --> 35:57.380
Oh, so you didn't respond to was her asking how mad a mirror was,

35:57.380 --> 35:59.380
which didn't feel like it actually needed a response,

35:59.380 --> 36:01.460
because it was like, oh, they'll just join when the meetings over.

36:02.500 --> 36:03.220
Interesting.

36:03.220 --> 36:06.100
But in general, you're absolutely correct.

36:08.020 --> 36:09.300
But are you humbled for that?

36:09.300 --> 36:10.420
Yeah, are you crumbling?

36:10.420 --> 36:12.100
No, that's why you guys have to, you know,

36:12.100 --> 36:14.180
it has to like, you have to be do better than that.

36:15.140 --> 36:16.740
I know that I'm a bad communicator.

36:16.740 --> 36:17.940
And frankly, I don't care.

36:19.940 --> 36:20.580
What if anything?

36:20.580 --> 36:22.580
You're doing better than before we started thinking.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.980
If anything, this is making you happy.

36:32.100 --> 36:32.580
Continue.

36:33.380 --> 36:34.340
Emma's turn, I guess?

36:35.940 --> 36:36.500
I don't know.

36:36.500 --> 36:38.260
I don't know what my feedback for you is, Jeff.

36:39.060 --> 36:42.100
I think what this is like, Emma's like,

36:42.180 --> 36:44.580
you could stand a lose five to 10 pounds.

36:44.580 --> 36:44.820
Yeah.

36:45.860 --> 36:47.140
Oh, short, easy.

36:47.140 --> 36:50.420
I'll start soft and get it in the way.

36:53.060 --> 36:55.060
You should come to New York more.

36:55.060 --> 36:56.820
You shouldn't be so LA-based.

36:56.820 --> 36:59.700
I think it's limiting your comedy and your personal growth.

37:00.420 --> 37:01.140
That's mine.

37:01.540 --> 37:02.740
I'm glad I'm glad.

37:02.740 --> 37:04.180
It's hard, you know, because I do things like I

37:04.180 --> 37:05.940
just spend money on trips to Paris, so

37:06.660 --> 37:07.780
into New York.

37:07.780 --> 37:08.580
So I did get to New York.

37:08.580 --> 37:09.620
That one kind of stun.

37:09.620 --> 37:10.020
Emma here.

37:10.980 --> 37:14.740
Um, so I'm starting to get defensive.

37:16.660 --> 37:19.460
I honestly don't know the point of this game, but like...

37:19.460 --> 37:19.780
Why?

37:20.420 --> 37:23.380
Like, I don't know if you want us to compliment or insult you.

37:23.380 --> 37:25.060
Like, let's more humbling.

37:25.060 --> 37:28.100
Humble me until I crumble and grumble.

37:28.100 --> 37:28.740
Right.

37:28.740 --> 37:29.860
That is the assignment.

37:29.860 --> 37:31.620
By the way, Emma understood the assignment.

37:31.620 --> 37:32.900
Casey understood the assignment.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.460
You didn't understand the assignment.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.060
Yeah.

37:37.060 --> 37:39.620
I guess I'm sorry I didn't come back for the

37:39.620 --> 37:43.380
head-gum podcast to end the live stream.

37:43.380 --> 37:47.780
But I really, I did have to a familiar obligation like my

37:47.780 --> 37:49.460
nieces were in town for the first time.

37:49.460 --> 37:50.260
Yeah.

37:50.260 --> 37:52.900
Since the pandemic, so I had to prioritize that.

37:52.900 --> 37:54.260
I didn't realize what would be such a

37:55.300 --> 37:57.060
polarizing, such a big deal.

37:57.060 --> 37:59.140
Had I had nothing to do, I would have come for a shirt.

37:59.780 --> 38:01.540
And I just, you know, didn't want to

38:02.740 --> 38:03.940
make the whole thing about me.

38:03.940 --> 38:06.100
I thought you did great regardless of if the

38:06.180 --> 38:07.620
Orgy came back.

38:07.620 --> 38:09.620
I don't know if that humbles you to the point where you're

38:09.620 --> 38:12.580
crumbling or crumbling.

38:12.580 --> 38:19.140
But Casey, that had a neutral effect on me.

38:19.140 --> 38:20.660
I appreciate it, but it didn't humble me.

38:20.660 --> 38:22.100
If anything, I feel like a big head about it.

38:22.100 --> 38:25.380
Because I'm like, you just did me to do it on my own.

38:25.380 --> 38:27.380
I'll be shit.

38:31.380 --> 38:35.620
Humble me until I tumble crumble and grumble.

38:36.260 --> 38:38.100
At the very least, mumble.

38:38.100 --> 38:39.460
I've got what we'd be seeing.

38:39.460 --> 38:42.900
You at our company bonding off-site in Austin.

38:42.900 --> 38:45.140
Actually, it's so serious.

38:45.140 --> 38:48.100
You will not.

38:48.100 --> 38:51.220
The last time I was invited, I think, because Jake was like,

38:51.220 --> 38:52.260
you should come to the off-site.

38:52.260 --> 38:53.540
I was like, no, I shouldn't.

38:53.540 --> 38:54.580
And then I was there.

38:54.580 --> 38:55.940
And I was like, even more so.

38:55.940 --> 38:57.220
Yeah, I shouldn't be here.

38:57.220 --> 38:59.780
Because we're doing team building exercises in specific

38:59.780 --> 39:02.420
departments and no other 1099 is here.

39:02.900 --> 39:06.500
Um, so I was like, I should probably shouldn't be at the next one.

39:06.500 --> 39:08.980
When this thing costs thousands of dollars ahead.

39:10.820 --> 39:13.780
Does that humble me, of course, because I'm also sort of a cultural

39:13.780 --> 39:14.980
mainstay?

39:14.980 --> 39:16.020
Forget the company.

39:16.020 --> 39:16.740
I mean, like,

39:18.580 --> 39:20.100
lost to Angela's at this point.

39:21.140 --> 39:22.580
Like, when people are good as them, you learn.

39:23.300 --> 39:24.260
And they don't see me.

39:25.860 --> 39:28.740
They feel like they didn't get seen the way they wanted to be.

39:28.740 --> 39:31.460
You know, do you get how I'm like getting confident?

39:31.540 --> 39:33.220
Because you guys aren't humbling those.

39:33.220 --> 39:33.860
So maybe I'm not.

39:35.860 --> 39:36.740
Kind of winning.

39:36.740 --> 39:37.700
I haven't crumbled yet.

39:37.700 --> 39:39.060
Okay, so we've got grumble.

39:39.060 --> 39:41.700
So far, we have at least one grumble.

39:43.220 --> 39:44.500
And now we're looking for the grumble.

39:44.500 --> 39:47.460
I need to fall apart at the seams on camera.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.500
Yeah, I think I got something.

39:51.780 --> 39:52.740
You pull out a gun.

39:56.740 --> 39:58.660
Yeah, I got something for you.

39:58.740 --> 40:11.220
I think this is, this is all very clearly a facade to everybody who knows you, you know,

40:11.220 --> 40:16.180
watches this podcast, you know, anyone, anyone involved with the

40:18.100 --> 40:21.860
consuming Jeff, this is a very clear

40:23.140 --> 40:28.500
cry for help of a sod, like you, like you like to be so confident

40:29.220 --> 40:33.300
and like outgoing, I, if I'm not at Zebi long,

40:33.300 --> 40:34.660
people feel like they're not seen.

40:34.660 --> 40:41.460
And it's, it's so clearly a scared little boy inside that is saying all of this.

40:42.660 --> 40:46.420
Hmm, for sure, for sure.

40:47.780 --> 40:50.020
Um, hanging on by a thread.

40:50.020 --> 40:51.060
Anybody want to take us home?

40:51.060 --> 40:53.220
Because I will crumble if you guys say anything further.

40:53.860 --> 40:55.620
I feel like if you cut your hair,

40:55.780 --> 40:58.900
you would lose all your sense of self work.

40:58.900 --> 41:02.500
And that actually is not that the pre of you.

41:03.060 --> 41:04.340
Fuck you guys.

41:04.340 --> 41:05.380
All right, plugs.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.020
What do we got?

41:06.020 --> 41:08.020
What do you want to point the people to the floor as yours?

41:08.020 --> 41:08.820
Let's start with a mirror.

41:09.380 --> 41:10.740
Uh, this is bullshit.

41:10.740 --> 41:11.700
Why did I do the segment?

41:11.700 --> 41:12.580
Fuck you guys.

41:12.580 --> 41:15.460
Oh, uh, I'm still on child.

41:15.460 --> 41:22.980
Follow me on Twitter at Blumenfeld for my sort of rumbling slash

41:22.980 --> 41:27.060
using about the topics of the day.

41:28.100 --> 41:29.620
So check me out.

41:30.500 --> 41:31.860
It's not me there.

41:31.860 --> 41:34.660
You're kind of like selling yourself as like a John Stewart type

41:34.660 --> 41:37.620
community and by like your takes on certain things.

41:37.620 --> 41:41.140
Usually you tweet nonsense about how like when you're in Gabriel went to a

41:41.140 --> 41:42.740
Hobachi restaurant, maybe.

41:44.420 --> 41:45.940
When you grow, as you said,

41:48.260 --> 41:52.180
Casey, uh, you could follow me at Casey Donnie

41:52.340 --> 41:58.580
on Instagram, Twitter, letter box, uh, but more importantly, uh, listen to the pit wall.

41:59.220 --> 42:02.900
Follow the pit wall on Instagram at pit wall pod, uh,

42:02.900 --> 42:08.820
it's an F1 podcast I host it with Marie with Maria and Jeff is there sometimes

42:08.820 --> 42:11.940
and Jake is there sometimes and piles there sometimes.

42:13.540 --> 42:17.540
That's the most accurate description I've heard of the cast of characters on that show today.

42:18.260 --> 42:19.060
Best for last.

42:19.060 --> 42:19.620
Emma, what do you got?

42:20.580 --> 42:22.740
Um, you can follow me.

42:22.740 --> 42:24.020
I've never said the sentence before.

42:24.020 --> 42:26.500
You can follow me on Instagram at Emma Rose Foley.

42:26.500 --> 42:30.100
It's really just like a group of a group of friends over there.

42:30.100 --> 42:36.100
So that's, uh, kind of the audience I'm posting for and like God, I'm sorry.

42:36.100 --> 42:37.060
I don't mean it or up.

42:37.060 --> 42:40.420
I just thought there's this person who has a vintage, uh,

42:40.420 --> 42:47.140
Datson on my street and he just pulled into his garage at like way like 20 miles an hour.

42:47.220 --> 42:48.740
There's no way he didn't crash it.

42:50.740 --> 42:52.980
Forward or back, forward.

42:53.780 --> 42:54.740
Absolutely forward.

42:55.940 --> 42:57.940
And I think you're not to be this forward going forward.

42:58.740 --> 42:59.300
Emma, sorry.

43:00.580 --> 43:04.980
Um, and my short film The Poison will come out somewhere at some point.

43:06.580 --> 43:08.740
You should premiere to the Woodstock on my Instagram.

43:08.740 --> 43:09.780
Sorry, go ahead.

43:09.780 --> 43:11.620
Premier to Woodstock Film Festival. It's easy.

43:12.820 --> 43:13.460
Okay, great.

43:14.420 --> 43:17.060
It gets into Woodstock. I'll go there for it.

43:18.180 --> 43:18.420
Okay.

43:18.420 --> 43:21.140
And then we can go to early terrible to get a drink.

43:22.340 --> 43:26.180
Okay. Well, it sounds like it sounds like a drink of champagne.

43:26.180 --> 43:26.740
Yeah.

43:27.380 --> 43:31.460
At Jeffrey James that Instagram and uh,

43:37.220 --> 43:37.700
that's it.

43:37.940 --> 43:41.940
It's okay.

43:44.660 --> 43:45.220
The pit wall.

43:45.780 --> 43:46.820
I don't know what time going on.

43:48.180 --> 43:49.300
What is this coming out? Mark,

43:49.300 --> 43:52.260
you don't have a ton going on and you can't make these pit wall recordings.

43:54.260 --> 43:55.060
I do actually.

43:55.060 --> 43:57.060
I don't have a ton going on to point people too.

43:57.940 --> 43:59.860
It's all stuff that is unpaid

44:00.900 --> 44:03.940
speculatory work that will never pay dividends.

44:04.340 --> 44:06.340
I do these holes.

44:08.180 --> 44:13.540
Mostly meetings where they say that we really want to work with you and they don't want to

44:13.540 --> 44:14.340
work with me.

44:14.340 --> 44:17.540
They just have to fill their schedule so that it seems like to their boss.

44:17.540 --> 44:18.580
They're doing something.

44:19.220 --> 44:20.660
Are you still crumbling?

44:20.660 --> 44:21.380
What's that?

44:21.380 --> 44:23.060
It ends right there.

44:33.940 --> 44:46.180
That was a hit-dum original.

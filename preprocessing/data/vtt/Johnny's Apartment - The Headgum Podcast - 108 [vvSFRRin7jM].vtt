WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
You can layer. It's something I just realized.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
How is everybody doing to that?

00:33.520 --> 00:36.480
Tonight? Great. How are you going to do tonight?

00:37.840 --> 00:38.560
Worst.

00:40.000 --> 00:40.480
Hopefully.

00:41.520 --> 00:46.000
Yeah, I'm not saying I'm positive. Yeah. I was saying I can layer the sounds now, right? Here we go.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.400
I will eat your ass.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.160
Monday, June 20th.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.320
We've got Grayson Wise on the show.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.480
New and improved with a microphone.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.200
Wow.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.880
And headphones. I can actually hear what you guys are saying for the first time.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.240
insane.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.400
Johnny is on the party.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.400
And I'm near Blumenfeld.

01:18.400 --> 01:22.240
Bring it up the rear, but not bringing a lot to the table. Is that fair to say?

01:22.960 --> 01:27.440
Nope. It's not fair. Because the show just started and I feel like I am going to do a lot.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.160
A rear Blumenfeld.

01:30.160 --> 01:32.800
That's really good. That's actually fair.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.000
Grayson Wise on the show.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.200
You're on their aches.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.400
You're hearing sounds.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.160
Heather than Pinnard doing.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.360
Obviously.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.040
45 minutes straight.

01:57.920 --> 02:00.160
It doesn't get a question with the sounds.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.400
With the layering. I just got excited about the layering.

02:02.400 --> 02:03.200
Yeah.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.920
Is Johnny at a furniture store?

02:05.920 --> 02:08.960
I feel the people, I see people shopping behind him.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.640
Oh, no. Those are my roommates.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.680
Johnny at the movie, recently.

02:13.680 --> 02:14.880
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

02:14.880 --> 02:20.240
I, the movie was pretty crazy, but I don't know what everyone's talking about with the housing market in

02:20.240 --> 02:24.240
New York. I was actually pretty good. I was able to find a really sweet spot.

02:24.800 --> 02:25.920
How did you find it?

02:25.920 --> 02:30.240
Like, well, did you say I was showing up through Zillow and then go see an empty apartment?

02:30.240 --> 02:32.560
Honestly, I think I just got lucky.

02:32.560 --> 02:33.200
How so?

02:34.640 --> 02:37.040
I don't know what I think that explains everything.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.880
I just got pretty lucky with the spot.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.480
Okay.

02:40.480 --> 02:40.880
Yeah.

02:41.600 --> 02:44.160
Is that all new furniture or new clock on the wall?

02:44.160 --> 02:45.200
I saw tags with them.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.760
Some tags still.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.680
Yeah. I mean, it's all like super, super new.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.240
It's all super, super new.

02:54.320 --> 02:58.000
It looks like a stage like the lighting on top is an open space.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.200
No, it's no, it's no roof.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.440
But it's fine. We don't have to look at the roof.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.680
With the Zoom recorder, I can see it. Yeah.

03:03.680 --> 03:06.160
Yeah. So you are on your computer?

03:06.800 --> 03:10.720
I am on my computer at my desk in my apartment.

03:10.720 --> 03:11.200
Yeah.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.400
Where is the apartment?

03:12.400 --> 03:13.120
Do you have an address?

03:13.120 --> 03:16.800
It's like, it's like deep deep Manhattan.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.600
Nobody says that about Manhattan.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.200
It's not deep Manhattan.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.560
That's the center of things.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.840
It's an island.

03:25.840 --> 03:29.200
But I guess like wherever is like hard to find in Manhattan.

03:30.800 --> 03:31.280
Inwood.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.200
Yeah. Yeah.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.640
Whatever. We'll go with that.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.960
I guess go with that or that's where it is.

03:36.960 --> 03:37.360
Yeah.

03:37.360 --> 03:37.680
Okay.

03:37.680 --> 03:37.840
Yeah.

03:37.840 --> 03:38.640
It's very weird.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.400
If it is an IKEA, you can say the

03:41.040 --> 03:42.240
geolocation.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.680
You don't have to hide that part.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.640
Just say it's on 34th and 10th or so.

03:46.640 --> 03:47.840
But it's not an IKEA.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.960
That's I think that's the disconnect that's happening right now.

03:51.520 --> 03:52.080
Right.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.840
I do like this style.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.000
I have to style you have going for your apartment.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.160
It's very like Swedish modern.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.000
Yeah. Thank you.

04:00.560 --> 04:05.440
Yeah. There's a lot of, see a lot of people in the background, man.

04:05.440 --> 04:08.240
That's not just your roommates. They're all shopping.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.280
Yeah, like now you're watching this.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.520
But also when you pointed your thing down,

04:13.520 --> 04:14.560
they like hide the ceiling.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.320
I also saw a bowl of Swedish meatballs.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.520
Yeah. Well, I was eating Swedish meatballs.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.400
I don't know what to tell you.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.360
For lunch.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.320
A bowl of meatballs and nothing else.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.360
Exactly.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.520
With the cranberry sauce and everything.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.280
Does your room not have a door?

04:32.640 --> 04:35.440
Yeah, it's kind of, it's like railroad style.

04:35.440 --> 04:38.240
Railroad style doesn't preclude having a door.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.080
Then I guess it's like,

04:42.880 --> 04:44.320
Sam, I railroad.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.520
Oh, we've got something.

04:45.520 --> 04:48.160
Yeah, whatever. Multiple beds too, right?

04:48.160 --> 04:48.720
Yeah.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.920
Yeah, I mean, like, if go bigger, go home, right?

04:55.920 --> 04:56.720
Are you home?

04:59.200 --> 05:00.640
It seems like you've gone big.

05:01.600 --> 05:02.720
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.480
Are you home? And he says, oh, yeah, absolutely.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.800
Every answer is slightly off.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.000
This isn't how people speak.

05:11.840 --> 05:12.640
Right.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.600
I mean, I know nothing about my amazing apartment.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.560
I'm wondering how you asked them to record there.

05:19.440 --> 05:22.480
I mean, if I were in an IKEA show room,

05:22.480 --> 05:25.520
wish I'm not, I would not have asked for permission.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.360
I'm just wandered in with a laptop.

05:28.080 --> 05:28.640
Sit down.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.640
Yeah, hoping I know where it was.

05:30.640 --> 05:31.120
Get me.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.120
Wi-Fi hotspot or do they have public Wi-Fi?

05:33.120 --> 05:36.960
I know that IKEA has public Wi-Fi.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.160
And that's where you're on.

05:38.160 --> 05:41.360
No, just in general, not specifically for right now.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.960
Yeah, like most IKEA Wi-Fi.

05:42.960 --> 05:46.800
Most places, honestly, most furniture stores have public Wi-Fi.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.960
Also, you didn't even know we were recording today

05:48.960 --> 05:51.120
until 10 minutes ago you said.

05:51.120 --> 05:54.000
I'm ready, unless by tomorrow you met Tuesday.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.960
So like, were you already in this IKEA down to go back the next day?

05:58.960 --> 06:02.800
Or did you have to hustle when you realized 10 minutes before recording

06:02.800 --> 06:03.440
that I meant?

06:03.440 --> 06:05.840
I like IKEA.

06:06.640 --> 06:10.320
I mean, my apartment, but if I tend to go to IKEA's

06:10.320 --> 06:13.600
pretty frequently now that my lease is up, there's no way.

06:14.160 --> 06:18.000
Hmm, there's no way you're there most days of the week.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.480
It is crazy that you unprompted 10 minutes before the recording said,

06:22.480 --> 06:23.680
I'm ready whenever.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.200
You weren't even ready for the normal time.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.160
You were recording.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.560
Yeah, I mean, I got ready.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.720
And obviously, I just needed a fresh enough

06:34.720 --> 06:36.720
to place just a little bit to make it look.

06:36.720 --> 06:37.920
What did you do?

06:37.920 --> 06:39.040
How did you freshen it up?

06:40.160 --> 06:41.360
Put the tags back on.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.640
Why did everyone see it was all new?

06:43.760 --> 06:45.520
Super, super new, yeah, we are.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.360
Super, super new.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.040
Oh, I'm going to go up the side.

06:49.040 --> 06:53.200
Um, I'm sure we'll speak more about this later into the episode as some kind of chaos happens

06:53.200 --> 06:54.960
in the background of Johnny's apartment.

06:55.760 --> 07:00.160
But I wanted to get things started off with, um,

07:02.960 --> 07:04.640
talking about dating in New York.

07:06.640 --> 07:10.880
Oh, wait, you, you talk about these things like they're new,

07:10.960 --> 07:13.440
but it's the same exact thing every week.

07:13.440 --> 07:17.920
Actually, I wanted to start this off by talking about everyone's, oh,

07:17.920 --> 07:18.960
bonds of the week.

07:18.960 --> 07:22.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:22.720 --> 07:26.400
Uh, last time we spoke on this show, uh,

07:26.400 --> 07:29.120
you had been, you had been experiencing unrequited love.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.080
Kind of, yes.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.480
I was unceremoniously rejected.

07:32.480 --> 07:33.280
Yeah.

07:33.280 --> 07:34.640
And did you,

07:34.640 --> 07:36.240
exact your revenge?

07:36.240 --> 07:40.080
Did you sort of put into place financial

07:40.400 --> 07:41.440
revenge tools?

07:41.440 --> 07:44.240
Yeah, um, um, yeah.

07:44.240 --> 07:47.280
I mean, are you seem confused about the concept of revenge?

07:47.280 --> 07:49.680
What's, what's there to seek revenge for?

07:50.960 --> 07:52.880
Should you not listen to him?

07:52.880 --> 07:55.680
Yeah, it's not what they did when I go out with you.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.040
Exactly, okay, so you got it.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.800
Yeah, yeah, he gets it with this.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.000
Yeah, that's pretty pain out here.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.840
I think that was a lot of revenge.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.120
Not even petty revenge.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.160
A lot of revenge.

08:04.160 --> 08:07.920
Yeah, like on a skill of one to a lot,

08:08.000 --> 08:11.120
it should be on the more extreme revenge of course.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.160
Absolutely.

08:12.160 --> 08:18.000
Okay, um, so what did, what did you do when someone said that they didn't want to get

08:18.000 --> 08:19.120
dinner with you?

08:19.120 --> 08:21.200
Um, what's your dinner?

08:21.200 --> 08:21.840
That's interesting.

08:21.840 --> 08:22.560
It was drinks.

08:22.560 --> 08:26.160
Do you think, do you think as somebody who is in a

08:26.160 --> 08:30.160
committed relationship that my next move should be to ask them to dinner?

08:30.160 --> 08:33.120
I don't think your next move should be to talk to them ever again.

08:33.120 --> 08:36.640
Oh, yeah, obviously they don't want anything to do with you.

08:36.720 --> 08:37.760
Not that's fine.

08:37.760 --> 08:38.400
That's not.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.760
You don't want to down your pretty words.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.080
Yeah, it's not what they said.

08:42.080 --> 08:42.880
Word, what did they say?

08:43.920 --> 08:47.360
They said, listen, I, I just, not like if you don't

08:47.360 --> 08:48.160
do my best.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.640
You never want to hear a listen at the top of it.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.680
Yeah, they said, they said, listen, who is this?

08:55.680 --> 08:58.560
And then of course I explained, um, and what was the

08:58.560 --> 08:59.120
explanation?

08:59.120 --> 09:00.960
So they didn't even know who you were, but you knew them.

09:02.720 --> 09:06.480
No, so I, you never do the thing where you just type numbers in

09:07.200 --> 09:08.000
Yeah.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.480
And then, and then you just shoot them a message.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.120
You say, do you want to grab drinks sometime?

09:13.120 --> 09:15.520
So you don't know how old this person is, what they look like, what they do,

09:15.520 --> 09:17.360
where they live, what area could you use?

09:17.360 --> 09:18.000
Was it at least two weeks ago?

09:18.000 --> 09:22.240
No, but I, I leave open the possibility for love at first sight,

09:22.240 --> 09:24.880
because I don't know who they are until we both show up.

09:26.080 --> 09:28.160
You know, and you can have that spark then.

09:28.160 --> 09:31.280
Yeah, that's not possibility, though, exists everywhere.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.720
How do you know this person?

09:33.360 --> 09:33.760
What?

09:34.560 --> 09:35.120
Nothing.

09:35.280 --> 09:35.920
He heard you.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.200
Johnny, let's talk about dating in New York just in terms of, I mean,

09:43.200 --> 09:44.800
you have this new bachelor, you know, Pat.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.320
It's pretty choice, pretty chair.

09:46.320 --> 09:46.960
Thank you, man.

09:46.960 --> 09:47.760
Pretty savory.

09:47.760 --> 09:48.320
Thank you.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.800
Oh, yeah, it's all brand new, new brand brand.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.760
Can you kind of like, clean out of, uh,

09:54.960 --> 09:56.880
was that a line from a rap or something?

09:58.160 --> 10:00.880
No, new brand brand spaken new.

10:01.440 --> 10:04.800
Can you sort of lean out of frame and point to how you would use your current

10:04.880 --> 10:07.760
room set up for, for like a better term, porken.

10:08.960 --> 10:09.760
For porken?

10:09.760 --> 10:10.400
Yeah, so.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.600
For the audio, this was Johnny just leaned out of the way, and there were two people

10:19.600 --> 10:20.640
with masks.

10:21.280 --> 10:24.960
They saw Johnny was doing something bizarre and then walked out of the room.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.720
I roommates, by the way.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.000
That's what other names, I'm so sorry.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.400
I should not think about it.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.080
Michaelie and frankly,

10:38.080 --> 10:41.120
Michaelie and, sorry, his name is frankly.

10:41.680 --> 10:45.040
Frankly, his name is Michaelie, and then the other one's name is Mike.

10:45.040 --> 10:48.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, let's see.

10:48.640 --> 10:51.840
His first name is Michaelie or his full name is Michaelie.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.160
Mike, that is, that is a director.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.720
That is a good, uh, good question.

10:56.720 --> 11:00.160
He gets, uh, confused, a lot of people can fuse that, but it is,

11:00.240 --> 11:03.280
Michaelie and my KEE, LEEY.

11:04.960 --> 11:05.760
What's his last name?

11:07.600 --> 11:08.160
Michaelie.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.240
This name is Michaelie.

11:10.240 --> 11:11.200
Michaelie, Michaelie.

11:11.440 --> 11:14.480
Michaelie and my KEE, LEEY.

11:15.200 --> 11:19.200
Mike and my KEE, uh, dash LEE.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.720
So it's kind of like, uh,

11:21.120 --> 11:21.720
So one of his parents,

11:21.720 --> 11:23.920
he's a native to hyphenated last name.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.840
Okay, what does he do for living?

11:26.320 --> 11:27.120
Something normal.

11:27.840 --> 11:29.000
Yeah, he's a P.A.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.320
Adagian Central pusher.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.440
He's a total pencil pusher.

11:32.720 --> 11:36.320
Meaning like he has a Minio, you know, average job or his job is still.

11:36.320 --> 11:40.080
Oh, no, he's like, yeah, he pushes, he's a pencil salesman.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.640
Is that what the song push and P is about?

11:43.040 --> 11:44.240
Yeah, push and pencil.

11:45.440 --> 11:46.880
Very clever goal.

11:46.880 --> 11:47.840
This, this is that job.

11:48.560 --> 11:51.760
And then I, he has a we work, but that's,

11:52.800 --> 11:54.000
probably unsustainable.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
There's no way they're just going to let it fly.

11:56.320 --> 11:57.520
Where do you, where do you pork?

11:58.720 --> 11:59.360
Or do I pork?

11:59.360 --> 12:02.400
I pork on that new bed, uh, over there.

12:02.400 --> 12:03.520
Yeah, brand spanking up.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.280
Yeah, brand spanking, brand brand new.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.960
Uh, and we can watch the hours go by over there.

12:09.600 --> 12:10.880
Yeah, we know it's lots, sorry.

12:12.560 --> 12:13.280
Are you get it?

12:13.280 --> 12:17.200
This guy, this guy, that TV looks like a piece of plastic.

12:19.040 --> 12:22.320
I mean, I could turn it on for you if you like, I mean,

12:22.320 --> 12:24.720
not right now, but like, maybe after the recording,

12:24.800 --> 12:25.680
you can talk about it.

12:25.680 --> 12:26.640
Turn it on for a quick.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.960
Pork, he said, huh?

12:29.360 --> 12:30.400
Oh, this guy, pork.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.040
Actually, try not to eat.

12:35.040 --> 12:35.760
Put up for a second.

12:37.120 --> 12:40.880
Grayson, I mean, your room, we've seen it before, but where do you pork?

12:43.280 --> 12:47.840
Weirdly enough, kind of exactly in the same, in the same set up as Johnny, uh, just on a bed.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.240
No tags or, which is there.

12:50.240 --> 12:54.240
No tags, none of my stuff is brand new, new brand, brand spanking new.

12:54.240 --> 12:58.000
So no tags left on any of my things.

12:58.560 --> 12:58.880
Okay.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.680
And then is there any way to watch the, I'm sorry to say, but hours go by.

13:01.680 --> 13:02.640
The hours go by.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.720
I have a digital watch.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.240
So we could in theory, watch them in, it's go by.

13:10.880 --> 13:14.560
That's, that's, yeah, this guy also works.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.160
James Bond of the week.

13:21.040 --> 13:21.360
Nice.

13:21.360 --> 13:24.160
This week, my pick is Doos Tatum.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.880
Nice, the child.

13:26.880 --> 13:30.880
Yeah, um, James Tatum's four-year-old son.

13:30.880 --> 13:35.760
Yeah, listen, I don't know if you saw those shots of him on the sideline, but he was looking pretty

13:35.760 --> 13:46.320
soft, pretty dangerous, toddler, I just think that Jason's recent defeat could be made better by

13:47.280 --> 13:51.120
Doos, being able to grid post a variety article.

13:52.640 --> 13:56.880
Doos Tatum is in as the name is, he's four.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.120
He's not, exactly.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.240
Meaning, and you want him.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.480
Side of the body, on the corners.

14:02.480 --> 14:02.560
Side of the body, on the corners.

14:02.560 --> 14:03.840
Side of the body, on the corners.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.680
You have him, we'll still be excited.

14:05.680 --> 14:06.880
Really?

14:06.880 --> 14:07.600
Yeah.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.880
What's the youngest bond?

14:09.440 --> 14:10.640
45.

14:12.320 --> 14:16.240
He's still decades away from being that even after 20 years.

14:16.560 --> 14:17.680
Or taxes.

14:17.680 --> 14:18.640
That's the other thing.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.640
Suddenly, that money is actually going to Jason.

14:21.840 --> 14:22.800
Born.

14:22.800 --> 14:23.440
He needs it.

14:23.440 --> 14:23.840
He doesn't.

14:25.920 --> 14:29.600
Who are you guys, James Bond 007s of the week?

14:31.040 --> 14:34.160
Uh, I personally, I just watched Top Gun.

14:34.160 --> 14:34.640
Yeah.

14:34.640 --> 14:41.680
Uh, I don't know if you guys have seen it, and I have to spoil just the intro intro sequence.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.480
Yeah.

14:42.480 --> 14:46.080
There are no company title cards, no production houses that you see.

14:46.720 --> 14:53.360
It's, uh, it fades in on Tom Cruise, addressing the audience, saying that this film is going to be great,

14:53.360 --> 14:54.880
and you're going to really enjoy it.

14:54.880 --> 14:58.080
And I'm not joking, that it was the most bizarre thing.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.280
Are you serious?

14:59.280 --> 15:00.800
I, there's no way.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.840
I'm a cruise head now.

15:04.880 --> 15:07.360
So, it's Tom Cruise, your picker, was that a way?

15:07.360 --> 15:08.320
He's absolutely, okay.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.800
I think he's too old at this point.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.200
And then he's too stocky.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.280
And also, I wouldn't call him Swav.

15:19.920 --> 15:20.240
Yeah.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.360
He's also called Doost Tatum Swav.

15:24.000 --> 15:24.400
Yeah.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.400
Who is more Swav?

15:26.400 --> 15:27.920
Doost Tatum or Tom Cruise?

15:27.920 --> 15:28.400
Tom Cruise.

15:28.400 --> 15:28.960
He got you that.

15:28.960 --> 15:29.920
No, I don't know.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.640
Tom Cruise is, Tom Cruise is rugged.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.600
Yeah, but Doost Tatum is a four year old child.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.240
Yeah.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.600
And that's a lot doesn't it?

15:39.600 --> 15:41.120
But doesn't say a lot of shoppers.

15:42.080 --> 15:45.040
What a roommate, a lot of roommates.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.240
A lot of roommates.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.200
Look at his fucker.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.000
Oh, got a good deal.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.280
Yeah, he's a cute little boy, but he's not going to be the next James.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.440
Look at that fucking form.

15:53.440 --> 15:56.080
What if they do like a prequel, a prequel bond?

15:57.440 --> 15:59.440
That kid, the young bond, yeah.

15:59.440 --> 15:59.840
Yeah.

16:01.680 --> 16:04.480
And he looks nothing like any of the previous James.

16:06.240 --> 16:11.040
No, because 007 is kind of, that that gets past from agent to agent.

16:12.000 --> 16:12.960
Yeah, that's true.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.720
We never get to see him grown up.

16:14.720 --> 16:18.400
In like the third prequel, he could die or something.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.600
That's really good.

16:19.600 --> 16:23.360
I would love to see this fucker sort of parish on screen.

16:26.640 --> 16:31.120
Anyway, um, I love that Gucci man was really excited to take a photo with me.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.400
Here we go, full steam ahead.

16:34.400 --> 16:42.400
Let's talk about family heirlooms.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.840
If you died today, what would you?

16:46.880 --> 16:50.400
Johnny, your apartment's awesome, but it doesn't give you license to get a mirror.

16:50.400 --> 16:54.480
I'm sorry, but thank you for the, thank you for the apartment stuff.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.120
I mean, a lot.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.320
The tags are pretty awesome.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.600
Yeah, I can't wait to come over.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.960
Hell yeah, dude.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.760
Um, it might look different, but that's whatever.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.320
You have to be a fairie to red mirror shut up for saying,

17:06.320 --> 17:08.320
Johnny, I kind of, I'm the same guy right now.

17:08.320 --> 17:09.120
It's kind of awesome.

17:11.120 --> 17:13.600
Great. I guess you're getting a little too excited, but like I'm like,

17:13.600 --> 17:16.000
kind of like catching up with you with the energy.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.040
No, 100% and 100% if you don't speak for me.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.800
Super, super awesome.

17:23.600 --> 17:24.080
Yeah, I guess.

17:28.080 --> 17:28.640
Nice.

17:28.960 --> 17:32.320
I didn't like that.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.760
Who was that directed to?

17:35.760 --> 17:37.760
Um, let me just flip to Jeffrey.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.040
Okay, then cool, then cool.

17:41.040 --> 17:41.280
Yeah.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.680
Not cool for me.

17:44.320 --> 17:44.640
Yeah.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.520
Johnny, you're in a public place.

17:49.520 --> 17:50.400
Give it together.

17:50.400 --> 17:51.680
Haha!

17:51.680 --> 17:54.320
All right, we do have a good break.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.960
Just for ads, nothing else here we go.

17:56.960 --> 17:57.760
We'll be right back.

17:58.640 --> 18:06.640
Now a word from our sponsor better help.

18:06.640 --> 18:11.520
Guys, burnout can manifest in so many different ways, man.

18:11.520 --> 18:15.720
For me, it means not setting boundaries, right?

18:15.720 --> 18:20.240
Over extending myself, doing too much stuff, work all day.

18:20.240 --> 18:21.920
Be with friends all night.

18:21.920 --> 18:26.960
That's too much sometimes, sometimes you need to have a little time to recharge, right?

18:26.960 --> 18:31.120
In the, uh, it feels stressful, it feels overwhelming, it feels all consuming, I feel

18:31.120 --> 18:33.280
like I'm having tunnel vision.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.600
And life is just overwhelming, right?

18:36.600 --> 18:40.080
Many people are burnt out without even knowing it, and symptoms can include lack of

18:40.080 --> 18:44.280
motivation, irritability, fatigue, and more, and we associate burnout with work, but that's

18:44.280 --> 18:45.960
not the only cause.

18:45.960 --> 18:48.880
Any of our roles in life can lead to us feeling burned out.

18:48.880 --> 18:53.840
That's why better help online therapy wants to remind you to prioritize yourself by talking

18:53.840 --> 18:57.680
to someone who can help you figure out what's causing stress in your life.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.400
I'm in therapy every week.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.960
Uh, it's very helpful.

19:00.960 --> 19:04.680
Um, I can't imagine my life without it.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.400
Didn't do it for three years.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.600
I think I'm a better person.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.600
We'll see.

19:10.600 --> 19:14.520
But I think everybody should have, if they have access to it, everybody should be in therapy.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.520
It's good.

19:15.520 --> 19:16.520
Why not?

19:16.520 --> 19:18.400
It's always good to talk about shit.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.760
Better help specifically.

19:19.760 --> 19:23.080
It's customized online therapy that offers video, phone, and even live chat sessions

19:23.080 --> 19:24.080
with your therapist.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.400
You don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.920
It's also, and it's much more affordable than in-person therapy, and you can be matched

19:28.920 --> 19:30.800
with a therapist in under 48 hours.

19:30.800 --> 19:31.800
So get to it.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.520
Especially this summer, man.

19:34.520 --> 19:38.480
Our listeners get 10% off their first month at betterhelp.com slash what's that?

19:38.480 --> 19:39.880
Again, that's betterhelp.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.200
H-E-L-P dot com slash what's that?

19:42.200 --> 19:42.720
Thanks, betterhelp.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.400
And we're back.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.120
Johnny, where are you now?

19:57.120 --> 19:58.120
You'll part, man.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.120
You know.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.280
It's places in it.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.400
This place is huge.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.240
Yeah, I kind of got a pretty sick deal on this one.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.080
Towels also have tags, right?

20:07.080 --> 20:08.920
That's bizarre.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.680
Yeah, haven't dried myself yet.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.040
Obviously, I can have multiple towels as well.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.200
Did you move in today?

20:14.200 --> 20:16.080
What the hell was that?

20:16.080 --> 20:17.440
Brutely, I said.

20:17.440 --> 20:18.280
How many of you have?

20:18.280 --> 20:20.560
Because every single one has been different.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.880
How many of you have got such a good deal?

20:21.880 --> 20:24.720
It's like 50 roommates.

20:24.720 --> 20:25.720
Wow.

20:25.720 --> 20:26.720
It's a good deal.

20:26.720 --> 20:27.720
It's a good deal.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.400
It's like a co-op, really.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.400
Not really.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.400
Um, okay.

20:33.400 --> 20:39.880
Do you guys have any family heirlooms that you would pass down?

20:39.880 --> 20:42.640
Johnny probably has some at his desk, I'm sure.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.640
Yeah.

20:43.640 --> 20:46.400
Personal items that he cares a lot about.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.400
Yeah.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.920
So this has been kind of passed on.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.720
It's an ironing board.

20:50.720 --> 20:54.800
The tags still aren't because it's been passed down.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.520
Yeah, it's an ironing board.

20:56.520 --> 20:57.520
Seven dollars.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.520
Yeah.

20:58.520 --> 21:01.080
Seven ninety nine might do.

21:01.080 --> 21:04.520
That tag is from when it was purchased in the twenties.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.520
Yeah.

21:06.520 --> 21:11.360
Inflation is a real, real evil person.

21:11.360 --> 21:16.520
Okay, let's say 1929, 799, let's see how much that would cost today.

21:16.520 --> 21:17.520
Numbers crunch.

21:17.520 --> 21:18.520
Yeah, crunch.

21:18.520 --> 21:20.200
Can we get a number crunch on that?

21:20.240 --> 21:21.640
Nine hundred dollars.

21:21.640 --> 21:26.440
There's no way that that's from 1929.

21:26.440 --> 21:27.760
It just took really good care of it.

21:27.760 --> 21:33.840
I don't understand why you would be not convinced, I guess.

21:33.840 --> 21:34.840
Yeah.

21:34.840 --> 21:37.800
Grace, and do you have anything that you would pass down as a family heirloom?

21:37.800 --> 21:41.200
I'm sort of a family heirloom, heirloom, heirloom.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.200
Yeah.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.200
Yikes.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.200
Aeromoom.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.200
Aeromoom.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.200
Aeromoom.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.200
Aeromoom.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.200
Aeromoom.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.200
Aeromoom.

21:50.200 --> 21:53.200
Can we cut all that out?

21:53.200 --> 21:54.200
Sure.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.200
What?

21:55.200 --> 21:56.200
Okay.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.200
Yeah.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.200
Just with a part five.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.200
Yeah.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.200
I mean, I have actually this, this could work.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.200
This could be interesting.

22:03.200 --> 22:06.200
I have this mostly empty packet of gum.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.200
I've had for a week.

22:08.200 --> 22:09.200
Yeah.

22:09.200 --> 22:13.200
I don't have that.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.200
It's weird.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.200
Look at that.

22:15.200 --> 22:18.200
Look at Johnny's bathroom.

22:19.200 --> 22:25.200
A fully grown adult male, sort of lifting things up.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.200
He is.

22:26.200 --> 22:27.200
He is.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.200
In the show.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.200
Todd Rick.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.200
Todd Rick.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.200
Todd Rick.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.200
Hmm.

22:32.200 --> 22:35.200
Do all your roommates have one name?

22:35.200 --> 22:37.200
All of multiple names.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.200
Some of them have multiple names that were peed.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.200
Sally Darwalks back in the back.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.200
I don't know.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.200
There's no way.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.200
Um, I'm here.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.200
You're sort of vaguely wealthy.

22:47.200 --> 22:52.200
How much, what, what would you pass down?

22:52.200 --> 22:54.200
And respond faster than you have been.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.200
Hell yeah.

22:55.200 --> 22:58.200
A brick on a power brick.

22:58.200 --> 23:01.200
I mean, are you a power bottom?

23:01.200 --> 23:02.200
Next segment.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.200
Okay.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.200
Um, I really want to get a moped.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.200
I'm sorry to say.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.200
Okay.

23:07.200 --> 23:10.200
Just part of the next segment or just non-secretor.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.200
Non-secretor.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.200
Just what do you guys think?

23:13.200 --> 23:14.200
Seems dangerous.

23:14.200 --> 23:15.200
Yeah.

23:15.200 --> 23:18.200
Well, so you should do it.

23:18.200 --> 23:19.200
Hmm.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.200
It seems dangerous and you should do it.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.200
Hmm.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.200
He's on his phone.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.200
Are you looking at your phone?

23:26.200 --> 23:28.200
He's looking at your moped.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.200
Yeah.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.200
Okay.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.200
Absolutely.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.200
I should do that.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.200
What are the rules there?

23:33.200 --> 23:35.200
Like, you can't drive that on the highway, right?

23:35.200 --> 23:36.200
You can do it on side streets or something.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.200
You can drive it on the highway.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.200
I never would.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.200
That's too much.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.200
Yeah.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.200
Down sunset.

23:42.200 --> 23:43.200
Yeah.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.200
Sunset.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.200
That's cool.

23:46.200 --> 23:47.200
You're racing a view ever.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.200
That's a little senseless.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.200
That's those are the streets I knew.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.200
I don't know.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.200
Los Angeles.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.200
Welcome to so what?

24:02.200 --> 24:04.200
Is that segment I like to call so what?

24:04.200 --> 24:10.200
So, uh, a lot of nonsense passes for news these days.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.200
Why is that funny?

24:11.200 --> 24:12.200
Yeah.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.200
Sorry.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.200
I guess.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.200
Um.

24:18.200 --> 24:21.200
A lot of nonsense passes for news these days.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.200
And, um.

24:22.200 --> 24:23.200
Okay.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.200
You don't have to be sad about it either.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.200
What am I supposed to do?

24:27.200 --> 24:28.200
Sorry.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.200
Here people and Johnny's.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.200
Yeah.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.200
What are they saying?

24:32.200 --> 24:33.200
Not roommates.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.200
Strangers.

24:34.200 --> 24:37.200
I think they're talking about, like, how they do, like,

24:37.200 --> 24:38.200
fry higher.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.200
They do, like, fry higher.

24:40.200 --> 24:43.200
They do like talking about, like, the way the room looks

24:44.200 --> 24:46.200
or getting a couple ideas for their own personal room.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.200
It does.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.200
It sounds like they're trying to purchase your bed.

24:49.200 --> 24:52.200
They want, like, a similar model.

24:52.200 --> 24:55.200
Uh, I just wanted to do another roommate to talk to them about it.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.200
Yeah.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.200
What's up, my friend?

24:57.200 --> 24:58.200
That's all the night.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.200
It was just for a moment.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.200
I wanted something.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.200
This is awful.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.200
Yeah.

25:03.200 --> 25:08.200
They're measuring.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.200
Yeah.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.200
You like the fuck?

25:11.200 --> 25:16.200
I guess they think they can take that exact shower and put it in their place.

25:16.200 --> 25:21.200
Okay.

25:21.200 --> 25:26.200
Um, this is a segment I like to call so what, which is pointing out the

25:26.200 --> 25:28.200
pointlessness of some news headlines.

25:28.200 --> 25:33.200
I guess, like, I was just, I'm just going to say some news headlines that I think are sort of meaningless.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.200
And we can talk about it.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.200
Here we go.

25:36.200 --> 25:40.200
Three years ago, her art sold it for $400 at the beach.

25:40.200 --> 25:45.200
Now it fetches up to $1.6 million at auction.

25:45.200 --> 25:50.200
Yeah.

25:50.200 --> 26:00.200
Anna Wyant, a new art star whose work evokes a millennial bodice outly, was discovered on Instagram.

26:00.200 --> 26:08.200
She's also dating her dealer, Larry Gagosium.

26:08.200 --> 26:13.200
So it's the second thing.

26:13.200 --> 26:17.200
You're saying Larry is just selling her shit at a huge premium.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.200
Yeah, Gagosium.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.200
Yeah.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.200
Which part of that is pointless?

26:23.200 --> 26:27.200
Oh, I think the whole thing is sort of like, so what, you know what I mean?

26:27.200 --> 26:30.200
I want that.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.200
I guess.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.200
Doesn't really affect our lives.

26:34.200 --> 26:39.200
Yeah, it's just so what, but maybe to somebody else, it's like kind of like an important thing.

26:39.200 --> 26:40.200
Yeah, really imagine her actually.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.200
Yeah, imagine that.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.200
It's awesome.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.200
Yeah.

26:44.200 --> 26:45.200
Yeah.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.200
Really cool.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.200
Yeah.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.200
No.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.200
Yeah.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.200
It's kind of down actually.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.200
Probably never had your name in some sort of outfit.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.200
A mirror would understand.

26:53.200 --> 26:57.200
He's had a piece in the time recently.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.200
Yeah.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.200
That was huge for you, right?

26:59.200 --> 27:01.200
That was two years ago.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.200
It was cool.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.200
It was like about sort of me as a taste maker.

27:04.200 --> 27:12.200
Alluding as a fact that a good re-hollywood gift giving.

27:12.200 --> 27:16.200
COVID tests would be an interesting sort of slant.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.200
Yeah.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.200
Yeah.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.200
It was pretty exciting.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.200
It was pretty exciting.

27:20.200 --> 27:21.200
Yeah.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.200
Yeah.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.200
That was in 2018 also.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.200
Yes.

27:24.200 --> 27:27.200
So like completely, I was ahead of the curve entirely.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.200
Absolutely.

27:28.200 --> 27:29.200
Yeah.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.200
It was no curve.

27:30.200 --> 27:33.200
I think it predated COVID by year.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.200
Listen, we've talked so much.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.200
We've exhausted this subject.

27:36.200 --> 27:43.200
So I need to take the lead here and just lead into some fucking new, so-what segment things.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.200
Okay.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.200
You guys keep talking.

27:45.200 --> 27:48.200
I can hear you, but I'm going to step away from my computer for a second.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.200
Yeah.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.200
But again, I can't stress enough.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.200
I will be able to hear you.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.200
I don't think so.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.200
Because you don't have to take your headphones off.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.200
He's so ugly.

27:55.200 --> 27:59.200
I heard that I haven't even left yet.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.200
That was really fast for you.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.200
Yeah.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.200
You did not even give it time to wait.

28:04.200 --> 28:09.200
A barber kicked a customer out of his chair after Quavo walked in.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.200
So what?

28:14.200 --> 28:15.200
I saw that.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.200
I would probably be a good barber, right?

28:17.200 --> 28:18.200
Yeah.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.200
But I'd be pretty annoyed as the customer, I think.

28:20.200 --> 28:21.200
Yeah.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.200
The article seems to be on the customer side.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.200
If Quavo walks in, you're fucking gons.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.200
We don't.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.200
What if you're halfway through here on this?

28:29.200 --> 28:30.200
I don't care.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.200
It's Quavo.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.200
So you're like a child's on camera.

28:34.200 --> 28:37.200
And he's spent $100,000 on a chandelier.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.200
Okay.

28:39.200 --> 28:43.200
So all of a, it seems like you care a lot, especially about Quavo.

28:43.200 --> 28:46.200
So it's not really a so much for you, so maybe.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.200
Right.

28:47.200 --> 28:50.200
I would call back to reveal a chandelier.

28:50.200 --> 28:51.200
In Quavo.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.200
I'm in debt.

28:53.200 --> 28:57.200
This is, I mean, that's just, that's pointless to me.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.200
But here we go.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.200
Jared Kushner lets his feet breathe.

29:00.200 --> 29:05.200
In thong sandals alongside kids with a vanka Trumpet beach.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.200
Hmm.

29:06.200 --> 29:07.200
Okay.

29:07.200 --> 29:11.200
I think it's the first one where I'm kind of like so much.

29:11.200 --> 29:14.200
Specifically, that article was written about the sandals.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.200
Yes.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.200
It's like a fashion thing.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.200
Wow.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.200
He was also in the thing thong.

29:20.200 --> 29:24.200
He was wearing a hang thong as a, yeah.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.200
He's packing heat, though.

29:27.200 --> 29:30.200
I don't know if he has new Jared Kushner's caucus.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.200
We don't have to talk about that.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.200
Yeah.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.200
That's going to be a, a so what.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.200
Yeah.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.200
Yeah.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.200
Uh, Jon here just messaged.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.200
Yeah.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.200
I'm glad I'm not here.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.200
Uh.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.200
It is mutual.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.200
Yeah.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.200
Yeah.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.200
Uh.

29:48.200 --> 29:52.200
Giant cruise ships made in voyage may be to a scrapyard.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.200
So what?

29:57.200 --> 30:01.200
And I also think figure out if it will or not first.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.200
I guess.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.200
Yeah.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.200
Don't publish an article about the fact that it might end up in a junkyard.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.200
That is a really good point.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.200
That is weird.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.200
What a strange article you found.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.200
Major killer.

30:13.200 --> 30:16.200
Be sure of shit before you post it.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.200
Right.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.200
So if you're, if you're going to post a grid post or tweet,

30:19.200 --> 30:22.200
make sure that it's going to have staying power.

30:22.200 --> 30:26.200
I mean, I'm sure the music licensing labels are pretty stringent about those kinds of guidelines.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.200
Yeah.

30:27.200 --> 30:30.200
But it's still copyrighted.

30:30.200 --> 30:48.200
I mean, I'm sure the music licensing labels are pretty stringent about those kinds of guidelines.

30:48.200 --> 30:52.200
Yeah.

30:52.200 --> 30:56.200
Are you like a business Instagram account?

30:56.200 --> 30:58.200
No.

30:58.200 --> 31:05.200
I don't think that I've never heard of them taking down like a normal person's content.

31:05.200 --> 31:07.200
I don't think I'm a business account.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.200
Maybe I accidentally am.

31:08.200 --> 31:13.200
Anyway, we do have to move on to the next headline here.

31:13.200 --> 31:16.200
Ready for wine.

31:16.200 --> 31:22.200
Tea Mallory does dancing trend in house dress and Nike airmax sneakers.

31:22.200 --> 31:25.200
It seems more like a sponsored article.

31:25.200 --> 31:29.200
It's mainly for Nike.

31:29.200 --> 31:34.200
I couldn't tell you what publication this was if I tried.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.200
It says Fn.

31:35.200 --> 31:38.200
And I can't write Bart.

31:38.200 --> 31:43.200
That was just a fake tweet on true social.

31:44.200 --> 31:47.200
All right. Last one. First of all, so what? Second of all, here we go.

31:47.200 --> 31:55.200
Bella Hadid just made a case for wearing two belts at once.

31:55.200 --> 32:00.200
I guess if she makes a good case, then it might be a potentially huge.

32:00.200 --> 32:05.200
Yeah, potentially huge for the fashion fashion world for Johnny's specifically.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.200
Yeah.

32:07.200 --> 32:10.200
I've been dying to wear two belts.

32:13.200 --> 32:17.200
Okay, Jeffrey. All right. Okay.

32:43.200 --> 32:48.200
Welcome to worst actors on actors.

32:48.200 --> 32:51.200
You guys familiar with actors on actors.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.200
It's like an interview.

32:52.200 --> 32:57.200
Yeah. It's a variety series where two prominent actors will interview each other.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.200
And they usually pick pretty interesting pairings.

32:59.200 --> 33:05.200
But I thought to myself, what would be the worst possible pairings of actors.

33:05.200 --> 33:08.200
And interview that I just frankly, or sorry,

33:08.200 --> 33:11.200
Mike Lee wouldn't want to see.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.200
Nice. That's my roommate, man.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.200
Yeah. Sorry to reference them.

33:15.200 --> 33:17.200
You guys are welcome to shout out your own.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.200
But I'm going to kick things off by saying,

33:19.200 --> 33:21.200
Billy Bob Thornton and Young Sheldon.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.200
I'd love to see them chop it up.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.200
You'd like to do this?

33:26.200 --> 33:27.200
And Young Sheldon.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.200
You kidding me?

33:28.200 --> 33:30.200
The two hottest young things.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.200
Yes.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.200
P.Y.T. is really.

33:35.200 --> 33:38.200
Wait, is it two actors sitting down to interview each other?

33:38.200 --> 33:39.200
Yeah.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.200
I only did actors.

33:41.200 --> 33:45.200
So do you just take them thing, and we'll see if he gets bonded or not.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.200
But that wouldn't actually qualify.

33:47.200 --> 33:49.200
Yeah.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.200
Oh, yuck.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.200
Do you think Yuck?

33:59.200 --> 34:01.200
Oh, wow.

34:03.200 --> 34:07.200
What about Tim Allen and Susan Sarandon?

34:07.200 --> 34:11.200
It would just be them arguing about politics.

34:11.200 --> 34:15.200
I guess that's not for him to make that a home improvement sound.

34:15.200 --> 34:17.200
That's good.

34:17.200 --> 34:19.200
Yeah, I should do it louder.

34:19.200 --> 34:21.200
Every question.

34:23.200 --> 34:25.200
Do you guys have any ideas?

34:25.200 --> 34:29.200
Because I was also thinking Sylvester Stallone and John Trevolta.

34:29.200 --> 34:33.200
Because it would just sort of be undisernable nonsense.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.200
Why?

34:34.200 --> 34:36.200
Well, I'd be like, one of them would be like,

34:36.200 --> 34:38.200
Well, I'd be like, yeah, really, really.

34:38.200 --> 34:40.200
And then it would be like,

34:40.200 --> 34:44.200
You sounded like Scooby-Doo.

34:44.200 --> 34:46.200
I'm never heard you do an impression.

34:46.200 --> 34:50.200
And then you just did two of them back to back.

34:50.200 --> 34:52.200
So let's hear the truth.

34:52.200 --> 34:53.200
Who can do it?

34:53.200 --> 34:54.200
Who can do it?

34:54.200 --> 34:56.200
I would do it.

34:58.200 --> 35:00.200
Do you hear the Stallone again?

35:00.200 --> 35:02.200
Well, I would be like,

35:04.200 --> 35:06.200
What about Trevolta doing Stallone?

35:10.200 --> 35:12.200
Now Adam Sandler doing Stallone.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.200
That's pretty good, actually.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.200
Yeah, I don't want to watch that.

35:20.200 --> 35:24.200
I want to actually have a boxing match.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.200
Me versus Blumenfeld.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.200
I don't fucking dynasty type writer.

35:28.200 --> 35:30.200
I would never.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.200
Why?

35:33.200 --> 35:40.200
There's been so much vitriol poison thrown back in fourth for six fucking years.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.200
There's so much history there.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.200
So we don't have to box.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.200
Yeah.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.200
Really kind of coming out of the moment.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.200
I didn't think that they were shouldn't.

36:03.200 --> 36:07.200
What about Michael Kane and the dog from Marley and me?

36:07.200 --> 36:10.200
Because they're both sort of on their last legs.

36:10.200 --> 36:11.200
I'd have to assume.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.200
Michael Kane seems fine.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.200
Yeah.

36:18.200 --> 36:19.200
This probably did.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.200
That was the one obstacle.

36:21.200 --> 36:24.200
What about Francis McDormand and Steve O?

36:28.200 --> 36:29.200
Well, with that sound like.

36:33.200 --> 36:37.200
And Francis, I can tell you if you do it.

36:38.200 --> 36:41.200
You don't you can forget that we are in a jackass.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.200
And then Francis would be like.

36:43.200 --> 36:46.200
What did you say at the Oscar speech?

36:46.200 --> 36:47.200
I don't know.

36:47.200 --> 36:50.200
She's just always so stern and I feel like Steve O's never serious.

36:53.200 --> 37:00.200
So that would be an interesting conversation.

37:00.200 --> 37:08.900
would you yeah I agree but Jeffrey I don't know. Why won't you die?

37:08.900 --> 37:16.600
What about Pete Davidson and Fespis? Who is Fespis?

37:16.600 --> 37:23.400
It's like one of the few famous ancient Greek actors from the first millennia.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.800
That one is a little interesting conversation.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.800
Yeah he's also not with us.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.800
Well you know it's like a dinner guest question.

37:30.800 --> 37:34.000
I think Pete Davidson doesn't act he's just Pete.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.800
And then Fespis sort of pioneered the game.

37:37.800 --> 37:46.600
You can't tell me that Merrill and Hank didn't look back and study their forefathers.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.400
In Fespis.

37:48.400 --> 37:52.200
And the like you throw it towards your end of the screen.

37:52.200 --> 37:55.800
It comes out Maya.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.800
But get let's box.

37:57.800 --> 37:59.800
What?

37:59.800 --> 38:03.800
Okay what about Alec Baldwin and John Wilkes Booth?

38:03.800 --> 38:05.800
Not an actor. John Wilkes but there's not an actor.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.800
John Wilkes was an actor.

38:07.800 --> 38:08.800
Yes he is.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.800
Oh my god I didn't know that.

38:10.800 --> 38:15.800
Yeah but John Chervulta or who is it? Alec Baldwin and John Wilkes Booth.

38:15.800 --> 38:16.800
Grayson got the chair.

38:16.800 --> 38:20.800
Alec Baldwin accidentally shot someone.

38:20.800 --> 38:23.800
It's okay.

38:26.800 --> 38:29.800
Sorry did you roommate need something?

38:29.800 --> 38:35.800
Yeah my roommate just needed to look at the glasses.

38:35.800 --> 38:37.800
Are you wearing headphones?

38:37.800 --> 38:39.800
Yeah I'm wearing headphones.

38:39.800 --> 38:42.800
The episode ends right there.

38:42.800 --> 38:50.800
And then last but at least what about Charlize Theron and Amir?

38:51.800 --> 38:55.800
That's what I want to talk about.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.800
Have you guys been hanging out still?

38:57.800 --> 38:59.800
I haven't seen Charlize in a minute.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.800
Do you think you're growing apart?

39:01.800 --> 39:03.800
It's a good question.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.800
Charlize is like one of those girls where it's like,

39:05.800 --> 39:08.800
you know when you haven't spoken to someone in six years.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.800
But then you just get dropped into a conversation.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.800
It's like you haven't spent any time at part.

39:12.800 --> 39:13.800
You're like I'm right where you left off.

39:13.800 --> 39:14.800
Exactly.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.800
And it's like that's the beautiful thing about Charlize.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.800
She has that with so many people that like I feel like,

39:19.800 --> 39:21.800
whether I'm getting some wine with Charlize

39:21.800 --> 39:25.800
or Charlize is talking to a whole lot of people.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.800
I haven't had wine with Charlize.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.800
Probably ever.

39:29.800 --> 39:34.800
But I feel like if I like tomorrow DM Charlize and Charlize is like,

39:34.800 --> 39:37.800
you know, don't you ever remember if you're close to her?

39:37.800 --> 39:40.800
She goes through this thing because she's like dealing with a stock

39:40.800 --> 39:42.800
or situation where she changes her number a lot.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.800
I don't even think I've ever had her number.

39:44.800 --> 39:45.800
But who's the stalker?

39:45.800 --> 39:47.800
Is it like she doesn't know who it is or it's you?

39:47.800 --> 39:49.800
Yeah, she doesn't know who it is.

39:49.800 --> 39:53.800
And but like the second you sort of pick things up with Charlize,

39:53.800 --> 39:55.800
like I can pick up the phone and try to call her right now.

39:55.800 --> 39:57.800
Or she can pick up the phone and call me for sure.

39:57.800 --> 39:58.800
I would not mind that at all.

39:58.800 --> 39:59.800
Yeah.

39:59.800 --> 40:03.800
Charlize would be able to chop it up just like you throw out like a topic of comfort.

40:03.800 --> 40:06.800
It feels like an old like French Revolutionary salon.

40:06.800 --> 40:09.800
Like we're just discussing all sorts of philosophical intricacies.

40:09.800 --> 40:10.800
No.

40:10.800 --> 40:11.800
She's like Neil Cassidy.

40:11.800 --> 40:12.800
I didn't even know that.

40:12.800 --> 40:13.800
Yeah.

40:13.800 --> 40:14.800
What's going on behind Johnny right now?

40:14.800 --> 40:19.800
Oh, strangers are browsing in an IKEA that Johnny is recording from.

40:19.800 --> 40:20.800
What?

40:20.800 --> 40:31.800
That's all we have for you today guys.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.800
Why don't we do our plugs?

40:33.800 --> 40:38.800
Johnny, start us off.

40:38.800 --> 40:43.800
That plug is to follow me on Instagram at Johnny V. J. O. H.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.800
And then why V. I.

40:45.800 --> 40:50.800
And check out my new apartment like if you ever are around like deep in wood.

40:50.800 --> 40:51.800
What was it, New York?

40:51.800 --> 40:53.800
You don't know where you are.

40:53.800 --> 40:54.800
Yeah.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.800
I mean, what are you going to listen about New Jersey?

40:56.800 --> 40:57.800
Where are you?

40:57.800 --> 41:00.800
Uh,

41:00.800 --> 41:01.800
Evan Confession.

41:01.800 --> 41:03.800
I'm in Konsehawk in Pennsylvania.

41:03.800 --> 41:06.800
Uh, at a furniture store.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.800
But I hope you guys can hold it against me.

41:08.800 --> 41:09.800
Kind of.

41:09.800 --> 41:10.800
Of course we knew that.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.800
Is it an IKEA or is it a different furniture store?

41:13.800 --> 41:14.800
It's an IKEA.

41:14.800 --> 41:15.800
Yeah.

41:15.800 --> 41:16.800
And are you happy?

41:16.800 --> 41:17.800
I am happy.

41:17.800 --> 41:18.800
But that's great.

41:18.800 --> 41:21.800
I mean, the thing about the tags, the room, it's all.

41:21.800 --> 41:22.800
No, we know.

41:22.800 --> 41:23.800
Yeah.

41:23.800 --> 41:25.800
And you tell you don't live there.

41:25.800 --> 41:27.800
No, don't.

41:27.800 --> 41:35.800
Well, I kind of dispensing around different ideas indefinitely until I find some housing.

41:35.800 --> 41:36.800
Yeah.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.800
And we should say that you're moving to, what is it?

41:38.800 --> 41:40.800
Do not say that.

41:40.800 --> 41:43.800
How do you know that?

41:43.800 --> 41:44.800
You told me.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.800
You sent me some of the listings.

41:46.800 --> 41:47.800
I don't know.

41:47.800 --> 41:48.800
I never did.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.800
Oh, I didn't.

41:50.800 --> 41:54.800
And then AJ sent me and said this is where I'm living.

41:54.800 --> 41:55.800
Yeah.

41:55.800 --> 41:56.800
We signed the list and everything.

41:56.800 --> 41:57.800
No.

41:57.800 --> 41:59.800
I didn't respond to that text actually.

41:59.800 --> 42:00.800
Yeah.

42:00.800 --> 42:01.800
Anyway.

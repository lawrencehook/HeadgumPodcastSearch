WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head gum original.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
This is Ritumaro again. Yep.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
Yep.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
I mean, we're only like what?

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Seven hours out, six hours out.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
We're recording this at 5pm on a Thursday.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Another day that shit comes out tomorrow morning, man.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
I mean, the energy is imbued.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Right? Yes, yes.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Of course.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
So what if...

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
What if...

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
What if...

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Yeah.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Just get on with it.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Just get on with it.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Fuck you.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Go!

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Just say it.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
I'm saying it.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
What if we weren't available, really?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
It would have been a fucking solo solo episode.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I would have done it by my own Lonesome.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Right?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
The issue was high.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Yeah.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Really sneak up on you Friday or because it's happened every single Friday for three years.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
So I'm wondering why it's like, oh shit.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I had to do this tomorrow.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Did it sneak up on me or am I sort of...

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Just wait for someone to question that I asked.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
But we got away from me.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
I was in San Francisco, the Bay Area,

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
I had to be sure and...

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Joseph A. Biden flew in.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
I guess he's doing some fundraising and athletes in

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
or some shite and he was staying across the street

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
for me at the...

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
For lack of a German fair amount.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
And so what happened was they shut down

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
the streets in every direction.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Right?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
So for me to get to the airport on time

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
was not even in the cards.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
And so there wasn't any way I could record

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
What about last week?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Like, last week?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
How did it not...

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
How did she not know that he was out?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
That would have been a good idea.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Until you were leaving for the airport.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I don't follow the guys' whereabouts.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Stop my job to make sure that the taxpayers

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
being fucking charged for a bit.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
You'd assume that.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Stay at a five star hotel, by the way.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
You'd assume that you'd like...

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
notice something going around

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
at least like a couple hours before.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
People hours.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
I flew in on Saturday.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
All right?

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
This was...

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
This started.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
He flew in on Tuesday.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Right?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
By the way, I flew via jazz sucks.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
And I'd love to talk about that.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Jet sweetx.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
It's a shuttle flight.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
You can get from LA to San Francisco

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
on a private jet for the cost of less

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
than a fucking commercial airline ticket

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
with 29 other people, including twice.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Nick Kroll.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Right?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
And so...

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
But the thing you're signing up for there

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
is that it's like a different section

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
of the Oakland airport.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Right?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
And that's the section, by the way,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
that Air Force One lands out.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
So guess what they also did.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Sign private.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Send me.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
They still fucking moved our flight

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
to Buchanan Airfield.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Two hours.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
What was it?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
What was Kroll?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I don't think Kroll was it on this leg.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Kroll was there when I went for TSM

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
for the dead company show.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Right?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I had happened was.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
My whole trip was thrown off.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Ubers couldn't pick us up at our hotel.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Because we were too close to where Biden was staying.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
And it took me off.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
To walk to Buchanan.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
We did that.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I'm just saying I've been turned around

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
and inside out.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Did you see?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Biden's fucking team.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
I didn't see Ferris.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
I didn't see Ferris's fair amount.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
I didn't see Ferris's fair amount at the fair amount.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
She, what I ended up seeing was the Tonga Room

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
and Hurricane Hut.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
I saw hate ashberry a little bit.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
And I saw the outer sunset a lot a bit.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
I ended up seeing a lot of it the town.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Because I also went to the mission.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
I walked through the silver lake of SF aka

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Nobhill.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
And I had my nob worked on

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
with a woman with thrill

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
and I hooked up.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Right?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Or you guys are having a good time.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Because I'm bringing a ton of joy.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Or you guys are having a good time.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
I'm only going to see you San Francisco twice.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
I'd never been really.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
I'd been for the dead and company show and that's kind of it.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
And I driven through but that doesn't count.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
I'm here.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
What are your questions follow up?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Just lightning around style.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
Why don't you fly Southwest for like 4% of the price is Jet Sweet X?

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Well, I just said that Jet Sweet X is the same price

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
or sometimes less than commercial.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
So yeah.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Okay.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
So you actually saved money by flying Jet Sweet X.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Either the same or saved.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
And I definitely saved time and time as money.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
So if you count that,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
do you still hate San Francisco the city?

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Because I remember that was your stance

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
when the warriors were constantly beating the cap leaders

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
in the finals.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
What ended up happening was I got my nob worked on

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
by a woman from shrill on Nobhill

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
and then I sort of changed my tune.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Because I just became a tune to the energy of the city.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Right?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
So like there's AI driving cars.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
There's a dog robot delivering food that stepped on my toe.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
And I don't know.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
I'm kind of falling in love with the energy.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Okay.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
Why did you go there Monday through Wednesday?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
It was Saturday through Wednesday.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
So I don't know if it's that you're not listening

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
or you're just not understanding me.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Basically it was their family commitment.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Family commitment.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Not really.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
What's that?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Five days.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
I thought you said five days.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
I did five days.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
And I don't know if you're talking about 80.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
So you're there for five days?

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
That was there for four nights five days.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Yeah.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
I don't much more interesting trip than last week than you did.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Where did you go?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Hennely on 10?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
London.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Did you end up at Hennely on 10?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
I didn't end up at Hennely on 10s.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
So you avoided firepark at all costs?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I was asking questions about London.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Shoot.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Ten years ago or so.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
You go to London and everything's super expensive because it's like,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
it's already expensive plus the exchange rate.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
It's like, oh, this $10 sandwich is actually,

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
it's 10 pounds.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
So it's $15.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Now everything in New York and LA is super expensive.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
So it's London even more expensive or it's like,

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
okay, now I'll send which is cost $18 here and there.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Comparable to cheaper.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Oh, even cheaper there.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Yeah.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
I guess I don't know.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
I feel like alcohol definitely cheaper there.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Which is what like five to eight pounds per drink.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Yeah.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Like I got a half pint of cider at the theater.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
And you know, if you're getting like,

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
oh, first, I don't even know if they really have beers at a Broadway theater.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
But you know, a cocktail is costing you $20.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Three pounds.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Wow.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Okay.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
So America has because of the crazy price gouging that's going on

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
as certainly as London at this point.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
More than crazy though.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I don't even know if that's the right word to use.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
One second.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
I'm talking to Chris.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
And then what about like hotels and stuff,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
super expensive as well?

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Um, I think it's like kind of the same.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
I got a pretty good deal at mine was three nights

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
for 450 pounds total total.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Oh, that is pretty sweet.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Oh, that is pretty sweet.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Exchange rate was like a 0.8.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
You ended up staying at the hotel or.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Uh, I'm not going to reveal where I should do not there.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
And I'm well, yeah.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
You got back.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
So I think you can tell them where you ended up.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Well, if I want to get on a sack.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Yeah.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
I think that must have nailed it.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
It must have actually kind of a cool place.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
It was one of those places where you sort of sleep in a locker.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Why didn't we record earlier today?

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Like, why five p.m. versus 11 in the morning?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
What did you say?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Why five?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
VPN?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
What's a VPN?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Well, I didn't say anything.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
VPNs that you thought I said.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
You said Wi-Fi.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Internet?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
I got it.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
VPN.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
What's that?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Oh, hi.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Why does it come after Internet?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Why did you want to do this at five in the afternoon?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Didn't want to.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
It's such a time crunch.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Well, Maria gave me two choices.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Right.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
She held my feet to the fire.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
And I went through.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Because that was at six p.m.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
My name.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
And you said now or never.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
And I said never.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
And you said eight.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Do you want to read the exact transcript?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Because that's how it plays in my head.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
And I want to know.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Sure.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
What your reality.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
So I can bend it to my will.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
And Maria, you can still decide how you feel about it.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Still silent on the hotel.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Still silent on the subject of the hotel.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
So it wasn't the hotel.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Okay.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
How hard was that?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
I didn't say where did you stay.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
I said, was it the hotel.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
And you said no.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I want to protect it.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
And what if I want to stay there.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
So that implies that you were staying at the hotel.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
I still know why you did it.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
I said, yeah.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
You knew that this wasn't going to be able to happen.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Five, twelve p.m.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
My son Jeff, do you still need to record tonight?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
I'm going to listen to you, actually.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Well, no.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Because Jeff might have been not able to.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Like, even remember that he had to record.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
I wouldn't.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Right.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Because he lost his mind.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
So tomorrow.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Yeah.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
That's a play right.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
For sure.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
Because last night he asked me if I wanted to record a one on one episode.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Oh.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
And I said, this studio is pretty busy today.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I'll have to see.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
I got back to him.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
He never responded.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
So at 5 p.m.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I took it upon myself to reach out.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Because I am talking to the work.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
I might as well do have some sort of responsibility.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Check in.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And the day Jeff hasn't texted you back.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Totally.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
So at 5 p.m.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Do you still need to record tonight?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
I'm going to leave the office soon.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
So just checking.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
He said at 6 o 6.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
You're fine.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
We're out after.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Hour after.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
I do if you can.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
But no pressure.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
I have an idea if it doesn't work.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
I said, I could do.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Well, I do.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Well, I'm going to have to do the idea if it doesn't work.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
So I want to keep that in my back pocket.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
So I can either do like right now or in two hours.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
And then he didn't respond.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Format's later.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
I said, let me know.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Because I either need to set up the studio or go home.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
ASAP.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
It's really an hour to come.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Yeah.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Seven minutes later.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
I said bump.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
And then he responded.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Can we do 8 p.m.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
ET?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Sorry.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Or not.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
I don't want to inconvenience.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
And I said, yeah, I can do 8.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
And then he said, I know I am inconveniencing.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
But if you don't want to, I can do a different.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
It's been a week.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
And I said, no, it's fine.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
I'm free.

10:22.000 --> 10:29.000
I was just trying to determine if I needed to go home or stay at the office.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
And now it's a day.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
And now we're here.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
And I don't know.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
I'm being lambasted because you guys don't like what I've done the past.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Or if it's actually about what happened this week.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
I went to London this weekend.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
I saw five shows in three days.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Wow, by yourself.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
By myself.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
Although two of my friends from New York happened to be there doing the same thing.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
So I met up with them.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Oh, wow.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Did you find yourself?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Did you find yourself?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
This shows, sorry, one second.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
This shows that are, okay.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
So there's balloons.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
I don't know.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
I don't know.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Jeffery did that.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
I think that was you from just gesturing.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
I like this.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
I know.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
You did something.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
You did some.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
I created one of my gesturing.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
What do you mean?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
I didn't see that at all.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
You didn't see balloons in my friends.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
There weren't balloons in your frame of my screen.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Where are you?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I don't even think it's going to come up on the recording.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Rake it.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Did you see balloons?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I saw something.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
There were like animated balloons in my frame.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Oh, is your question?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Jeff's devil in charge.

11:33.000 --> 11:40.000
Yeah.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Bond of the week.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
Are these New York Broadway shows that eventually go to London or ones that haven't

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
been to New York?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Western might end up at Pintages.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Just trying to figure out if you stayed at the hotel.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Didn't say the hotel.

11:50.000 --> 11:59.000
They are for, for all the shows I saw that they had not been New York transfers

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
to the West End.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
And as of now, there's no plans for any of them to transfer to New York.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Can I just ask though?

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
Is that, is that, you went about it in a certain way, where you made sure to only see West End

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
originating shows.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
Because I don't want the audience to think that they're like aren't New York transfers to the West End.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
There are ample of those.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
But because you know that I'm not going to go see what you're talking about.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Exactly.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
You're going to go to the West End and you're going to see things you can't see in New York.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
So I just want people to think that, I don't want people to think that they're going to go to London

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
and that they're only going to see shit that are only there.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
You have to do the research here.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Right.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
London is a really, really thriving theater scene.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
They have a really good, what we would kind of consider, like, off-ground.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
A grasp, yeah.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
A theater.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
They have, and they're doing it really well.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
So they have, like, a bunch of theater companies, a national theater.

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
The old Vic bridge theater that put on a season of shows.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
And you went to see a bunch of those.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
Are a lot of these theaters places that also have pines or maybe just ails?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Yeah.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
They kind of all do.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Which is nice.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
I do.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
I stole this cup from the bridge theater.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I saw guys and dolls.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Did you declare that?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
That customs?

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
I'm just starting to worry that you may be below.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
No, I have global entry.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
You, you have global entry?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Where did you get global entry?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
And why?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
I mean, I don't really get a year.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Is that just so you can go to London easily?

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
No, I got it when I went to France.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Anyone could get global entry.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Is it like TSA pre-check?

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
What the hell?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Yeah, it's like that.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
Plus, you go into a different line when you're going through customs.

13:40.000 --> 13:47.000
And when I got back to the States, the line, the regular customs line over an hour.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
People waiting outside of the stanchions.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Global entry.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
No one was in line.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I got through in a minute.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I feel like I can inflate it with like clear.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
I thought that you had to pay like $100 a year for it.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
You do have to pay to apply for it.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
It's not like a yearly cost.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
And a lot of credit cards cover the cost of it.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
So your credit card might cover the cost.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Okay.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Highly recommend global entry.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
And with TSA pre-check.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
I really don't want to interrupt the flow of conversation.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
But we are going to have to, on the week for sure.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
But I want to talk about the hotel for a minute.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
There we go.

14:26.000 --> 14:33.000
And this is, I'm assuming, not part of the plan that you had for us also.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
We can't hear the video.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Sort of see a choppy version of it.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Okay.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Is that okay?

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
Not really here.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Oh, here.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
It's kind of an equally choppy audio version.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
Yeah, so I mean, I guess what's your confusion about the hotel?

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
I was trying to figure out if Maria was basically doing this, right?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Right.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
She said she didn't stay at one.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah, but I don't, that doesn't mean that you weren't kind of trading London like this.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
Uh, I don't think I was trading London like this.

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
I kind of walked around at a, like, fast, normal walking pace.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
Not dancing on the streets.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
I kind of want to point out, sorry.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I just need to point out this video, too.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
It says, one minute with the hotel London.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Uh, the video is a minute 37 seconds.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
Well, skip to the end and see if there's like a 20 minutes.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
No, there's still going.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Nope.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
It goes till the very last second.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
What's your recent, do you have a reason for your recent fascination with the hotel?

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
I have no fascination.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
I just know that this hotel exists.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Okay.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
The first was only at London Heathrow Airport.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
And you basically slept in England.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Last.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
With the hotel.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
I have a good deal.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
The hotel Hotel.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
All the day.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Oh, and...

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Um.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
We have to take a break.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
We have to take a break.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Ready, you're right.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
I'm squash on the oven.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Okay.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
And ready, you're bound to the week because we are going to come back hot.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
This show is sponsored by Better Help.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
Guys, sometimes racing thoughts keep you up in night.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Right?

16:18.000 --> 16:24.000
Or wake you up early, preventing you from being able to enjoy your sleep and thus enjoy your life.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Right?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
You're fine at the end of the day.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
You know, you just can't get your brain to stop talking.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
You know, your thoughts are racing right before.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
Better at other in, in opportunity moments.

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
And it turns out one great way to make those racing thoughts go away is to talk them through.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
And therapy gives you a place to do that.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
So you can get out of your negative thoughts, cycles, and find some mental and emotional peace.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I'm in therapy every weekend.

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
It offers me just that in a arena to discuss the things that are sort of going on and on

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
and circles in my mind so that I can get some good rest and also just enjoy my life.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
So if you're thinking of giving therapy a try, start with Better Help.

Thanks, Better Help.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Hey, fuckers.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
Are you a millennial who misses what life was like in the 2000s?

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
Have you had a hard time finding new or curated music?

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
Are you interested in multiple perspectives on relationships dating and other?

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
And are looking for hosts that offer non-male bashing perspectives?

17:47.000 --> 17:53.000
But also holding both sex as accountable, then you're going to love see the thing is.

17:53.000 --> 18:02.000
A podcast hosted by Grammy Award-winning R&B artist Bridget Kelly and media personality and podcast trailblazer Mandy B.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
Twice a week, Bridget and Mandy have nostalgic conversations in their grown segments.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
Political pop culture conversations in their honest segments and relationships slash hot

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
take conversations in the slightly toxic segment.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
The opinions on the show are real and brought to you by the genuine connections that the ladies have with

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
the guests that they like to call their friends with benefits.

18:22.000 --> 18:28.000
Each week you'll leave with some new music recommendations or a curated playlist that you didn't even know you needed in their new

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
freshly squeezed music segment.

18:31.000 --> 18:37.000
Most recently the ladies have sat down with Ari Lennox, Big Fridia, Remi Ma, Van Lathen and more.

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
Follow slash subscribe to see the thing is on Spotify, Apple Podcasts or on YouTube.

18:42.000 --> 18:48.000
New audio episodes drop every Tuesday and Friday and visuals are available on YouTube Wednesday and Saturday.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Check it out!

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
We're not going to really have time because for her and I don't know if she's at the hotel or if she's just where she lives in a private room.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Probably, but I don't know if she did like a staycation or something.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Probably not.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
I know probably not, by the way.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
I just am wondering and I think I'm allowed to wonder.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
Because we've been adding to the kind of ethos of the show, right?

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
Because it's be joy, get-wise.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
Or sorry, embellish faith and what was the last one?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I remember.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
Well, let's say foster wonder.

19:30.000 --> 19:37.000
Because I was just saying to a mirror that I wonder if Grace is doing a staycation or not right now.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
And if that's why she might not have a hand in this week's episode, or if it's maybe just that we're recording.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Six hours before it has to go.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Yeah, I'm going to go with that one for sure.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Probably.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Here we go.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Bottom of the week, I'm going to go with the RIP Michael Gambond.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Michael Gambond?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Yeah.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
He was ahead of his time, he was of his time.

19:57.000 --> 20:03.000
He was someone who a mirror probably doesn't remember, but that's okay.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
Because neither does Gambond.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
I don't know what he just did.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Yeah.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Michael and the Weeks.

20:13.000 --> 20:21.000
Gonna be Andrew Scott.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Fine, I'm here.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
True holiday.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Nice.

20:27.000 --> 20:34.000
We've got a lot to get to wax wise and then we have a segment.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Kevin James.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Let's talk about these again.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
To wax wise, which is a stocky about anything.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
And then we have a segment.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Correct.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
So Kevin James has sort of come on to the internet all this week.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
He's a specific memeology.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
He's kind of just like,

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
mm-hmm.

20:58.000 --> 21:05.000
And so I kind of wanted to know who in your guys' life or who maybe at the company had the energy of.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
The Kevin James meme.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Exactly right.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
I'm thinking shackle.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
I feel like shackles have been getting married for like five years.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
When is the ceremony?

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Has it already happened?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Why wasn't we there?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
No.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Small wedding or...

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
We don't know.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
You should have her on and talk to her about it.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
She doesn't want to come on.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
She didn't want to come on.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
She did the show once and said never again.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
I was three years ago.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Yeah.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
And you can do a bunch of people who have won and done it and then have them back on.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
So shackle.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Katie.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Yeah.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
She said she would come back on.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
It was another all girls episode.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
I'd love to do another one of those.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
It's just hard to pin people down, especially like today.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
I tried to get a bunch of people.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
I could get all I could handle.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Wrangle was you guys.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
And...

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Well...

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Yeah.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Whether the episode is coming out tomorrow or to, you know, next week.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
It still was a, you know, as a work day.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Who else did you ask?

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Casey, pile.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
What did they say?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
They said can't tomorrow.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
That was yesterday.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Yeah.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
So...

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
You didn't ask me yesterday.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I didn't really want you to be on this episode.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
But, you know, Marika was, and I were going to do a one-on-one.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
And then I worried that that was maybe too much to put on to Marika.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Because I'm also tired from the travel.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Right.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Yeah.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Anyway.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
Let's kind of continue this going.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
I think it's Riley.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
It is Riley, actually.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
But she does it jokingly.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Yeah.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Which she kind of does that likely.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
So, that's like a bit.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
I'm wondering who genuinely, and I'm wondering if it's maybe...

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
I was going to say...

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Shackle.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
You did it.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
It's Peter.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I think it's Grimm.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
It's like earnestly Grimm.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Grimm is like...

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
You know what I mean?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
That's my impression of Grimm is like...

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Not really.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Yeah.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Maybe it was Servantes.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Who?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Oh, it's this guy I've been vetting to be an intern.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Not your job.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Yeah.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Kind of is.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
I mean, I need my assistant editor.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
I'm sticking with my answer.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Yeah.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Yeah.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Yeah.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
You're...

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Um...

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
Let's continue on.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
Imagine eating yogurt at the hotel.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
Also, I just not to circle back on something we talked about a while ago, but...

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Sure, we'll get back on my question later.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
The round trip from Berbank to SF.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
We're going to be like...

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
We're going to be at $78.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Yeah.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Very affordable, man.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
The JX, the...

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
What, or whatever?

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
$369.499.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
That's the 759.412.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
That's the 759.412.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Berbank to $600.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Yeah.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
That's $279.316.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Yeah.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I mean, I've done that.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
That was $269.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
That's exactly what I said.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Okay.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Berbank to SFO, right?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Because I just...

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Good to play to you on GoogleFlights.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Because I'm looking at the same dates, $78.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Well, I didn't pay for the flights.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Yeah.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
The truth comes out.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
I wish we didn't have to hold your feet to the fire.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
Because now I'm starting to question every answer you've ever given me.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Ask me anything.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Now I have.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
You're not.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Because I have to follow up.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
And if I find the truth, then you're going to be honest.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Okay.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Ask me the same question twice.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
I guarantee you'll be the same answer.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
How old are you when you first hug the woman?

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
Probably like one, two.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
All right.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Now I'm going to ask you again.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
It has to be the same answer.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
All right.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
How old are you when you had your first hug?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Um...

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
I don't know.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Because there's a lot of things to question about that.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
What is a hug?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
What do you mean?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Like me, hugging someone or me being common.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
You can't even...

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
A baby girl.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Yeah.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Yeah.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
But you know what?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
It's interesting.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
It keeps people sort of engaged.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
And I feel like that's the whole point of like hosting.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
You've got to keep the audience engaged.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
That might even be my approach to romantic relationships and generals.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
To just keep them engaged.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
And just like don't let them lose that.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Um...

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Amir...

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
And engaged by...

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
To be wet.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
But never the actual wet.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
The actual...

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Like a 14 year engagement.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Yeah.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
But longer than that even.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
Because like if you marriage, everybody's like, oh, you know,

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
being married so hard.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Nobody says being engaged is hard.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
People say planning a wedding is hard.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
So let's get engaged.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Not plan the wedding.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Never get married.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
It's honey mood phase forever.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And you're sort of...

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
In bliss.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
I don't know.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Domestic...

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Yeah.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
You'll tell it, dude.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
You'll tell it, dude.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
It's like an attitude slash...

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Yeah.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
So attitude.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
You'll tell...

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
You'll tell...

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Tell...

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Holiday Inn.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
That's funny.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Y'all a day in.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Sorry.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
I'm trying to use...

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Oh, here we go.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Up.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Go ball beside it.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Where's it?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Where's it?

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Where's the way?

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
We do have a segment.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Do we want to get to it now?

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Or do you want to wait another 15 minutes?

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Or probably now?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Oh, right now.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
That's what I was going to say.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Now it's fine.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Now it's fine.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Just because we're like 24 minutes in this.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Yep.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Second.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Take 10.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Why don't you guys talk amongst yourselves?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
And then, Marie, can you want to check in on that?

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
What was it?

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Flavtenous squash.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
How do you not squash?

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Do you want to make sure it's not burning?

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Well, I get my laptop charger.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Could it smell it?

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
It smells fine.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
It smells not burnt for sure.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
But I wonder if you want to check the glaze.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
See if it's maybe browning.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
If you want to turn it into a broil from the bake.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
So that we don't get this caramelization on top.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
No.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Just so I can have the dots.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
You go across the room and get it.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
You could have already done it.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
You could have already done it.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
I could have done it within this time period.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
But now we're talking about the flautas that you're...

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Or sorry, the honey nut fucking materials.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Honey nut.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Flavtenous.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
That's a type of squash.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Yeah, they're really cute.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
They're...

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
This is good.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
They're new squash.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
They're relatively new squash.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
So you bake it then what?

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
I was going to make some sort of risotto, I think.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Geez.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
That seems like a whole other dish.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Yeah.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I thought you were just going to slice it in half and add, like,

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
I don't know, pomegranate seeds and chow down.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I have pomegranate seeds.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I did slice it in half, but my thought was,

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
carve out the flesh.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Put it in a blender with some...

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Oh my gosh.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
This is all for tonight's dinner?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Yeah.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
That's a lot of work for a late night meal.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
I agree, but I'm...

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
Blend it, put it in a broth, and then what?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
You're not even done at your...

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
I'm the new maker.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I'm making the risotto with that broth.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
I see.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
So then you put rice in there.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Yeah.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
But you've got to constantly stir.

27:48.000 --> 27:55.000
We should use our 4-E-L-M-N, right song.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
That's the risotto, right?

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
I did.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
I did.

27:59.000 --> 28:04.000
I actually had it grabbed it.

28:04.000 --> 28:22.000
The irony is, Jeff left and we talked about rice while you were gone.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
So true.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
It's like segment...

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Yeah.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Ready?

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
I said, let's do it now.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Yeah.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
I was saying this.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
It's either now or 15 minutes from now.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
You're ready now or shall we wait 15 minutes?

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
There we go.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
There we go.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
That's kind of ironic.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Welcome to Pump the Freaks.

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
This is an interview segment, sort of a compilation of questions asked and answered.

28:45.000 --> 28:51.000
Factor fiction, beyond belief, beyond relief, because by the end of this, you guys are

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
going to be exhausted.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Here we go.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Pump the Freaks.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Question by question.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
What do you do with Jonathan Freaks?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
It does.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
It exactly has to do with Jonathan Freaks and him hosting the song, beyond belief, so this

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
is beyond relief, pump the Freaks edition.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Here we go.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
Have you ever walked out of a mall into a huge parking area and realized you'd forgotten where

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
you parked your car?

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Yes or no?

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
I don't.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Yes.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
So now.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Okay.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
I'm here.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Expound on that.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
Sometimes I'm not paying attention to where I'm parking, because I'm so consumed about

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
getting to where I'm going.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Then I'm like, oh shit.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Let me just find a spot and get out.

29:25.000 --> 29:32.000
And then I, in a huff, like, find a spot, get in, hustle over the theater, the restaurant, or whatever.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Then I'm like, I can get all the rights.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Hustling, bustling over to a dillards to get your shitty chinos.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
You pleated shirts.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
You pleated shirts.

29:40.000 --> 29:45.000
I know how you, I know you're game blue and fall.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
I know where you got your wedding tucks.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
And it was a fucking sacks.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
That's nice.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
No.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
It was a bundle of sacks that he pieced mailed together.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Chain mail.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Yeah.

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
Anyway, I forgot where I left my car after I parked it.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Have we gone non-biking?

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
What are you?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
No.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
No.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Never.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
I barely know.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
That's true.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Marika?

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
You said you didn't drive.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
You also don't bike?

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
What do you do?

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Like, I've never mountain-baked.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Well, what is Manhattanipped on a mountain?

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
To climb.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
Because if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
Sure.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
What do you want to be when you grow up?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
What's the ride?

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
What are these clothes?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
What are you talking about?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
What are you talking about?

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
It's pumped your brakes.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
It's from the show beyond relief.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
I see.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
I see.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
This is beyond relief.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Second.

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
So, what are you going to be when you grow up?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Retired.

30:56.000 --> 31:01.000
Marika?

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Happy?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
What's the ride tip?

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
Interpret this as you will, expound expand.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Blunt.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
It's 20%.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
To stay at the hotel.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
All the plumber to your home lately?

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
No.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I actually have.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Oh!

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
Breaking news.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
Breaking news.

31:32.000 --> 31:43.000
What did you have to call a plumber foreblood, was it a massive log?

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
It's got no risk.

31:46.000 --> 31:51.000
Unrelated song.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Yeah.

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
My toilet was flushing properly, so I had to get a new one.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Okay.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
How much money would...

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
How superstitious are you?

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
It's hard to call it.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Audio levels are all different.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
How superstitious are you?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
I like to think that I'm not.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
I like that I'm not.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
But I'm a little stish.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Okay.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
What do you get superstitious about?

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Like the Lakers?

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
Yes, sports.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
Like sometimes I'm like, oh, did I leave the door open?

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Did the dog escape?

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
I'm not going to check outside.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
I'm just going to look inside and hopefully find them.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
Because if I look outside and see them, it's really bad news or something like that.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Yeah.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
I kind of think I can tell the future sometimes.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
So I guess relating to that.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
How much money would it take to make you spend a night in a cemetery?

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
What do you mean what cemetery?

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
See the future.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
Not that I can see the future.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
But it feels like something to happen.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Yeah, sometimes I have.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
But I'm just trying to...

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Oh, this like...

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
I think about everything and then like,

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
an hour later or something it happens.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
Just trying to keep it going, the episode and the segment.

33:06.000 --> 33:11.000
So how much is it? What cemetery? What are my accommodations?

33:12.000 --> 33:16.500
Just a cemetery. Definitely not like a nice one. Like it's not like Hollywood forever.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.500
Stay awake or people there.

33:18.500 --> 33:22.000
Spend a night so you can sleep you get like do whatever you want in the cemetery

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
But how much money would it take for you to do that?

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
I probably would sleep.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
Yeah, so just don't sleep. Bring a book.

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
How much it's kind of a stupid question but this is pump the brakes beyond relief

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
So I'm trying to fucking pump the brakes rather.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Just name a fucking number.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
A hundred thousand to stay.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
That's you could have ten guaranteed.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Or I could have a hundred thousand.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
Yeah, but it's about the bare minimum you would take.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
That's the bare minimum.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Yeah, you wouldn't do it for ninety nine thousand.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
You wouldn't spend one night where you can't sleep or not.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
You can do whatever you want.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
You have to wear principles.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Ninety nine grand.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Hundred take it early that.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I'm here.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Forty thousand.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
I would do it for.

34:09.000 --> 34:14.000
Well, the question is like how much money can you make otherwise.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I would do it for like.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Probably a lot.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
I would do it for like twenty five hundred dollars.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
You just play this.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
You just play this.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
You just play this is a.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
You just play this is a good 50 people to give 50 bucks.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
And then make you be in a cemetery for a full night.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Easily, yeah.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Okay, fine.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
But you have to prove it.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Venmo Marieka up.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Actually don't wait.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
So what's the number one?

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
I have to organize this.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Okay.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Well, let's just not do it then.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Yeah.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Do you have a sweet tooth?

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Do you have a sweet tooth?

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Yes.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
What a weird episode that was.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Do you believe in that in the past?

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Yeah.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Do you believe in the power of curse?

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
Yes.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
No, I'm here.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
I have a sweet tooth, but I don't believe in the power of curse.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
You had your hearing test of anything.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
Yeah.

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
The episode counts as that, then sure.

35:05.000 --> 35:11.000
I haven't had my hearing tested, but I have had somebody looking my ear and find ear wax.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
So I got a ear wax removal.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Removal with the well.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Uh, you're supposed to have a doctor do it.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Can you?

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Yeah.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
Yeah.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Well, I don't know anything.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Did the chops.

35:22.000 --> 35:27.000
And then I had the little, you know, the baster that you flush it out with.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
And I got it.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
The wax out.

35:29.000 --> 35:34.000
But afterwards, like within 30 seconds, I felt so dizzy that the room was spinning.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
Like I had a fucked up face.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
Yeah.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Or something like that.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
But I had to lay down and I felt like sick to my stomach for like an hour.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Might have been something wrong.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Yeah.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Can you show it?

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
I'm excited.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
But I'm afraid to do the other ear now.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Planting a trip soon.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
No follow-ups at all to the Marieka thinking she could see the future.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
My ear related story or just powering through.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Do you think?

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
Or do you think we should take a little rest stop and explore the answers?

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
And I mean to clarify, I can't see.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
It's not a crystal ball.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
It's the fact that there's a layer of fun.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
This idea.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Not really.

36:11.000 --> 36:16.000
It's supposed to be beyond relief.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Rapid fire.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Right?

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
I don't even remember what he asked just now.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
So I think that's pretty interesting.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
Can you remember the tallest band you've ever seen?

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
What did he say?

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
It's hard because you guys keep talking over the ship.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
Can you remember the tallest band you've ever seen?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
No.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Yeah.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Actually that's a basketball game.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Ball baller.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Maybe shack.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
I don't know if I've ever seen a football ball.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
I probably went to a game where Bobon was there.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
I think he's 7-3.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
I feel like there's been a couple of games that you've talked about.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Were like a full ball was there.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
I would have left the arena.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
No, I never said that about.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
No, that was must have been.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
It was either that or Marika Stewart stated.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
One time I at a.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
Like Rage Festival.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
That my dad was catering.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
When I was really little, there was a man on stilts.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
And he was he scared me so much I started crying.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
So that's probably the tallest man I've ever seen.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
Do you love to go a wanderin beneath the clear blue sky?

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
That's a classic.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
That's a classic quote.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I do like walking.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
So yeah.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
And I do like wandering underneath.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
I don't like wandering.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Yeah.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
But yeah.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Well, that's because you're lost.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Not all who wander or lost.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
But some who wander are lost.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
And you're lost.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
I don't mean like in the city.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
I mean.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I'm not I'm not lost in life.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
And I don't like wandering.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
Because it implies either slow.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Speeds or no purpose.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
And neither of those things appealed to me.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
What is this?

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
I feel like you guys are treating this episode differently.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Just because it's like after hours.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
It's like you guys want to get out of here or some shit.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
I think it's easier to be such a good answer.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
The energy is high for me.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I feel like I've been driving this through.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
You know, there's like a driving base.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
There's a driving kick drum.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
And then there's me on this episode.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Hosting.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
To get us right before dinner is the May dear of our day.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
Have you noticed when big stars real estate agents have become?

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
Yeah.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Daria Greenbaum.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
You careful with your personal records.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
Do you guys keep personal records?

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Do you have a filing cabinet?

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Do you have it in cash?

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Do you have it in signing a not cash?

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Hard copies.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
No, you guys have me saying cash.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
But I just wondered.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
No.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
I'm here.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
Do I have money in a hard cash?

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
Do you keep personal records in a filing cabinet?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
I have like tax information.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Yeah.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Okay.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Can I say I don't want to dox this person.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
But the person who uploaded this video, which is Jonathan Friggs.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Asked you things.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
His name is Zane Goliah.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
Kind of a name.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
That would be.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Oh, that's like two.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
That's not a user name.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Is your computer ever seemed to have a mind of its own?

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
Have you ever visited a Chinatown section in a major city?

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
Have you ever visited a Chinatown section in a major city?

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
Have you ever visited a Chinatown section in a major city?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
I was just in San Francisco's Chinatown.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Nary three days ago.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
And it might be the best Chinatown ever been to.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Sounds good one.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
It's a good one or.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
It's a good one.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
I was in London, recently.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
That was also nice.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
I did a good London.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
My trip was more interesting when yours.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
It's hard because there's not like little America's other places.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Right.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Maybe the airports.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Amir, speak on it.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
Um, are there little other countries in other countries?

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Or is that purely an American thing?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Have you ever visited a flea market?

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Yes.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
We've obviously visited a flea market.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
The flea markets in my hometown used to sell like.

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
Have you noticed how many successful restaurants are themed based these days?

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
That's not true.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Why?

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
Well, this show is like from the 80s.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
Yeah.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Saying these days, not true.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
Okay.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
Then you guys don't think.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
Because all the headgum api hours shows are themed based.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
So I just don't understand why you're like so aggressive.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
What's that?

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Restaurants?

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Restaurants have a theme.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
How successful themed restaurants?

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Name a restaurant.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Name a restaurant.

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
We'll just rapid fire keep naming restaurants and I'll tell you what their themes are.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
All right.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
They may not be obvious.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Chick-fil-A.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
A bigotry.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Continued out.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
In and out.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
California.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Panda Express.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
Sticky sauce.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Really thick.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Fiskas.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
Continue.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Yes.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Yeah.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
The theme is gray.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
Because the brown beef ends up sort of gray.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
Are there any tie chains?

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
No.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Continue.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Let's keep doing this rapid fire.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
I think we can all figure it out.

40:59.000 --> 41:04.000
There should be fast casual tie chains.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
What about fast casual tie G?

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
It's like you can get in and get out through a drive through but sort of get your piece

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
and find your balance.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
I feel like that's good.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
Name another restaurant.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Against tie cheese.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Why don't we name a couple more restaurants.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
We'll go rapid fire.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Wrap this up.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
The B.K.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
C.P.K.

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
The theme is wood fire.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
These cool.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
No.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
There's no way they can live fire.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
Just a bit of it.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Fuck off.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Let's just continue.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
Let's get one more question from Jonathan Friggs and we'll be out.

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
Have you ever had the desire to write your initials and what's cement to you?

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
What is this show?

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Plugs.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
What do you guys have going on?

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
What do you want to point to people to and then yes or no?

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Just end on yes or no for that.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Plugs.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Yes or no.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Plugs.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Yes or no.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Right.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Yeah.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
Ameri-K-Lon on x slash twitter and instagram threads.

42:00.000 --> 42:05.000
Let's go to the box to talk blue sky.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
Listen to the pit wall.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
Go see review reviews live show.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
I thought you were a comedy festival.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000

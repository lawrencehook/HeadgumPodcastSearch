00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
We met Title this episode, Hodge Podge,

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
because no one here knows each other.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
We've got Billy Skiffiery from the Nojup podcast,

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Emmy Award winner we should say.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
We've got Alex Burkeman making her head-gum podcast debut.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
What is your job time?

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Senior Crater Partnerships Manager.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Huge, so you get ads.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
You get branded content.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Crater is enjoying the platform.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Crater is to join the platform.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
We're not going to be my fourth.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
We're just listed what he thinks people in an office do.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
So you get ads?

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
I don't actually work at this network.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Corey Lane returning.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
You were at your episode as a hit.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
So we had W back.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Thank you.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Also I needed someone else.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Oh, wow.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
You should practice quitting while you're ahead.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
When you're complimenting people.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Well, I tried to get you in Madison to come.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
She couldn't do it.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
And then you said yes.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
And so then I was like, who else can you know?

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
I've a very lowly supervised work from home job.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Yeah.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
And we should say you work for a government agency.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
I do work for a government agency.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Murdieka Brownlee on the sex.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Obviously Casey Donna, you on the facts.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
We've got you on a voice of God, Mike.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
That's right.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Let's keep you highly active during this episode.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Jeff's committed nervous.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I'm coming.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
He feels untill right now.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
It's just me.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
We did in episode.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Was that?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
I was.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
I was.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I was.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
You're talking about me.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
But you guys talk about me.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
What's going on?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
We just did an episode.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
The morning at 10.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Now it's noon.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
And that one was the episode that was more outlined.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
We have a plan here.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
But it really relies on your guys' personality.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Is your joy or inner child.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
May I ask you a question?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
You may not.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Okay.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Murdieka, you have anything for me?

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Do I have anything for you?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Questions concerns from New York City.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Yeah.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
I'd like to know what the door dash or their that we just received is.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
We'll get there.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
That's actually the last segment.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Do you want to start with that segment?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Do you want to start with that segment?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
We can start with that segment.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
What?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Don't put this on me.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
You're the one that just timed thing poorly.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
I didn't time things make it.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
I didn't want.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
What do you want me to do?

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
I scheduled it ahead to get there at noon so that it would be there for sure.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
And if there are any issues, any refunds, any substitutions, like it's still

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
order it.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.560
You always complain that when I order things for this show in LA, that I don't set it to

02:46.560 --> 02:47.560
you in New York.

02:47.560 --> 02:50.000
The first time I do it, I get lumbasted by you.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
I never even ever ordered things for this show in LA, period.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
You just said things to a mirror at random hours of the night.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.500
That's true.

03:01.500 --> 03:04.000
One time I sent a mirror.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.680
DJ Khaled's wings or like chicken wing company ghost kitchen through door dash.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.680
I didn't know he was out of town.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.680
So this food sat there on his doorstep, rotting wing.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.680
No, it was wings.

03:18.680 --> 03:19.680
It wasn't the worst.

03:19.680 --> 03:20.680
That was a lot of stereotype.

03:20.680 --> 03:21.680
It was a lot of stereotype.

03:21.680 --> 03:22.680
It was a lot of stereotype.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.680
It was a lot of stereotype.

03:23.680 --> 03:24.680
It was a lot of stereotype.

03:24.680 --> 03:25.680
It was out of town for days.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.680
It just didn't have claims casino.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.680
So I had to get the last thing in the door.

03:29.680 --> 03:30.680
Have to.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.680
Is the thing that you should explore in that sentence.

03:32.680 --> 03:33.680
You didn't have to do eddy of that.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.680
I disagree.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.680
You recorded a podcast today, Tanya.

03:37.680 --> 03:38.680
Yep.

03:38.680 --> 03:39.680
Yesterday.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.680
You gave me a five minute window to respond.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.680
If I could do a Tanya on podcast today.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.680
And you said, Oh, we lost that.

03:47.680 --> 03:48.680
We lost that window.

03:48.680 --> 03:49.680
We did.

03:49.680 --> 03:50.680
Well, what do you mean we did?

03:50.680 --> 03:52.680
Because you just said you recorded a Tanya.

03:52.680 --> 03:53.680
I filled up.

03:53.680 --> 03:54.680
Okay.

03:54.680 --> 03:55.680
So I lost that.

03:55.680 --> 03:56.680
You lost.

03:56.680 --> 03:57.680
Oh, I might have not worried it correctly.

03:57.680 --> 03:58.680
Correct.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.680
To address the energy coming into this podcast.

04:00.680 --> 04:01.680
Can I just ask real quick?

04:01.680 --> 04:04.680
Were they unkind to you in the podcast this morning?

04:04.680 --> 04:05.680
Was anybody mean to you?

04:05.680 --> 04:07.680
Um, who was on that one?

04:08.680 --> 04:10.680
It was Billy brick.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.680
And my friends sess Lee and Lucy.

04:12.680 --> 04:13.680
Comedians.

04:13.680 --> 04:14.680
Oh, I love them.

04:14.680 --> 04:15.680
Yeah.

04:15.680 --> 04:16.680
Uh, we do.

04:16.680 --> 04:17.680
Great.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.680
Those are just like people that would be mean to you.

04:19.680 --> 04:20.680
Would or would not.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.680
They don't sound like they were kind of mean.

04:22.680 --> 04:23.680
Oh, were they?

04:23.680 --> 04:24.680
I think Billy would be mean to you.

04:24.680 --> 04:25.680
Yeah.

04:25.680 --> 04:26.680
I guess I don't know Billy.

04:26.680 --> 04:27.680
Yeah.

04:27.680 --> 04:28.680
The other two people.

04:28.680 --> 04:29.680
Um, we did a squad off.

04:29.680 --> 04:32.680
It was, uh, two squads to handle.

04:32.680 --> 04:33.680
Too many squads to handle.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.680
Uh, was the name of the game.

04:35.680 --> 04:36.680
We did.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.680
Who can do the most squads in three minutes?

04:38.680 --> 04:40.680
Well, also being bombarded by questions.

04:40.680 --> 04:41.680
Who won?

04:41.680 --> 04:42.680
I did technically.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.680
Look, setting up games for you to win.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.680
I didn't think I was going to.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.680
Anyway, and then Sess Lee won.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.680
But what inspired the squad off?

04:52.680 --> 04:56.680
Uh, I came up with the titles to too many squads to handle and then kind of back

04:56.680 --> 04:57.680
my way.

04:57.680 --> 04:58.680
Well, I backed that ass up.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.680
I also backed my way into what the game was.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.680
I don't even understand the play on words for too many squads.

05:04.680 --> 05:10.680
Well, I tried, you know, we tried to do like game shows, uh, inspired segments.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.680
Oh, and that's too hot to handle.

05:12.680 --> 05:13.680
Yeah.

05:13.680 --> 05:14.680
Thank you.

05:14.680 --> 05:15.680
Take help, Corey.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.680
I got you.

05:16.680 --> 05:17.680
Good.

05:17.680 --> 05:18.680
Look it out.

05:18.680 --> 05:19.680
Um, you've been on the show before.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.680
You've been on the show before.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.680
Marie Gunn fortunately is like a weekly staple.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.680
Alex, what do you want people to know about you?

05:25.680 --> 05:29.680
Uh, what do you want to point to people to, uh, four zeros?

05:29.680 --> 05:32.680
And very hungover today.

05:32.680 --> 05:33.680
Really?

05:33.680 --> 05:35.680
So far from the company dinner.

05:35.680 --> 05:36.680
Yes.

05:36.680 --> 05:37.680
Wow.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.680
Now I wish I had gone instead of outlining this.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.680
For three hours.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.680
So I'm actively trying not to die.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.680
Uh, I can't believe you said yes.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.680
I asked Alex 10 minutes ago.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.680
She wanted to be on this episode because of your build.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.680
You don't have to do this if you're really hungover.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.680
But I really appreciate you powering through.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.680
I think it felt right.

05:58.680 --> 06:01.680
I felt like a good fit.

06:01.680 --> 06:02.680
I'm already in pain.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.680
Why not just double it under this podcast.

06:04.680 --> 06:07.680
It's like when you're sad and you listen to like sad songs.

06:07.680 --> 06:08.680
Yeah.

06:08.680 --> 06:09.680
Lean in.

06:09.680 --> 06:10.680
Yeah.

06:10.680 --> 06:11.680
Lean in.

06:11.680 --> 06:12.680
How was the party?

06:12.680 --> 06:13.680
It was great.

06:13.680 --> 06:14.680
Yeah.

06:14.680 --> 06:15.680
Fun.

06:15.680 --> 06:16.680
Had a lot of wine.

06:16.680 --> 06:17.680
Was it wine?

06:17.680 --> 06:18.680
Yeah.

06:18.680 --> 06:19.680
It was a lot of wine.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.680
Did anybody embarrass themselves?

06:20.680 --> 06:21.680
Casey.

06:21.680 --> 06:22.680
Casey.

06:22.680 --> 06:23.680
Well, look at the fresh.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.680
Casey was wearing his bolo tie.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.680
And always wearing.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.680
Casey's.

06:28.680 --> 06:29.680
Alex.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.680
Alex told me how.

06:30.680 --> 06:31.680
Sharp.

06:31.680 --> 06:32.680
I liked it.

06:32.680 --> 06:35.680
It really made my night.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.680
It seems to have also made your this morning.

06:38.680 --> 06:39.680
Yeah.

06:39.680 --> 06:40.680
You're glowing.

06:40.680 --> 06:41.680
Yeah.

06:41.680 --> 06:42.680
That's a beautiful smile.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.680
It's really nice to get a compliment on my clothes, you know.

06:45.680 --> 06:46.680
Yeah.

06:46.680 --> 06:52.680
I don't think I've ever been as happy as you look right now.

06:52.680 --> 06:53.680
That reminds me.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.680
I'm also not.

06:54.680 --> 06:55.680
Casey.

06:55.680 --> 06:59.680
Would you just give me your finger now?

06:59.680 --> 07:00.680
Pretty good.

07:00.680 --> 07:01.680
What did you do?

07:01.680 --> 07:04.680
I just wanted to say one thing.

07:04.680 --> 07:10.680
Which is that I saw a cowboy ask shirt that I've been meaning to send you.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.680
And so I'm going to do that now.

07:12.680 --> 07:13.680
Finally.

07:13.680 --> 07:14.680
Because this reminded me of that.

07:14.680 --> 07:15.680
Okay.

07:15.680 --> 07:16.680
Great.

07:16.680 --> 07:17.680
Can't wait to see it.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.680
What did I do last night?

07:19.680 --> 07:20.680
Is what you asked Jeff?

07:20.680 --> 07:21.680
Yeah.

07:21.680 --> 07:26.680
I watched the Netflix movie.

07:26.680 --> 07:31.680
The Noel Diary, which wasn't very good.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.680
But I had a hoot in the hall there.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.680
Hmm.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.680
Was Marika on your other episode?

07:37.680 --> 07:38.680
No.

07:38.680 --> 07:39.680
Okay.

07:39.680 --> 07:40.680
So is your first time in here?

07:40.680 --> 07:41.680
Hi, nice to meet you Marika.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.680
Am I the only one asking what you kind of speed things up a little bit?

07:43.680 --> 07:44.680
Speed things up.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.680
So maybe this is a little bit.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.680
I think that's like a vibe.

07:49.680 --> 07:50.680
It's a vibe.

07:50.680 --> 07:51.680
It's a vibe.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.680
It's a vibe.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.680
It's a vibe.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.680
It is one of the, I'd say, top complaints.

07:55.680 --> 07:59.680
That I see on the internet about myself.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.680
But I don't really care.

08:01.680 --> 08:07.680
I think it takes confidence to operate at your own speed Marika.

08:07.680 --> 08:16.680
Let's keep things going with everyone.

08:16.680 --> 08:17.680
Bond of the week.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.680
Just a dude.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.680
I don't know.

08:21.680 --> 08:22.680
Alex, have you ever heard the show?

08:22.680 --> 08:23.680
No.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.680
Oh.

08:26.680 --> 08:27.680
Bond.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.680
You're still doing this.

08:29.680 --> 08:30.680
My image of you.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.680
She'd like to have to find you.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.680
You're already here.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.680
Yeah.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.680
She doesn't have to research you as a creator.

08:37.680 --> 08:38.680
You're here.

08:38.680 --> 08:39.680
She's listening to other people.

08:39.680 --> 08:41.680
See if they want to come on the podcast.

08:41.680 --> 08:42.680
Exactly.

08:42.680 --> 08:43.680
Right.

08:43.680 --> 08:45.680
I did.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.680
Listen to one episode.

08:47.680 --> 08:48.680
Which episode?

08:48.680 --> 08:52.680
It was literally you just like telling a very long story.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.680
It was the audiobook episode.

08:55.680 --> 08:56.680
Yes.

08:56.680 --> 08:59.680
And I didn't understand what was going on whatsoever.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.680
I was very confused.

09:01.680 --> 09:04.680
That's because I couldn't book any guests that week.

09:04.680 --> 09:08.680
And we had to put some shit out.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.680
And so I read a chapter from this book that we do in, like,

09:11.680 --> 09:13.680
bits about on this show.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.680
And he way.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.680
We do the segment called Bond of the week.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.680
Dingo Craig is out as double a seven.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.680
And so every week until the next James is cast,

09:22.680 --> 09:24.680
we're lobbing up our pick as for the next Bond.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.680
This week, my pick is Billy Ska Fury.

09:26.680 --> 09:27.680
Thank you.

09:27.680 --> 09:28.680
I think what's that?

09:28.680 --> 09:29.680
Thank you.

09:29.680 --> 09:30.680
Got it.

09:30.680 --> 09:31.680
You're already jacked.

09:31.680 --> 09:32.680
You don't have to work out for the role.

09:32.680 --> 09:33.680
Okay.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.680
And I also think lustic could be the gadgets guy.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.680
Oh, he is a human gadget.

09:36.680 --> 09:38.680
Just quit Twitter.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.680
He quit Twitter.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.680
He quit Twitter.

09:40.680 --> 09:41.680
He's a musk.

09:41.680 --> 09:42.680
Goes a musk.

09:42.680 --> 09:43.680
Yeah.

09:43.680 --> 09:44.680
Yeah.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.680
I hope that the whole thing goes belly up because I'd love to have less social media.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.680
I found it funny that one of my close friends Adam quit social media.

09:49.680 --> 09:53.680
Right around the same week that you said, if I get to 10,000 followers,

09:53.680 --> 09:54.680
I'll post my ass.

09:54.680 --> 09:55.680
So please email me.

09:55.680 --> 09:56.680
I saw your ass.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.680
Yeah.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.680
So two different directions there.

09:58.680 --> 10:01.680
One of very sweaty kind of, like, please follow me.

10:01.680 --> 10:02.680
I need followers.

10:02.680 --> 10:03.680
Oh, I'm like, good here.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.680
I think that's the perfect thing to go out on.

10:06.680 --> 10:07.680
Or go out with.

10:07.680 --> 10:08.680
And ass?

10:08.680 --> 10:09.680
Yeah.

10:09.680 --> 10:10.680
Okay.

10:10.680 --> 10:11.680
Did you see my ass on Twitter?

10:11.680 --> 10:12.680
Hmm.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.680
Interesting.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.680
It's professionally better that way.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.680
Yeah.

10:16.680 --> 10:17.680
Yeah.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.680
I hired a boot to our photographer because I got to 10,000 followers.

10:19.680 --> 10:24.680
And then I rented a peer space loft took on very tasteful photo of my ass posted

10:24.680 --> 10:25.680
to the internet.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.680
We were downtown this weekend.

10:27.680 --> 10:30.680
And you're like, that's the loft that I took picture of my ass.

10:30.680 --> 10:31.680
Yeah.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.680
That was like, that's awesome.

10:32.680 --> 10:33.680
That's true.

10:33.680 --> 10:34.680
That's such casual.

10:34.680 --> 10:35.680
Have you seen my ass on Twitter?

10:35.680 --> 10:36.680
That loft.

10:36.680 --> 10:37.680
Sorry.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.680
Marie, go on second.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.680
Yeah.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.680
I've got my meanness back.

10:41.680 --> 10:44.680
It's been a couple of weeks where I kind of ramed it in.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.680
But I think it's the turtle neck.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.680
I thought you're going to be nice today.

10:48.680 --> 10:49.680
Yeah.

10:49.680 --> 10:50.680
I did say right before we recorded it.

10:50.680 --> 10:51.680
It was like, maybe I'll be nice to everybody.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.680
And then I realized I didn't want to do that.

10:53.680 --> 10:54.680
Yeah.

10:54.680 --> 10:55.680
Definitely wouldn't.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.680
My bond of the week is Casey in his bowloat tie.

10:58.680 --> 10:59.680
Hmm.

10:59.680 --> 11:00.680
Wow. Nice.

11:00.680 --> 11:01.680
That's cool.

11:01.680 --> 11:02.680
I agree.

11:02.680 --> 11:03.680
This is huge for me.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.680
What a day.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.680
Casey, have you ever worn a bowloat work?

11:07.680 --> 11:08.680
No.

11:08.680 --> 11:09.680
No.

11:09.680 --> 11:10.680
I haven't.

11:10.680 --> 11:11.680
Do you like for events?

11:11.680 --> 11:12.680
I don't.

11:12.680 --> 11:15.680
I kind of gave up regular ties and I've switched to bowloat.

11:15.680 --> 11:16.680
Yeah.

11:16.680 --> 11:17.680
I got a handful of them.

11:17.680 --> 11:18.680
Nice.

11:18.680 --> 11:21.680
And it's a real compliment getter.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.680
You're kind of a uniform guy, I would say.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.680
Like you play within the uniform.

11:25.680 --> 11:28.680
But I kind of know what to expect from you, which is a cool thing.

11:28.680 --> 11:29.680
Wow.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.680
This is huge for me.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.680
I think it's the nice episode only.

11:33.680 --> 11:34.680
Like across the booth.

11:34.680 --> 11:36.680
I also left the,

11:36.680 --> 11:38.680
that we're, we keep describing the only person

11:39.680 --> 11:40.680
I'm not a camera.

11:46.680 --> 11:47.680
Fun's the week.

11:47.680 --> 11:50.680
Do you guys have anybody ideas for the next James?

11:50.680 --> 11:52.680
Uh, yeah.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.680
I think I'm ready to do it.

11:54.680 --> 11:55.680
Me.

11:55.680 --> 11:56.680
Cory Peter Land.

11:56.680 --> 11:57.680
Yeah.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.680
I think that they haven't had an Irish bond.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.680
And they've also not had a Jewish bond.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.680
And I can do both.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.680
That sounds like every Brit's worst nightmare.

12:07.680 --> 12:12.680
We just come in there and take their jobs and have sex with their wives.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.680
So you, but that was like their problem like 50 years ago.

12:15.680 --> 12:17.680
They've got other problems now, but 50 years ago.

12:17.680 --> 12:18.680
They were really worried about us.

12:18.680 --> 12:19.680
Irish and Jewish people.

12:19.680 --> 12:20.680
Yeah.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.680
So your, your cast is bond today.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.680
Yeah.

12:24.680 --> 12:25.680
What do you do?

12:25.680 --> 12:26.680
Shooting starts in let's say March.

12:26.680 --> 12:27.680
Yeah.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.680
Are you changing the hair?

12:28.680 --> 12:29.680
Are you just trimming the beard?

12:29.680 --> 12:31.680
Uh, I'm getting worse.

12:31.680 --> 12:36.680
You're getting more layered, longer.

12:36.680 --> 12:39.680
Um, I, I do clean up my unibrow.

12:39.680 --> 12:40.680
I'm going to let it go.

12:40.680 --> 12:41.680
I'm going to let it go.

12:41.680 --> 12:42.680
Yep.

12:42.680 --> 12:46.680
Uh, I'm going to go on like an ice cream diet.

12:46.680 --> 12:47.680
I'm going to be the first.

12:47.680 --> 12:48.680
You do the Ryan Gosling.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.680
Yeah.

12:49.680 --> 12:50.680
I'm going to be 400 pounds.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.680
And then you, you show up on day one.

12:52.680 --> 12:53.680
Yeah.

12:53.680 --> 12:54.680
And they're like, Weezister Lane.

12:54.680 --> 12:55.680
Yeah.

12:55.680 --> 12:56.680
Right this way to hair and makeup.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.680
And you say, Oh, no.

12:58.680 --> 12:59.680
No hair makeup for me.

12:59.680 --> 13:00.680
I've done it.

13:00.680 --> 13:01.680
Yeah.

13:01.680 --> 13:02.680
And then do you do your own stunts?

13:02.680 --> 13:03.680
Of course.

13:03.680 --> 13:04.680
But do you train for them?

13:04.680 --> 13:05.680
No.

13:06.680 --> 13:10.680
Uh, and I die on set like the, the crow.

13:10.680 --> 13:11.680
Wow.

13:11.680 --> 13:12.680
Yeah.

13:12.680 --> 13:13.680
That's it.

13:13.680 --> 13:14.680
It's contract.

13:14.680 --> 13:15.680
Yeah.

13:15.680 --> 13:16.680
Yeah.

13:16.680 --> 13:17.680
And so they never really comes out.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.680
But all your interactions with women aren't like being

13:20.680 --> 13:21.680
Swav betting them.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.680
It's not very uncomfortable.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.680
Nothing that you can really quite put a finger on is wrong.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.680
But so you prepare for the movie like the crow.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.680
And then you quote the Raven to never more.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.680
Yeah.

13:32.680 --> 13:33.680
Yeah.

13:33.680 --> 13:34.680
And then I die.

13:34.680 --> 13:35.680
And everyone's like, That's okay.

13:35.680 --> 13:36.680
Yeah.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.680
I think cast that guy's bond anyway.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.680
Yeah.

13:39.680 --> 13:43.680
He hasn't really done much.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.680
And then he like killed himself.

13:45.680 --> 13:46.680
Essentially.

13:46.680 --> 13:49.680
I remember you asking this of starting this game.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.680
The James Bond game that we're playing right now.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.680
Like 50 episodes ago when I was on.

13:53.680 --> 13:57.680
And it's just shocked that it's lasted this long.

13:57.680 --> 14:00.680
I'm fucking waiting on Barbara broccoli to make the decision.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.680
Like Barbara broccoli to produce her bond.

14:02.680 --> 14:05.680
And she's like, that sounds like a fucking last name.

14:05.680 --> 14:06.680
Yeah.

14:06.680 --> 14:10.680
And the guy who started the first Don string bean.

14:10.680 --> 14:11.680
Yeah.

14:11.680 --> 14:15.680
Fucking bojack horsemen as names.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.680
Jamie and Edamame.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.680
I said track 50 episodes going.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.680
I still think track would make a great part.

14:21.680 --> 14:22.680
Yeah.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.680
I guess he'd be like.

14:24.680 --> 14:26.680
Yeah.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.680
Let me happen on that kind of like pseudo killing yourself.

14:29.680 --> 14:30.680
Yeah.

14:30.680 --> 14:31.680
Yeah.

14:31.680 --> 14:32.680
Yeah.

14:32.680 --> 14:33.680
You can kill yourself on it, too.

14:33.680 --> 14:34.680
How are you feeling right now, Jeff?

14:34.680 --> 14:36.680
Well, I'm starting to sore off cold brew.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.680
My cortisol levels are all over the fucking place because I haven't had water.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.680
And I didn't eat anything this morning.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.680
Alex, do you have any ideas for bonds?

14:43.680 --> 14:45.680
The next James Bond.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.680
I would have to go with Larry David.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.680
That'd be good.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.680
That's a good one.

14:50.680 --> 14:51.680
That's a really good one.

14:51.680 --> 14:52.680
Yeah.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.680
I just want to be cringing the whole time.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.680
And it all takes place.

14:57.680 --> 15:05.680
Like a freight that he's going to keel over from stunts or just like his general demeanor general demeanor.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.680
But maybe maybe killing over to.

15:08.680 --> 15:09.680
A grumpy bond.

15:09.680 --> 15:10.680
A grumpy bond.

15:10.680 --> 15:11.680
Yeah.

15:11.680 --> 15:12.680
Who wants to be here?

15:12.680 --> 15:14.680
That's what the software runs.

15:14.680 --> 15:15.680
No.

15:15.680 --> 15:19.680
He's so put upon every time that he's like called in to solve something.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.680
He's like, oh.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.680
And also when the bond girl dies, he's like.

15:23.680 --> 15:24.680
Larry.

15:24.680 --> 15:25.680
Larry Bond.

15:25.680 --> 15:26.180
Larry Bond.

15:26.180 --> 15:27.180
Larry Bond.

15:27.180 --> 15:30.180
The whole movie takes place like west of Satell.

15:30.180 --> 15:34.180
But north of Venice and south of the palace.

15:34.180 --> 15:36.180
It's where Jewish people live.

15:36.180 --> 15:39.180
That's just where all of Kerburentusia's in place.

15:39.180 --> 15:40.180
Never mind.

15:40.180 --> 15:41.180
Except for your catch you in a.

15:41.180 --> 15:42.180
Yeah.

15:42.180 --> 15:43.180
Anti-Semitic.

15:43.180 --> 15:47.180
Let's take it into news of the day.

15:47.180 --> 15:52.180
A recent CNBC article argues that.

15:52.180 --> 15:58.180
COVID-19 changed the dating landscape.

15:58.180 --> 16:02.180
And argues for sober first dates instead of like getting a drink.

16:02.180 --> 16:08.180
What do you guys think the best first date is?

16:08.180 --> 16:09.180
Genuine answer.

16:09.180 --> 16:10.180
Yeah.

16:10.180 --> 16:11.180
This is a genuine question.

16:11.180 --> 16:12.180
Okay.

16:12.180 --> 16:16.180
Like a first date that didn't start off as a first date.

16:16.180 --> 16:19.180
But then by the end you're like, oh, this is a first date.

16:19.180 --> 16:21.180
You've accidentally.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.180
Are the last two people somewhere.

16:23.180 --> 16:25.180
Are you or the first two people somewhere.

16:25.180 --> 16:28.180
And you get someone on one time.

16:28.180 --> 16:31.180
And then by the end you're like, oh.

16:31.180 --> 16:35.180
And then when you do go on what is technically your first date,

16:35.180 --> 16:37.180
it kind of feels like a second date.

16:37.180 --> 16:38.180
That's cool.

16:38.180 --> 16:39.180
Yeah.

16:39.180 --> 16:40.180
I've actually.

16:40.180 --> 16:41.180
That's happened before.

16:41.180 --> 16:42.180
Yeah.

16:42.180 --> 16:43.180
It's great.

16:43.180 --> 16:44.180
It's organic.

16:44.180 --> 16:46.180
A lot of the best relationships I've had have started that way.

16:46.180 --> 16:47.180
Yeah.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.180
Shout out.

16:49.180 --> 16:50.180
Uh.

16:50.180 --> 16:51.180
Hey, man.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.180
Who are you pointing to?

16:55.180 --> 16:56.180
Camera two.

16:56.180 --> 16:57.180
Camera two.

16:58.180 --> 16:59.180
Shout out.

16:59.180 --> 17:00.180
Oh, yeah.

17:00.180 --> 17:01.180
Let's keep going.

17:01.180 --> 17:02.180
I'll leave it all out.

17:02.180 --> 17:03.180
Maria.

17:03.180 --> 17:04.180
Let's hear it.

17:08.180 --> 17:09.180
Faster.

17:09.180 --> 17:10.180
How is it?

17:10.180 --> 17:13.180
We put me on the spot.

17:13.180 --> 17:14.180
I don't know.

17:14.180 --> 17:16.180
In the door dash bag is some speed.

17:17.180 --> 17:18.180
So actually, let's.

17:18.180 --> 17:20.180
Like get that instructor speed.

17:20.180 --> 17:21.180
Yeah.

17:21.180 --> 17:24.180
Just like prolonging it because you're just complaining.

17:24.180 --> 17:26.180
And it's taking longer.

17:26.180 --> 17:28.180
I think like a walk.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.180
Somewhere like in a park.

17:30.180 --> 17:31.180
Yeah.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.180
Yeah.

17:32.180 --> 17:35.180
You know how like I forget which acting school this is.

17:35.180 --> 17:39.180
But it's like, uh, paying attention to your physicality and like what

17:39.180 --> 17:43.180
center of your body you lead with informs the character.

17:43.180 --> 17:47.180
You have your nose so high up in the air.

17:47.180 --> 17:48.180
Yeah.

17:48.180 --> 17:51.180
Your energy is like snooty and whole year then out today.

17:51.180 --> 17:53.180
Whoa.

17:53.180 --> 17:56.180
So uncalled for.

17:56.180 --> 17:58.180
No, I'm just I've bones to pick with.

17:58.180 --> 18:00.180
Is that like second city?

18:00.180 --> 18:01.180
Okay.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.180
Yeah.

18:02.180 --> 18:03.180
Pick the bones then.

18:03.180 --> 18:04.180
What was it?

18:04.180 --> 18:06.180
Mostly that in the speed with which you're talking.

18:06.180 --> 18:08.180
What's your walk in the park you said?

18:08.180 --> 18:09.180
Yeah.

18:10.180 --> 18:13.180
I mean, we're all obviously team Marika.

18:13.180 --> 18:14.180
Yeah.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.180
Yeah.

18:15.180 --> 18:17.180
I just want to go meet and clear that up right now.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.180
Right.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.180
No one is hiding with Jeff.

18:19.180 --> 18:20.180
The TV.

18:20.180 --> 18:21.180
The TV.

18:21.180 --> 18:22.180
You know, I was to get out of here.

18:22.180 --> 18:23.180
Yeah.

18:23.180 --> 18:24.180
I broke the TV.

18:24.180 --> 18:26.180
The TV even once to leave right now.

18:26.180 --> 18:27.180
Um.

18:27.180 --> 18:28.180
All in.

18:28.180 --> 18:29.180
So.

18:29.180 --> 18:30.180
I can't.

18:30.180 --> 18:31.180
Can't.

18:31.180 --> 18:33.180
Maybe like this has to be fixed.

18:33.180 --> 18:36.180
Uh, and go ahead and look at one of the cameras to show them how great

18:36.180 --> 18:38.180
you look today because I think that we've been talking about you a lot.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.180
You look really good.

18:39.180 --> 18:40.180
Hey.

18:40.180 --> 18:41.180
Um.

18:41.180 --> 18:42.180
Yeah.

18:42.180 --> 18:46.180
If I may come in on your body language, I think that if we were in the same room,

18:46.180 --> 18:49.180
you'd be like attacking Jeff.

18:49.180 --> 18:52.180
And would you want me to do that for you?

18:52.180 --> 18:53.180
Uh.

18:53.180 --> 18:54.180
Yeah.

18:54.180 --> 18:55.180
That would be great.

18:55.180 --> 18:56.180
Cool.

18:56.180 --> 18:58.180
I think there's like also a delay problem.

18:58.180 --> 19:03.180
And I feel like if I were just like in the same room, it'd be like slightly faster.

19:03.180 --> 19:04.180
No.

19:05.180 --> 19:07.180
Jeff is just.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.180
Jeff is just being Jeff.

19:08.180 --> 19:09.180
You've done nothing wrong.

19:09.180 --> 19:10.180
Yeah.

19:10.180 --> 19:11.180
What so ever.

19:11.180 --> 19:12.180
You're.

19:12.180 --> 19:13.180
Yeah.

19:13.180 --> 19:15.180
I know you're aware, but I just want you to hear it from someone else.

19:15.180 --> 19:19.180
Because we're trying to make sense of what's happening and you're fine.

19:19.180 --> 19:20.180
You're perfect.

19:20.180 --> 19:21.180
Just the way you are.

19:21.180 --> 19:22.180
Thanks.

19:22.180 --> 19:23.180
You're welcome.

19:23.180 --> 19:24.180
Thank you so much.

19:24.180 --> 19:25.180
Agreed.

19:25.180 --> 19:27.180
You said her nose is so high up in the air.

19:27.180 --> 19:29.180
You use words like snooty.

19:29.180 --> 19:30.180
Yeah.

19:30.180 --> 19:31.180
Holy.

19:31.180 --> 19:32.180
Yeah.

19:32.180 --> 19:33.180
I don't know.

19:33.180 --> 19:34.180
You said.

19:34.180 --> 19:35.180
Holy.

19:35.180 --> 19:36.180
Holy.

19:36.180 --> 19:37.180
No.

19:37.180 --> 19:38.180
Oh.

19:38.180 --> 19:39.180
You're pulling down.

19:39.180 --> 19:40.180
Uh.

19:40.180 --> 19:44.180
So we've got group hang lingering and then first.

19:44.180 --> 19:45.180
Okay.

19:45.180 --> 19:47.180
Miss hear graduation.

19:47.180 --> 19:48.180
What?

19:48.180 --> 19:49.180
That's.

19:49.180 --> 19:50.180
No.

19:50.180 --> 19:53.180
One on one time within a group setting and then your first actual date feels like a second.

19:53.180 --> 19:54.180
We've got walk in the park.

19:54.180 --> 19:55.180
What do you guys got?

19:55.180 --> 19:56.180
Hit us with it.

19:56.180 --> 19:58.180
I like walk in the park and I will just add to that.

19:58.180 --> 20:01.180
That by the end of the walk, you'll maybe both know kind of your point.

20:01.180 --> 20:02.180
Do we want this to keep going?

20:02.180 --> 20:03.180
Yeah.

20:03.180 --> 20:04.180
Do we want to get fries now?

20:04.180 --> 20:06.180
Do we want to share a plate of fries or something like that?

20:06.180 --> 20:07.180
It doesn't have to be like big meal.

20:07.180 --> 20:11.180
We're suddenly someone's going broke or someone's like clocking how much money's going

20:11.180 --> 20:12.180
in and out.

20:12.180 --> 20:15.180
But I do like the idea of like a free simple event and then we could decide, hey, you

20:15.180 --> 20:16.180
want to keep this going a little longer.

20:16.180 --> 20:17.180
Yeah.

20:17.180 --> 20:18.180
And I think day dates.

20:18.180 --> 20:19.180
I'll just say day dates.

20:19.180 --> 20:20.180
Really.

20:20.180 --> 20:21.180
There's just so much.

20:21.180 --> 20:22.180
I don't know.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.180
To me, night time comes with night life comes with hooking up.

20:24.180 --> 20:27.180
All that energy is kind of just all mixed up in there.

20:27.180 --> 20:28.180
That's fair.

20:28.180 --> 20:29.180
Yeah.

20:29.180 --> 20:31.180
So on the sober point, I think a day date is a nice way to start.

20:31.180 --> 20:32.180
Yeah.

20:32.180 --> 20:34.180
I thought you meant gifting them a Rolex day date.

20:34.180 --> 20:35.180
Excuse me.

20:35.180 --> 20:36.180
Alex?

20:36.180 --> 20:44.180
I'd have to go with the way that me and my boyfriend met with playing Edward

20:44.180 --> 20:45.180
Forty Hands.

20:45.180 --> 20:46.180
Wow.

20:46.180 --> 20:47.180
A bar in Ilevista.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.180
Wow.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.180
They let you play that at a bar.

20:50.180 --> 20:51.180
Everybody.

20:51.180 --> 20:56.180
Who duct, who duct tape the forties to your hands?

20:56.180 --> 20:57.180
The bouncer.

20:57.180 --> 20:58.180
Yeah.

20:58.180 --> 20:59.180
Yeah.

20:59.180 --> 21:00.180
Wait.

21:00.180 --> 21:01.180
What a bar.

21:01.180 --> 21:02.180
Yeah.

21:02.180 --> 21:04.180
I've never heard of somebody like Edward.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.180
You go to UCSB.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.180
Yeah.

21:06.180 --> 21:09.180
I feel like just that city is owned by a university culture.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.180
I live as this.

21:10.180 --> 21:11.180
Yes.

21:11.180 --> 21:12.180
That's awesome.

21:12.180 --> 21:13.180
I do.

21:13.180 --> 21:15.180
I didn't get in.

21:15.180 --> 21:17.180
Who put them on your hands?

21:17.180 --> 21:18.180
I would.

21:18.180 --> 21:20.180
I think just friends.

21:20.180 --> 21:21.180
Yeah.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.180
It wasn't a one on one day.

21:22.180 --> 21:24.180
It was just kind of like.

21:24.180 --> 21:26.180
That would be so funny.

21:26.180 --> 21:27.180
I didn't think it was.

21:27.180 --> 21:28.180
They asked her here across the table.

21:28.180 --> 21:29.680
But you just had two forties duct tape.

21:29.680 --> 21:30.680
Two of your hand electrodynamics.

21:30.680 --> 21:31.680
That is who that is.

21:31.680 --> 21:34.060
That is hepy ounces of vault liquid.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.180
That is really fun.

21:36.180 --> 21:41.100
I'll have the bar chop just splashing弟 on your floor.

21:41.100 --> 21:47.100
Then what was the second date.

21:47.100 --> 21:48.740
Let's flip, cut.

21:48.740 --> 21:51.220
Kind of act good.

21:51.220 --> 21:52.220
No.

21:52.220 --> 21:53.620
Honestly, it was month later.

21:53.620 --> 21:57.660
a jazz bar dinner situation.

21:57.660 --> 22:01.780
Of course, the natural four hands to jazz bar.

22:01.780 --> 22:03.260
And that's the spectrum of data.

22:03.260 --> 22:05.380
Yeah, jazz club or Edward Fortyhands.

22:05.380 --> 22:06.340
Those are the two end.

22:06.340 --> 22:07.340
Yes.

22:07.340 --> 22:08.540
That's awesome.

22:08.540 --> 22:11.980
And when was the moment you realized this is the guy for me?

22:11.980 --> 22:13.820
Mm.

22:13.820 --> 22:16.900
About three months in.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.740
That's the way.

22:18.740 --> 22:20.940
What's that so many dates?

22:20.940 --> 22:22.340
Well, no, not long term.

22:22.340 --> 22:26.300
I mean, just that you wanted to pursue it more than like a casual thing.

22:26.300 --> 22:27.300
The first time.

22:27.300 --> 22:28.300
The first time.

22:28.300 --> 22:29.300
Yeah.

22:29.300 --> 22:30.300
Okay.

22:30.300 --> 22:31.300
That's fun.

22:31.300 --> 22:32.300
We don't have to move on.

22:32.300 --> 22:35.060
Well, not to a new segment, but to more news of the day.

22:35.060 --> 22:40.020
Also a Percy NBC in the US, you can quote, legally be fired for any reason or no reason

22:40.020 --> 22:41.020
at all.

22:41.020 --> 22:42.780
Let's talk about it.

22:42.780 --> 22:44.420
How do I still have employment here?

22:44.420 --> 22:46.940
I was expecting I'm here to be on this episode and I thought he would jump down my

22:46.940 --> 22:49.220
throat immediately on the one.

22:49.220 --> 22:53.140
I could maybe not speak for him to speak to that.

22:53.140 --> 22:54.140
Yeah.

22:54.140 --> 22:57.220
I think that you're a good looking guy.

22:57.220 --> 22:58.940
That's not good for comedy.

22:58.940 --> 23:02.420
Well, no, and you didn't let me finish.

23:02.420 --> 23:03.820
That is about it.

23:03.820 --> 23:05.620
Just hot.

23:05.620 --> 23:06.620
Just hot.

23:06.620 --> 23:07.860
Yeah, you're really hot.

23:07.860 --> 23:11.260
The long people give you people that you do so.

23:11.260 --> 23:16.540
The long lost remains of the last known Tasmanian tiger have been found in a cupboard.

23:16.540 --> 23:18.700
Wait, we're just off that.

23:18.700 --> 23:19.700
We have to keep it rolling.

23:19.700 --> 23:20.700
Okay.

23:20.700 --> 23:25.580
I mean, what was the last word five minutes to Marieka's draw?

23:25.580 --> 23:26.820
What was it in a cupboard?

23:26.820 --> 23:32.140
The long lost remains of the last known Tasmanian tiger.

23:32.140 --> 23:33.140
Who's covered?

23:33.140 --> 23:34.140
That's crazy.

23:34.140 --> 23:35.140
That's a great question.

23:35.140 --> 23:36.140
That's what I want to know.

23:36.140 --> 23:37.140
Good.

23:37.140 --> 23:38.140
A cupboard.

23:38.140 --> 23:39.140
Not even a closet.

23:39.140 --> 23:40.140
Yeah.

23:40.140 --> 23:41.140
Like a pantry.

23:41.140 --> 23:43.260
Like next to the baking soda, they found this Tasmanian tiger, like what's

23:43.260 --> 23:44.260
a cupboard?

23:44.260 --> 23:45.260
Exactly.

23:45.260 --> 23:46.260
It's like a pantry.

23:46.260 --> 23:47.260
I think.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.260
A small closet.

23:48.820 --> 23:49.980
Okay.

23:49.980 --> 23:51.460
The Wall Street Journal reports on my talk.

23:51.460 --> 23:53.300
I don't want cash anymore.

23:53.300 --> 23:54.460
They want robots.

23:54.460 --> 23:56.460
What's a robot?

23:56.460 --> 23:58.500
Glad you asked.

23:58.500 --> 24:04.820
It's a digital currency that does not appreciate and value like crypto, but really

24:04.820 --> 24:11.060
just exists within the Roblox games, which I don't really know what those are either.

24:11.060 --> 24:14.940
It's like if Leggo's made a game.

24:14.940 --> 24:15.940
Kind of.

24:15.940 --> 24:16.940
Got it.

24:16.940 --> 24:18.220
It's like, you know, Roblox.

24:18.860 --> 24:21.500
Or like, kind of like Leggo's that you can't swallow.

24:21.500 --> 24:22.940
They made a game.

24:22.940 --> 24:24.380
That's online that kids play.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.900
That sounds like a game in and of itself though.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.820
Don't swallow the leggo.

24:28.820 --> 24:30.220
It's like hot potato.

24:30.220 --> 24:33.220
You have to put as many in your mouth without it's

24:33.220 --> 24:35.980
thinkfully swallowing one.

24:35.980 --> 24:40.180
The co-hosts of Good Morning America, fucked each other.

24:40.180 --> 24:42.980
I love the body reset for each one of these news.

24:42.980 --> 24:44.900
So I'm telling us about a lot.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.340
Are you guys here to read this?

24:47.340 --> 24:48.340
Yeah, thoughts.

24:48.340 --> 24:49.340
Have you guys heard about this?

24:49.340 --> 24:50.340
Yeah.

24:50.340 --> 24:51.340
Yeah.

24:51.340 --> 24:52.340
Of course.

24:52.340 --> 24:53.340
Yeah.

24:53.340 --> 24:54.340
It's so funny.

24:54.340 --> 24:55.340
So fittingly named.

24:55.340 --> 24:57.940
Here's what you need to know.

24:57.940 --> 25:01.460
Paparazzi shots of them co-zing up and holding hands and visiting each other's

25:01.460 --> 25:03.740
New York City apartments of surfaced.

25:03.740 --> 25:08.380
Rumors are circulating that they fucked off to a private college in the New York City

25:08.380 --> 25:11.020
set-on on New York Mountains.

25:11.020 --> 25:14.660
And on their last broadcast, one host said, who's looking forward to the weekend?

25:14.660 --> 25:16.580
And the other said, I am.

25:16.580 --> 25:22.100
And there was a third host that said nothing.

25:22.100 --> 25:26.900
Best of all, I wanted to screen share this.

25:26.900 --> 25:40.100
The last Instagram post from the guy TJ Holmes was this.

25:40.100 --> 25:43.940
This particular, this was an anniversary post for his wife.

25:43.940 --> 25:47.580
This particular decade challenges a little late, so he didn't even post on the day.

25:47.580 --> 25:52.340
But 10 years, merely fee-big married me and despite my best effort, she remained married

25:52.340 --> 25:53.980
to me the past 10 years.

25:53.980 --> 25:55.300
That's not hyperbole.

25:55.300 --> 25:56.780
I'm not being dramatic.

25:56.780 --> 26:01.940
I gave her plenty of reasons, excuses, and opportunities to walk her fine ass out the door.

26:01.940 --> 26:07.260
But instead with her built-in black woman, superpowers, she showed a grace and patience

26:07.260 --> 26:08.900
that's incomprehensible.

26:08.900 --> 26:12.620
Asking her for another 10 years would be asking too much, another 10 months.

26:12.620 --> 26:14.100
That might even be a stretch.

26:14.100 --> 26:17.220
If she gave me another 10 weeks, I should consider myself lucky if she puts me up with

26:17.220 --> 26:18.220
me for another 10 days.

26:18.220 --> 26:20.780
I'd be grateful, but if she could even spare another 10 minutes of her time for me today,

26:20.780 --> 26:22.780
I would consider myself blessed.

26:22.780 --> 26:26.380
Um, Casey, can you leave the echo in for all of this?

26:26.380 --> 26:30.340
Uh, oh my god, can I have the remote, Jeff?

26:30.340 --> 26:31.340
Please.

26:31.380 --> 26:32.340
Yep.

26:32.340 --> 26:34.340
Oh nice.

26:34.340 --> 26:45.420
Oh wow, lucky dog seems to be playing on the phone channel.

26:45.420 --> 26:51.580
Let's watch TV for the next 10 or so.

26:51.580 --> 26:55.940
Sorry, lucky dog seems to be playing on the phone channel.

26:55.940 --> 26:56.940
So fun.

26:56.940 --> 27:03.340
It's just three of words I've ever heard in my life.

27:03.340 --> 27:05.340
Everything's coming apart.

27:05.340 --> 27:06.340
Oh no.

27:06.340 --> 27:07.820
That's the halfway point.

27:07.820 --> 27:08.820
We all knew this would happen.

27:08.820 --> 27:09.820
Let's take a break.

27:09.820 --> 27:10.820
Well, thanks for watching.

27:10.820 --> 27:11.820
Why?

27:11.820 --> 27:12.820
Why?

27:12.820 --> 27:13.820
Yeah.

27:13.820 --> 27:17.060
Turn your volume back up.

27:17.060 --> 27:19.060
As this show is sponsored by BetterHelp.

27:19.060 --> 27:21.020
I'm a huge fan of BetterHelp.

27:21.020 --> 27:24.420
I love what they're doing to expand access to therapy.

27:24.780 --> 27:26.060
I'm in therapy every week.

27:26.060 --> 27:31.300
I say at every time I have an ad read for them, it is extremely important to my life.

27:31.300 --> 27:35.740
And again, you know, you don't have to be actively dealing with like a deep trauma to go

27:35.740 --> 27:36.740
to therapy.

27:36.740 --> 27:42.380
Like the reason I go to therapy is to be a better version of myself to understand myself

27:42.380 --> 27:47.380
more so that, you know, the little things don't bother you so that, you know, things don't

27:47.380 --> 27:49.220
grow under resentment or insecurities.

27:49.220 --> 27:53.900
Like just being able to talk with somebody about what you're dealing with, what you're

27:53.900 --> 27:54.900
thinking about.

27:54.900 --> 27:59.180
Even if it's neutral, you will learn something about yourself every week.

27:59.180 --> 28:01.220
And that's where BetterHelp comes in, right?

28:01.220 --> 28:03.260
Because life doesn't come with a user manual.

28:03.260 --> 28:06.620
BetterHelp by a nontherapy is basically the next best thing.

28:06.620 --> 28:10.300
Navigating any of life's challenges can make you feel unsure whether it's a career change,

28:10.300 --> 28:14.300
a new relationship, or becoming a parent, and therapists are trained to help you figure out

28:14.300 --> 28:18.100
the cause of these challenging emotions and learn productive coping skills, which makes

28:18.180 --> 28:24.100
therapy the closest thing to a guided tour of the complex engine called you.

28:24.100 --> 28:26.100
It really does.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.660
Again, I'm in therapy every week.

28:27.660 --> 28:30.100
I could not recommend it enough.

28:30.100 --> 28:35.780
I really think, especially all the mail identifying people out there.

28:35.780 --> 28:37.780
There's no shame in going to therapy.

28:37.780 --> 28:40.980
I've been in therapy for three years.

28:40.980 --> 28:44.780
And you know, you got to feel your feelings, guys.

28:44.780 --> 28:50.460
You got to be able to communicate them healthily, you know, and calmly.

28:50.460 --> 28:53.340
As the world's largest therapy service BetterHelp has matched three million people with

28:53.340 --> 28:58.100
professionally licensed and vetted therapists available 100% online, plus it's affordable.

28:58.100 --> 29:00.660
Just feel a lot of brief questionnaire to match with the therapist and if things aren't

29:00.660 --> 29:03.340
clicking, you can change therapists at any time.

29:03.340 --> 29:04.340
No waiting rooms.

29:04.340 --> 29:05.340
No traffic.

29:05.340 --> 29:07.540
No endless searching for the right therapist.

29:15.660 --> 29:20.300
Thanks, BetterHelp.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.780
We're back.

29:21.780 --> 29:23.780
Everything's fine.

29:23.780 --> 29:27.580
Do you ever see that radiohead, music video, where the water slowly comes up, I

29:27.580 --> 29:30.660
am for Tom York, and he's just drowning, but really, really slowly, and he gets through

29:30.660 --> 29:31.660
singing the entire song?

29:31.660 --> 29:32.660
That feels like Jeff today.

29:32.660 --> 29:37.780
He's my friend, like slowly swim, and just drowned out here.

29:37.780 --> 29:38.780
Yeah.

29:39.020 --> 29:40.780
But looking great doing it.

29:40.780 --> 29:41.780
Thank you.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.220
We've confirmed you're a high.

29:44.220 --> 29:48.820
I saw a homeless guy that looked like he'd today, on the way here.

29:48.820 --> 29:50.180
Was he also wearing a turtleneck?

29:50.180 --> 29:52.220
No, but he was dressed very well.

29:52.220 --> 29:55.660
I complimented Jeff's fashion when we walked in today.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.900
What makes you think that he was on house?

29:57.900 --> 29:59.900
Wow.

29:59.900 --> 30:00.900
I'm trying.

30:00.900 --> 30:01.900
I have to screen-share.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.900
I didn't do this last episode.

30:04.900 --> 30:10.580
I actually think I'd rather watch that than do this, so.

30:10.580 --> 30:14.940
Imagine being hungover, coming to work, saying I don't want to be here today, obviously.

30:14.940 --> 30:18.900
Getting bombarded by Jeff 10 minutes before, and then just watching him play with wires

30:18.900 --> 30:21.900
and trying to pick Echo, fixing Echo for the next two hours.

30:21.900 --> 30:23.900
Goblop the side.

30:23.900 --> 30:24.900
Oh, I remember.

30:24.900 --> 30:25.900
It's podcast.

30:25.900 --> 30:30.500
I won't let you stream shit for this podcast now.

30:30.500 --> 30:31.500
It was conduct.

30:31.500 --> 30:38.100
You don't usually see from a conductor.

30:38.100 --> 30:47.500
Tim Schultes took the New York-based Chelsea Symphony on a wild, slay ride.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.740
Tim is a teacher, not a conductor.

30:49.740 --> 30:53.340
He only got to leave the orchestra because he won a raffle.

30:53.340 --> 30:54.980
They was like a carlburned episode.

30:54.980 --> 30:57.420
I was like, how can I make them laugh?

30:57.420 --> 31:01.100
Maybe by wagging your butt while wearing a kilt?

31:01.100 --> 31:02.820
Tim was totally uninhibited.

31:02.820 --> 31:04.820
He was totally the music.

31:04.820 --> 31:09.260
Artistic director, Matthew Oben, was playing the French horn.

31:09.260 --> 31:13.820
I actually had a good way from him a lot, because he was making me laugh.

31:13.820 --> 31:16.100
Tim kept looking back at the audience.

31:16.100 --> 31:18.340
The musicians already knew the song.

31:18.340 --> 31:20.980
You think they weren't knowing you can play with it?

31:20.980 --> 31:21.980
She sounds mad about it.

31:21.980 --> 31:26.980
My favorite move of his was when he put the baton up in the air and kind of twirled

31:26.980 --> 31:31.300
it a lot around like a lasso.

31:31.300 --> 31:43.740
Instead of dignified drumming, Tim moved it up and looked at the orchestra.

31:43.740 --> 31:45.860
Tim was once a Broadway dancer.

31:45.860 --> 31:49.140
His conducting stint got ready for views.

31:49.140 --> 31:50.580
He slayed that.

31:50.580 --> 31:51.980
He killed that.

31:51.980 --> 31:55.460
That was what got me going, was that trombone in the back.

31:55.460 --> 31:56.460
He was going nuts.

31:56.460 --> 32:08.420
And when it was over, he did what all good conductors do, gave the orchestra their

32:08.420 --> 32:09.420
do.

32:09.420 --> 32:21.980
In this case, the music went to the Maestro's head, Kenny Moves, CNN, New York.

32:21.980 --> 32:33.220
Do you ever think that podcasting and news, they're all part of the same media legacy?

32:33.220 --> 32:39.380
And that woman going like, and then he did something, no, what do you expect it?

32:39.380 --> 32:45.700
That's like, you're all part of the same evolution of news.

32:45.700 --> 32:51.260
Do you ever see that and see what you're doing and go like, we're sisters of the same

32:51.260 --> 32:52.260
club?

32:52.260 --> 32:53.260
Do you ever think about it?

32:53.260 --> 32:56.620
What's happening right now is that everyone wants to be against me, but you're saying

32:56.620 --> 32:57.620
nonsense.

32:57.620 --> 33:02.900
And they're, them two are giving looks like we're about to be with you, just make a little

33:02.900 --> 33:03.900
bit of sense.

33:03.900 --> 33:04.900
Yeah.

33:04.900 --> 33:08.340
They, maybe if you were saying this, they would have hopped on and said like, that's

33:08.340 --> 33:09.340
how stupid.

33:09.340 --> 33:11.340
You're saying that podcasting is media.

33:11.340 --> 33:14.340
You're saying that podcasting is media.

33:14.340 --> 33:15.340
Yeah, yes.

33:15.340 --> 33:17.660
Podcasting is radio.

33:18.220 --> 33:24.660
And the news was on the radio before it was on TV and just watching that, like, that's

33:24.660 --> 33:25.660
news.

33:25.660 --> 33:32.820
There was a tint of everything was on the radio before it was on TV.

33:32.820 --> 33:34.180
My question is, why did we watch that?

33:34.180 --> 33:39.700
I was just, no context to give it.

33:39.700 --> 33:40.700
I was so excited.

33:40.700 --> 33:41.980
We took a break.

33:41.980 --> 33:43.340
We took a break to go to that.

33:43.340 --> 33:46.100
I thought you were going to get a kick out of it to be honest with you.

33:46.100 --> 33:50.780
And that was going to make a joke about what have he had done in the gritty.

33:50.780 --> 33:51.780
We have to move on.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.780
Bad joke.

33:53.780 --> 33:55.780
Shit.

33:55.780 --> 33:56.780
Shit.

33:56.780 --> 34:06.820
All right, you know what, let's just do this one, and it was the wrong piece song.

34:06.820 --> 34:11.100
Your shits were coming at the exact out and beat where they should have the song.

34:11.340 --> 34:17.420
Dude, dude, dude, dude, shit, dude, dude.

34:17.420 --> 34:21.420
Welcome to Master Chef Dairy Edition.

34:21.420 --> 34:24.660
Maria, can you have Joel bring the ingredients?

34:24.660 --> 34:28.060
I, I'll slack him.

34:28.060 --> 34:34.420
And I'll be right back, talk amongst yourselves, but don't be too gossipy.

34:34.420 --> 34:36.580
Where do you have to go?

34:36.580 --> 34:37.580
He has to go to the fridge.

34:37.740 --> 34:43.020
He doesn't have somebody to slack.

34:43.020 --> 34:44.460
So how's it going for you?

34:44.460 --> 34:45.620
We've both done this podcast.

34:45.620 --> 34:47.140
Our expectations are met.

34:47.140 --> 34:48.300
How's it going for you, so far?

34:48.300 --> 34:50.300
I'm still thoroughly confused.

34:50.300 --> 34:51.300
Yeah.

34:51.300 --> 34:53.100
Did you have any expectations going in?

34:53.100 --> 34:54.100
No.

34:54.100 --> 34:55.300
I like to go unblind.

34:55.300 --> 34:56.300
Okay.

34:56.300 --> 34:59.100
Did you think you would have questions to learn more about you?

34:59.100 --> 35:03.620
I think the initial idea of this podcast was to get to know the staff of head gum and get

35:03.620 --> 35:07.100
to know everybody, were you hoping to share things about yourself or are you

35:07.100 --> 35:08.100
so long for the ride?

35:08.100 --> 35:09.100
I'm just long for the ride.

35:09.100 --> 35:10.100
Respect.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.100
Yeah.

35:11.100 --> 35:14.700
Do you feel that this informs your job more?

35:14.700 --> 35:19.300
Do you think that you are going to try to find some counterpoint creators to whatever

35:19.300 --> 35:20.300
this is?

35:20.300 --> 35:21.300
Like, shows less like this?

35:21.300 --> 35:22.300
Yeah.

35:22.300 --> 35:23.300
Yeah.

35:23.300 --> 35:24.300
Wow.

35:24.300 --> 35:26.300
That's a blow.

35:26.300 --> 35:27.300
All right.

35:27.300 --> 35:34.380
Welcome to Master Chef Dairy Edition.

35:34.380 --> 35:38.620
I have in front of me three glasses.

35:38.620 --> 35:44.540
Oh, that's not going to so well.

35:44.540 --> 35:48.100
Eggnog, cottage cheese, and whipped cream.

35:48.100 --> 35:49.900
Is this showing up on camera at all?

35:49.900 --> 35:50.900
Yeah.

35:50.900 --> 35:51.900
Ice cream.

35:51.900 --> 35:56.300
Looks like coffee creamer.

35:56.300 --> 35:57.300
Okay.

35:57.300 --> 35:58.300
Butter.

35:58.300 --> 36:03.140
Did you have me tell Joel to put ice cream in the fridge?

36:03.140 --> 36:09.460
Did you get your shit?

36:09.460 --> 36:11.980
Sage is bringing it, and I don't know where Joel went.

36:11.980 --> 36:12.980
All right.

36:12.980 --> 36:15.460
Well, let's see what Marieka has.

36:15.460 --> 36:17.740
Was that ice cream in the fridge?

36:17.740 --> 36:18.740
Yep.

36:18.740 --> 36:22.500
So if we're playing the prices right, what are we thinking that's all adds up to?

36:22.500 --> 36:24.460
Chef spent money on this bit.

36:24.460 --> 36:27.060
This bit cost Jeff playing the prices right.

36:27.060 --> 36:30.780
Would you say over under he spent $40 on the other side?

36:30.780 --> 36:33.100
I've got to remember to double it because he did it for Marieka.

36:33.140 --> 36:34.100
Right.

36:34.100 --> 36:35.100
Okay.

36:35.100 --> 36:37.460
But for our table at least, over under $44.

36:37.460 --> 36:39.700
This is my bag is from a ride aid.

36:39.700 --> 36:43.260
So if that's what you have in your bag, Marieka.

36:43.260 --> 36:44.860
I say it could be over $40.

36:44.860 --> 36:45.860
Carried gold butter.

36:45.860 --> 36:46.860
Yeah.

36:46.860 --> 36:47.860
It's like six or seven dollars.

36:47.860 --> 36:48.860
Yep.

36:48.860 --> 36:52.820
So probably looking at something around $100 for this bit.

36:52.820 --> 36:53.820
Yeah.

36:53.820 --> 36:54.820
Real dollars.

36:54.820 --> 36:58.940
I have a gallon of 2% reduced fat milk.

36:58.940 --> 37:00.660
It's called seven dollars.

37:00.660 --> 37:01.660
Let's show it.

37:01.660 --> 37:02.660
Yep.

37:02.660 --> 37:03.660
I'm guessing that at our table.

37:03.660 --> 37:04.660
Okay.

37:04.660 --> 37:08.980
We've got a hole and it's just a court, but that'll have to do.

37:08.980 --> 37:09.980
So good.

37:09.980 --> 37:17.100
Golden egg nong, ultra-pasturized, ultra-pasturized, ultra egg nong is also ultra-pasturized.

37:17.100 --> 37:18.300
I read that as well.

37:18.300 --> 37:20.340
But ours is from a bourbon company.

37:20.340 --> 37:21.340
Yeah.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.340
Yeah.

37:22.340 --> 37:23.340
You don't.

37:23.340 --> 37:24.340
I was furious if that's alcoholic egg nong.

37:24.340 --> 37:29.220
You don't see a lot of overlap with like grain alcohol and dairy.

37:29.220 --> 37:30.700
Marieka?

37:30.700 --> 37:31.700
Great commentary.

37:31.740 --> 37:32.700
Philadelphia.

37:32.700 --> 37:33.700
Yeah.

37:33.700 --> 37:34.700
Pretty cheap.

37:34.700 --> 37:35.700
Mm-hmm.

37:35.700 --> 37:40.220
Floating around $20.

37:40.220 --> 37:45.460
Easy cheese, cheddar.

37:45.460 --> 37:47.700
Do we have $15 worth of dairy?

37:47.700 --> 37:49.700
That's the question.

37:49.700 --> 38:00.700
A and eight ounce, a carton of triple-churned extra creamy sour cream.

38:00.700 --> 38:04.980
Okay.

38:04.980 --> 38:07.700
I'm unnervingly slow.

38:07.700 --> 38:11.300
The answer is of mozzarella, Sargento.

38:11.300 --> 38:12.300
I knew that was Sargento.

38:12.300 --> 38:14.300
I knew it was Sargento from the back.

38:14.300 --> 38:22.340
And perhaps the most perplexing of all, one single baby belt.

38:22.340 --> 38:25.700
The name of the game is Master Chef Dairy Edition.

38:25.700 --> 38:28.700
You guys all have a jar in front of you.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.700
Casey and I are going to be the judges.

38:30.700 --> 38:31.700
Okay.

38:31.700 --> 38:35.700
Well, then you need, you also need a jar.

38:35.700 --> 38:38.700
We're saved.

38:38.700 --> 38:40.700
And I have to get her back.

38:40.700 --> 38:42.700
We don't have jars.

38:42.700 --> 38:43.700
Do you have a glass?

38:43.700 --> 38:45.700
Tell me what to do and I'll go.

38:45.700 --> 38:46.700
You need a glass.

38:46.700 --> 38:49.700
You need a glass and I need Joel back in the room because in New York, Joel is going

38:49.700 --> 38:50.700
to be the judge.

38:50.700 --> 38:52.700
In here, it's going to be a BKC.

38:52.700 --> 38:57.700
Why do I have the feeling that this podcast is going to be evidence in a cake?

38:57.700 --> 39:00.700
I die when do something awful.

39:00.700 --> 39:03.700
I haven't even gotten to explain what the game is.

39:03.700 --> 39:08.700
Master Chef is a cooking show where people try to create food and shit.

39:08.700 --> 39:09.700
This is Master Chef Dairy Edition.

39:09.700 --> 39:12.700
You guys all have an empty jar or a glass in front of you.

39:12.700 --> 39:18.700
You're going to with these ingredients, one by one, create a dairy concoction.

39:18.700 --> 39:26.700
And Casey and I will be the judge on who creates truly like the best tasting thing.

39:26.700 --> 39:30.700
But you have to use all the ingredients.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.700
So it's really just ratio.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.700
You have to use all of the ingredients.

39:34.700 --> 39:35.700
Yes.

39:35.700 --> 39:36.700
Okay.

39:36.700 --> 39:37.700
How are you going to taste it?

39:37.700 --> 39:39.700
Are you scooping down to the bottom?

39:39.700 --> 39:42.700
Uh, how are you going to get everything in one bite?

39:42.700 --> 39:44.700
You can help me decide how I do that.

39:44.700 --> 39:45.700
Okay.

39:45.700 --> 39:50.700
Can I leave the room to actually do things?

39:50.700 --> 39:52.700
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

39:52.700 --> 39:53.700
Okay.

39:53.700 --> 39:55.700
I won't have a microphone with me.

39:55.700 --> 39:56.700
Okay.

39:56.700 --> 39:57.700
That's fine.

39:57.700 --> 39:58.700
We'll just need the finished product.

39:58.700 --> 39:59.700
Okay.

39:59.700 --> 40:03.700
So Billy, Billy line the rim of his jar with butter.

40:03.700 --> 40:04.700
I saw that.

40:04.700 --> 40:05.700
Did it in the ice cream.

40:05.700 --> 40:06.700
Okay.

40:06.700 --> 40:08.700
So that's already so much dairy.

40:08.700 --> 40:13.060
We've got Corey starting things off with like, I would say a half cup of egg

40:13.060 --> 40:14.060
nog.

40:14.060 --> 40:15.700
He's going to cut it with some whole milk.

40:15.700 --> 40:20.700
I saw them all handling the butter bear handed.

40:20.700 --> 40:23.700
I broke this stick of butter in half.

40:23.700 --> 40:27.700
It looks like I've done so much shit to this studio.

40:27.700 --> 40:32.700
We've got Alex being patient slash maybe boy cutting the game.

40:32.700 --> 40:33.700
Oh, thanks.

40:33.700 --> 40:34.700
I got a new job.

40:34.700 --> 40:35.700
What happened to the first one?

40:35.700 --> 40:36.700
I don't know.

40:36.700 --> 40:37.700
I accidentally used to.

40:37.700 --> 40:38.700
Ascle.

40:38.700 --> 40:42.700
Alex is now the perfect time to tell you that you're pretty much

40:42.700 --> 40:44.700
exact doppelganger for my therapist.

40:44.700 --> 40:45.700
Really?

40:45.700 --> 40:46.700
Yeah.

40:46.700 --> 40:47.700
How is that?

40:47.700 --> 40:49.700
How is that for you, mentally?

40:49.700 --> 40:50.700
Me or Alex?

40:50.700 --> 40:51.700
How does that make you feel?

40:51.700 --> 40:52.700
For your use.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.700
It makes me feel like I can share a lot with you.

40:54.700 --> 40:55.700
That I put the egg nog as a spoon.

40:55.700 --> 40:58.700
I'm using the cap for the egg nog as a spoon for the ice cream.

40:58.700 --> 40:59.700
Okay.

40:59.700 --> 41:01.700
We've got Billy feeling the jar with mostly whipped cream.

41:01.700 --> 41:02.700
I think this is a good start.

41:02.700 --> 41:05.700
I would say that Billy is looking the most

41:05.700 --> 41:07.700
electable to me thus far.

41:07.700 --> 41:09.700
I've spilled champagne in the studio.

41:09.700 --> 41:10.700
Coffee.

41:10.700 --> 41:11.700
I think.

41:11.700 --> 41:12.700
That fruit.

41:12.700 --> 41:15.700
I was on the hundredth episode when you were stupid.

41:15.700 --> 41:16.700
That's one of my favorite.

41:16.700 --> 41:17.700
Watch out.

41:17.700 --> 41:18.700
Okay.

41:18.700 --> 41:21.700
Alex has ice cream and egg nog.

41:21.700 --> 41:23.700
That's she just pulled ahead in my eyes.

41:23.700 --> 41:26.700
The butter I think is unsalted to be fair.

41:26.700 --> 41:29.700
They all have ice cream and egg nog.

41:29.700 --> 41:30.700
Yeah.

41:30.700 --> 41:31.700
Wait.

41:31.700 --> 41:32.700
You said that we have to use everything.

41:32.700 --> 41:33.700
Yeah.

41:33.700 --> 41:34.700
It's about ratio.

41:34.700 --> 41:41.700
And then the white lotus theme song inexplicably playing under all of this.

41:41.700 --> 41:45.700
What's is that coffee creamer in the white?

41:45.700 --> 41:48.700
Oh.

41:48.700 --> 41:51.700
Oh.

41:51.700 --> 41:54.700
Cory sort of shaking.

41:54.700 --> 41:55.700
Oh.

41:55.700 --> 41:57.700
There it is.

41:57.700 --> 41:59.700
And that's raw denim too.

41:59.700 --> 42:00.700
That ain't no rental.

42:00.700 --> 42:03.700
Alex made a tower of whipped cream.

42:03.700 --> 42:04.700
Oh.

42:04.700 --> 42:06.700
Cleaning tower of cream.

42:06.700 --> 42:09.700
And it's going down.

42:09.700 --> 42:10.700
And there it goes.

42:10.700 --> 42:11.700
The tower.

42:11.700 --> 42:12.700
Done.

42:12.700 --> 42:13.700
Chef.

42:13.700 --> 42:14.700
Done.

42:14.700 --> 42:15.700
Thank you.

42:15.700 --> 42:16.700
Chef.

42:16.700 --> 42:17.700
Can I try it?

42:17.700 --> 42:18.700
You want to try it?

42:18.700 --> 42:20.700
I want to try it before I make other people try it.

42:20.700 --> 42:21.700
Yeah.

42:21.700 --> 42:31.700
I mean, you're free to taste test before you want to lock the mark of a true chef.

42:31.700 --> 42:32.700
It's a lot of way.

42:32.700 --> 42:33.700
Yeah.

42:33.700 --> 42:34.700
All right.

42:34.700 --> 42:35.700
So what went into this?

42:35.700 --> 42:39.700
Can you explain the ratios that you used?

42:39.700 --> 42:43.700
The minimum amount of cottage cheese.

42:43.700 --> 42:46.700
I put the minimum amount of butter just a little bit of both.

42:46.700 --> 42:47.700
Yeah.

42:47.700 --> 42:49.700
Then I hit it with some egg nog.

42:49.700 --> 42:50.700
Yeah.

42:50.700 --> 42:51.700
Some whole milk.

42:51.700 --> 42:52.700
Some nature bliss.

42:52.700 --> 42:53.700
Coffee mate.

42:53.700 --> 42:54.700
Yeah.

42:54.700 --> 43:01.700
And then I used the cap from the egg nog as a spoon for the ice cream.

43:01.700 --> 43:05.700
And then I used the cap of the cottage cheese to cover and shake up the whole.

43:05.700 --> 43:08.700
That sounds like you put a lot of time and energy in thought.

43:08.700 --> 43:09.700
Yeah.

43:14.700 --> 43:15.700
Yeah.

43:15.700 --> 43:18.700
I mean, it really just tastes like an egg nog milk shake.

43:18.700 --> 43:19.700
Yeah.

43:19.700 --> 43:20.700
Okay.

43:20.700 --> 43:22.700
So you want to dip your mustache in this too?

43:22.700 --> 43:23.700
Let's do it.

43:23.700 --> 43:25.700
There's been two mustachees dipped into it.

43:25.700 --> 43:26.700
No.

43:26.700 --> 43:27.700
Actually, you know what?

43:27.700 --> 43:28.700
I'm getting a little bit of the coffee cream.

43:28.700 --> 43:30.700
I'm getting a little bit of the milk.

43:30.700 --> 43:31.700
This is disgusting.

43:31.700 --> 43:32.700
Now I'm messy.

43:32.700 --> 43:33.700
Oh, great.

43:33.700 --> 43:34.700
Well done.

43:34.700 --> 43:38.700
What am I doing taking this seriously?

43:38.700 --> 43:40.700
Honestly.

43:40.700 --> 43:42.700
Oh, that's nice.

43:42.700 --> 43:43.700
What you just did.

43:43.700 --> 43:44.700
Oh, yeah.

43:44.700 --> 43:46.700
I mean, yeah.

43:46.700 --> 43:48.700
One of them has dreams.

43:48.700 --> 43:50.700
One of them's bound to be better, though.

43:50.700 --> 43:52.700
I will give Cory's.

43:52.700 --> 43:53.700
I'm going to adjust them.

43:53.700 --> 43:54.700
There's going to be a curve.

43:54.700 --> 43:56.700
But I'm going to give yours a nine out of ten.

43:56.700 --> 43:57.700
Wow.

43:57.700 --> 43:58.700
Yeah.

43:58.700 --> 43:59.700
Right now we're starting it at the nine.

43:59.700 --> 44:00.700
Yeah.

44:00.700 --> 44:01.700
There's definitely.

44:01.700 --> 44:04.700
I feel like there's something that could be better about it.

44:04.700 --> 44:05.700
Alex.

44:05.700 --> 44:06.700
So you ready to present yours?

44:06.700 --> 44:07.700
I'm ready.

44:07.700 --> 44:08.700
Okay.

44:09.700 --> 44:10.700
Can I come through this?

44:10.700 --> 44:12.700
I'll say I'm intimidated by Alex.

44:12.700 --> 44:14.700
Especially the finishing touch.

44:14.700 --> 44:15.700
Yeah.

44:15.700 --> 44:17.700
We have no idea what Marie has been doing.

44:17.700 --> 44:18.700
Well.

44:18.700 --> 44:21.700
I don't think she has jar yet.

44:21.700 --> 44:24.700
I just want to mention how stressful it is to see all these open

44:24.700 --> 44:26.700
dairies next year open computer.

44:26.700 --> 44:28.700
Open dairies.

44:28.700 --> 44:29.700
Open dairies.

44:29.700 --> 44:30.700
Yeah.

44:30.700 --> 44:31.700
We're in open dairies.

44:31.700 --> 44:33.700
What's the.

44:33.700 --> 44:35.700
It's a, it's a concealed dairy.

44:35.700 --> 44:36.700
All right.

44:36.700 --> 44:38.700
Alex, walk us through what you've done here.

44:38.700 --> 44:39.700
Yeah.

44:39.700 --> 44:40.700
Yeah.

44:40.700 --> 44:42.700
There's a lot of separation in this one.

44:42.700 --> 44:44.700
There's layers to this texture.

44:44.700 --> 44:45.700
Yes.

44:45.700 --> 44:48.700
So I started with a big scoop of ice cream.

44:48.700 --> 44:49.700
Yeah.

44:49.700 --> 44:51.700
Because that obviously will taste the best.

44:51.700 --> 44:53.700
Poured some eggnog.

44:53.700 --> 44:56.700
A little bit of the milk and creamer.

44:56.700 --> 45:00.700
I did a leaning tower of whipped cream.

45:00.700 --> 45:01.700
Yeah.

45:01.700 --> 45:05.700
Just assuming that most of it would taste like whipped cream.

45:05.700 --> 45:08.700
And finished with a drizzle of eggnog.

45:08.700 --> 45:09.700
On top.

45:09.700 --> 45:11.700
That sound.

45:11.700 --> 45:12.700
That sound.

45:12.700 --> 45:13.700
That sound.

45:13.700 --> 45:14.700
Oh.

45:14.700 --> 45:15.700
Oh.

45:15.700 --> 45:19.700
It has a, honestly, very distinctly different smell of

45:19.700 --> 45:20.700
an eggnog.

45:20.700 --> 45:22.700
There's was heavier on the eggnog.

45:22.700 --> 45:24.700
Like eggnog.

45:24.700 --> 45:30.700
That was a big go.

45:30.700 --> 45:33.700
That good.

45:34.700 --> 45:38.700
Alex, I got to say, there's a dairy intolerant person having

45:38.700 --> 45:39.700
diarrhea on your back.

45:39.700 --> 45:41.700
That's something to the spot.

45:41.700 --> 45:42.700
That's right.

45:42.700 --> 45:45.700
I, I had high expectations for this.

45:45.700 --> 45:48.700
It tastes the most like.

45:48.700 --> 45:51.700
Yours really tasted like an eggnog milk shake that you could order

45:51.700 --> 45:52.700
to bar.

45:52.700 --> 45:53.700
Yeah.

45:53.700 --> 45:54.700
Or like a burger place.

45:54.700 --> 45:57.700
This really tastes like a concoction of what these things are.

45:57.700 --> 45:58.700
Yeah.

45:58.700 --> 46:02.700
Jeffrey, for those just listening and not watching, it has a very cute little

46:02.700 --> 46:03.700
dog.

46:03.700 --> 46:09.700
Dot of whipped cream on the tip of his nose.

46:09.700 --> 46:11.700
You're giving me Gordon Ramsay vibes right now.

46:11.700 --> 46:12.700
Because I'm angry.

46:12.700 --> 46:13.700
Yeah.

46:13.700 --> 46:14.700
Yeah.

46:14.700 --> 46:15.700
I'm actually angry.

46:15.700 --> 46:16.700
Because I'm angry.

46:16.700 --> 46:17.700
I'm angry.

46:17.700 --> 46:18.700
I'm angry.

46:18.700 --> 46:19.700
I'm angry.

46:19.700 --> 46:20.700
I'm angry.

46:20.700 --> 46:21.700
I'm angry.

46:21.700 --> 46:22.700
Yeah.

46:22.700 --> 46:23.700
Yeah.

46:23.700 --> 46:24.700
I'm angry.

46:24.700 --> 46:25.700
Yeah.

46:25.700 --> 46:26.700
Yeah.

46:26.700 --> 46:27.700
Yeah.

46:27.700 --> 46:28.700
Yeah.

46:28.700 --> 46:29.700
Yeah.

46:29.700 --> 46:30.700
Yeah.

46:30.700 --> 46:31.700
Yeah.

46:31.700 --> 46:32.700
What did you give Cor arts?

46:32.700 --> 46:33.700
A nine?

46:33.700 --> 46:34.700
I gave it a nine.

46:34.700 --> 46:35.700
I'm gonna give Alex is a six.

46:35.700 --> 46:36.700
Ooh.

46:36.700 --> 46:37.700
Damn.

46:37.700 --> 46:38.700
What's that down nine?

46:38.700 --> 46:41.700
Did you say damn or ham I said ham upside down nine?

46:41.700 --> 46:42.700
Sure.

46:42.700 --> 46:43.700
Yep.

46:43.700 --> 46:47.700
I'm gonna give Alex 7, 7, 5, 7, 5.

46:47.700 --> 46:48.700
I'm sorry.

46:48.700 --> 46:49.700
Remember the bullet?

46:49.700 --> 46:50.700
I remember the bullet.

46:50.700 --> 46:51.700
I remember the bullet.

46:51.700 --> 46:52.700
What the?

46:52.700 --> 46:53.700
I don't know.

46:53.700 --> 46:54.700
I can't remember the bullet.

46:54.700 --> 46:55.700
It's cheating.

46:55.700 --> 46:56.700
You can butter it.

46:56.700 --> 46:58.700
But I thought you looked really handsome without the bullet tie.

46:58.700 --> 47:00.700
I think just in general, you're really handsome.

47:00.700 --> 47:03.340
So he's trying to bank points and it's working.

47:03.340 --> 47:05.100
You butter up when you play the dairy game.

47:05.100 --> 47:08.380
Nice, I like the course a little bit better

47:08.380 --> 47:13.380
because Alex, it was a bit too thick.

47:13.380 --> 47:15.140
And it was pretty thin.

47:15.140 --> 47:15.980
All right.

47:15.980 --> 47:16.540
And a great speaking voice.

47:16.540 --> 47:17.980
You just have a great speaking voice.

47:17.980 --> 47:19.700
Thank you so much.

47:19.700 --> 47:22.260
Really, walk us through this dairy.

47:22.260 --> 47:26.900
It's your classic butter rimmed three layered

47:26.900 --> 47:30.260
whipped cream ice cream situation.

47:30.260 --> 47:32.660
I tried to ease off of the cottage cheese.

47:32.660 --> 47:34.220
It doesn't really seem like there's a place for that

47:34.220 --> 47:34.820
in this drink.

47:34.820 --> 47:39.900
So what I did was I rimmed my mixing jar with cottage cheese

47:39.900 --> 47:40.700
on the inside.

47:40.700 --> 47:42.700
So she's going to be hints of cottage cheese in there.

47:42.700 --> 47:47.140
But ultimately, this is kind of like a postwork out meal.

47:47.140 --> 47:49.780
You know, two in the morning, come home drunk.

47:49.780 --> 47:51.500
You don't really have ingredients for something.

47:51.500 --> 47:55.140
You make a butter rimmed dairy drink.

47:55.140 --> 47:57.140
I will say this smells the best of the three.

47:57.140 --> 47:57.980
Wow.

47:57.980 --> 47:58.460
Thank you.

47:58.460 --> 47:59.460
Here we go.

48:00.260 --> 48:06.500
Chef.

48:06.500 --> 48:07.500
Chef.

48:07.500 --> 48:08.500
Chef.

48:08.500 --> 48:09.500
Sorry.

48:09.500 --> 48:13.180
Second sip and ever heards.

48:13.180 --> 48:17.180
And if you've any notes tasting notes or notes on your performance,

48:17.180 --> 48:18.020
either is great.

48:18.020 --> 48:19.620
Well, it's already vanilla.

48:19.620 --> 48:20.620
Yes.

48:20.620 --> 48:21.620
That's what we were going for.

48:21.620 --> 48:22.620
Yeah.

48:22.620 --> 48:23.620
The room is a nice touch.

48:23.620 --> 48:24.620
Yeah.

48:24.620 --> 48:26.620
And you have a great speaking voice.

48:26.620 --> 48:27.620
Yeah.

48:28.220 --> 48:32.020
Let me try quarters again.

48:32.020 --> 48:35.340
Oh, I like Billy's.

48:35.340 --> 48:37.460
I was I was saying off Mike.

48:37.460 --> 48:39.820
I liked the work he did around the rim.

48:39.820 --> 48:40.500
Thank you, Chef.

48:40.500 --> 48:44.700
It really came through while drinking all of the cream.

48:44.700 --> 48:46.260
Thank you, Chef.

48:46.260 --> 48:47.420
Yeah.

48:47.420 --> 48:48.740
It was light.

48:48.740 --> 48:49.540
It was nice.

48:49.540 --> 48:50.660
Thank you.

48:50.660 --> 48:51.540
Refreshing.

48:51.540 --> 48:52.060
Yeah.

48:52.060 --> 48:53.660
I got to give him a 9.5.

48:53.660 --> 48:54.260
Wow.

48:54.260 --> 48:55.260
Thank you, Chef.

48:55.260 --> 48:55.780
Thank you, Chef.

48:55.780 --> 48:57.300
I'm going to give him a 9.

48:58.180 --> 48:59.860
Point.

48:59.860 --> 49:01.660
Just 9.

49:01.660 --> 49:02.660
Uh.

49:02.660 --> 49:03.660
Yeah.

49:05.660 --> 49:09.420
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

49:09.420 --> 49:10.300
You agree?

49:10.300 --> 49:15.940
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

49:15.940 --> 49:19.380
I liked it as much holistically as quarries.

49:19.380 --> 49:22.580
I will say that the taste of quarries, I think, is better.

49:22.580 --> 49:24.780
The texture of Billy's is better.

49:24.780 --> 49:26.660
The texture of quarries is worse.

49:26.700 --> 49:29.660
The smell of Billy's is really good.

49:29.660 --> 49:31.220
The taste doesn't live up to the smell.

49:31.220 --> 49:34.020
quarries smells like it tastes.

49:34.020 --> 49:36.500
You know what, I might need to bump it up to a 9.5.

49:36.500 --> 49:39.700
Mike, it might need to be a 9.5.

49:39.700 --> 49:40.380
Thank you, Chef.

49:40.380 --> 49:41.220
Bye.

49:41.220 --> 49:45.780
The point five we've seen in the rim work, really.

49:45.780 --> 49:50.780
What's like the rim work was, uh, thank you.

49:50.780 --> 49:53.420
How many times do you say rim work?

49:53.420 --> 49:54.420
Yeah.

49:54.420 --> 49:56.020
The rim job you did was amazing.

49:56.100 --> 49:57.260
Thank you.

49:57.260 --> 50:01.820
So I just, I just feel like I deserve a moment to say something right now.

50:01.820 --> 50:02.660
Yeah.

50:02.660 --> 50:06.220
I really felt like I was just the out in the head winner coming out with nine

50:06.220 --> 50:07.500
than you in the six.

50:07.500 --> 50:11.020
At first, you know, I was going to walk away thinking that I had one.

50:11.020 --> 50:14.820
I would have said, I really admired your rim work.

50:14.820 --> 50:21.500
But now because I'm a sore loser, I will say that I was going to do that.

50:21.500 --> 50:22.500
And then you did it.

50:22.500 --> 50:25.700
And I'm like, well, I'm not going to copy you.

50:26.260 --> 50:29.260
I just want everyone to know that I thought of that, too.

50:29.260 --> 50:29.580
Okay.

50:29.580 --> 50:30.660
Daddy, chill.

50:30.660 --> 50:32.100
Daddy, chill.

50:32.100 --> 50:33.540
Was that, did somebody say that?

50:33.540 --> 50:35.300
Or did you do that?

50:35.300 --> 50:37.380
Mureka, we've got Joel in the studio.

50:37.380 --> 50:38.940
Joel looks anemic.

50:38.940 --> 50:41.100
Let's talk about it.

50:41.100 --> 50:42.180
You look anemic.

50:42.180 --> 50:43.540
That's what white people look like.

50:43.540 --> 50:44.540
Yeah, okay.

50:44.540 --> 50:46.020
So today.

50:46.020 --> 50:49.020
He looks like he needs to go to the hospital.

50:49.020 --> 50:50.060
Some general would be good for him.

50:50.060 --> 50:50.420
All right.

50:50.420 --> 50:52.100
Today with my ingredients, I prepared

50:52.660 --> 50:57.980
a nice glass of agnog talked with Vietnamese cinnamon,

50:57.980 --> 51:00.460
which you can't really see.

51:00.460 --> 51:02.140
Is that the church is getting?

51:02.140 --> 51:04.420
Is that all you did in an ingredient?

51:04.420 --> 51:05.420
No.

51:05.420 --> 51:07.020
You have to use all the ingredients.

51:07.020 --> 51:08.820
I'm not, I'm not done.

51:08.820 --> 51:10.380
I made him a full meal.

51:10.380 --> 51:11.780
Where is the cheese wheel?

51:11.780 --> 51:13.860
Where is the cheese wheel, Marika?

51:13.860 --> 51:17.020
We know you got a baby bell in there somewhere.

51:17.020 --> 51:19.580
Cheese dip.

51:19.580 --> 51:20.580
Okay.

51:20.580 --> 51:28.740
So dip with a mostly crispy cheese cracker in the side.

51:28.740 --> 51:32.300
What the hell?

51:32.300 --> 51:34.140
So Joel, if you want to taste.

51:34.140 --> 51:37.740
Hey, it's Sarah's an egg nog.

51:37.740 --> 51:38.740
Cheers.

51:38.740 --> 51:39.740
To everyone.

51:39.740 --> 51:45.500
I don't know what to give him anything on that.

51:45.500 --> 51:46.500
This is good.

51:46.500 --> 51:47.500
Good egg nog.

51:47.500 --> 51:48.500
Great.

51:48.540 --> 51:52.740
I think you should go higher for sure.

51:52.740 --> 51:55.500
It's going to be tough to beat a nine-five.

51:55.500 --> 51:56.500
Okay.

51:56.500 --> 52:00.980
I feel a lot less confident about this, especially having

52:00.980 --> 52:04.220
watch Marika make it.

52:04.220 --> 52:07.420
Marika, did you want microwave cheese in a bowl?

52:07.420 --> 52:08.420
With the milk.

52:08.420 --> 52:12.100
And two different types of cheeses, but it's hard to make a case

52:12.100 --> 52:13.100
with mozzarella.

52:13.100 --> 52:15.100
It's very stringy, obviously.

52:15.100 --> 52:16.100
Yeah.

52:16.100 --> 52:17.100
Of course.

52:17.100 --> 52:18.100
Of course.

52:18.500 --> 52:21.460
Doesn't look how you would want it, too.

52:21.460 --> 52:23.260
And love that.

52:23.260 --> 52:24.260
Is it you want it?

52:24.260 --> 52:27.420
Love how you would want it, too.

52:27.420 --> 52:29.140
I mean, it's not bad.

52:29.140 --> 52:33.180
That's like a five point eight out of ten.

52:33.180 --> 52:34.180
Damn.

52:34.180 --> 52:36.940
If I didn't see how it was made, it would probably be closer to a seven.

52:36.940 --> 52:38.180
I mean, you got to go higher.

52:38.180 --> 52:39.580
If you were getting nine.

52:39.580 --> 52:41.420
I should make butter on the outside of a jar.

52:41.420 --> 52:42.020
Are you not a nine?

52:42.020 --> 52:43.020
Something.

52:43.020 --> 52:44.020
Yeah.

52:44.020 --> 52:45.580
That's lower than my score.

52:45.580 --> 52:48.420
But you know, that's what I want down some egg nods.

52:48.420 --> 52:50.500
Like, I'm not such a good score.

52:50.500 --> 52:52.300
Marika, you're far and away the loser.

52:52.300 --> 52:53.500
So I have high standards.

52:53.500 --> 52:55.340
I'm literally a loser.

52:55.340 --> 52:57.380
OK, well, here's the last caveat.

52:57.380 --> 53:00.180
By the way, this is a gourmet meal.

53:00.180 --> 53:03.060
OK, here's the part of this that we didn't really

53:03.060 --> 53:03.700
use good.

53:03.700 --> 53:04.740
Egg nodgle up to a nine.

53:04.740 --> 53:05.340
Excuse me, Joe.

53:05.340 --> 53:06.300
Actually, excuse me.

53:06.300 --> 53:08.340
Make it.

53:08.340 --> 53:09.740
Joel, do you want to get a game?

53:09.740 --> 53:11.340
Joel, can't hear you.

53:11.340 --> 53:12.340
Oh, OK.

53:12.340 --> 53:15.020
Marika, really, really this to Joel.

53:15.060 --> 53:17.220
Joel also has to give scores on the ones here.

53:17.220 --> 53:19.260
And Casey and I have to give scores on yours.

53:19.260 --> 53:23.180
So Joel, this is just visually and texture wise.

53:23.180 --> 53:27.260
You have to give a score to theirs as well.

53:27.260 --> 53:29.660
Visually and texture wise.

53:29.660 --> 53:31.900
That's egg nod, Jeff.

53:31.900 --> 53:34.140
I'm not sure what it is.

53:34.140 --> 53:35.100
OK.

53:35.100 --> 53:37.900
Hi, buddy.

53:37.900 --> 53:41.100
What are you getting, Corey?

53:41.100 --> 53:42.780
What are you giving that one?

53:42.780 --> 53:44.620
Jeffs, I'll give.

53:44.700 --> 53:45.660
No, it's mine.

53:45.660 --> 53:46.700
It's Corey's.

53:46.700 --> 53:47.980
Make sure you know it's going to.

53:47.980 --> 53:50.460
Jeff, treat it like it's Jeff's.

53:50.460 --> 53:51.660
That's right.

53:51.660 --> 53:52.660
Can you hear me?

53:52.660 --> 53:53.620
Does he know that he can hear me?

53:53.620 --> 53:56.420
He's not mine because I mean, he's giving me a score.

53:56.420 --> 53:58.020
He's giving me a score because he thinks it's mine.

53:58.020 --> 53:58.860
Here, you hold it.

53:58.860 --> 53:59.860
No, I'm going to hold it.

53:59.860 --> 54:00.580
It was Corey's.

54:00.580 --> 54:00.860
OK.

54:00.860 --> 54:01.860
I told him it was Corey.

54:01.860 --> 54:04.220
Any, maybe he can't hear me?

54:04.220 --> 54:04.580
OK.

54:04.580 --> 54:06.860
No, he can't hear you.

54:06.860 --> 54:08.140
OK, great.

54:08.140 --> 54:09.580
When you're listening to this later, if you

54:09.580 --> 54:11.180
fuck me on this, I will find you.

54:12.140 --> 54:14.220
He doesn't know what to do.

54:14.220 --> 54:14.940
You said that.

54:14.940 --> 54:15.820
Alex is.

54:15.820 --> 54:18.620
Just keep in mind that before I know he can't hear me.

54:18.620 --> 54:19.620
They're eight.

54:19.620 --> 54:21.020
Oh, why is he Alex's?

54:21.020 --> 54:23.820
I'm twice as good as Corey's.

54:23.820 --> 54:24.460
That's true.

54:24.460 --> 54:25.420
Good as Corey's.

54:25.420 --> 54:26.700
OK, and then he'll hear you.

54:26.700 --> 54:27.900
Thanks, Joel.

54:27.900 --> 54:29.420
And then the final.

54:29.420 --> 54:31.500
Let me find the best angle.

54:31.500 --> 54:33.740
He's finding the best angle.

54:33.740 --> 54:34.540
No.

54:34.540 --> 54:36.140
What?

54:36.140 --> 54:36.940
Yeah.

54:36.940 --> 54:38.140
He's a mute.

54:38.140 --> 54:39.900
What?

54:39.980 --> 54:43.340
That looks like a, that looks like a freaking 10 to me.

54:43.340 --> 54:44.140
Yeah.

54:44.140 --> 54:46.380
Oh, that was great.

54:46.380 --> 54:46.860
Great.

54:46.860 --> 54:47.740
Thank you.

54:47.740 --> 54:50.780
Corey, please tell him I said, thank you.

54:50.780 --> 54:52.780
OK, so let's do these averages out.

54:52.780 --> 54:53.820
I'll move to that.

54:53.820 --> 54:54.300
Yeah.

54:54.300 --> 54:56.620
You guys, you guys have to rate mine.

54:56.620 --> 54:58.540
I'm going to say 10.

54:58.540 --> 54:59.980
I think she went above and beyond.

54:59.980 --> 55:01.660
She didn't have to do any of this.

55:01.660 --> 55:03.180
She didn't even have to do the show today.

55:03.180 --> 55:08.540
And yeah, we were waiting just on appearance.

55:08.620 --> 55:09.900
Holistically, you're impression of it.

55:09.900 --> 55:10.700
I'd say 10.

55:10.700 --> 55:11.980
I got to say 10 as well.

55:11.980 --> 55:12.540
Great.

55:12.540 --> 55:15.100
OK, so the, let's average these out.

55:15.100 --> 55:16.380
Corey, I gave a nine.

55:16.380 --> 55:18.140
You gave a nine.

55:18.140 --> 55:20.860
Joel gave a four.

55:20.860 --> 55:22.540
Quick math here.

55:22.540 --> 55:24.380
22.

55:24.380 --> 55:25.580
22 divided by three.

55:25.580 --> 55:26.540
7.7.

55:26.540 --> 55:28.540
7.333.

55:28.540 --> 55:30.940
And then Alex, I gave you a six.

55:30.940 --> 55:33.100
You gave her an 8.5.

55:33.100 --> 55:36.380
And then Joel gave her, what, 8.5?

55:36.380 --> 55:37.900
No, much higher.

55:38.860 --> 55:40.460
No, it was an 8.5.

55:40.460 --> 55:42.620
Sorry, it sticks to the rules.

55:42.620 --> 55:46.220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

55:46.220 --> 55:47.660
That's going to be 7.66.

55:47.660 --> 55:49.020
So I have fucking sucks.

55:49.020 --> 55:53.980
Yeah, Billy, we gave you nine point five, nine point five,

55:53.980 --> 55:56.700
and Marie gave you a, or Joel gave you a 10.

55:56.700 --> 55:58.300
So here we go.

55:58.300 --> 56:00.220
Wow, that's nearly perfect.

56:00.220 --> 56:01.100
Thank you.

56:01.100 --> 56:02.140
Great speaking boys, Casey.

56:02.460 --> 56:08.380
That's going to be nine point six.

56:08.380 --> 56:09.100
Wow.

56:09.100 --> 56:11.420
And then Marieka, you got two 10s.

56:11.420 --> 56:12.620
And what did Joel give you?

56:12.620 --> 56:14.220
A six.

56:14.220 --> 56:16.300
Can you remind me what they overall,

56:16.300 --> 56:18.380
rate eating that you would give my meal?

56:18.380 --> 56:20.780
What is combined?

56:20.780 --> 56:24.780
I think it was like a seven point two.

56:26.140 --> 56:27.580
That's a point two, huh?

56:27.580 --> 56:27.980
Yeah.

56:29.580 --> 56:30.780
Cool.

56:30.860 --> 56:33.180
I mean, we know Billy won, but just to get the final scores.

56:33.180 --> 56:34.220
I'm moving to York.

56:34.220 --> 56:36.380
And I want Joel to worry about me.

56:40.380 --> 56:43.500
Um, all right, it was my final score.

56:43.500 --> 56:47.260
Your final score was 9.06, uh,

56:47.260 --> 56:49.260
fuck to me.

56:49.260 --> 56:49.660
Be gone.

56:49.660 --> 56:50.860
Yeah, Joel, really, fuck.

56:50.860 --> 56:51.660
Yeah, get out of here.

56:51.660 --> 56:52.540
This will made me laugh.

56:52.540 --> 56:53.340
Oh, don't tolerate.

56:53.340 --> 56:55.180
That's a good thing to laugh.

56:55.180 --> 56:59.260
And you fucker, um, the winner of today's

56:59.260 --> 57:03.740
Master Chef Derrick and his Billy Skiff Yurties.

57:03.740 --> 57:04.220
Fuck.

57:10.220 --> 57:13.980
Uh, Casey, how are we going to go in an hour?

57:13.980 --> 57:14.860
Great.

57:14.860 --> 57:15.340
That's it.

57:15.340 --> 57:16.300
That's all we had today.

57:16.300 --> 57:18.540
I had a white lotus thing, but I kind of

57:18.540 --> 57:21.180
shoehorned it, shoehorned it in, orally.

57:21.180 --> 57:23.900
Um, shoehorned it in, orally.

57:23.900 --> 57:25.340
What?

57:25.340 --> 57:28.140
A-u-r-a-l-r-ly, irally.

57:28.140 --> 57:28.860
Orally.

57:28.860 --> 57:32.140
Uh, congratulations to Billy.

57:32.140 --> 57:32.300
Thank you.

57:32.300 --> 57:35.420
Uh, you are the Master Chef of Derrick.

57:35.420 --> 57:36.380
Feels great.

57:36.380 --> 57:37.780
Yeah, how does it feel?

57:37.780 --> 57:38.260
Sticky.

57:38.260 --> 57:38.900
Sticky.

57:38.900 --> 57:40.260
Yeah, um, sticky, very wide, very wide.

57:40.260 --> 57:41.380
I my right hand is sticky right now.

57:41.380 --> 57:44.660
Yeah like a five year old boy who's just, like,

57:44.660 --> 57:47.460
had a lot of suites and came from the park in his finger, stick.

57:47.460 --> 57:48.460
Yeah, of course.

57:48.460 --> 57:49.740
It's what I feel like right now.

57:49.740 --> 57:51.660
Um, impressions of this game.

57:51.660 --> 57:55.900
we do it again with a different type of viscous ingredient

57:55.900 --> 58:03.100
kit class. Probably not, first sure, first sure.

58:03.100 --> 58:09.340
Just definitely a dairy shortage, right? Is there? I think so.

58:09.340 --> 58:12.140
There was an ego waffle shortage, like a year and a half ago.

58:12.140 --> 58:16.380
I mean, all of this is just going to get thrown out. Like, we will keep some of it.

58:16.620 --> 58:22.220
But you were talking about the audio we're working with, you were facing a

58:22.220 --> 58:27.820
butter shortage in October. So. But then they started churning out more.

58:29.580 --> 58:33.580
That's really good. Let's do this. Exit interviews of Master Chef Dairy

58:33.580 --> 58:36.860
Edition and plugs. We'll go down the line starting with Corey. How do you feel

58:36.860 --> 58:39.820
about this? How do you feel about your performance? I started really strong. I got two

58:39.820 --> 58:46.220
nine out of tens and suddenly was the biggest loser of all. And it's a bullshit game

58:46.220 --> 58:56.940
and I'm going to kick Joel's ass. And I've got a show on February 25th. It's so far away.

58:56.940 --> 59:03.260
This comes out on December 23rd. Yeah, that's the nearest show that I've got.

59:04.220 --> 59:09.100
February 25th, it'll be at the Illusion with the Bandart Daisy, a whole part of the sketch group.

59:09.100 --> 59:13.340
Social media. I'm at Captain Sadbeard. I got a good follower bump.

59:13.340 --> 59:15.900
Yeah, that was fun. No, your episode was a hit.

59:15.900 --> 59:18.700
People love you. I'm at Captain Sadbeard. So give me a follow.

59:18.700 --> 59:23.740
Captain all the way. That whole full word. Captain not C.I.P.T. No. On Twitter, I'm

59:23.740 --> 59:27.980
Captain Sadbeard. But I don't really use that platform very much.

59:27.980 --> 59:33.500
Uh, yeah. Cool. It's a huge yon from Jeff towards the end of this. That was like a lion's roar.

59:33.500 --> 59:38.860
Yeah. The Fox MGM. It's sometimes feels that the people closest to us were

59:38.860 --> 59:43.100
comfortable giving the worst of ourselves. Like people a little further away from us. We

59:43.260 --> 59:47.660
wouldn't show them true sides of ourselves, but then someone gets closer and they get worse parts of us.

59:47.660 --> 59:51.580
Hmm, I would say that that's not true about the first time I met Jeff. He was just out the gate.

59:51.580 --> 59:54.220
We didn't have a relationship. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

59:54.220 --> 59:58.460
Giving handshakes or he wouldn't grab your hand. He'd grab your arm. He, you're just a master at

59:58.460 --> 01:00:01.900
making someone feel a little uncomfortable. It's like a little off.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:04.940
Do you want to plug like, are you going to be staring at any time soon?

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:11.740
We're banking episodes so I can take a three week break. Wow. Yeah. What are you going to do with your

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:16.300
time? Be normal. Like what? Do what? I'm going home to Cleveland. Then I'm going to which

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.980
tuck hands is. Then I'm going to New York City. Great. And what are the addresses of all the places you

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:25.500
should? Alex? What do you have to plug? How did you feel about your performance in the dairy

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:31.660
contest? The dairy contest was touching go for me. It kind of came at a time where I entered the

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:37.820
shaky period of my hangover. I was a little worried about looking like a tweaker.

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:46.460
But I actually came out a lot more on top than I thought I would thanks to Joel

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:54.220
and you know the Ray reviews. So I'm okay with it. Hell yeah. Do you want to plug your social

01:00:54.220 --> 01:01:02.220
media or outside projects? Join Gumball if you're a podcaster and Alex Berkman.

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:07.740
Did you hear what you got? I don't usually like to play your games. I've done this podcast a lot

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:12.060
and the more I've done them, the less I've enjoyed them. But really, I think so.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:17.260
We've got the YouTube comments of previous Hedgum podcasts that I've been on. People have

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:22.620
almost hired of me being tired of you. So I was almost surprised to be invited back. But here we are.

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:27.820
And I decided to change your tone, change your tune, play the game. So I went in with an open

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:33.020
mind and I tried to use the ingredients in front of me and I tried to show them respect and

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:38.300
hopefully them together would produce a tasty meal. And how do you feel now you want?

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:43.580
I feel really great. And I want to apologize for being so salty to you all those other episodes.

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:47.660
Because now I realize that if you just play the game and play along, it's a pretty positive

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:54.540
experience. So I feel great. I'm excited to leave this studio winner and one more time, Casey.

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:57.260
Great speaking voice. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Casey.

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:05.580
plugs. How do you feel about dairy? Dairy is good by me. I have no issues with it.

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:11.100
Thank God. I'm down. I'm down. Like Donald Trump.

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:12.380
It's awesome. Yeah.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.740
It's amazing.

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:21.180
I'm fine with dairy. If you want a dairy dairy, that's fine.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:36.380
I'm not going to be here. You can follow me at Casey Donhoe and listen to the pit wall

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:42.540
and have one podcast for casual fans. Marie, come round us out. How do you feel about the dairy

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.700
addition of vaster chef and we have to plug?

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:53.500
I feel very proud of the presentation in meal that I made for Joel. I think that I was

01:02:55.340 --> 01:03:01.100
at a disadvantage with my ingredients being different than everyone else's. And also at

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:06.780
an advantage because Joel's a little punk ass bitch. I'll say it on air.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:10.540
Yeah, we just did. Joel's going to catch these fucking hands.

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:17.340
Wow. I think Marie got rubbed. You got me daddy.

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:25.740
That was great. Joel is great, but he is on notice for this because I tried to make it as

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:32.140
palatable as possible for him. I made a fucking cheese crisp in a microwave.

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:40.220
You got two minutes. His favorite thing was the egg nog that I poured and sprinkled with cinnamon.

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:47.740
So, you know, it is what it is, but I was whipping together a full case-o dip for him.

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:55.500
Anyway, yeah, if I can follow me on letterbox to write a letterbox at my collection.

01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:01.740
Twitter and Instagram at Marie Gailon, but mostly letterboxed.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:05.980
Got it. Can I pitch title for this episode? Yeah. There's something about dairy.

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:11.100
That's good. Yeah, I kind of want to laugh. Everyone should have.

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:14.940
About when dairy met Casey.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:24.300
Yeah, you should be there. Something about dairy and then you could do a little bit of whipped cream in your hair.

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:27.020
Have you seen that?

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:29.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:32.380
At Jeffrey James on Instagram at Jeff Bordy on Twitter.

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:35.660
We'll come up with something. I'll start a group chat.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.780
I think you guys will see me this for that.

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:44.380
Don't start a group chat for the title, right?

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:48.300
Everyone has their own work and stuff to deal with.

01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:54.140
I mean, Marie gets right.

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:58.140
Oh, yeah.

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:12.780
That was a hit-dum original.

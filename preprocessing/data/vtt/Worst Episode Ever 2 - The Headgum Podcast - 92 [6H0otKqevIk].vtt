00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Thank you to Athletic Greens for sponsoring this episode of our show.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Guys, you know I'm high on Athletic Greens because I've started taking it every day,

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
and it makes me feel energized, which I obviously need because I never sleep well.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
I've started taking it in the morning, I'll have a cup of water,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
and then I'll have my Athletic Greens in an hour later, I'll have my coffee,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
and it just really helps me start the day feeling like I have a pep in my step,

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
without tasting super healthy, but being super healthy.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
So what is this stuff?

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Well with one delicious scoop of Athletic Greens, you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins,

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
minerals, whole-food source super foods, probiotics, and adaptogens to help

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
start your day right.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
This special blend of ingredients supports your gut health, your nervous system, your immune system,

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
your energy, recovery, focus, and aging, all the things.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
It helps me again with my energy.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
I definitely feel like I'm a better version of myself physically,

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
and the taste again I would say is kind of bubble gumming.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
I haven't found anyone that agrees with me on that, but that's what I taste.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
It's kind of like mild and tropical.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
And I've started traveling a little bit,

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
and I take it with me on the go because they gave me travel packs.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
And again, we'll get to that later.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Athletic Greens is lifestyle friendly,

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
whether you eat keto, paleo, vegan, dairy for your gluten-free,

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
it's all for you, and it's all right with AG1.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
It contains less than one gram of sugar, no GMOs, no nasty chemicals

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
or artificial, anything while still tasting good.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
It supports, again, better sleep quality and recovery, mental clarity and alertness,

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
and much, much more.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
And it's the one thing with the best things.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Because Athletic Greens uses the best of the best products,

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
based on the latest science with constant product iterations

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
and third-party testing.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
It costs less than $3 a day,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
and you're investing in your health,

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
and it's cheaper than your cold brew habit.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
It's also cheaper than getting all these supplements yourself.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
I used to be a million different pills guy.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Now I get it all from one delicious scoop of Athletic Greens,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
and you're investing again in an all-in-one nutritional insurance.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
So right now, it's time to reclaim your health

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
and arm your immune system with convenient, daily nutrition,

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
especially heading into cold and flu season, right?

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
It's just one scoop of in a cup of water every day.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
That's it.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
No need for a million different pills and supplements

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
to look out for your health, and to make it easy.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one-year supply

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
of immune supporting vitamin D,

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
which is incredibly important,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
especially in places that don't get a lot of sun in the winter,

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
and five free travel packs with your first purchase.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
All you have to do is visit AthleticRings.com slash what's that?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Again, that's AthleticGreens.com slash what's that

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
to take ownership over your health and pick up

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Thanks Athletic Greens.

02:35.000 --> 02:44.000
Are we rolling or just this?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Yeah.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Happy New Year.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
What?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Welcome to another dish in the bag and podcast,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Friday, February 25th, shortest month of the year.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
We're almost through it.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Shout out to our lineup today,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
which is Johnny Villa, George Saba, Andrew Pyle,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
and Amir Loonfeld.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
How's it hanging with everybody?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Pyle, you're having technical issues.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Johnny, you're at home.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Johnny's laptop might die in the middle of this,

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
and George is currently in an editing bay,

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
working on a television episode,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
so he cannot talk or hear us.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
What do you mean he can't talk or hear us?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
So he's not a show.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
He can't be listening to things in the editing bay.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
And he can't be responding when he's next to his boss.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
So what's happening is that he can't hear us

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
and we are not going to hear him say anything.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
So what?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Why did you add him last minute?

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Because it's fun to have guests on the show.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
You're making this harder for grace than to edit in the editing.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
I'm not going to apologize for taking a big swing.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
So he cannot hear us any.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
And he cannot say anything.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
At no point during this record,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
we'll George hear anything we're saying.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
But at the same time, he won't say anything.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
So I just might as well leave.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Major killer.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Swing for the fences, no matter the defenses.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
I've got three fucking white guys here,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
telling me what to do, how to feel,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
what to eat and when to be.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Three.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
What is that?

04:29.000 --> 04:37.000
Andrew Pile, how is that cockman?

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah, you asked us every episode.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
What are you eating?

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
You keep like quickly moving shit into your mouth with chopsticks.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
That can't, we can't see anything.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
That's it.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
It's just what he prepared.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
It looks like brownies.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
A chopstick is what it looks like from here.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
You're so dexterous with the chopsticks.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Is that a steak?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
It's just a steak.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
A giant piece of steak with chopsticks.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Why chopsticks?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Why on the show?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
What?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Why so close to my camera?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Here's my brain.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Oh, God.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
You guys want to hear it?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Can you finish eating and then say it?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Hang on.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
It's fucking bear with me.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
It's a wax episode.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
So you didn't prepare anything.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
It's what you're trying to say.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Couldn't, I had an audition right before this.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
During the time I was going to outline the episode.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
George says, hello.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
What are you guys talking about?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
What do you mean he says it?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
He didn't say anything.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
And the chat here.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
I'm the fucking chat.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
How did the audition go?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
It went really well.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
This might be bison meat.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Now that I'm tasting her.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Who made that?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Peter Luger.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
You went to a real useless business.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I want to be a loser.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
And got a doggy bag.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
Um, my, like, entertainment industry mentor took me there last night.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Sorry.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Start from the way way way top.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Yeah.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
What did anybody take you under there?

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
And you give you a bison.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
Entertainment mentor.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
His name's Ivan.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
So I'm so flippin slash glib slash casual.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
What's that?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Potatoes?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Fritz?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Bingo.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
So you want to rip him?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Daniel.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Hello.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Hello.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Hello.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Yeah.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Happy weekend.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
I don't know what to say.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Um, I'm having a great time.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
How was Peter Luger's?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
It's kind of a famous job house.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
It's really fancy.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Is it good?

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Bad.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Yeah.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Is it like overrated or is it like?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
It was unbelievable.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Yeah.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
You never had steak like that or you never had steak period.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
It's like one.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
So it was good.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Do you like the.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
What's up?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Did I like the plate?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
No.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
The plate of sizzling.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Was that George?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Believe it was.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
So he interrupted the stream with a song.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I'm starting to know that he's might be in the studio.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
With a famous artist.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
No way.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
I doubt him.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Who did you say you had?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
I doubt it.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Who did you say you ate with yesterday?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
I've been.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Your entertainment mentor.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Yeah.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
He produced entourage and band of brothers.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I tried to get him on dead eyes.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
But my comrade didn't respond to any of his emails.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
He's buddies with Tom Hanks.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Not that matters.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
And what was the.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
What was the um.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Moots.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
What was the conversation like?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
We talked about our families.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Because I know his kids.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
We talked about casting.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
We talked about my new pilot.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
All right.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
I found him.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
How do you know this guy?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
How old is he?

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
This is the fucking second degree here.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
All right.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
And I'm ready to turn into the first.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Murder wise.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
I don't know where his him is.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Oh.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Uh.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Up.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Football pass on it.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
Did he have the Peter Lover credit card?

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
You know it's like cash or the credit card is the only way you can pay for

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
food.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Peter Lovers.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
All right.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
I don't know why.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
They're all on credit card.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I found out this is the worst.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
So this is going to be a huge reward.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.800
to learn about New York.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.200
You need to have like cool little factoids

09:16.200 --> 09:17.840
about New York if you want to fit in as New York.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.840
I have factoids, but I know Lugers.

09:19.840 --> 09:21.040
I know Lugers.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.240
Lugers was sold in 19th.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.440
Did you get the most important?

09:24.440 --> 09:26.560
1950 was sold for $35,000,

09:26.560 --> 09:29.240
because they were the only people who bid it.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.200
George's asking if he should leave LOL,

09:31.200 --> 09:33.120
because he's not saying anything he's can't hear us.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.680
Yeah, they should probably leave.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.520
Yeah.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.360
Don't say LMAO.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.200
I think.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.360
I said, stay.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.920
LMAO, I'm dead.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.000
You can get a mic stand and then you could use both hands.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.280
I'd like to say like holding the mic directly

09:53.280 --> 09:55.000
and your nose and breathing into it.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.840
Yeah, Johnny Carson said that Peter Lugers

09:56.840 --> 10:00.440
was the best meal he's ever had.

10:00.440 --> 10:03.840
So I'd caution all of you to proceed with reverence.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.480
Having leftovers from Peter's is better

10:06.480 --> 10:10.040
than having the finest dining elsewhere,

10:10.040 --> 10:12.040
because it's Luger.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.760
Have you guys ever, this is going to be

10:14.760 --> 10:16.600
a very specific set of circumstances.

10:16.600 --> 10:20.440
Have you guys ever been to Lugers after you were at a Lugers?

10:20.440 --> 10:22.000
I've never actually been to Lugers.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.560
Then you're a loser.

10:23.560 --> 10:24.240
Not really.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.600
Yeah.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.480
That's funny.

10:29.480 --> 10:30.280
I've been to Lugers.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.880
I don't know what Lugers is.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.280
Stayed free for lunch, basically, is what I was talking about.

10:34.280 --> 10:35.160
Can you reheat it?

10:35.160 --> 10:38.560
It looks still cold from the fridge or something.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.560
I thought you'd have freeze sticks.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.720
Might be they're cold.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.120
And why are you using chopsticks?

10:48.920 --> 10:50.880
Let's talk about you, right?

10:50.880 --> 10:51.400
OK.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.640
Are you going to move any time soon?

10:56.640 --> 10:57.080
No.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.160
Live in a piece of shit.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.280
No, I don't.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.160
Probably everybody in the house.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.160
Yeah, it's really nice.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.160
No, it's really nice.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.000
I love it.

11:04.000 --> 11:04.760
I don't even use it.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.520
It was a piece of shit in that I should move.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.520
Now that I've been to Lugers, I can't help but feel

11:09.520 --> 11:13.320
like everything's a piece of shit, unless you're at Lug Peters.

11:13.320 --> 11:15.960
So every time I sit, that's not where it gets.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.080
Yeah, it's the worst ambiance of any restaurant

11:18.080 --> 11:19.160
I've ever been in.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.120
It's the right lights.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.960
Waiters that are super rude to you.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.120
So we're going to have two things on the menu.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.760
It's like a whole steak.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.360
The three things on the menu.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.360
Steak for two, steak for three, steak for four.

11:31.360 --> 11:32.360
Yeah.

11:32.360 --> 11:35.200
So it's like, it's sort of like the time-square of steak house

11:35.200 --> 11:35.840
as it seems.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.760
It's kind of like a tourist trap a little bit.

11:37.760 --> 11:40.160
And you said you had the best meal of your life

11:40.160 --> 11:42.640
there last night with your entertainment mentor?

11:42.640 --> 11:45.480
No, that was Johnny Carson's in that.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.160
So you said you loved it, didn't you?

11:47.160 --> 11:48.000
I thought it was great.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
You say it's steak for the first time at Versailles.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.160
They cut bacon, sizzling wedge.

11:58.440 --> 12:01.560
Peter Luger, the first choice.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.160
I didn't choose it.

12:03.160 --> 12:04.480
Oh, OK.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.680
He said you want to get dinner, I said yes.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.560
Well, this guy's a real mover and shaker.

12:11.560 --> 12:14.880
He's got quite a list of accomplishments.

12:14.880 --> 12:15.360
Nice.

12:15.360 --> 12:15.880
I'm intrigued.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.480
I don't know how you know him.

12:17.480 --> 12:18.680
Cleveland.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.440
Let's talk about something else.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.760
Cleveland.

12:21.760 --> 12:23.960
Ten minutes of this one topic.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.000
I think we're done with it.

12:25.000 --> 12:25.880
We've exhausted it.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.560
And I'm exhausted of it.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.000
You keep your head and back to the steak, man.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.200
Thank you, athletic greens for sponsoring this episode.

12:33.200 --> 12:33.720
No way.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.400
We're not in the middle of an ad break.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.400
Well, from an edit,

12:36.400 --> 12:39.120
the mud is well just throw caution the way in, right?

12:39.120 --> 12:40.840
You guys are saying, oh, we've just pieced it together.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.800
You know, long it takes probably not.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.160
This thing apparently zero.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.280
You didn't play it anything.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.920
All right, all right.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.400
Oh, waxing episode.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.800
Oh, waxing episode.

12:51.800 --> 12:52.800
Yeah.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.600
That's a real one.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.400
That's a kind of fun way to say you did nothing.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.040
It's great.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.040
Fuck.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.520
That's not the song.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.320
That's not it, either.

13:03.320 --> 13:04.760
What the fuck is happening?

13:05.400 --> 13:06.640
Nope.

13:06.640 --> 13:08.920
This sucks, this is not krie.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.160
Sorry.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.800
I'm a messaging droer as it's probably way more fun.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.600
He's asking me what I thought he'd tell

13:29.600 --> 13:34.240
from Sweet Green or of what he should get from Sweet Green.

13:34.240 --> 13:38.640
Don't stay free it's stay free it's they don't sell that actually pretty it's a solid place man

13:41.280 --> 13:43.280
All right, you okay

13:44.960 --> 13:53.320
You know you're hosting this you should probably at least have like one question, but you can fall back on if it gets sour like it is right on

13:54.320 --> 13:56.320
Minute nine of

13:57.520 --> 13:59.520
All right, what's the question I could ask um

14:04.240 --> 14:08.160
Do you guys like photos or paintings

14:10.720 --> 14:12.720
If you had to pick one

14:13.360 --> 14:17.120
Did you guys all hang out yesterday? I know Marty's on in New York

14:18.640 --> 14:23.360
Here's like a panel going on with where you guys there to hang out. Did you guys go to the cheese place?

14:23.840 --> 14:29.240
Yeah, we went to the cheese place. It was great. Have you been to be a church before never?

14:29.680 --> 14:33.520
It's just a lot of cheese to be white cheese. It's just really nice

14:33.840 --> 14:39.040
It's like cheesy Peter lougars. It seems like yeah, yeah Johnny you get in the stairs

14:39.040 --> 14:45.440
I really fall down the stairs. It was pretty embarrassing because it was the way I entered everyone else got there before me

14:46.640 --> 14:50.240
They saw me on these stairs way of to low and me it will you fail

14:51.840 --> 14:56.160
Did you like slide and sort of fall on your butt or did you like I'm here? Sorry, let's listen to Johnny

14:58.400 --> 15:00.400
He was

15:01.360 --> 15:03.360
Move it

15:03.600 --> 15:08.880
But to answer your question, I'm here. It was a front facing fall. So I don't know

15:10.160 --> 15:16.560
Wow down there's front facing and the stairs were metallic too. So every

15:17.680 --> 15:19.680
It was very loud as well

15:20.640 --> 15:22.640
not great

15:23.440 --> 15:29.600
This is at a cheese restaurant. Yeah, hopefully it's kind of stopped and stared for what felt like a stunned eternity

15:30.400 --> 15:35.600
It was pretty bad. Yeah, but in the pile wasn't there speaking of getting stairs

15:36.160 --> 15:42.960
I recently went out to like an orchestra concert. It was like a school or a university orchestra concert

15:44.560 --> 15:46.800
And there are a lot of older people there

15:48.400 --> 15:53.840
Probably around there like 60s 70s and 80s and I walked in sat down

15:54.560 --> 15:57.520
Took off my mask just to breathe a little bit and talk to my friend and

15:58.000 --> 16:02.240
And someone tapped me and they said excuse me, sir. Can you put on your mask?

16:02.240 --> 16:08.640
It was one of the audience. One of the members of the audience and I look behind me and everybody is staring at me

16:09.600 --> 16:14.560
Insane so they all amass on but you they all had masks on it was

16:15.840 --> 16:17.840
Crazy

16:18.720 --> 16:20.720
Did you put it on what it is?

16:20.720 --> 16:25.200
Yeah, I absolutely put it on but I felt like other people behind me were like pod people really

16:25.680 --> 16:27.680
For believing in this shit

16:36.000 --> 16:42.240
Big time you suck you suck big time. Yeah, I don't know why

16:43.680 --> 16:47.200
We're starting to have fun all of a sudden you have to antagonize somebody. Yeah

16:47.360 --> 16:52.720
It's like what's the vibe like at a cheese-only restaurant? Does it sort of wreak of cheese down there?

16:52.960 --> 16:54.960
Yeah, yeah, it stinks

17:01.440 --> 17:05.440
Okay, do that five the sound five the sound here. Yeah, that's never ago

17:10.320 --> 17:12.320
You like

17:12.320 --> 17:16.080
You think it sounds the single note of let's get it stuck

17:23.040 --> 17:25.040
Don't

17:26.640 --> 17:30.320
Marty said that he that what used to be his spot to take like first dates, too

17:31.280 --> 17:33.760
Cheese recipes. It's been of a cheese store

17:34.800 --> 17:36.800
Reaks of a party

17:37.440 --> 17:39.440
Vardy Michael

17:41.680 --> 17:44.400
When he's feeling extra cheesy, that's his nickname

17:45.760 --> 17:47.760
Vardy Michael

17:48.720 --> 17:52.720
See you're down there. What do you guys get in like a fondue a shark cuterie?

17:53.440 --> 17:57.680
What's the cheese vibe? We ended up doing the mongers five I think what's that?

17:58.240 --> 18:02.000
Johnny it's just a play to five different cheeses that they look out

18:02.880 --> 18:04.880
Like it's not really that crazy

18:04.880 --> 18:07.520
Right, I know I'd Jeff threw it to me to explain

18:08.800 --> 18:12.480
And they choose all the cheeses or do they ask you what you like? No, they choose a

18:13.440 --> 18:20.240
Cower and you and I'm glad you asked because you would have thought that we added some say instead we're left with this fucking triple

18:24.720 --> 18:26.720
Sorry you deserve that man

18:28.160 --> 18:30.720
Your apartment is now hitting you

18:31.840 --> 18:37.440
You get how you're annoying so much that objects are starting to ripple

18:43.360 --> 18:45.360
You're bleeding a little bit

18:46.640 --> 18:48.640
Not like my whole life just flashed your eyes

18:50.160 --> 18:52.400
Because I was eating like they fucking um

18:53.840 --> 19:02.240
They seeming they gave us the drugs we had this triple crème that was to die for drizzled in honey. We had what was it a truffle gouda

19:03.840 --> 19:05.840
I guess man. I just ate the cheeses

19:06.480 --> 19:12.000
Yeah, I'd have positively just putting him in my mouth. There was a goat cheese. There was a wine and coffee

19:12.160 --> 19:13.520
Rubbed

19:13.520 --> 19:19.440
Strong cheese and it just sort of felt like they didn't give a damn whether we had a good time or not

19:20.640 --> 19:22.640
really didn't bend to every

19:23.840 --> 19:25.840
Will that I that we had and

19:27.360 --> 19:33.520
I didn't appreciate it. I didn't have a great time kidding me. The waitress came up to us so many times asking how we were doing

19:35.200 --> 19:40.800
That's true. We're pretty much bending to our every whim because it was on the company credit card

19:40.880 --> 19:44.240
Which was nice, but that's true. I also sent a lot of things back

19:45.360 --> 19:46.880
Yeah, we didn't have of it

19:47.280 --> 19:49.520
Yeah, and they still like did it with a smile on their face

19:50.080 --> 19:54.080
I guess I missed some kind of etiquette class that everybody else took like why why is that?

19:54.080 --> 20:00.320
I just myself all the time and then I see glances like this where everybody's staring me at the eyes angry for some reason

20:01.760 --> 20:05.520
Sorry, just got a pack Joe's trying to figure out what it was. Pile how's the kid?

20:06.480 --> 20:15.040
Good, really good. I went to an actual semester's week. He has he's in the 25th percentile and had a wait and the 60 fifth percentile in head size

20:16.000 --> 20:22.560
Wow, he's got the cranial capacity of a young butch Cassidy as they say. I mean he's great

20:23.120 --> 20:27.520
I'm pretty into phernology recently and I really like that

20:29.520 --> 20:31.520
Sort of learn a lot

20:31.840 --> 20:40.800
I'll send some skull photos or yeah, yeah, it's all about the shape really of the the front and the back and how the interact with each other

20:41.200 --> 20:45.120
I shouldn't know that I have I'm in the first percentile and head size actually

20:46.400 --> 20:49.200
Or a size or yes, yes, smallest

20:53.440 --> 20:56.240
What's the last thing that you learned

20:57.600 --> 21:00.560
Last big thing so that's big thing you learned

21:02.240 --> 21:08.320
That's a good one object permanent still or yeah, no, he's he's good. He's stringing sentences together

21:08.320 --> 21:15.120
He's like walking around. He knows about you know his family. It's family just came to visit and I like his grandparents and

21:17.840 --> 21:22.000
often alcohol and he had a really a time and was like looking forward to it like we told him

21:22.000 --> 21:25.840
We were coming and he was like talking about it for like days so he got to it. It's like pretty crazy

21:26.400 --> 21:29.360
His like brain doesn't reset like a fish every night anymore

21:29.680 --> 21:32.400
He's nice fully evolved all the time

21:35.520 --> 21:38.400
Yeah, I don't know I'm trying to think what the latest piece of information he has

21:39.280 --> 21:42.960
He learns like so many words. I feel like every day. He's got like five new words that he picks up

21:43.680 --> 21:47.440
Do you ever wonder like whoa how did he learn that word? I didn't teach it to him

21:48.400 --> 21:53.200
Well, yesterday we were playing like farm bingo like we have these words with like farm models on them

21:53.200 --> 21:57.520
And you can do like bingo with it and he was like just playing bingo by himself like picking up things

21:57.840 --> 22:00.400
I'm on the massive and I'm like how did you learn this?

22:00.400 --> 22:04.160
He's like couldn't explain it so I don't actually know like out that everything

22:04.880 --> 22:09.680
But he had somehow figured that someone had taught him that clearly, but yeah, that's pretty awesome

22:10.080 --> 22:12.080
He naturally figured it out

22:12.080 --> 22:14.080
Yeah, he's fine

22:15.120 --> 22:17.120
Does he know JavaScript given anything else?

22:18.720 --> 22:20.000
What was that?

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Sorry you go

22:22.560 --> 22:27.120
Who whoever talked over me? I was just asking if you knew JavaScript, but

22:27.840 --> 22:29.520
No, but I am working on that

22:29.520 --> 22:31.520
I've kind of figured out like how I can teach him

22:33.120 --> 22:39.280
Engineering concepts. We have like an engineering like a series of books about like physics for babies and it's very

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
some interesting

22:42.400 --> 22:44.400
There's like statistical

22:44.400 --> 22:46.400
Analysis for babies

22:46.400 --> 22:48.400
The books and it's about

22:49.200 --> 22:51.200
Entropy it doesn't matter. This is not that

22:52.400 --> 22:56.160
Well, it's probably more interesting than the whole ten-minute spiel that we had about Peter Louder

22:56.240 --> 23:03.600
Which is a restaurant localized within New York City and it's hard to afford by the way for most of the general public

23:04.400 --> 23:08.160
But I guess Ivan has that cash that deep

23:08.720 --> 23:10.720
pocket

23:11.440 --> 23:16.400
Given the choice of anyone in the world who would you want as a dinner guest?

23:17.440 --> 23:19.760
Let's start there and see where the podcast goes

23:20.480 --> 23:22.480
Okay, why are you annoyed?

23:22.880 --> 23:27.680
That you had to come up with a single question for an hour-long conversation

23:27.680 --> 23:32.240
Conan O'Brien is my answer nice why he's funny a shit

23:33.840 --> 23:35.840
Tall suit

23:36.400 --> 23:43.360
There's lots of funny tall people why Conan is specifically Gary Goldman is like six with six hilarious stand-up comedian

23:44.400 --> 23:48.640
He's following the Conan. Yeah, so lives in New York so I could make that happen asap fur

23:49.840 --> 23:51.840
What about you Johnny

23:52.960 --> 23:54.320
I

23:54.320 --> 23:55.680
Don't know

23:55.680 --> 23:58.240
Probably some musician maybe

23:59.120 --> 24:03.040
Frank Ocean just be it'll be interesting getting to the mind of Frank

24:05.440 --> 24:09.840
I don't have it. I can't make this funny. This is like just a very general question

24:12.320 --> 24:14.320
I'm here

24:14.320 --> 24:19.120
Choose an athlete. I'd like to sort of pick the brains of LeBron James

24:19.200 --> 24:21.200
Yeah

24:22.480 --> 24:24.480
LeBron

24:24.480 --> 24:26.480
Yeah, we go to

24:31.200 --> 24:38.160
Yeah, it's sort of get to the bottom of a spirits business. It seems like there's a lot of money to be had there in terms of pivoting

24:39.120 --> 24:42.800
Because the rock did the tequila thing and then the bron did it

24:43.520 --> 24:47.520
Also tequila. I wonder if it's all just from the same place with the different label on it

24:48.000 --> 24:54.480
That is interesting because Brian Krannston and Aaron Paul of breaking bad fame

24:55.280 --> 25:01.680
They also have it. I think it tequila as well. I think it's just tequila is like how you get a cheap and yeah

25:02.080 --> 25:10.880
I think it's all it's like the best marketing market you can do is like to just get alcohol and then like put it in a nice bottle with a nice label

25:12.080 --> 25:14.080
Jeffrey James

25:18.480 --> 25:25.520
I'm you already have like you know between the rock and LeBron two of the biggest folks people in the world

25:25.520 --> 25:27.520
So like why would they get paid to

25:28.160 --> 25:31.520
Hock some other product they might as well own the entire distribution

25:33.120 --> 25:35.120
Is that the kind of liquor that you'd like?

25:35.120 --> 25:37.120
Let's say that you had your own liquor

25:37.680 --> 25:41.600
Yeah, I don't really like tequila. I wonder why they both chose that when I wonder if that's special

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Would you want to have dinner with

25:44.960 --> 25:46.960
I've in the e-shorts

25:48.560 --> 25:50.560
No, for

25:50.960 --> 25:52.960
first two and

25:54.240 --> 25:57.440
Let's see what else and taking Jeffrey to Peter Luger

25:58.560 --> 26:05.040
If you're a Luke having the a counted peer looter, probably having the Peter Luger credit card is what I think he's best no more nice

26:05.280 --> 26:10.080
Just kidding. He's super well enough. Brother stuff. What's the APY on a Peter Luger?

26:10.560 --> 26:12.560
Oh

26:16.560 --> 26:18.560
It's funny

26:23.360 --> 26:27.840
Yeah, I think I don't have to say yeah, I guess I would say a few jobs

26:28.720 --> 26:30.320
You know, I think that's kind of like

26:32.000 --> 26:36.960
He's dead. I don't know basic or whatever. Yeah, he has to be alive

26:37.200 --> 26:39.840
Yeah, he didn't he didn't do the dead or live thing

26:43.200 --> 26:48.400
Give me a fucking meal with Putin right now. I want to sit down to stare the man in the house

26:50.400 --> 26:52.400
He could be afraid to me

26:55.520 --> 26:57.520
I feel like I can convince him

26:57.520 --> 26:59.520
Jeff is calling

27:01.760 --> 27:04.160
You think Putin is stressed out right now like

27:04.800 --> 27:07.760
Is he like nervous see you think he's sleeping well?

27:10.640 --> 27:11.600
I wonder

27:11.600 --> 27:16.080
Because he's sort of a sociopath so like he doesn't seem to mind the

27:16.560 --> 27:18.560
casualty that he's caused

27:19.200 --> 27:22.480
But at the same time it must weigh on him a little bit you would think

27:23.600 --> 27:26.240
Yeah, name three things you have in common

27:27.520 --> 27:33.440
With what well these are the fucking questions for the New York Times 36 questions that lead to love thing and it's

27:33.520 --> 27:37.520
Supposed to be you in your partner, but it doesn't make any sense because it's just you guys individually. So what do you have in common?

27:39.360 --> 27:41.360
Amongst all of us in the room

27:41.360 --> 27:43.360
That's maybe a little easier to understand sure

27:48.480 --> 27:53.440
We all work the same monster. Yeah, let's get back on the Putin topic

27:54.480 --> 27:57.520
An absolute monster a dictator

27:59.200 --> 28:02.320
We all work headgun so that's too

28:03.520 --> 28:06.160
We have to endure this and that's three

28:10.480 --> 28:12.480
Okay

28:14.720 --> 28:20.160
When you had the energy Jeff had at the top with his fucking chopsticks

28:20.880 --> 28:26.480
He was on top of the fucking world. I think Jeff has said less this episode than any other

28:27.440 --> 28:29.440
Sorry

28:30.000 --> 28:35.680
Don't look to sponsor talk about maybe two things and he said like maybe four cents

28:38.240 --> 28:40.240
But you know this is a waxing up

28:42.800 --> 28:48.400
Take four minutes and tell you your life story and as much detail as possible

28:48.400 --> 28:50.400
Let's start with Andrew fucking pile

28:50.400 --> 28:55.600
Do we have to take do we have to take a break by the way? Don't we have ads wait what time is it

28:56.480 --> 28:59.040
Real four oh shit. Yeah, we'll be right back

29:00.320 --> 29:05.120

30:23.200 --> 30:27.040
or going someplace new and whatever you way you challenge yourself this new year

30:27.280 --> 30:32.640

Oh

31:48.000 --> 31:52.640
I don't you don't have why this this is not I don't want to let's but I'm not prepared to do that

31:53.760 --> 31:55.760
Emotional yeah

31:55.760 --> 31:57.760
It's bad podcasting yeah

31:58.800 --> 32:02.160
No, no heads up you're gonna come in and tell your life story

32:03.680 --> 32:05.680
I think that's easy, but yeah

32:06.480 --> 32:08.480
Why don't you tell you haven't done anything

32:09.040 --> 32:13.360
You're nothing you want you want my life story no, and I don't actually no one does

32:13.760 --> 32:18.960
It goes from a fucking yo-yo competition to a dinner at Peter Luger. That's it

32:21.200 --> 32:25.680
All right, how about this fuckers and now I'm angry what do you value most in a friendship

32:27.760 --> 32:29.760
You're angry at that question

32:30.800 --> 32:35.280
I don't know what to do here. All right, I'm between rock and a fucking hard place because you guys are

32:35.280 --> 32:38.400
spewing poison at me and George isn't even offering anything

32:39.360 --> 32:46.480
You're one bit for this episode was to add George who's can't hear or say anything

32:47.040 --> 32:53.360
Then you plan no bits beyond that so there's no talking or anything like that all right

32:53.360 --> 33:00.160
And you get up and look at your look at your body language. It's so manic and nervous right now

33:00.160 --> 33:05.520
You're wrong. Yeah, why do you think I did it five people more perspectives?

33:06.400 --> 33:08.400
So

33:08.400 --> 33:16.560
I'm here before you joined Johnny signed on and Jeff was like really excited that Johnny was here and he was like it's I'm really glad you're here

33:16.560 --> 33:23.120
Like you'll see why and I assume it was because he had some Johnny specific bits planned and now I realize it's because he had nothing planned

33:23.680 --> 33:27.040
And he just needed more people to be able to carry this jail for

33:28.000 --> 33:31.680
Also didn't Johnny say he might not be able to come you were not yeah

33:31.840 --> 33:38.080
I wasn't free and I shouldn't be here Johnny moved heaven and earth to be here. And yes, this is what we have

33:38.560 --> 33:41.760
I was six percent of it. I have six percent left on my laptop

33:44.960 --> 33:49.600
I'm definitely leaving this is it this is the worst episode we've ever done

33:51.120 --> 33:53.120
Right

33:53.120 --> 33:59.200
Yeah, certainly does and I'm gonna show a nude photo how about that everybody loves my eyes all the time right

33:59.840 --> 34:05.920
Here we go, no, I photo my own ass kind of don't want to look, but feel like I have to look

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
What am I looking there?

34:10.000 --> 34:13.360
It's me scratching that looked like a dog

34:17.520 --> 34:19.520
God, you have such small cheeks

34:23.200 --> 34:25.200
You

34:25.920 --> 34:27.920
You

34:29.440 --> 34:31.440
Really small

34:32.400 --> 34:35.040
Pads his pants he pads his butt cheeks

34:35.760 --> 34:42.320
You have white hips and a really small hole in cheeks. I don't know what that was

34:43.120 --> 34:48.240
It was one of those optical lesions where the picture of what people were struck see

34:52.960 --> 34:54.960
Let's suck um

34:55.920 --> 35:00.400
I don't know there's nothing new in my life. What about who took on penis game you

35:01.280 --> 35:04.400
I like there go back came from a you just came from an audition

35:04.400 --> 35:06.240
I mean what was the role was the role what was

35:07.040 --> 35:12.400
Glad you guys so it was actually I'll do some lines. There's a lot of improv involved and one of them was

35:13.680 --> 35:15.680
My name's Johnny Villa

35:15.680 --> 35:19.520
No way they didn't lie with the line but I got two takes

35:21.760 --> 35:23.280
Okay, so what was the commercial for

35:24.240 --> 35:30.400
Why would my name possibly be mentioned in a commercial because Craig Robinson is also in it and he loves your ass

35:31.120 --> 35:33.120
No way he has no idea

35:36.080 --> 35:40.000
The audition was good it was virtual and it was virtually useless

35:41.040 --> 35:43.040
I'm gonna try to tell you dad

35:43.040 --> 35:46.640
Boy what was the product and how many auditions have you had for a commercial

35:47.280 --> 35:52.240
For this one or for commercials in general ever ever probably over 40

35:53.360 --> 35:55.840
Booked any of them only because of Vinny Pion

35:58.160 --> 36:00.160
So often audition

36:01.680 --> 36:04.800
So for 40 so far I almost was

36:05.760 --> 36:10.000
In an enterprise commercial with Kristen Bell and asked me why I lost out on it

36:10.880 --> 36:13.120
Why'd you leave that on because I shaved my mustache

36:14.880 --> 36:17.280
I didn't know that mattered nobody fucking told me

36:18.240 --> 36:24.320
I walk into the final callback or for the camera the read or something and they were like what happened to the mustache

36:24.320 --> 36:26.560
And I was like, oh, I had to shave it for a different audition

36:26.560 --> 36:28.560
They said oh, thanks for coming in

36:28.800 --> 36:30.800
Didn't even do the no

36:33.200 --> 36:35.280
They don't know you can like put on fake mustache

36:38.320 --> 36:40.320
New York

36:40.320 --> 36:42.320
You

36:43.840 --> 36:47.680
That was finally found it. He finally found it. That was the line

36:51.840 --> 36:55.040
Sorry, I got lost picturing myself living in piles back house

36:56.400 --> 36:59.600
If I did you up here when you're upstate and you never even

37:00.480 --> 37:03.360
Told me you were coming you but kids. We're gonna do with a kid

37:04.560 --> 37:08.320
The kid has daycare just come to her. He goes to bed at like seven

37:10.320 --> 37:14.960
Yeah, all right. What is daycare like up there? What is daycare like up there?

37:16.000 --> 37:20.880
It's just the lady's house, so it's woman watches like three other little kids his age

37:21.760 --> 37:24.560
Oh George is laughing shut up George is laughing. What's kind of fun to see

37:27.040 --> 37:29.040
He doesn't want to shut up all right

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
All right, so the daycare's at this lady's house

37:34.960 --> 37:36.000
I

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Not it. I laughed so much that

37:38.720 --> 37:40.720
Vogueers came out of my nose

37:41.760 --> 37:47.360
We can see that if you can rewind it you can see that happen. Let's get that on the tape. Yeah in real time. Yeah

37:49.680 --> 37:55.280
Yeah, for you don't have to be texting in the middle of your show sorry your show remember your show

The founder of Kenyan coffee happy now and what was he stylish?

41:07.920 --> 41:09.920
He was in a green sweater

41:11.120 --> 41:13.920
Painters pants and fucking broken stocks

41:14.000 --> 41:16.640
I think that's awesome. I think that's awesome

41:17.920 --> 41:19.920
Actually

41:19.920 --> 41:21.920
Sweet, nope

41:22.560 --> 41:24.320
Sayon because you said sweet like you're about to leave

41:27.760 --> 41:32.560
I wasn't about to leave but you're incredibly insecure that you think that

41:33.760 --> 41:35.760
Amir

41:35.920 --> 41:40.400
Make three true Wii statements for instance we are in this feeling

41:41.360 --> 41:43.360
Or in this room both feeling blank

41:49.920 --> 41:54.320
Uh, we are in this room feeling disappointed. Oh, oh

41:56.960 --> 41:58.960
Joy we are you're gonna say

42:00.240 --> 42:02.240
We are in this room

42:02.880 --> 42:04.880
wondering

42:04.880 --> 42:08.480
How are you doing this so well this week? No

42:08.800 --> 42:12.800
Because as we ran third and head home, I'm starting to think that people are gonna love this episode

42:12.800 --> 42:14.800
We didn't get uncomfortable

42:14.800 --> 42:16.160
Last week

42:16.160 --> 42:18.160
We are ready for the weekend

42:19.680 --> 42:23.520
But we don't have to come too soon because I'm much fun. We're having right now during work

42:27.200 --> 42:29.200
Andrew

42:31.280 --> 42:35.600
Yeah, we are wondering how much time is much time is left because we're worried that it's gonna end too soon

42:36.160 --> 42:38.160
We can go for an hour

42:38.880 --> 42:40.480
Okay

42:41.360 --> 42:44.560
Here you go for an hour now. I feel like we have to go for an hour

42:45.360 --> 42:47.360
Don't have to

42:49.840 --> 42:54.640
I better fucking book this commercial because I'm tired of feeling like I'm three steps behind everybody else right

42:56.080 --> 42:58.080
There's no way

42:58.080 --> 43:00.080
There's no way you're going to

43:01.440 --> 43:05.840
With the enterprise commercial did you ever see it on TV and was the person to the person I was

43:06.560 --> 43:10.960
I saw it the guy I don't even think had a mustache and I think it was a woman

43:15.280 --> 43:17.280
Oh, woman playing opposite

43:17.840 --> 43:19.840
Christ doesn't know

43:19.840 --> 43:21.840
Christian or Christian

43:21.840 --> 43:23.840
Christian with a K though

43:23.840 --> 43:24.640
Correct

43:24.640 --> 43:29.920
She's one of the most famous people on the face of the earth, so it's not one of those things of like oh, it's fine that I don't know this by heart

43:30.240 --> 43:37.680
However, I watched all the good place. I look her. She's great. He's great. I don't know her name super wall. I love her. I think she's great

43:40.320 --> 43:43.200
By the way, I just looked at his question so Jeffrey you were wrong

43:52.720 --> 43:54.720
We three in this room are feeling poisoned

44:00.320 --> 44:02.320
You

44:07.600 --> 44:11.680
It's like one of the main reasons people go into comedy is because they're actually not doing to on their personal life

44:12.560 --> 44:15.840
Yeah, and then it's like you can work through those emotions with comedy, but

44:16.800 --> 44:18.800
This is like my main

44:19.360 --> 44:27.520
My main thing comedy was right now and I like I show I try to be prepared every week. Obviously I'll drop the ball sometimes

44:28.480 --> 44:30.480
and

44:31.840 --> 44:36.000
You guys could have taken it at a different direction. You know you could have brought something to the table you could have been

44:36.880 --> 44:38.880
Like hey, it's all right, you know

44:39.440 --> 44:41.440
All right, you didn't bring anything

44:42.080 --> 44:44.080
But instead I was

44:46.320 --> 44:48.320
There's a 45 minute lambast

44:49.280 --> 44:51.280
There's a spit roast. It was a

44:53.280 --> 44:55.280
There's a spam bake

44:57.840 --> 44:59.520
You guys are no clam flakes

45:01.040 --> 45:03.040
So this is like

45:03.040 --> 45:05.040
misoobie

45:05.920 --> 45:12.400
You can't hear me now I'm talking to George. I've tuned you out. I think George is having trail mix

45:16.320 --> 45:19.200
Oh, he's uh, now he's still muted. Can you hear us now?

45:21.360 --> 45:23.360
Got it you can't

45:24.240 --> 45:25.600
This

45:25.600 --> 45:29.040
Might be the last episode of the show ever. Yeah, yeah

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
What's we are talking about

45:39.600 --> 45:41.600
We were uh

45:41.680 --> 45:44.080
We were talking about how this might be the last episode of the show ever

45:44.720 --> 45:46.720
Who say that every time

45:46.720 --> 45:48.720
This one was bad

45:50.160 --> 45:52.160
Should end right there

45:54.240 --> 45:56.240
You

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
That was a hit them original

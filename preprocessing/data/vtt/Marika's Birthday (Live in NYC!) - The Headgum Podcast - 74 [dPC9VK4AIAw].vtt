WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
We're all going to the theater.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
You want to come?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
No, I'm going to hang back.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
There's a couple more things I need to do.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Alright, see you there.

01:00.000 --> 01:15.000
I went to the mall pet store.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Set fucking salesman's like, what up?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
What's your budget?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
And I'm like, honestly, I don't know nothing about mall pet.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
He said, I got the one for you.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Follow me.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Ooh.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
It's too real.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Calm down me.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I don't need a windshield.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
But then I see, I can't be on two wheels.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Ain't down the cash.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
That's a hell of a deal.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
I'm headed.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
I'm found.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Who's up for the alley?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
To the top.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
In the street like valley.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Pulled up.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
More than to the valley.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
White walls.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
On the wheels like me.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
My crew is ill.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
And all we need is two foot wins.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Got gas in the tank.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Cash in the back.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
And a bad move.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
The rest of my face.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
I'm a lit nest.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Take that back for rock.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Kick gas.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
I'm a man backstage.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
You don't need a risk bag.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Don't.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Fuck a bus pass.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
You got a moped, man.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
She got my 288.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
All right, carry it.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
There we are.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Fums are using her dairy air.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Don't win up the west side.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
We're touring the air stop by.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Pipe place.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Don't fish to a hula.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Don't tell.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Don't tell.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Don't tell.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Don't tell.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Don't tell.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Don't tell.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Don't tell.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Don't tell.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Don't tell.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
She has her arms around your waist.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.660
You're the barelysekin',

02:27.660 --> 02:29.000
To your side.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.020
Burn and see the cleaner.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Don't tell.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Don't know.

02:53.000 --> 02:53.460
When they're on the streets,

02:53.460 --> 02:55.000
call them me the просто.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.960
I'm down town, show me it's what you get

02:58.960 --> 03:01.160
Cause I'll never forget

03:01.160 --> 03:05.400
Cause it's nothing yet until you're down town

03:05.400 --> 03:09.000
Have you bought guest history in the making?

03:09.000 --> 03:13.800
Brammercy Theater, New York, shitty?

03:15.800 --> 03:17.400
That was all I had.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.800
I spent $275 on that.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.200
Three days, 14 hours.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.800
But I can't do it all by myself, can I?

03:32.200 --> 03:34.800
That was easy. That was easy.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.400
Are you guys ready for some chaos?

03:41.400 --> 03:45.800
Who do you think is the furthest person that traveled to be here tonight?

03:47.000 --> 03:50.800
Oh, Sabrina! Oh my god, you came from Florida.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.000
Happy to hit that you're here.

03:54.200 --> 03:54.800
Sorry.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
Um, I brought some friends.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
You ready?

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
I picked these introsongs specific for the people.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Let's give it up for a mere schmoo-el-blumen.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
You had a birthday.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
You count on life.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
You come back now.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
You really don't mind.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
You had a birthday.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
You had a birthday.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Thanks.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Bad song, but I appreciate the warm entrance.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
I would actually appreciate it if the energy got a little more poison tonight.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
And we'll get there.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
Yeah, worse than you had a bad day as intro music.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Retroactively cursing the night.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
In a way. Yeah.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
In a way.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Yes.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
It's also a very mellow song.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
I had to walk out to that and like,

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
mid-fist bump it fell wrong.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Yes.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Right.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Right.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Yes, you agree.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
You think it's going to be as bad as I do.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
So we are on the same page.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Major's killer.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Board people, board people.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Right?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Sure.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
I guess.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
What about the other person people, man?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
I don't like this.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Let's bring it on our next guys.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
All right.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Give it up for Jacob Penn Cooper.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Oh, wow.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Thank you.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Not bad.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
I've been very long time ago.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
But did you come from ready?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
You go, ready?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
You come from Kathmandu.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Go, ready?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
You come from ready?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Go, ready?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Go, ready?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Go, ready?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Go, ready?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Go, ready?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Kathmandu.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Here we go.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Oh, yes.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Yeah.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
I resent that you didn't get up to greet me.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
I figured if I keep doing that,

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
it's going to be 20 minutes of intro.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Yeah.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
That's my fear.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Cool.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
That was rude.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
It was weird to be the second guy.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Is this for Jeff or first?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Yeah.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
He asked me to bring out his drink.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Yeah.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
You didn't even stand up to take it from me.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
You just played Cottonite Joe.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
And expected me to know the dance, which thankfully I did.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Yeah.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
You were practicing.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
You were practicing.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
We didn't talk about that.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
And let's get our last guest for the first segment.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Marika Brownlee, the birthday girl.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Oh, my God.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Oh, my God.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Oh, my God.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
That's how you greet it.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Yeah.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Let's show that in life.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Oh, my God.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Oh, my God.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Oh, my God.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Oh, my God.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Oh, my God.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Let's get this shit over with.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
The girl.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
What?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
So negative.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Look at no live show for two years.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
You say, let's do it.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
We shot the video this week.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
I've been in New York since last Friday.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Red Eye.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
It shouldn't have taken you that long.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
To shoot an MOS video.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
I'm sorry.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I said, you don't have to take a red eye.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
You came here a week early.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
I read eyes what people important people in a rush have to do.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
You have all the time in the world.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
You could have left it noon four, eight.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Nobody cares for you there or here.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
What are we all doing?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Goddamn.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Why do you listen to this show?

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
We sold out the grammar.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
We sold out the grammar.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
My God.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Pretty good.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Yeah.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Well, I guess we should just wax.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
No.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
No way.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
You have to have prepared something.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
You said you were worried the intro's would go too long.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
You said I'm going to cut the socks off early.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I'm worried the intro's will go too long.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Now you're segments, but we have to fill time.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Sure.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
By the way, seeing your soundboard is fucking perverted.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
We we organization to it.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
No, yeah.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
That was easy.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
That was easy.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
If you guys could see how many sounds are on the board,

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
it would be really impressive.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Too many.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
And I don't use half of them because some of them are bad.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Yeah.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Damn.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Damn you.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Back at it again with the wife.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
You used that one a lot.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah, I know.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
You should you have like 80.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
You used four.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
It should be on.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
But the ones you use a lot on one line.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Yeah, you're scanning.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
It's like third row from the left.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
They're all standing.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
All different colors for no reason.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Well, I'd like, it's like synesthesia, right?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
So for troll alone.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I was like, that's kind of like a light brown.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
You know what I mean?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
So I agree.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
For the shots.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Sorry.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
It was not the board.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
And that grammar scene was under a flame top.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Yeah.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Yeah.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Well, Manhattan, right?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Cheers.

09:10.000 --> 09:17.000
Let's get into the shit with everyone's bonds of the week.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Damn it.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
I was once a week till the next James Bond is cast.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
We're all going to pick a bond.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I really didn't prepare for that.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Really?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Yeah.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
No, everyone else can go for it.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
I've told everyone nothing.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
The only people that know the segments are people that aren't here tonight.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
So.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Right.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Right.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Yeah.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Bonds of the week.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Yeah.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Bunking.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Who cares?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Wesley Snipes.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
It has to be British.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
I don't listen to the fucking Joe.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Wesley Snipes is cousin.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Wesley Snipes.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Who's from Cardiff.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
That's right.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Let's do Ray Fines.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
So.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
What's that?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Yeah.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
What's in bond?

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
I haven't seen James Bond in probably 10 years.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
It's been.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Yeah.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
It's been like 15 years old.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
No.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
I thought it was Judy Dench.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Keesh.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
I can't afford her.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
She died.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Let's cut all of this out.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Yeah.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Yeah.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Keep looking.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
What's the ejector button?

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
This show isn't set up to be a live show because so much of it.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
That's how that's up to be a recording show.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
It's mostly awesome.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Let's get the energy out.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Let's all.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Can we all agree?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
One thing.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I only ask you this and then a couple other things.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
We all stand up and we shake it out.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
No.

10:48.000 --> 11:04.000
We all stand up and we shake it out.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
How long are we into this?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Do we have a timer, Mike?

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
It's so bad that that is going to cause the audience to applaud.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Good.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Good.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
They reset.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I think let's get into our first segment.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Are you guys ready?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Here we go.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Welcome to Ham or Spam.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
No fucking way.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
What do you mean?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Prepare it.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Yeah.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
So the game.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
You haven't even heard the rules yet.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Don't be mad already.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
I know the rules.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Then why don't you explain it?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
You're going to show us photos.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
We're going to guess if it's Ham or Spam or playing for cash.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Right?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
All right.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Lucky guess.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
A hundred dollars for every ride.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
A hundred dollars.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
We owe you for every wrong.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Is that about right?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Very good.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
He is.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
He is obviously.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
They're oddly good at keeping track of that.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Like, yeah, like eight minutes in.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
You're like, all right, I'm here.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
It's down 600.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Because nine hundred.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
And it's always accurate.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Yeah.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Well, like that about you.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Let's put it to the test right here.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
No buzzing in.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Just yell out the answer.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Ham.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Ham.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
It's ham.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
I mean, yeah.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
That would be a little harder than that.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
Spam is going to be a little crazier, fam.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
All right.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Jake is in the lead with a hundred.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
He did edgy out.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Marika by one.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Thank you.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
So I can hear we go.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Number two.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
You want it?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
You know what it is.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
It's crazy.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
It looks like pancakes.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
That's spam.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
All right.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Her wits is pulling ahead.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Cleaning house.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
That is absolutely spam.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I was thrown off by the slices.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Well, that should be the dead giveaway that it's spam.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Here we go.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
It gets harder.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
It gets harder.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Ham.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Really.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
That's so pixelated.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
You couldn't find a, like, a, a large bottle of either.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
It's zoomed in for sure.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
You're, you're looking for a sound.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
What are you going to play?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
It was a, it was ham.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
She said ham.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Oh, it was spam.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I meant.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
It doesn't fucking matter.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
It's all content.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
We have to put out a fucking episode next week.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
So here we are.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Mike's recording.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
We got Marie gets about round the on this axe.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
We got Mike home at day on the fact.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
What do we think?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Is that a different photo?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Ham.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Is it nice?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
I saw it.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
I saw it.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
It's like part of your body.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
I don't want to look anymore.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Ham.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Yeah.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
I think that's ham as well.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
That's correct.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
That was ham.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Marie can Brownlee has $200 or $100.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Sorry.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Get in to myself.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Jake has $200.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Here we go.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
I look at the door.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
We can see the, like, the, I would spam.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Because she's a label.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Kind of showed up.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
I named.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
That's the hybrid.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Yeah.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Yeah.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
300 to me.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
All right.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Fine.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
This is so fucked.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
I'm not even getting paid for this.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
I'll turn around.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
All right.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Here we go.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
That's, I think that's spam as well.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
That was a shame for a scene.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
I'll see you later.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
And I know that you have a page around that's really successful for a

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
nab bug.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
You don't need the money.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
It's Moorika's birthday today.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Happy birthday, buddy.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
Like don't let her win, but don't be an asshole.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I'm going to buy her something nice with my $400.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
From the buyer's spam with your $400.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
All right.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
This might be the last one.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I hope I'm actually impressed.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Ham or spam.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Ham.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Really?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
You have to look to make sure.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
All right.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
$200.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.800
Let's see if we can get it on this last one.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.000
This one's triple or nothing.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Here we go.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
That looks like Mars.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Spam.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
That's correct.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Very nice.

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
So you win with $500.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Thank you.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Yeah.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Yeah.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Always.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
It's not the most.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
It might be more.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
You said it was triple or nothing.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
You said like not really.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
$200.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
It's triple.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
I guess.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
I guess.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
You sure.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Somebody had Venmo's going to be so weird without looking at your history.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
Like this guy sends thousands of dollars and then gets it back within an hour to a day.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
What's this scam there?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
What's the Spam there actually?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
I'm just going to make sure that everybody knows.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Nice.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Thanks.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Can you just confirm?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
That this is real?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Confirmed that that's Marieka's name.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Yeah.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
500.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
I got it.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
No reaction.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
I do Venmo people.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Yeah.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Unfortunately.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
The only person who wasn't going to send money back was Caleb Heron.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
And I'd be begging.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Yeah.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
How fucked is that?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Yeah.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
I'm not going to grove.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
It sounds like you did.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Oh, I did.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
You said I had to beg him.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
Then you said I'm not going to grove.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Jake, I will eat your ass.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
All right.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
I should have started a timer because I don't know how long this shows.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
That's blocked right there.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
And there it is.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
So we're going to 15 minutes.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
We have five minutes to fill or we can move on.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
What do you guys want to do?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
I don't know.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
That's like an internal process that you should go through as a host.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
That's not a question that you asked out loud until my very good.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Yes, I know.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
That's very fond of the week to get to this segment.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Oh, you're like, what should we do?

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
We could go back to bond to the week.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Yeah.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
You did.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Which I guess was a spoiler.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
What about Randolph finds the explorer who circumnavigated

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
the globe in 2012?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
And I read his book.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Is he British?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Hmm?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Yes, he's British.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
The one rule you had?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Yeah, no, he is British.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
That's good.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Let's move on.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
All right.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
I was just joking.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I thought it would be funny.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Daddy, chill.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
Oh, it's quick.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I think we should move on to our next segment.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Sure.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
I mean, why are you asking us?

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
You told us that you...

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Everybody.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
All right.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
For this next segment, we're going to need Jake and Marika out of here.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Would you tell anybody from the soundboard, but...

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Finally.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Didn't have time.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
So you want us to just get up and leave?

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Why don't you get up and leave?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
And if you could go find...

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Yeah.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Yeah.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Yeah.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
One of you knows.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
I want to keep it a surprise.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Yeah, no, I know.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
And you know who to get.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Yeah.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Yeah.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
All right.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Thank you.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Let's take a look.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Let's take a look.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Do they know who to get?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Yes, they're right.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Let's do it.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Let's get the boy.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
You're going to have to say their name.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
They don't know.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Because he didn't tell.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Oh, let's get it.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Yeah.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
They know.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Yeah.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Jake's saying, I'm here we go.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Please welcome Danny Sellers.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
Johnny Miller.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Yeah.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Yeah.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Yeah.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
George Saba.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Everybody.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Everybody.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Just get into it.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Get snowed in my head.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Start.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Get started.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Let's get it started.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
All right.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
This is so...

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
This is the boys.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
This is the boys of Edgum.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Hey, man, brother.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Yeah.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Hell yeah.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
I don't work there.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Yeah.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Well, you're, you're sort of canon.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Yeah.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
I'm lower.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
I'm hanging out.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
And I like drink the spin drift.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Yeah.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
And the cool it.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Yeah.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
We got a company retreat.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
I brought you guys here for a very special reason.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I'm really excited about it.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Are you guys ready to play a game?

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Spam or Ham.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Here we go.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Welcome to.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Wow.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
They love it.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Yeah.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
This is Jeopardy.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
So this is Jeopardy.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
New York City Edition.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
So every category you see is related to the big apple.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
It was really worried it was going to keep going.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
So this category is our Captain Sully.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
All things Rockefeller.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Billy Joel's drafts.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Fair.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
And midtown hidden gems.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
I have to add a team.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Now.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Fair is cut this up.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Oh my god.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
All right.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Here we go.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Are you guys ready?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
This is for actual cash.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Every number you see on the board.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
It's winter takes all.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
But that is an amount of money that you could win tonight.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Are you guys ready?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
How to do it?

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Yeah.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
You could say buzz.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Or no.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
No.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Let's do something New York.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Thanks.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I don't want to play then.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
What?

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
I'm not going to buzz in person.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
That's the bar.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Yeah.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
I'm so much worse.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Shit on the show.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
I'll say.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Met.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
All right.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Sorry.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
I just touched New York sports.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
All right.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Yeah.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Just say.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Met.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Yeah.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I'm walking over here.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Oh.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
She and that child.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
That's a buzzing inward.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
You've never played a game.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
All right.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Let's start off with the guest of honor.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Danny Sellers.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
You control the board.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
Let's go with my dog Sully for $200.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Captain Sully for.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Are you sure?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
No.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
All right.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Captain Sully for $200.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
$200.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
No.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
No.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
No.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
No.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
No.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
No.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
No.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Without fail.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Not even skipping a beat.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Johnny goes meds and smiles so earnestly.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Yes.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Johnny.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
I feel like that's the year that movie that he was in released.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Well, he wasn't in it.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
It was Tom Hanks.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Mm.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Is that right?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
I also didn't answer.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Thanks.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Before you.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
That was wrong.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Yes, George.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
I didn't know there was a buzzer in there's an etiquette.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
I think it's the year.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Oh, what is the year that it happened?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
It's so close.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
That's so close.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Anybody?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
No.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Those are my two only two guesses.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
Everybody else is taking a complete shot in the dark.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Here we go.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
The correct answer was.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
What year did Sully turn 58?

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Nice.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Nice.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Yeah.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
I was about to say that actually.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
That was, yeah.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Only one guess per round, obviously, though.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
So for some reason, Johnny Villa controls the board.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
You're clicking on a button that's a spacebar.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Instead of using the spacebar.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
I think he could use the spacebar.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
That's hard.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
You know, because I have this one monitor here.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
It's connected.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
That doesn't even have my laptop.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
The biggest button.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Yeah.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
All right.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Johnny Villa controls the board.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I'll do fair for 200.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Really?

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
All right.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Fair for 200.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
Oh, this is perfect.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
A burger joint.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Johnny wouldn't dare step foot in.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Met.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
This Johnny?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Yes.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Oh, Danny.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Shake, shake.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
I want to give it to you.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Yeah.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
That's a good one.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Mm.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Yanks.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Yes, George.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
Uh, is it like something like in and out?

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Because Johnny doesn't live on the West Coast.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
You know what?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
That's funny.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
So I'll give you the cash for it.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
But that's not it.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
I've definitely never opened up to you about the burger joints I go to.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Okay.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Is it a burger joint called the burger joint?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Oh, wait.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Holy shit.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I actually think it is.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
I'll still give that to you.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
I'm here.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Where is burgers by honest chops?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
No.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
No.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
No.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
No.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Do you guys ever go to burgers by honest chops?

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Cool.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Is that a real place?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
No.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
I was like, I didn't think of it.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
All right.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Weirdly, we got two winners that round.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Um.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Either of what you've got to tell the board.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Okay.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Yeah.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
I'm trying to do without looking because my neck is starting to hurt.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Yeah.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
There's been a lot of turning this way.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Yeah.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Midtown's gems.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I think it's one of them for 100.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Okay.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Here we go.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Midtown hidden gems.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
A secret roundabout.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
Pull out my Google Maps.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
Yeah.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Can we have like a hint?

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Is this like a street or an intersection or something?

24:05.000 --> 24:12.000
Um, your hint is it's, uh, it's pretty gross.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Not a word.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
That's not a word.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
It's pretty awesome.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Oh, okay.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
I'll go yanks.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Yep.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
And Columbus Circle.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Holy shit.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Absolutely correct.

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
See, it's because it's because you lived here for so long.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Yeah.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
It's because I think you don't know what secret means.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
All right.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
And again, you can't just touch that space bar.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Let's go.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Hidden gems.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Yeah.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Which I'm starting to think are I hitting it all?

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
I will say pre-bucking clue.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
Yanks Empire State Building.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
Um, incorrect.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Um.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Yeah.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
No, because that's a tallest building almost.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Yeah.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
It was the tallest.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
And Columbus Circle is a huge circle.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
All right.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Let's see the 200.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
200.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
200.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Here we go.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Midtown Hidden gems.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
A museum worth seeking out.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
If you can find it.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
Yanks.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Yes, George.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Is the moment, Midtown.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Go!

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I don't, I don't know.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
I don't know.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
I don't know.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
It is not, not kind of neck and neck.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
You're just cleaning out.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
I'm sorry to say it.

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
Well, because I was better that you said Danny was the guest of honor.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
We glossed over it.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Sorry.

25:35.000 --> 25:40.000
No, it's fine.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Um, you control the board.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
If it's any consolation.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
No, it is.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
Uh, I'll take Billy Joel's drafts for 300.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
Billy Joel's drafts for 300.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
A tweet Billy didn't end up sending.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Is this the clue for all of them?

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
No.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
It should have been.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Again, George is punching up Jeffery.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Um.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
Uh, he's probably like, uh, touring in Chicago and he was going to be like,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I'm going to Chicago, stay to mind.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Uh, come see me at the bean.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Uh, November 4th.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Holy shit.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
What is well, this was two years ago,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
or last year, and so the show got canceled for him.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Um, here's the thing.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
You guys have to get your answers because I forgot what I wrote.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
Uh, uptown squirrel, and it's a picture.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Okay.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Nice.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Nice.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Uh, would I change my answer?

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Sorry.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Yes.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Yeah.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
I'm so sorry for seeing rolling you right now.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
I, you take your thing.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I'm so rude.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
Uh, you go.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
I feel like.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
No, mine is not.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
It's not good.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
You have to say it.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Every second that goes by where you don't say it is worse.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
Call me piano guy.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
He was right.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Is that your final wish?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Yeah.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
I think that actually might be closer to it.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
I do not remember what I wrote.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Danny, Johnny, get your final answers in.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
This is not how jeopardy works.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
This is final jeopardy in a way.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Yeah.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
In the middle of that.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
I was going to say damn, what is damn about this party's kind of thick.

27:17.000 --> 27:23.000
That also might be a Johnny, let's hear it.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
I can't say right or wrong for any of you.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
Uh, I think he wanted to tweet your perfect just the way you are,

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
but it was over the 140 character limit.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
It wouldn't have been.

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
What is just sour the day at a stranger's bris, AMA?

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
I honestly feel like Danny was the close.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Yeah.

27:43.000 --> 27:50.000
Johnny, you know I love you, man, but you got to step it up, man.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I'm not familiar with it.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
This isn't a hard game.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
It's just jeopardy.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
It absolutely is a hard game.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Also, jeopardy is famously hard.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Yeah.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
It's just jeopardy.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
It doesn't make it easier.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
Before you put your demented twist on it, it was already difficult.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Danny controls the board.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Oh, okay.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
Oh, I like old dead white men.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
All things Rockefeller 300, I guess.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
And you're fucking all things Rockefeller 300.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Here we go.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
Rockefeller's center.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Mets.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
What is Rockefeller's center?

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Mets.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
What is Rockefeller's center?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Mets.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Why do you torture us?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Mets.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
What is 30 rock?

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Mets.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Come on.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Gotta give me that one.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
I'm not gonna give it to you, man.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
You gotta earn your key.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Yanks.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
What is Rockefeller's millionaire's heart?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
I mean, that's not wrong.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
That's wrong.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
But it's the closest answer so far.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Danny?

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
Uh, what is Jay-Z?

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
The correct answer we were looking for is what is another name for John D. Rockefeller's

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Pooh.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
So, sort of a center of gravity.

29:04.000 --> 29:11.000
There's no way this is going worse than you thought it would.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
I thought you guys were gonna be going home with some serious key.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
So much that I moved over money for my savings.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
For this.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Here we go.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
George controls the board for no reason.

29:21.000 --> 29:27.000
Uh, I'll do, uh, I'm gonna, I want to redeem myself with Billy Joel Straps.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
So don't go over that for 200.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Here we go.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Billy Joel Straps for 200.

29:30.000 --> 29:36.000
I'll lyric Billy wrote down after a six hour delay at LaGuardia.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
A Yanks.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Yes, Danny.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Damn.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
It's still thick in here.

29:41.000 --> 29:46.000
Ah, that's incorrect.

29:46.000 --> 29:51.000
Again, all your answers are on the right.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
The hell is this?

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
You looked at the board as if you were going to push the space.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
No, you guys got a chance.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
This is crazy.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I don't know enough Billy Joel.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
400 people in the room and you are dead silent.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Give me nothing today.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
It's Billy Joel.

30:06.000 --> 30:11.000
He's sort of the Randy Newman of New York.

30:11.000 --> 30:17.000
I almost had you come out to I love LA.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
That's pretty good.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Yeah.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
Instead, you did I had a bad day.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
Because you had a bad day.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Any guess?

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Any guess it probably won't be right.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
We have to move on.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Or I'll just move on.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Here we go.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
What is, but at least it ain't Newark.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Is that a real lyric?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Is that a real lyric?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Is that a real lyric?

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
It didn't make it into a song because he couldn't work it out.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
You know, with the beats of it all, the rhythm.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Yeah.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
In the rhythm of a fly.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
I parked at LGA.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
I'm a ballet kid.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Just next one.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
Here we go.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I'm here to control the board.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Fair.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
100.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
All right.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
Jake's favorite halal.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Fair.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
100.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
Jake's favorite halal.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Well, it was fair.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
200.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
It was a burger joint.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Johnny wouldn't dare step into.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Right.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
What is halal guys?

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
In correct.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
It's actually Sammy's halal in the East Village.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Is this a real place?

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Yes.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
We got to move on pretty soon.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
So here we go.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
One guess each for all of these.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
We're going to do rapid fire.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Danny, you control the board.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
It didn't really jose.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
A song about losing power in Bushwick.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
This is a real song.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
No.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
I mean, yes.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Wait.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
It's not a draft.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
It's a song he wrote.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
So it's real.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
It's a final draft.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Yeah.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
But he didn't put it out.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Is that a screenwriting joke?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Don't touch me.

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
Anyone buzz in.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Walking in Memphis.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
No.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
It's actually.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
I've seen the lights go out on wake off.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
We don't know enough about you.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Yeah.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
Wait.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
What is it?

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Why?

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
Faris spliced it in like I did it perfect.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
All right.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
We got to move on.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
I don't know what else to say.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
We're running out of time here.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Here we go.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
George, you control the board.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
All things rock a failure 100.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
All things rock a failure 100.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Oh, this is perfect for you.

32:43.000 --> 32:48.000
A dish topped with a rich sauce of butter, parsley, and other green herbs and bread crumbs.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Yeah.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Yes.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Emily Nelson.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Thank you.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Thank you.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
This is real money, right?

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
Word of the absolute weed.

32:59.000 --> 33:08.000
That's a thousand dollars to George.

33:08.000 --> 33:13.000
The word was oysters.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
What was that a real weed?

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Why is this a real one?

33:17.000 --> 33:24.000
Everything else is like a dementive fucking dumbass riddle you came up with forty-five

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
minutes ago.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
And then this real question and answer.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
You just got to know to choose that one.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Yeah.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
It's intuition.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
I guess.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Absolutely intuition.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Here we go.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
George control the board.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Wait.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
You never showed the final answer.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
I'm sorry.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
I'm sorry.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Oyster's rock up.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Okay.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Yeah.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
I thought it'd be funny if you press space bar and it was like Columbus.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
I'm going to go with over two thousand dollars.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
I'm going to do Sally for three hundred.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Sally for three hundred.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
Doggy style.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Probably.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
What is Sally's favorite?

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Oh, I didn't buzz in.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Yes.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
Uh.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Gangs.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
What is Sally's favorite sex position?

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Go ahead.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
This is crazy.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
He's doing really well.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
How do you know that?

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
It's George Mitch with me.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
It's in the movie.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
All right.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
George controls the board again.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Here we go.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Fair for three hundred.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Fair for three hundred.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
A frank further with brawn enough for an entire bar.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
This is simple.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Yeah.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
He knows exactly what it is.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
You haven't been to this place.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
So I haven't been to a lot of places.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Anybody can buzz in.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Johnny and I have been.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Fuck.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
That was a hit.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Johnny, you have to run with it.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
That was easy.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
Yes.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Johnny, where have you been?

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
I don't know.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
I try to forget every time I hang out with George.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Let's go.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
I got one from the audience.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
Oh, yeah.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Is it?

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Is it not raised?

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
That's correct.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
All right.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Well, now you have to participate in the rest of it.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Because it's winter takes all.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
So here we go.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
It's feel free to yank or met.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
You work here now.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Yeah.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
That's our social media guy now.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
All right.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
You control the board.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
Is broadcast of.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Rockefeller 200.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
Rockefeller, all things Rockefeller for 200.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.680
A man topped with a rich sauce of butter, parsley, and other green herbs and breadcrumbs

35:23.680 --> 35:26.000
and baked or broiled.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Yanks.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Yes.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
What is Rockefeller's Rockefeller?

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
That's absolutely correct.

35:30.000 --> 35:38.000
You're just going on with, if you win.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Which I think it's actually impossible.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
You won.

35:41.000 --> 35:47.640
Well, let's see what happens in final jeopardy he might wager more than he's less these last two are triple or nothing

35:48.640 --> 35:50.640
You still control the board

35:50.640 --> 35:56.400
Midtown hens for a 300 midtown hens for 300 you can catch Johnny here on any given Sunday

35:59.360 --> 36:02.640
Metz yeah, is it a bar called any given Sunday

36:03.920 --> 36:05.920
Yanks yes

36:06.320 --> 36:08.320
Johnny's house

36:09.240 --> 36:16.080
Technically correct, but not with the answer Danny for 900. Yeah, yep, a tailor that is

36:16.960 --> 36:20.920
Really specific and dedicated to making clothes specifically for Johnny

36:21.480 --> 36:24.680
I'm gonna give you that one because it's actually

36:25.480 --> 36:27.480
Tiffany's

36:27.480 --> 36:31.480
Which is kind of a finger tailor soldier spy

36:31.480 --> 36:33.160
Oh

36:33.160 --> 36:39.620
Bigger tail is live in a Japanese, right? Like that's your ideal of a Tiffany's actually so feels like I'm also a little bit right if we

36:39.620 --> 36:46.280
Gage up the thing you've already won quite enough George last one here we go the Hudson one under Captain Sully

36:46.960 --> 36:49.440
Metz yes the Hudson River

36:52.000 --> 36:56.680
I'm gonna give you that one Johnny it's actually what's Sully oh fuck

36:56.680 --> 36:58.680
I

37:00.760 --> 37:02.760
Forgot that I changed it

37:03.320 --> 37:09.320
The right answer was what is Sully's favorite Kate, but you know I'll still give it to you Johnny this maybe next time we hang out

37:09.320 --> 37:11.320
You won't forget it on purpose

37:11.920 --> 37:13.920
This has been

37:19.040 --> 37:21.040
This

37:27.560 --> 37:30.720
George you could burn that I did send you a house dollars just now

37:35.880 --> 37:37.880
I was any what's your Venmo?

37:38.880 --> 37:41.560
You still haven't given it to me because you don't want me to have your personal information

37:42.280 --> 37:44.280
I've been for a check

37:44.920 --> 37:46.920
What's during is there like a chase near here?

37:48.760 --> 37:50.760
Probably yeah, all right

37:51.720 --> 37:53.720
You did send me a thousand dollars

37:54.280 --> 37:58.400
Yeah, and you can bend on the other all right, are you guys ready for some more guests?

38:00.520 --> 38:04.440
This is where things get hectic. I'm sorry to Mike. I'm sorry to the venue

38:04.440 --> 38:09.120
I'm sorry to everyone involved do we even have enough mics? We do not we're gonna share God. We're gonna share

38:09.120 --> 38:13.760
I thought it'd be fun to do a little New York versus L.A. Shabaz

38:14.720 --> 38:21.640
Right because we have our office here in Brooklyn. We have our office in L.A. Let's pit each other against each other

38:21.640 --> 38:26.560
Danny, you get over here. George you get over here and we're gonna introduce some more people here. We go

38:26.560 --> 38:29.760

38:54.320 --> 38:56.320
Johnny with a team

38:57.200 --> 39:03.200
Let's do four on one

39:04.720 --> 39:07.440
I can handle it. You saw how good I wasn't Jeopardy

39:18.080 --> 39:20.080
Again

39:20.720 --> 39:27.440
And the upstate fiend himself and you pile holy shit

39:29.360 --> 39:31.360
We got pile

39:33.600 --> 39:41.600
How did we afford pile we got Kyle bust down here via a gray-hound not I think

39:42.800 --> 39:48.280
Jeopardy was not chaotic enough. I wanted to do this. Yeah, you guys have no people

39:49.080 --> 39:55.080
Three mics we have no chairs one mic. Oh, oh, I'll very nice. Thank you

39:56.200 --> 39:58.200
This is fanfieroo

40:01.320 --> 40:03.320
All right, wow

40:04.520 --> 40:12.280
Everyone here was surveyed about each and every so actually not all of you only some of you and some of you aren't even on stage

40:13.240 --> 40:18.440
And we were asked specific if they were asked specific questions about your guys' personality you're knowing habits, et cetera, et cetera

40:19.080 --> 40:21.640
And basically this is family rude. So top

40:22.520 --> 40:25.640
314 answers on the board Danny can you just be my space bar guy?

40:30.520 --> 40:32.520
It's a big it's a bigger responsibility

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Oh my god

40:39.080 --> 40:44.040
This is not how I wanted this to go really you didn't plan this at all. So how did you think it would go such a

40:44.040 --> 40:47.240
Was a favor and how this is happening and let's do show question

40:49.080 --> 40:53.160
So he's more than the space bar guy. It's a little bit more involved. Maybe yeah. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it

40:54.120 --> 40:57.400
Ferris got this out here. I'll relieve you. I'll relieve you

40:58.040 --> 41:03.160
You can they have set yeah three mics and we have one then yeah here take this one

41:04.360 --> 41:08.520
All right, thank generous even on her birthday very nice. Let's go to one more time for Marie

41:08.600 --> 41:10.600
Because birth

41:13.080 --> 41:14.600
All right

41:14.600 --> 41:19.400
Top three hundred and fourteen answers on the board name something sour about Andrew Pile

41:20.600 --> 41:23.800
Can we raise hands? I don't know family feud works

41:24.920 --> 41:32.040
You had a you buzz you buzz cool. Now usually it's one family and they they keep naming shit until they get three

41:32.040 --> 41:37.080
X's and it goes to us so we can steal all right. Why am I explaining to the rules to you?

41:39.400 --> 41:44.280
Buzz you somebody buzzed in you buzz in okay name something sorry about Andrew Pile his dog is a lemon

41:44.760 --> 41:48.120
Liz lemon the dog. Okay. That's true. That's really good

41:49.960 --> 41:53.560
Show me dog and then I'm not gonna hit it because I know that's not on the board

41:57.080 --> 41:59.080
Best answer

41:59.080 --> 42:04.200
Yeah a dog name lemon would have been the perfect answer

42:04.760 --> 42:11.000
All right, can we can can we buzz can we all right buzz Pile is gonna go cuz it's about him. Okay, all right

42:11.000 --> 42:15.160
Can I ask one thing yes? I showed up tonight and you asked me to be on the show

42:15.960 --> 42:20.120
Like 20 minutes before it started my plan was what was the plan here?

42:20.120 --> 42:24.920
Were you just gonna have this entire thing about me and me not be here? Yes, you were gonna be in the audience

42:24.920 --> 42:28.120
And then I would probably you know me you do that sometimes

42:28.920 --> 42:33.080
All right well okay earlier I walked into the room and he said you have a seller personality

42:33.080 --> 42:35.080
So I'm gonna say personality

42:37.000 --> 42:41.320
You know what I'll I'll give you that under this category

42:45.320 --> 42:47.320
You're a little slutty

42:47.960 --> 42:49.960
All right

42:50.360 --> 42:55.080
All right, you guys now you guys control it right how does family if you're yeah they keep going until they get yes, all right

42:55.640 --> 42:59.880
He's been addictive. I'll give you that under the category rich, but not happy

43:03.800 --> 43:10.120
188 people yeah, that was the biggest audience answer these are real surveys

43:10.120 --> 43:15.000
We should say they only ask a hundred people, but that would have yeah come up with you ask me about the rules of the game

43:15.000 --> 43:18.440
We're playing on the show right all right no strikes keep it going

43:18.440 --> 43:22.600
I'd say his jokes are very sour. They kind of put people in a very sour mood

43:22.600 --> 43:25.240
Yeah, I'm gonna give you that one under the category kind of a red neck

43:28.440 --> 43:30.440
And then Maria come down and turn take it home

43:31.400 --> 43:37.960
I guess he's isolated up state so that's a sour way to be correct

43:37.960 --> 43:40.440
He had a child because you're supposed to

43:42.600 --> 43:44.600
That's not a good reason

43:45.960 --> 43:47.960
All right

43:48.360 --> 43:50.360
The next question is

43:52.120 --> 43:54.920
What about a mere rubs you wrong just so

43:55.880 --> 44:02.920
But yes, yes, that was yes, that was really fast. We should say you don't think about where do I start right?

44:03.560 --> 44:10.280
Should we do like character like physical stuff or you want to be like all I think because I would do it like appearance

44:10.280 --> 44:12.280
Yeah, sure

44:12.280 --> 44:14.280
Let's go to here and swear

44:14.280 --> 44:16.520
Oh, wait, no, that's actually his inexplicable

44:18.520 --> 44:20.520
222 surveys

44:20.520 --> 44:23.800
Yeah, okay, well, it's actually it's explicable because it's it's kind of you know

44:25.560 --> 44:27.560
Um

44:28.600 --> 44:35.160
All right, what is it final jet pretty or something going light and go down the line? Yeah, you go down the line or something

44:35.160 --> 44:39.160
Yeah, I'm gonna go with his pants or way too tight today

44:40.600 --> 44:43.480
Stained as well. That's incorrect, but it is true

44:45.800 --> 44:49.160
You know what it is, I'm here. It's that you've been working out. So you kind of have that thick ass now

44:50.120 --> 44:54.440
That's not true, but I'll take it as a comment

44:57.640 --> 45:04.520
Is it our turner it's I know it's down the line, right? Oh, yeah, if you got it wrong. Yeah, it's three x's three x three technically

45:04.840 --> 45:08.200
But the rules don't mean anything, so do you? Let's say I don't want to answer

45:09.480 --> 45:14.040
Okay, and top four answers on the board something that rubs you wrong about him. You're just so

45:14.040 --> 45:16.360
Oh, I thought something that rubs you wrong about yourself. Oh

45:17.320 --> 45:21.640
I guess I find it hard to fall back to sleep after I wake up in the middle of the night

45:22.920 --> 45:25.560
That is correct. Don't tell me more about my

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
That's not what the survey says

45:31.640 --> 45:33.640
Down the line. Yeah, all right

45:35.080 --> 45:37.720
Lately you're far you don't have to be like super

45:39.160 --> 45:44.200
Let her let her have the mic. I am I am let her go on the top. No, I want to hear this

45:44.760 --> 45:48.200
It's tough lately your farts are loud and smell

45:50.120 --> 45:52.120
That might fall under the category

45:53.320 --> 45:56.200
Can't work up to the the courage to propose to have it all

45:58.200 --> 46:00.840
Those two those two things are related. Yes

46:02.440 --> 46:05.720
I'm pushing her right in New York

46:05.720 --> 46:11.720
All right, so this is perfect. Yeah, but you thought pile would be here and those were four really nice things. Yeah, anyway

46:12.680 --> 46:13.720
Um

46:13.720 --> 46:15.720
Damn

46:16.600 --> 46:18.600
You guys are cold

46:18.600 --> 46:20.600
Down her eyes when you answer

46:21.800 --> 46:28.680
Um, I think sometimes your eye contacts inconsistent and like you you don't know where to look at me

46:32.040 --> 46:36.200
Yeah, he's cold personally. Yeah, that's yeah, you know what the touch

46:37.160 --> 46:38.200
That's

46:38.200 --> 46:45.240
I'll give you the issues. I don't I can't see it and somebody else needs to be controlling the survey. This is so fucked up

46:47.080 --> 46:50.840
And then yeah George why don't you Danny just say anything

46:52.280 --> 46:54.280
I think his overall professional vibe

47:01.160 --> 47:03.160
Home owning jackass

47:06.520 --> 47:07.800
Hmm

47:07.800 --> 47:09.800
It's kind of interesting

47:10.200 --> 47:16.360
Because it's someone that I I consider you and I kind of close but seeing these all in a row. It's like

47:17.160 --> 47:19.800

48:36.840 --> 48:38.840
I want to say to

48:41.800 --> 48:43.400

I'd like to rescind my previous comment because my parents are listening all right

49:03.160 --> 49:08.760
LA you guys are doing this right? I feel like we got it so we controlled the boy

49:08.760 --> 49:11.720
Fine, yeah, you don't control the board or whatever do that thing down the line

49:11.720 --> 49:16.040
That's the one yeah, so we'll start with Andrew. Yep. You have no idea what you're doing. You don't know Johnny at all

49:17.560 --> 49:18.840

Think you should still open up. They love it. I know it. I don't want to say anything to I'll say rimming and that's okay

49:52.280 --> 49:54.280
In hopes that they don't know what it is

49:55.800 --> 49:57.800
Notary public role plan exactly right

49:59.240 --> 50:01.240

Forgot to create a final round

50:43.240 --> 50:47.800
No, I did this is thing I had it on my other laptop and then because of the tech of the theater

50:47.800 --> 50:50.120
We had to switch the laptops out. I see so

53:24.520 --> 53:27.960

53:28.760 --> 53:30.760
Anyway, hello 10 man

53:32.040 --> 53:38.840

53:38.840 --> 53:43.480
Can we get a chance for Tanner? That's not a good example because you know each other

53:43.480 --> 53:47.880
We need a stranger to call the number. Well, we got a we got a stranger to call. Yeah, and then we're technical

53:47.880 --> 53:49.880

53:50.520 --> 53:56.200
I'm getting a lot of calls. Your phone is fucked up. Yeah, I'm reacting. I thought you were gonna be angry. I

53:56.760 --> 53:59.800
Am angry, but you know, I do want the conversation

54:02.600 --> 54:04.600
That's so dark

54:06.200 --> 54:08.200
Full steam ahead

54:09.080 --> 54:11.720
We have five or minutes. I think we should do plugs

54:12.440 --> 54:17.080
Why what's that there were so many people that were on stage that didn't get a plug chance. That's true

54:17.240 --> 54:23.320
It's just if we everybody got a plug and I'd be here the whole night. Why why for a live show are we doing this is you know

54:23.880 --> 54:32.360
All I've had tonight is sour poison vitriol from the 20 of the people on the headgum team

54:32.360 --> 54:38.760
And I'm not gonna fucking have it actually these people came to hear gold and you provided them mold

54:39.720 --> 54:40.920
Wow

54:40.920 --> 54:45.880
Wow, you think if 20 people are mad at you that we gave them the mold

54:46.120 --> 54:52.680
Did you give them the 100% you gave them also you think gold is me saying my Instagram handle for these people to

54:53.240 --> 54:59.640
Follow me after the show structure to work within you say a structure you didn't have final fucking family room

55:00.200 --> 55:02.200
There's no structure

55:02.200 --> 55:04.200
There's no structure

55:04.200 --> 55:06.200
We say anything

55:06.200 --> 55:11.400
I'm not gonna have it. Can we take you out to a lot of things? What's that? I don't think you have two laptops

55:11.560 --> 55:16.600
You said you messed up because you switched your laptop, but we don't sort of blame over either way

55:16.600 --> 55:20.200
Didn't have the final round. Yeah, I think you never had it right

55:21.400 --> 55:23.400
You're mold

55:24.600 --> 55:26.600
Yeah, you're fired

55:26.600 --> 55:29.800
Really, yeah, oh my god. Yeah, you can technically do that

55:30.200 --> 55:32.040
Weirdly the weird loophole

55:32.040 --> 55:38.280
Yeah, of course like so many this company's structure. Yeah, fucking weird Sphere. I sure like God

55:38.440 --> 55:42.920
I don't have any shares. Yeah, yeah, I divided them up freaking do that

55:44.120 --> 55:46.120
Oh

55:46.120 --> 55:51.400
No, wait that chant was broken. This is not a big start and I won't honor it

55:53.320 --> 55:55.320
You miss that thought

55:55.320 --> 56:00.280

56:03.480 --> 56:06.200
Right, this has been an unbelievable showing

56:07.160 --> 56:12.520
I really didn't think we were gonna even sell out the floor of this show really yeah, and don't worry

56:12.520 --> 56:15.160
We won't sell out the next one now that they've seen it right

56:15.400 --> 56:19.720
Yeah, we'd have to go city to city. I think we can't do the same one twice

56:20.280 --> 56:25.320
Don't tell your LA friends that it went this way because we're trying to do one in LA

56:25.320 --> 56:31.240
We're also gonna add artificial laughter throughout so if you sort of hear that it's a good time and through AI

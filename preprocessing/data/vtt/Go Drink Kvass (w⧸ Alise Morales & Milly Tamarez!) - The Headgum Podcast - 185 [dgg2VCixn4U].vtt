WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
Music

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
Music

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
Music

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Right! Are you kidding me?

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
New head-gum podcast alert. We're going straight into it.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
I mean, what other way to introduce you guys?

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
Host of Go Touch Grass, the newest head-gum podcast,

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
then with a luncheon learn.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Oh my god.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Wow.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
So, you know, I just wanted to welcome you guys to the network.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Obviously, we're a pretty tight-knit group.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
All the hosts, no each other.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
All the hosts are really good friends.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
And so, to sort of foster that camaraderie,

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
I thought they maybe we could all break bread together.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Right? We could all have lunch.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
We could all learn.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
We could do a lunch and learn.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Learn about each other over lunch.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
So, I got y'all clams casino?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Just moments ago.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
A plate of clams was put before.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
A foil tray of clams.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Who says no to that?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I'm not.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
I actually might, because I do not eat.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Millie doesn't eat seafood.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
But that's the case.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Aw, too old.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
I don't know, Millie.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Are you allergic to it?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
No, I just...

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
It's not my thing.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
It's not my twist.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
As long as no one's going to die and learn.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
No one's going to...

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Imagine if I'm like, definitely allergic.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
And I can't even be in the same room.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Well, no, it's not that.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
It's not that.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
That's good.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Well, why don't we all take a moment.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Meryka, do you want to grab some sparks?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Or...

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Can you answer?

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
I have a lot of questions before I consider eating.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
I'm going to grab my lunch.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Really?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Yeah.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
I'm going to grab my lunch.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
I'm also going to get you guys up on this TV screen.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
So that I'm not staring down.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And people are seeing my eyes have heard it down.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Like, I'm ashamed of something.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Because I've nothing to be ashamed of.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
I just gave you guys a clamp casino.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
No, there's nothing to be ashamed of.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
You just...

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
You just served us a tinfoil tray full of clams.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Definitely.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Really potent smelling clams.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
I mean, that's smoke.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
They smell good.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Are the clams in the shot?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Okay.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Can the audience get eyes on these clams?

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Where did you order the clams from, Jeff?

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Or you can't answer because you're not by a microphone.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Of course.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
So in the last 30 minutes, I'll have drank a butter beer from the Harry Potter store.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
And then I'm going to eat kind of random clams.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
And then we'll see what happens to me.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Yeah, absolutely.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Later today.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Literally.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Well, I was going to suggest we eat Indian food after this.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
But I don't know if you're piling a lot.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Yeah.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
We're piling a lot on top of each other.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Yeah.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I mean, it's nice of you to even consider eating them to be honest.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
You know, America.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I don't know how you wrote with things.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
But you got to...

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
We need a little bit more of a yes and some for sure for sure.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
And you got to...

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
And that is so fun.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
When you say yes and...

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
I said no.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
But she said no.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
But I don't agree with her.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Because I don't.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
In general.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Whatever.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
But if it was, let's say a chicken wing.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
I'm saying.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Yes.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Clam.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Nice.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Nice.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
And you know, I mean...

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
I feel like this is pretty relevant because we just had a topic.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
I mean, it's on our background.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
But, you know...

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
A woman who ate 48.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000

05:05.480 --> 05:05.500
Ons.

05:05.500 --> 05:11.500
Okay. As a result of knowing we were coming on the show. I think Millie's coming in cold. I think I'm coming in cold like now

05:11.500 --> 05:13.500
I'm now I'm two for two

05:13.500 --> 05:18.000
I'm like not eating seafood and also never heard hearing the

05:18.000 --> 05:20.500
Millie's like where are we? What year is this?

05:20.500 --> 05:22.500
We have a podcast.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.500
Yeah.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.500
At least just like trails me around.

05:26.500 --> 05:27.500
Sit down, Millie.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.500
It's gonna be here.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.500
Okay.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.500
Be here at this time and bring your takes.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.500
Okay.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.500
So there's Millie body around and then there's Millie sitting down.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.500
Wow.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.500
Wow.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.500
I'm like good, right? Not great but kind of good.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.500
And that's kind of what the podcast is.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.500
Yeah.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.500
Is kind of just saying stuff like that.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.500
Oh, okay.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.500
That's what had gone by.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.500
I'm a good person.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.500
Honestly is that what this show is is I'm well,

05:50.500 --> 05:52.500
at least would you say that I'm the exact same person

05:52.500 --> 05:54.500
off air than I am on this show?

05:54.500 --> 05:56.500
I would say yes.

05:56.500 --> 05:57.500
Well, don't say that.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.500
Don't say that.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.500
I was hoping you'd be like, no, you're actually the same

06:00.500 --> 06:02.500
top of the show and then on the air you're kind of an asshole.

06:02.500 --> 06:03.500
I was going to say yes.

06:03.500 --> 06:07.500
I was going to say before we before we recorded.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.500
Oh, for sure.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.500
Before we recorded, I was telling everyone that you came

06:11.500 --> 06:13.500
at me for having an apple watch.

06:13.500 --> 06:14.500
Told me I should get rid of my apple watch.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.500
Told me you were going to give me a Rolex watch and then

06:16.500 --> 06:18.500
here I am Rolex.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.500
To this day.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.500
Cool.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.500
I don't have a Rolex to give.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.500
If I had one, I'd have to keep it.

06:25.500 --> 06:29.500
But you were trying to persuade me to toss my gorgeous apple watch,

06:29.500 --> 06:30.500
which counts my step.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.500
Yes.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.500
Yeah.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.500
For a watch that didn't even exist.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.500
It wasn't even in your possession.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.500
So I would say that you bring the same chaos on and off.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.500
Oh, car.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.500
Oh, car.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.500
Oh, car.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.500
I'm getting to listen.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.500
I'm learning.

06:44.500 --> 06:45.500
Oh, I'm not lunch.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.500
But I'm learning.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.500
What is this?

06:48.500 --> 06:49.500
Right?

06:49.500 --> 06:51.500
This is so fucked up.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.500
What is that?

06:53.500 --> 06:55.500
The TV turned on.

06:55.500 --> 06:56.500
Yeah.

06:57.500 --> 07:02.500
What are you watching?

07:02.500 --> 07:05.500
It's like a British thing.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.500
This is so fucked.

07:07.500 --> 07:10.500
We need to have a producer in the room with me.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.500
You can't host and produce at the same time.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.500
Especially when they keep changing the studio up on me.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.500
Usually there's a desktop computer running an audition session.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.500
It's just miraculously gone today.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.500
And then I have to come in with 20 minutes advance.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.500
And I have to figure out how else to do it.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.500
It's.

07:29.500 --> 07:30.500
I'm sorry.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.500
That happened to you.

07:31.500 --> 07:32.500
It's all right.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.500
But then I look like a fucking amateur in front of Millie.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.500
I'm not going to have it.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.500
I'm going to have Millie thinking that it's my fault.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.500
He's not an amateur.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.500
He's not.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.500
Okay.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.500
Well, I don't know where to throw out.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.500
At least everything.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.500
All right.

07:45.500 --> 07:46.500
He's a climator.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.500
He's a climator.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.500
You know what?

07:49.500 --> 07:51.500
I have not had a climator.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.500
You said you were supposed to ask.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.500
Answer.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.500
Marica's question.

07:55.500 --> 07:56.500
Yeah.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.500
Oh, sorry.

07:57.500 --> 08:00.500
I wanted to know where the where they came from.

08:00.500 --> 08:01.500
Well, restaurant.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.500
Those are going to be in from.

08:03.500 --> 08:08.500
And I do have to say that I ordered these last night as I was outlining the episode.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.500
Those came to us from.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.500
I think a restaurant called Savil.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.500
Oh, okay.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.500
That's like kind of a fancy restaurant.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.500
Yeah.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.500
I missed.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.500
It was Doc's oyster bar.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.500
Okay.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.500
No one knows where these clams came from.

08:25.500 --> 08:26.500
Yeah.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.500
That said you ordered them last night.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.500
Yeah.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.500
That was a pretty order.

08:29.500 --> 08:30.500
Yeah.

08:30.500 --> 08:31.500
I think it has to be a pre-order.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.500
Exactly.

08:32.500 --> 08:33.500
Right.

08:33.500 --> 08:34.500
So I had to have the force.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.500
That's why that's why you texted me last night.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.500
What's the sweet and I'm glad you're on this episode.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.500
I thought you were on the one at three p.m.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.500
I thought that a mirror was going to be on in studio here with me.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.500
So Emma could have read the description.

08:46.500 --> 08:49.500
Well, you know, it's hard because we're banking episodes.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.500
Have you guys been banking episodes?

08:50.500 --> 08:52.500
Do you want to talk about the show for a bit?

08:52.500 --> 08:53.500
Go touch grass?

08:53.500 --> 08:54.500
Um, yeah.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.500
Actually, we don't think episodes.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.500
Um, because it's a weekly podcast.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.500
Yeah.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.500
So we talk about different.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.500
We talked about trending topics.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.500
Viral memes.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.500
The discourse.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.500
Yes.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.500
Online.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.500
You know, if people on Twitter are yelling at each other.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.500
We'll tell you why they're yelling at each other.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.500
What was the first post?

09:14.500 --> 09:17.500
What was the post that kicked off everybody yelling at each other?

09:17.500 --> 09:21.500
Why are two influencers you've never heard of fighting with each other?

09:21.500 --> 09:23.500
These are the things we'll break down on the podcast.

09:23.500 --> 09:27.500
And because it's so topical, we cannot bank.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.500
Yeah.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.500
So we have done a bunch of test episodes that are on our Patreon.

09:31.500 --> 09:35.500
So people can go back and hear like the past couple of weeks worth of discourse.

09:35.500 --> 09:40.500
And it is good to like, you can miss and like come back and come back.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.500
Yeah, and come back.

09:41.500 --> 09:46.500
It's not like you're, you know, if you don't know what who being that is, you won't.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.500
Yeah.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.500
Yeah.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.500
That information remains valuable.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.500
Yeah.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.500
Years into the future.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.500
Did you say you don't know who being, who's being that is?

09:55.500 --> 09:56.500
Being dad.

09:56.500 --> 09:57.500
No.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.500
Being dad.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.500
Being dad.

09:59.500 --> 10:00.500
Being dad.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.500
Being dad.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.500
Who's being dad?

10:02.500 --> 10:03.500
Okay.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.500
So he.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.500
Yeah.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.500
Being dad is this dad.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.500
Yes.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.500
He had beans.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.500
Well, his daughter wanted beans.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.500
Yes.

10:11.500 --> 10:12.500
This.

10:12.500 --> 10:13.500
This.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.500
This.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.500
And the dad's daughter wanted beans.

10:16.500 --> 10:17.500
Yes.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.500
And the dad.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.500
And the dad.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.500
And there's a kind of beans.

10:21.500 --> 10:22.500
Okay.

10:22.500 --> 10:28.500
And the dad tweeted kind of his long thread being like, I want to teach my daughter to be self-sufficient.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.500
So I will not open the beans for her.

10:30.500 --> 10:34.500
So I want her to try to figure out how to open this kind of beans herself.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.500
And it started a long.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.500
Well, I'm telling her about the can open.

10:38.500 --> 10:39.500
I don't think.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.500
Yeah.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.500
I don't think.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.500
This is a little girl.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.500
Yeah.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.500
I think there is a can opener.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.500
And but he didn't tell her how to use it.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.500
No.

10:49.500 --> 10:50.500
He was like.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.500
And he said she couldn't use the internet.

10:52.500 --> 10:53.500
What?

10:53.500 --> 10:54.500
Or something like that.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.500
Yeah.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.500
So it's efficiency.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.500
Why are something like that?

10:57.500 --> 10:58.500
Yeah.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.500
So.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.500
And then it started a whole discourse.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.500
I'm like.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.500
Is this guy an asshole?

11:02.500 --> 11:05.500
What does it mean to teach you guys self-sufficiency?

11:05.500 --> 11:06.500
Yeah.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.500
Yeah.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.500
I mean, teaching his daughter a valuable lesson by withholding beans from her until she can get them.

11:11.500 --> 11:12.500
Yeah.

11:12.500 --> 11:16.500
Of course, as everything does, there were some racist tweets.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.500
Yeah.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.500
Yeah.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.500
Like you dig into, then everyone's like, who is this guy?

11:21.500 --> 11:25.500
And they go down and he has a difficult history.

11:25.500 --> 11:28.500
So these are the things that we talk about.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.500
So you should have just opened that can of beans.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.500
Open the can of beans.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.500
Yeah.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.500
And these are the can of the pot.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.500
Wow.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.500
Exactly.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.500
That's the kind of stuff you're going to get on the head.

11:37.500 --> 11:38.500
Go and podcast.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.500
Millie.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.500
Let's dive into your past.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.500
What's the best thing that's ever happened to you?

11:44.500 --> 11:47.500
Wow.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.500
Jesus Christ.

11:49.500 --> 11:53.500
We can circle back to this.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.500
If you want to move on to our first segment.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.500
Let's move on to the first segment.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.500
Because now I'm thinking.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.500
And not like this.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.500
This is watching.

12:01.500 --> 12:02.500
This is like, wow.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.500
We really have to work.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.500
It really goes from technical difficulties to personal truth.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.500
I'll say I'll keep it easy.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.500
I'll keep it light.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.500
I love my dog.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.500
I'm the best thing that happened to me was that I got a dog.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.500
My dog is very sweet and quarterly.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.500
And he's the best and worst thing.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.500
He doesn't.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.500
Millie doesn't very cute dog.

12:21.500 --> 12:22.500
My dog is very cute.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.500
His name is Tina.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.500
So Tina's the best thing of late that happened.

12:25.500 --> 12:29.500
A financial drain and emotional gain is the dog.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.500
The first thing.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.500
I would say emotional drain as well.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.500
But also.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.500
Yeah.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.500
As a emotional gain and drain.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.500
Oh, really.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.500
Yeah.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.500
Are you guys hearing the sound effects?

12:42.500 --> 12:43.500
No.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.500
No.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.500
No, I am more.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.500
Okay.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.500
You're just going to have to roll with it.

12:50.500 --> 12:54.500
And I do want someone to eat the clam because you know.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.500
I'm.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.500
I'm looking.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.500
I'm like.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.500
Do I want to be filmed eating a clam?

12:59.500 --> 13:01.500
That's kind of where my head is at.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.500
Is that on?

13:02.500 --> 13:05.500
Is do I want to be on clamora?

13:05.500 --> 13:06.500
Wow.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.500
I'm in faith.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.500
I'm in faith.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.500
I'm in that head.

13:09.500 --> 13:10.500
You could like.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.500
Dig into it on the train.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.500
Yeah.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.500
You're hearing it.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.500
Bond of the week.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.500
Uh, Daniel Craig is out his bond.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.500
He has been out as bond.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.500
He had his time as bond.

13:23.500 --> 13:28.500
So we've been doing this long running segment that everybody hates on this show called

13:28.500 --> 13:31.500
Bond of the week where every week until the next James is cast.

13:31.500 --> 13:35.500
We're lobbying up our casting decision for the next 007.

13:35.500 --> 13:41.500
Uh, this week my pick is Benny Blanco.

13:41.500 --> 13:42.500
Wow.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.500
That really ties into.

13:44.500 --> 13:45.500
Yeah.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.500
We just discussed on our podcast.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.500
Right.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.500
We discussed Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.500
Topical.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.500
Selena Gomez needs to.

13:51.500 --> 13:52.500
She's not off.

13:52.500 --> 13:53.500
Yeah.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.500
Yeah.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.500
We sort of behave like Benny needs to log off.

13:56.500 --> 14:01.500
He's got a behaving like Benny Bondo because he's got the bond girl.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.500
He's got someone.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.500
Okay.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.500
Let's see.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.500
Let's see.

14:05.500 --> 14:06.500
Um.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.500
Is that what a bond girl is?

14:08.500 --> 14:11.500
There's someone out of your league.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.500
I'm asking.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.500
I guess it's it.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.500
But like do you feel like the bond girls are out of James Bond's league?

14:18.500 --> 14:19.500
Of course.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.500
You think Pierce Brosman doesn't chance?

14:21.500 --> 14:22.500
With fucking hell.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.500
Yeah.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.500
He actually, yes.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.500
Really?

14:25.500 --> 14:26.500
Yeah.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.500
He actually has a major chance at my house.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.500
I can't think of a bond.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.500
I wouldn't fuck.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.500
Even though it was Jason Stratman.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.500
No.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.500
He wasn't.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.500
I don't have an encyclopedic knowledge of bonds.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.500
But I'm actually thinking and I think I would.

14:42.500 --> 14:43.500
I would bang them off.

14:43.500 --> 14:44.500
Yeah.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.500
Yeah.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.500
For sure.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.500
No one knows what you're talking about Jeff.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.500
Wow.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.500
She does.

14:49.500 --> 14:53.500
It's clear that a woman's perspective.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.500
Oh.

14:54.500 --> 14:55.500
Yeah.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.500
Yeah.

14:56.500 --> 14:57.500
You know what?

14:57.500 --> 14:58.500
What else makes a bond girl?

14:58.500 --> 14:59.500
What else?

14:59.500 --> 15:02.500
A makeup line?

15:02.500 --> 15:04.500
Two all bond girls have makeup lines?

15:04.500 --> 15:06.500
Who's a bond girl who has a makeup line?

15:06.500 --> 15:09.500
Well, you're saying Selena Gomez is a bond girl.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.500
Oh.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.500
How do you know what makes a bond girl?

15:12.500 --> 15:13.500
Rare.

15:13.500 --> 15:14.500
Yeah.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.500
Wow.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.500
Yeah.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.500
Okay.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.500
Beauty is the name of Selena Gomez's.

15:19.500 --> 15:20.500
She.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.500
Make a bond.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.500
So.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.500
Rare.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.500
She's rare.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.500
And that's why we're upset that she's with Benny Blanco.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.500
Well, I feel like.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.500
I hear.

15:31.500 --> 15:32.500
I hear your segment.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.500
But I'm like a bond girl.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.500
Just like James Bond has an air of mystery to her.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.500
You don't know what her intentions are.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.500
You don't know where she came from.

15:41.500 --> 15:46.500
Why is this sexy, hot ass woman who's exotic in the middle of.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.500
Like the glacier in fact in Russia.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.500
Yeah.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.500
A lot.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.500
Whatever.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.500
And I will say that Selena Gomez is.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.500
There's not much mysterious about her.

15:56.500 --> 15:59.500
There's not much mysterious about her.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.500
I mean, all of her like responding comment.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.500
There's a, there's a zoom delay.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.500
I'm so sorry.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.500
No.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.500
Yeah.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.500
I, well, just their back off.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.500
I don't think she's a bond girl.

16:10.500 --> 16:11.500
I think she's a respond girl.

16:11.500 --> 16:12.500
Wow.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.500
That's really good.

16:14.500 --> 16:15.500
That's really good.

16:15.500 --> 16:19.500
I'm already feeling like y'all are going to be regular guests on the show.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.500
Because that was such a.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.500
I love that.

16:22.500 --> 16:25.500
Honestly, that was a really funny joke.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.500
I'm sorry.

16:28.500 --> 16:29.500
Sorry.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.500
I really like that.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.500
Do you guys have bonds of the week?

16:33.500 --> 16:37.500
Who would you love up this week as your casting decision for James Bond?

16:37.500 --> 16:38.500
I have a bond.

16:38.500 --> 16:39.500
Okay.

16:39.500 --> 16:45.500
I'm saying, you know, if we're talking about bond and who would be fun and interesting to do the movie.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.500
I'm saying Michelle, yo.

16:47.500 --> 16:52.500
I feel like I'd love to see her on some spy shit like.

16:53.500 --> 16:58.500
And I think it'd be adding some different things because again, it's unassuming.

16:58.500 --> 17:04.500
I think there's a lot of things right now in media talking about like women.

17:04.500 --> 17:12.500
Like people using their like blindness of like women to like let women slip through shit.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.500
You know, I'm thinking like made December.

17:14.500 --> 17:18.500
It's like basically all about like white women being predators.

17:19.500 --> 17:25.500
So I'd be fun to see like, yeah, no one is really paying attention to like an older Asian woman.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.500
And she's like, she's like, I'm actually James Bond.

17:28.500 --> 17:29.500
She's she's actually.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.500
And you know she can do those stunts.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.500
She can do all the stunts.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.500
So I love that.

17:33.500 --> 17:34.500
Michelle, yo.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.500
I would that would be the bond.

17:36.500 --> 17:41.500
I'm going to keep on the you brought up made December and my mind immediately went to.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.500
I would say one of the performance of the year, Charles Melton.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.500
Woo.

17:45.500 --> 17:46.500
That was her.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.500
He would be a very if he's very sexy.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.500
Very sexy.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.500
Very sexy.

17:51.500 --> 17:57.500
And, um, you know, that I feel like that would be a huge cap for him because it's like he did Riverdale.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.500
He's done the teen thing.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.500
Yeah.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.500
Because he's done this like prestige movie.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.500
And then it's like now you go be James Bond.

18:03.500 --> 18:07.500
I feel like he's hit all the all the pillars action star.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.500
Legit actor teen heartthrob.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.500
I mean, you can do anything.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.500
Bring him jingle jangle on that.

18:14.500 --> 18:17.500
On that show and like it was getting real.

18:17.500 --> 18:20.500
I mean, heartthrob, I'm like, that show was was okay.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.500
Yeah.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.500
Yeah.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.500
I mean, I only did like one season.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.500
But it was chaotic.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.500
No, it got even crazier.

18:29.500 --> 18:32.500
They were time traveling right there.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.500
Yeah.

18:33.500 --> 18:37.500
There's a part where like Archie joined ISIS or something like that.

18:37.500 --> 18:41.500
Like there's definitely there was definitely the cult run by what's his face.

18:41.500 --> 18:42.500
I don't know.

18:42.500 --> 18:46.500
No, the like weird cult in the woods or whatever.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.500
It's like class Chad Michael Murray.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.500
Oh, God.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.500
Chad Michael.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.500
Listen.

18:51.500 --> 18:52.500
Yeah.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.500
Bond Michael Murray.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.500
I've almost loved him up before.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.500
Okay.

18:56.500 --> 18:57.500
Wow.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.500
Almost loved him up.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.500
For.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.500
He's almost suggested him.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.500
Oh, okay.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.500
Okay.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.500
Yeah.

19:05.500 --> 19:06.500
So I'll say Charles Mountain.

19:06.500 --> 19:07.500
Those are both really good.

19:08.500 --> 19:09.500
Ultimately, I think I'm on the week.

19:09.500 --> 19:10.500
It's going to be this trip.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.500
Clams.

19:11.500 --> 19:12.500
Cause it could be like.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.500
Clams.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.500
Cause seen a rail.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.500
Wow.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.500
That's really good.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.500
That's really good.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.500
And they get better with it.

19:19.500 --> 19:20.500
Wow.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.500
I don't know.

19:21.500 --> 19:22.500
I don't know.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.500
I don't know.

19:23.500 --> 19:24.500
Clams.

19:24.500 --> 19:25.500
I don't know about that.

19:25.500 --> 19:29.500
But they are mysterious because, you know, you didn't really come down one way or another

19:29.500 --> 19:30.500
about where they came from.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.500
You said two different restaurants.

19:32.500 --> 19:33.500
Yeah.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.500
We don't really know what they did.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.500
We don't know what they did.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.500
We do have to move on.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.500
We do actually have to move on a little bit.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.500
Oh, okay.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.500
I don't like this.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.500
And I don't want to take it.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.500
We don't want to take it.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.500
It's a bitzy spider went.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.500
When up the water spout.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.500
Well, imagine he wasn't on my car.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.500
It's a bitzy.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.500
And he went on your big toe.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.500
Which caught him.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.500
No.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.500
And the doctor went.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.500
Holy.

19:57.500 --> 20:01.500
And that's not what you expect to hear from a doctor.

20:01.500 --> 20:02.500
Yeah.

20:02.500 --> 20:07.500
Colin Blake and his wife were celebrating their 35th anniversary on a cruise.

20:07.500 --> 20:12.500
When he believes a spider bit him while they were on shore in Marseille, France.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.500
Yeah.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.500
I was in Marseille.

20:14.500 --> 20:15.500
I was in Marseille.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.500
You went to Marseille.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.500
You were buying a cruise.

20:17.500 --> 20:18.500
On a cruise.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.500
The doctor cut open the toe.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.500
I'm milking.

20:20.500 --> 20:21.500
Oh, nice.

20:21.500 --> 20:22.500
With black dots.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.500
That's the eggs.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.500
And the don't worry.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.500
I've got them all out.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.500
Said the ship stockter.

20:29.500 --> 20:36.500
When Colin got back home to England, he did an IV antibiotics at the hospital for six weeks.

20:36.500 --> 20:43.500
And MRI scan found a spiky object in his toe that a podiatrist removed.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.500
I'm like asking what other spikes.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.500
And they said, but they would eventually become the legs.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.500
And I did ask if I could keep it.

20:49.500 --> 20:50.500
The answer was no.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.500
Oh, my infection has gradually improved.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.500
This is kind of tender.

20:55.500 --> 20:57.500
Colin says you can see the bite marks.

20:57.500 --> 21:02.500
Now that the swelling is down, but spider experts aren't fighting.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.500
If someone said to you, look.

21:04.500 --> 21:08.500
I got bitten by a spider and it lay eggs in my big toe.

21:08.500 --> 21:12.500
No spider on this earth can lay eggs in a person's toe.

21:12.500 --> 21:13.500
Perfect.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.500
I trust Nancy Hinkle.

21:17.500 --> 21:22.500
You guys host a very online show.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.500
It hasn't come out yet.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.500
So I've actually never been able to listen to an episode.

21:25.500 --> 21:28.500
But I listen to the trailer multiple times.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.500
I assume this is a kind of stuff you guys are talking about.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.500
Online debates and such.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.500
So yep.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.500
Yeah.

21:34.500 --> 21:35.500
Do you guys think that?

21:35.500 --> 21:36.500
What's the debate?

21:36.500 --> 21:38.500
Do we think that there's a spider laid eggs or not?

21:38.500 --> 21:39.500
Eggs or not?

21:39.500 --> 21:40.500
Eggs or not?

21:40.500 --> 21:41.500
Eggs or not?

21:41.500 --> 21:46.500
I mean, I will say that the professor seemed pretty

21:46.500 --> 21:49.500
adamant that a spider can't lay eggs.

21:49.500 --> 21:50.500
Sure.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.500
I'm sorry.

21:51.500 --> 21:54.500
If we're judging a book by its cover.

21:54.500 --> 21:57.500
Nancy Hinkle looks like she knows a lot about spiders.

21:57.500 --> 21:58.500
Yeah.

21:58.500 --> 22:02.500
She sounded frustrated by having to be asked about this.

22:02.500 --> 22:03.500
Yeah.

22:03.500 --> 22:06.500
But I believe number one, a rock knowledgeist.

22:06.500 --> 22:07.500
Yeah.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.500
Exactly.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.500
10 things on my plate.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.500
Now everybody's asking me about this toe.

22:11.500 --> 22:12.500
Yeah.

22:12.500 --> 22:15.500
I will say that man looks very sweet.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.500
Poor guy on a wedding set.

22:17.500 --> 22:20.500
I mean, what a good sport about it, right?

22:20.500 --> 22:23.500
He thought it was the funniest thing ever.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.500
You know, you go to his house.

22:25.500 --> 22:26.500
His fucking nieces enough.

22:26.500 --> 22:27.500
He's got his house.

22:27.500 --> 22:28.500
That's the first picture.

22:28.500 --> 22:29.500
He pulls out.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.500
Look at my toe.

22:30.500 --> 22:31.500
Look at my toe.

22:31.500 --> 22:32.500
He looks like that kind of guy.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.500
Oh, he's like everyone about that toe.

22:34.500 --> 22:35.500
But yeah.

22:35.500 --> 22:36.500
Yeah.

22:36.500 --> 22:37.500
He was like very pleased.

22:37.500 --> 22:38.500
But he doesn't know.

22:38.500 --> 22:41.500
From he doesn't know where a spider can lay eggs or not.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.500
I do think he was bitten by a spider.

22:43.500 --> 22:47.500
But he said that he thinks that he found spiky things in the toe that were supposed

22:47.500 --> 22:48.500
to be the legs.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.500
Our spiders formed leg first.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.500
That's when I was good.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.500
That's where I started to call a horseshit.

22:52.500 --> 22:55.500
Because I'm like, you're saying that the spider's going to grow from the big toe.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.500
Is the body of the spider going to be going to become the big toe.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.500
I feel like that was the insinuation.

22:59.500 --> 23:00.500
And we do have to move on.

23:00.500 --> 23:01.500
I think that was the insinuation.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.500
Yeah.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.500
And actually, I knew Mariek was going to say.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.500
And I knew Mariek was going to come at me after that.

23:06.500 --> 23:09.500
So I had to say we have to move on before she had a chance.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.500
Here we go.

23:10.500 --> 23:11.500
I want to hear what Mariek has to say.

23:11.500 --> 23:12.500
Let's hear.

23:12.500 --> 23:20.500
I was just like, it was, I feel like that just means that if the legs are growing out of his toe,

23:21.500 --> 23:23.500
they're like growing out of the egg.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.500
Like the egg still intact.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.500
Sure.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.500
Sure.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.500
That's when I took it to the end.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.500
And if the doctor took out all the eggs.

23:30.500 --> 23:31.500
Yeah.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.500
Well, the thing about the pusp being milky.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.500
It was that spider come.

23:35.500 --> 23:36.500
Wow.

23:36.500 --> 23:37.500
That's what I was going to ask.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.500
But I didn't want to be depressed.

23:39.500 --> 23:40.500
Yeah.

23:40.500 --> 23:41.500
Yeah.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.500
Maybe the spider just let loose in his toe.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.500
Oh, maybe it's a wish on me and this.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.500
Oh, who has it?

23:47.500 --> 23:48.500
Right.

23:49.500 --> 23:50.500
The spider fucked his toe.

23:50.500 --> 23:52.500
I also just want to, the spider fucked his toe.

23:52.500 --> 23:53.500
Yeah.

23:53.500 --> 23:58.500
I want to paint a picture for the audience right now that we are sitting in a room.

23:58.500 --> 23:59.500
Sure.

23:59.500 --> 24:00.500
Filled with the smell of clams.

24:00.500 --> 24:01.500
Yeah.

24:01.500 --> 24:02.500
I mean, it does smell good.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.500
Watch.

24:03.500 --> 24:04.500
Yeah.

24:04.500 --> 24:05.500
Yeah.

24:05.500 --> 24:10.500
Of a man with a giant toe spider by a giant milky pot of a mess.

24:10.500 --> 24:11.500
Sort of a mess.

24:11.500 --> 24:12.500
Yeah.

24:12.500 --> 24:15.500
What makes a clam casino?

24:15.500 --> 24:16.500
Yeah.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.500
Because I think cheese and bread crumbs.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.500
Yeah.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.500
And some lemon.

24:21.500 --> 24:25.500
We have like the fancy lemon situation where they put the bad things are all there.

24:25.500 --> 24:28.500
I don't know if you guys are sick to your stomach or what's the issue?

24:28.500 --> 24:31.500
Because I feel like Greek is hardly touched or clams casino.

24:31.500 --> 24:32.500
Yeah.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.500
I mean, now I'm a little sick to my stomach.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.500
Yeah.

24:35.500 --> 24:40.500
I would say the combination of us being milky going and drinking a butter beer at their

24:40.500 --> 24:44.500
pot or watching a video of an infected toe.

24:44.500 --> 24:48.500
And then also being in the room with these clams is me.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.500
My appetite is not kind of at its peak.

24:50.500 --> 24:55.500
And I kind of, I kind of walked in just like chowing down on some sour candies.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.500
Yeah.

24:56.500 --> 24:57.500
You were, yeah.

24:57.500 --> 24:58.500
And in a hot glass tea.

24:58.500 --> 24:59.500
Yeah.

24:59.500 --> 25:00.500
So you know, they got a port.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.500
They got a port.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.500
That's almost five.

25:02.500 --> 25:03.500
Okay.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.500
So our candy in a chocolate.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.500
Chocolate.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.500
Chocolate candy.

25:07.500 --> 25:08.500
Yeah.

25:08.500 --> 25:09.500
All right.

25:09.500 --> 25:10.500
Here we go.

25:10.500 --> 25:13.500
A recent advice column featured in Slate had the following letters sent.

25:13.500 --> 25:15.500
And sent in for advice.

25:15.500 --> 25:16.500
Dear Karen.

25:16.500 --> 25:17.500
I love to invite.

25:17.500 --> 25:18.500
Okay.

25:18.500 --> 25:19.500
What's that?

25:19.500 --> 25:20.500
I love Slate.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.500
I read all of Slate's advice columns too.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.500
So I bet I've read it.

25:23.500 --> 25:24.500
Yeah.

25:24.500 --> 25:25.500
Exactly right.

25:25.500 --> 25:26.500
I bet I have an opinion.

25:26.500 --> 25:27.500
Dear Karen feeding.

25:27.500 --> 25:31.500
My husband has been getting angry whenever our son coughs at night.

25:31.500 --> 25:32.500
He's in second grade.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.500
So he gets all the bugs you would expect at school.

25:35.500 --> 25:38.500
Whenever our son has extended bouts of coughing at night,

25:38.500 --> 25:40.500
we can hear loud and clear.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.500
My husband chanting.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.500
Shut up.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.500
Or stop fucking coughing.

25:46.500 --> 25:49.500
Last night our son started crying because of it.

25:49.500 --> 25:51.500
Which made his coughing worse.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.500
And we heard an actual scream.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.500
This slamming into walls.

25:55.500 --> 25:58.500
And when I tried to settle my husband, he said,

25:58.500 --> 26:00.500
Between his coughing and your snoring,

26:00.500 --> 26:03.500
I haven't gotten any sleep since the day we met.

26:03.500 --> 26:06.500
In the morning my husband just went.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.500
I was losing my mind from sleep deprivation.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.500
I didn't scream at our son.

26:11.500 --> 26:14.500
He's blown off any attempt to point out that he scared our child.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.500
And that this isn't the first time it's happened.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.500
I know sleep deprivation sucks,

26:18.500 --> 26:20.500
but this has got me really freaked out.

26:20.500 --> 26:24.500
We don't live near family and a hotel room until the cold clear

26:24.500 --> 26:25.500
is up as out of the budget.

26:25.500 --> 26:28.500
Any advice?

26:28.500 --> 26:29.500
And then.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.500
I mean, my question is,

26:31.500 --> 26:32.500
A Greer disagree.

26:32.500 --> 26:35.500
Children should be spanked for coughs.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.500
One for one.

26:38.500 --> 26:41.500
Well, children shouldn't get sick.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.500
And that's on them.

26:43.500 --> 26:46.500
I do think it's very funny to be like,

26:46.500 --> 26:47.500
I was delirious.

26:47.500 --> 26:51.500
I was like, I couldn't even, I was hallucinating

26:51.500 --> 26:53.500
basically, but also I didn't scream.

26:53.500 --> 26:54.500
It's like, you can't,

26:54.500 --> 26:56.500
you just said you don't know what was going on.

26:56.500 --> 26:58.500
So I'm telling you that you screamed.

26:58.500 --> 26:59.500
Yeah.

26:59.500 --> 27:00.500
Yeah.

27:00.500 --> 27:01.500
That's, I love him being like,

27:01.500 --> 27:03.500
I was out of my fucking mind.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.500
I didn't scream.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.500
Well, almost.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.500
No.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.500
Sleepy headphones, babe.

27:08.500 --> 27:09.500
Or earplugs.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.500
Yeah, earplugs are available.

27:11.500 --> 27:12.500
Yeah.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.500
Like, white noise machine.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.500
I'm a little concerned about the cough.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.500
It seems like it's been going on for a long time.

27:18.500 --> 27:19.500
Oh, take the kid.

27:19.500 --> 27:24.500
Maybe the kid needs to be on a million things to be done.

27:24.500 --> 27:25.500
Wife snoring.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.500
She probably has.

27:27.500 --> 27:28.500
Sleepy.

27:28.500 --> 27:29.500
That's not happening.

27:29.500 --> 27:30.500
And that needs to get checked out.

27:30.500 --> 27:31.500
Yeah.

27:31.500 --> 27:33.500
There's a lot of shit that needs to happen.

27:33.500 --> 27:36.500
But also, if the wife, the wife has been snoring,

27:36.500 --> 27:39.500
you know, I imagine she came into the relationship snoring.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.500
Yeah.

27:40.500 --> 27:43.500
So he should have already figured out how to deal with that,

27:43.500 --> 27:46.500
whether it be an earplugs situation.

27:46.500 --> 27:47.500
But number two,

27:47.500 --> 27:50.500
if he really wants this kid to stop coughing,

27:50.500 --> 27:51.500
let's get him in the doctor.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.500
Let's do an appointment.

27:52.500 --> 27:53.500
It's written up.

27:53.500 --> 27:54.500
Destiny's a drip.

27:54.500 --> 27:55.500
Yeah.

27:55.500 --> 27:56.500
Honestly, though,

27:56.500 --> 27:58.500
it's a little, let's get it written up.

27:58.500 --> 27:59.500
Post nasal drip.

27:59.500 --> 28:00.500
Absolutely.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.500
This is the worst kind of fucking person to me,

28:02.500 --> 28:05.500
because it's the person that complains,

28:05.500 --> 28:08.500
but does not come with the solution.

28:08.500 --> 28:12.500
Besides yelling to shut the fuck up in the walls.

28:12.500 --> 28:13.500
Slamming the walls.

28:13.500 --> 28:15.500
And it's like, this frustration,

28:15.500 --> 28:18.500
but it's like, you could actually do something.

28:18.500 --> 28:21.500
You actually have all the agency power and control

28:21.500 --> 28:25.500
to help alleviate the situation.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.500
And with your energy,

28:27.500 --> 28:28.500
what are you doing?

28:28.500 --> 28:30.500
Slamming your fists against the walls

28:30.500 --> 28:32.500
and saying shut the fuck up.

28:32.500 --> 28:34.500
And then saying, no,

28:34.500 --> 28:35.500
I didn't do that when it's like,

28:35.500 --> 28:37.500
well, actually you did.

28:37.500 --> 28:38.500
Yeah.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.500
And I feel like, is that the kids in second grade, right?

28:40.500 --> 28:41.500
Second grade.

28:41.500 --> 28:42.500
Second grade.

28:42.500 --> 28:43.500
Okay.

28:43.500 --> 28:44.500
So you could just ask the kid.

28:44.500 --> 28:46.500
Did I scream shut the fuck up at you last night?

28:46.500 --> 28:47.500
And you're killing him.

28:47.500 --> 28:48.500
He was dead.

28:48.500 --> 28:49.500
Yes.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.500
You did.

28:51.500 --> 28:52.500
Um.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.500
Let's go.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.500
Sorry.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.500
Yeah.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.500
I'm like, this is, yeah.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.500
No, I'm like, this wife needs to leave it.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.500
I'm like, this guy wants to meet it.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.500
I mean, I just feel like it's one cough away

29:03.500 --> 29:05.500
from being unsnapped, honestly.

29:05.500 --> 29:06.500
Yeah.

29:06.500 --> 29:07.500
Yeah.

29:07.500 --> 29:10.500
I think get the kids, pack your bags, find an apartment.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.500
No, leave the kid.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.500
We like to get his locker.

29:14.500 --> 29:16.500
Uh, in later days.

29:16.500 --> 29:17.500
Just bring it down.

29:17.500 --> 29:20.500
A recent LA Times headline reads,

29:20.500 --> 29:24.500
an auto engineer became a full-time potter in LA.

29:24.500 --> 29:27.500
Thank her high school art teacher.

29:27.500 --> 29:30.500
So would you just like to take a minute or?

29:30.500 --> 29:32.500
To thank the high school art teacher.

29:32.500 --> 29:35.500
To thank the high school art teacher.

29:35.500 --> 29:38.500
I mean, a potter like making pottery.

29:38.500 --> 29:39.500
Correct.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.500
And her high school art teacher is involved.

29:41.500 --> 29:42.500
Why?

29:42.500 --> 29:43.500
In how?

29:43.500 --> 29:44.500
I didn't read the article.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.500
I just, the headline said,

29:46.500 --> 29:48.500
to thank the art teacher.

29:48.500 --> 29:49.500
So I thought maybe we could all teach them.

29:49.500 --> 29:52.500
We'll take a moment.

29:52.500 --> 29:56.500
Well, um, as education and public school education

29:56.500 --> 29:58.500
continues to get defunded,

29:58.500 --> 30:01.500
I feel like we should be celebrating teachers,

30:01.500 --> 30:04.500
and especially the arts of the first to go.

30:04.500 --> 30:05.500
Yeah.

30:05.500 --> 30:08.500
I think that, you know what, with any platform,

30:08.500 --> 30:11.500
um, you should think teachers.

30:11.500 --> 30:14.500
And it's no secret that on the internet.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.500
If you want engagement, you'll do

30:16.500 --> 30:17.500
Proteas your content.

30:17.500 --> 30:19.500
That's just, yeah.

30:19.500 --> 30:22.500
And if you don't actually love the teachers,

30:22.500 --> 30:24.500
just do it for the numbers.

30:24.500 --> 30:25.500
Just say it in a moment.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.500
Well, we love teachers.

30:27.500 --> 30:29.500
I'm going to say,

30:29.500 --> 30:30.500
I'm going to say,

30:30.500 --> 30:33.500
thank you art teacher of the potter.

30:33.500 --> 30:34.500
Yeah.

30:34.500 --> 30:38.500
Thank you so much to this L.A. based art teacher.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.500
Because of,

30:40.500 --> 30:41.500
because of you,

30:41.500 --> 30:45.500
we have one more potter in this world.

30:45.500 --> 30:47.500
And, um,

30:47.500 --> 30:50.500
keep doing you and God bless you.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.500
And I've seen on TikTok that the classroom

30:52.500 --> 30:54.500
has become very challenging and easy.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.500
Yeah.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.500
I just hope that you're taking care of yourself.

30:57.500 --> 30:58.500
Yeah.

30:58.500 --> 30:59.500
I hope that you're doing your own potter.

30:59.500 --> 31:00.500
Yeah.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.500
You're making time for yourself to be a potter as well.

31:02.500 --> 31:03.500
Because you're not just a teacher.

31:03.500 --> 31:04.500
You're also a person.

31:04.500 --> 31:05.500
You're, you know,

31:05.500 --> 31:07.500
maybe a wife, a mother, a sister, a daughter,

31:07.500 --> 31:09.500
and a potter in your own right.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.500
Or husband.

31:10.500 --> 31:11.500
It could be.

31:11.500 --> 31:12.500
That's true.

31:12.500 --> 31:13.500
Actually, we don't know that.

31:13.500 --> 31:14.500
I'm so sorry.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.500
I do not know the gender of that.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.500
My son.

31:16.500 --> 31:17.500
My son.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.500
My son.

31:18.500 --> 31:19.500
My son.

31:19.500 --> 31:20.500
My son.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.500
My son.

31:21.500 --> 31:22.500
My son.

31:22.500 --> 31:23.500
My son.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.500
You're not thinking.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.500
I mean, to be fair,

31:27.500 --> 31:28.500
I was an asshole.

31:28.500 --> 31:30.500
But in that case,

31:30.500 --> 31:32.500
I didn't have the patience properly.

31:32.500 --> 31:33.500
So.

31:33.500 --> 31:34.500
But I think him too.

31:34.500 --> 31:35.500
I know.

31:35.500 --> 31:36.500
I know.

31:36.500 --> 31:37.500
I know.

31:37.500 --> 31:38.500
Oh, I,

31:38.500 --> 31:40.500
I'll thank the teachers.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.500
Well, but I do think it would be funny.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.500
And I hope this is the case that we're thinking them.

31:44.500 --> 31:49.500
Because they took over the automotive shop.

31:49.500 --> 31:52.500
So that the automotive shop owner

31:52.500 --> 31:53.500
could start their own.

31:53.500 --> 31:54.500
Yeah,

31:54.500 --> 31:55.500
ceramics company.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.500
And I think if they did that,

31:57.500 --> 31:58.500
that would be really cool.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.500
I was like,

31:59.500 --> 32:00.500
Did this channel original move?

32:00.500 --> 32:01.500
Yeah.

32:01.500 --> 32:02.500
Yeah.

32:02.500 --> 32:04.500
Very like princess in the popper,

32:04.500 --> 32:05.500
but it's automatic.

32:05.500 --> 32:06.500
And the father.

32:06.500 --> 32:07.500
That's really good.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.500
We got to take a break.

32:09.500 --> 32:10.500
We got to take a break.

32:10.500 --> 32:11.500
We got to take a break for that.

32:11.500 --> 32:15.500
Really good.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.500
Let me guess.

32:17.500 --> 32:18.500
You're a millennial.

32:18.500 --> 32:21.500
We missed this with life was like in the 2000s, right?

32:21.500 --> 32:24.500
And you've had a hard time finding new or curated music.

32:24.500 --> 32:26.500
You're interested also.

32:26.500 --> 32:33.500
I might add in multiple perspectives on relationships dating and music.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.500
That means if you checked.

32:35.500 --> 32:37.500
Yes, to any of them,

32:37.500 --> 32:38.500
Julia,

32:38.500 --> 32:39.500
that you're going to love.

32:39.500 --> 32:42.500

32:56.500 --> 33:00.500

33:04.500 --> 33:07.500

33:12.500 --> 33:14.500
in their freshly squeezed music segment.

33:14.500 --> 33:15.500
Most recently,

33:15.500 --> 33:17.500

33:35.500 --> 33:36.500

33:36.500 --> 33:39.500
Oxford dictionary's word of the year is also

33:39.500 --> 33:40.500
deeply online.

33:40.500 --> 33:42.500
I tried to pull some deep online content for you again.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.500
Rizz, right?

33:44.500 --> 33:45.500
I knew it.

33:45.500 --> 33:46.500
I knew it.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.500
I feel like...

33:49.500 --> 33:51.500
That's not my favorite slang word.

33:51.500 --> 33:52.500
Do you know what Rizz means?

33:52.500 --> 33:53.500
Yes.

33:53.500 --> 33:54.500
Yeah.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.500
I don't know the word for Rizzma.

33:56.500 --> 33:57.500
Yeah.

33:57.500 --> 33:58.500
I feel like...

33:58.500 --> 34:00.500
I feel like Rizz doesn't have...

34:00.500 --> 34:01.500
I don't know.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.500
You don't think Rizz has Rizz.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.500
Oh.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.500
Yeah.

34:05.500 --> 34:07.500
I came up too quickly.

34:07.500 --> 34:08.500
It came up too quickly.

34:08.500 --> 34:09.500
Now, you know,

34:09.500 --> 34:12.500
I would love to see the internet.

34:12.500 --> 34:15.500
The way that slang moves so quickly

34:15.500 --> 34:17.500
through the internet.

34:17.500 --> 34:18.500
Like first.

34:18.500 --> 34:19.500
Because I feel like...

34:19.500 --> 34:21.500
There was a shelf life on slang.

34:21.500 --> 34:24.500
Where it's like one cool black person said it.

34:24.500 --> 34:27.500
And then maybe ten years later,

34:27.500 --> 34:28.500
a white person wouldn't say...

34:28.500 --> 34:29.500
Now it's not just that.

34:29.500 --> 34:30.500
Yeah.

34:30.500 --> 34:31.500
Now a white person...

34:31.500 --> 34:33.500
And it started with on fleek.

34:33.500 --> 34:36.500
Where one black girl said my eyebrows were on fleek.

34:36.500 --> 34:38.500
And then I would say,

34:38.500 --> 34:39.500
like within months,

34:39.500 --> 34:42.500
Kardashians were putting their eyebrows

34:43.500 --> 34:45.500
They're brought Joe fleek whatever.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.500
So it's just like...

34:46.500 --> 34:48.500
We're caught in this very fast.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.500
And the longevity isn't the same.

34:50.500 --> 34:51.500
What I will say.

34:51.500 --> 34:52.500
So longevity isn't the same.

34:52.500 --> 34:54.500
It's my mom is in town this week.

34:54.500 --> 34:57.500
And she has held on to bling.

34:57.500 --> 34:58.500
Okay.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.500
She says bling often.

35:00.500 --> 35:01.500
Yeah.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.500
She is really held on to that.

35:04.500 --> 35:07.500
And kind of continues to use it.

35:07.500 --> 35:09.500
I would say daily.

35:09.500 --> 35:10.500
Yeah.

35:11.500 --> 35:15.500
And I feel like my whole thing about risk

35:15.500 --> 35:17.500
is that it's...

35:17.500 --> 35:20.500
It's bringing up this thing that I feel like.

35:20.500 --> 35:25.500
Social media has really de-prioritized,

35:25.500 --> 35:28.500
which is like this charisma,

35:28.500 --> 35:30.500
this genus, it's quite this thing

35:30.500 --> 35:33.500
that you need this personality,

35:33.500 --> 35:34.500
whatever.

35:34.500 --> 35:39.500
It's really a re-invention or like a re-purposing of the thing game.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.500
Because when people say somebody has game,

35:41.500 --> 35:43.500
that's risk, that's charisma.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.500
And I feel like, you know,

35:45.500 --> 35:48.500
it's all about fits in this and not and whatever.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.500
And it's like, no, let's go back to the basics.

35:50.500 --> 35:51.500
What's your risk?

35:51.500 --> 35:52.500
Like...

35:52.500 --> 35:53.500
Yeah.

35:53.500 --> 35:55.500
And it's like, how are you treating people?

35:55.500 --> 35:57.500
How do people feel around you?

35:57.500 --> 35:59.500
That's what's going to get you.

35:59.500 --> 36:00.500
What you want.

36:00.500 --> 36:01.500
Yeah.

36:01.500 --> 36:03.500
I don't personally...

36:03.500 --> 36:08.500
Rizz has not made its way into my personal lexicon.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.500
It makes me think...

36:09.500 --> 36:12.500
I feel honestly like, very, how do you do fellow kids?

36:12.500 --> 36:13.500
Yeah.

36:13.500 --> 36:14.500
If I were to say it...

36:14.500 --> 36:15.500
Yeah.

36:15.500 --> 36:16.500
I say as gamers, like, you know?

36:16.500 --> 36:18.500
Like I say, right?

36:18.500 --> 36:19.500
Like...

36:19.500 --> 36:22.500
For example, when we're talking about celebrities,

36:22.500 --> 36:23.500
we would sleep with.

36:23.500 --> 36:24.500
Mm-hmm.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.500
I can tell you a very hot person,

36:26.500 --> 36:28.500
but I can also say,

36:28.500 --> 36:29.500
that's...

36:29.500 --> 36:30.500
I thought Guy Fieri.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.500
Because I know that he does.

36:32.500 --> 36:33.500
Realistic.

36:33.500 --> 36:34.500
Really?

36:34.500 --> 36:35.500
It's like...

36:35.500 --> 36:37.500
Realistic.

36:37.500 --> 36:38.500
I don't know that.

36:38.500 --> 36:41.500
If we're out of bar, Guy Fieri is putting it down.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.500
Yeah.

36:42.500 --> 36:43.500
Guy Fieri is charming me.

36:43.500 --> 36:45.500
He's asking you questions about yourself.

36:45.500 --> 36:46.500
He's asking questions.

36:46.500 --> 36:49.500
He's asking you follow-up questions based on the thing

36:49.500 --> 36:50.500
that you said earlier.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.500
Yeah.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.500
Sure.

36:52.500 --> 36:53.500
He's listening.

36:53.500 --> 36:54.500
He's ordering for the table.

36:54.500 --> 36:55.500
Yeah.

36:55.500 --> 36:56.500
For the table.

36:56.500 --> 36:57.500
He's getting everyone's thing.

36:57.500 --> 36:58.500
That's charisma.

36:58.500 --> 36:59.500
That's Rizz.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.500
You'll move to a different topic,

37:01.500 --> 37:02.500
and then he'll bring it up and be like,

37:02.500 --> 37:04.500
that's like what you said earlier, Mill.

37:04.500 --> 37:05.500
Yeah.

37:05.500 --> 37:06.500
Then you'll be like,

37:07.500 --> 37:08.500
Hey, Mill.

37:08.500 --> 37:09.500
You got a Charles Milton.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.500
I'm not going to say I wouldn't smash.

37:11.500 --> 37:12.500
I'm just saying.

37:12.500 --> 37:14.500
He's got to prove himself in that other area.

37:14.500 --> 37:15.500
Yeah.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.500
Yeah.

37:16.500 --> 37:17.500
I mean, yeah.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.500
Where Guy Fieri's bringing it.

37:19.500 --> 37:20.500
Yeah.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.500
I don't know if Charles Milton has to ask other people questions.

37:22.500 --> 37:23.500
No, he doesn't.

37:23.500 --> 37:26.500
But he did give a very, very emotional and in touch performance.

37:26.500 --> 37:27.500
He made a summer.

37:27.500 --> 37:28.500
Of course.

37:28.500 --> 37:29.500
There's obviously something.

37:29.500 --> 37:30.500
There's some depth there.

37:30.500 --> 37:31.500
There's stuff there.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.500
I also say there's a Twitch streamer.

37:34.500 --> 37:35.500
I sent at least this clip.

37:35.500 --> 37:38.500
But there's a Twitch streamer who.

37:38.500 --> 37:42.500
He posted like him like with it.

37:42.500 --> 37:43.500
When it was fans or something.

37:43.500 --> 37:44.500
And it was a girl.

37:44.500 --> 37:45.500
And she was like, whatever.

37:45.500 --> 37:49.500
And all his like 13 year old Twitch fans were like commenting like,

37:49.500 --> 37:51.500
ill, she's ugly or her body blah blah blah.

37:51.500 --> 37:55.500
And this guy, this Twitch streamer like got so mad at them.

37:55.500 --> 37:58.500
And he's like, this is why no one wants to fucking talk to you.

37:58.500 --> 38:00.500
Guys have no fucking personality.

38:00.500 --> 38:01.500
You don't know how to talk to people.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.500
You are just going to be risked.

38:03.500 --> 38:04.500
But risked tip of the day.

38:04.500 --> 38:05.500
Risked tip of the day.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.500
My number one risked tip is shut the fuck up.

38:07.500 --> 38:10.500
No one wants to hear you talk.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.500
And honestly, risked tip.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.500
I would say just shut up and listen.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.500
Yeah.

38:15.500 --> 38:16.500
Shut up.

38:16.500 --> 38:17.500
That's a major risk tip.

38:17.500 --> 38:18.500
That's a major risk tip.

38:18.500 --> 38:19.500
Wow.

38:19.500 --> 38:20.500
Major killer.

38:20.500 --> 38:21.500
Yeah.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.500
Major.

38:22.500 --> 38:23.500
Yeah.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.500
Change it.

38:24.500 --> 38:25.500
That's.

38:25.500 --> 38:26.500
And that's a.

38:26.500 --> 38:27.500
That's a dated.

38:27.500 --> 38:28.500
Yeah.

38:28.500 --> 38:29.500
Yeah.

38:29.500 --> 38:30.500
Yeah.

38:30.500 --> 38:31.500
Oh, it's.

38:31.500 --> 38:32.500
It's a thing.

38:32.500 --> 38:33.500
Yeah.

38:33.500 --> 38:34.500
All right.

38:34.500 --> 38:45.500
This is going to take it into our last segment here.

38:45.500 --> 38:51.500
Listen, you guys are on the network now, right?

38:51.500 --> 38:52.500
Yeah.

38:52.500 --> 38:59.500
This is, you know, let's get serious for a second here.

39:00.500 --> 39:02.500
Where did it go?

39:02.500 --> 39:03.500
Let's get serious.

39:03.500 --> 39:04.500
Oh, okay.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.500
Hold on.

39:05.500 --> 39:06.500
Look.

39:06.500 --> 39:08.500
This never happened.

39:08.500 --> 39:09.500
It's never.

39:09.500 --> 39:10.500
Sorry.

39:10.500 --> 39:12.500
I'm on public Wi-Fi on a bus.

39:12.500 --> 39:13.500
Yeah.

39:13.500 --> 39:14.500
It's like.

39:14.500 --> 39:15.500
It's like.

39:15.500 --> 39:16.500
It's like.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.500
Let's get serious here for a second.

39:18.500 --> 39:21.500
You know, we like to have fun.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.500
You know, you guys host a comedy show.

39:23.500 --> 39:26.500
But it, you know, you're on the network now.

39:26.500 --> 39:28.500
This is, this is, this is serious business.

39:28.500 --> 39:31.500
You know, and we all need to stand on business.

39:31.500 --> 39:32.500
Right?

39:32.500 --> 39:37.500
I've, that's why I've come out with some, some, some PR stun slash products.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.500
Placement slash branded opportunities for the show.

39:40.500 --> 39:45.500
Go touch grass premiering on headroom two days from now slash last week.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.500
If you're listening to this episode.

39:47.500 --> 39:50.500
So go check out the first and maybe second episode.

39:50.500 --> 39:54.500
These are products and publicity stunts that I thought that you guys could do

39:54.500 --> 39:57.500
to promote the show in conjunction with all the crossroomer you're doing.

39:57.500 --> 40:02.500
The first one is go drink kvaas.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.500
Are you guys familiar with boss?

40:04.500 --> 40:05.500
What's the boss?

40:05.500 --> 40:06.500
No.

40:06.500 --> 40:07.500
No.

40:07.500 --> 40:08.500
We don't live in LA.

40:08.500 --> 40:11.500
We drink water and then go get soda.

40:11.500 --> 40:13.500
People in LA don't drink kvaas either.

40:13.500 --> 40:16.500
That's why there's a hole in the market here.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.500
And I'm going to say the product.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.500
And then I'm going to say the copy that I've created for you guys.

40:20.500 --> 40:21.500
Here we go.

40:21.500 --> 40:25.500
Kick back and unwind the way the hosts of go touch grass do.

40:25.500 --> 40:32.500
By housing a couple of these grain cereal based fermented sodas from a can or bottle.

40:32.500 --> 40:36.500
The sweetness hour taste of this bubbling eastern European

40:36.500 --> 40:41.500
oddity leaves an aftertaste that can only be described as okay.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.500
You won't regret kvaas.

40:43.500 --> 40:46.500
Subscribe to go touch grass too.

40:46.500 --> 40:49.500
I'm amazing.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.500
Go touch grass too.

40:51.500 --> 40:52.500
Yeah.

40:52.500 --> 40:54.500
That's what I'm saying.

40:54.500 --> 40:55.500
That's what I'm saying.

40:55.500 --> 40:56.500
That's what I'm saying.

40:56.500 --> 40:57.500
That's what I'm saying.

40:57.500 --> 40:59.500
For the products that are going to be the branded opportunities.

40:59.500 --> 41:00.500
What do you guys think?

41:00.500 --> 41:02.500
What do you want to solicit from us right now?

41:02.500 --> 41:05.500
He wants to know if we'll be able to drink that soda.

41:05.500 --> 41:06.500
Yeah.

41:06.500 --> 41:07.500
He's back.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.500
I'm trying to find that kvaas.

41:09.500 --> 41:13.500
My feedback is I don't really understand what kvaas is.

41:13.500 --> 41:15.500
But if anyone wants to put a sponsor.

41:15.500 --> 41:17.500
It's a low alcohol beer.

41:17.500 --> 41:19.500
What's that like kombucha?

41:20.500 --> 41:21.500
And I wish he was.

41:21.500 --> 41:23.500
That'd be simpler to understand.

41:23.500 --> 41:25.500
It isn't.

41:25.500 --> 41:26.500
Okay.

41:26.500 --> 41:28.500
Now here's my thing.

41:28.500 --> 41:31.500
It's kvaas the name of the genre of drink.

41:31.500 --> 41:32.500
Correct.

41:32.500 --> 41:34.500
Is it like clean eggs?

41:34.500 --> 41:35.500
Where it's like.

41:35.500 --> 41:37.500
That's the brand of tissue.

41:37.500 --> 41:38.500
Like.

41:38.500 --> 41:43.500
So are we promoting like the way that the milk a lobby or the can lobby?

41:43.500 --> 41:47.500
Like just the general idea of this drink.

41:47.500 --> 41:48.500
So it's like.

41:48.500 --> 41:49.500
So kvaas is like beer.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.500
It's like a category.

41:51.500 --> 41:52.500
Okay.

41:52.500 --> 41:56.500
And then go drink kvaas would be like Miller light.

41:56.500 --> 41:57.500
Okay.

41:57.500 --> 41:59.500
So the brand is go drink kvaas.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.500
The product is kvaas.

42:01.500 --> 42:02.500
Correct.

42:02.500 --> 42:03.500
Exactly right.

42:03.500 --> 42:04.500
I mean, he says no to that.

42:04.500 --> 42:06.500
And how does that not let me show?

42:06.500 --> 42:07.500
We might.

42:07.500 --> 42:08.500
We might.

42:08.500 --> 42:09.500
Okay.

42:09.500 --> 42:11.500
Let's go out of this product then.

42:11.500 --> 42:14.500
Just stay chased.

42:14.500 --> 42:16.500
This go touch grass branded.

42:16.500 --> 42:21.500
Chastity belt is not for the faint of heart nor randy of loins.

42:21.500 --> 42:27.500
Each week, you can listen to the sultry sounds of go touch grass while growing increasingly

42:27.500 --> 42:29.500
sexually frustrated.

42:29.500 --> 42:35.500
Millionally swaps all things internet pop culture as you unit yourself through bondage.

42:35.500 --> 42:39.500
If you aren't willing to lock up your bits and throw away the key for million

42:39.500 --> 42:46.500
release, then don't listen to the podcast at all.

42:46.500 --> 42:47.500
Um, okay.

42:47.500 --> 42:51.500
You know, I can't 100% get behind like purity culture.

42:51.500 --> 42:56.500
But if it's a kink thing, then I'd be more willing.

42:56.500 --> 42:58.500
It's it's somehow neither.

42:58.500 --> 43:05.500
It's just someone being willing to go sexual pleasure in service of people listening to your

43:05.500 --> 43:06.500
podcast.

43:06.500 --> 43:07.500
Yeah.

43:07.500 --> 43:08.500
I say do it.

43:08.500 --> 43:12.500
I feel like people fuck too much like people need to be more conscious about fucking

43:12.500 --> 43:13.500
him like, yeah.

43:13.500 --> 43:14.500
Yeah.

43:14.500 --> 43:17.500
Official touch grass opinion is people fuck too much.

43:17.500 --> 43:19.500
Go touch grass.

43:19.500 --> 43:22.500
Keep trying not yourself.

43:22.500 --> 43:24.500
No, go touch grass.

43:24.500 --> 43:25.500
We're good.

43:25.500 --> 43:26.500
All right.

43:26.500 --> 43:27.500
So just stay chased.

43:27.500 --> 43:28.500
Stay away from us.

43:28.500 --> 43:29.500
Yeah.

43:29.500 --> 43:30.500
We're going to keep.

43:30.500 --> 43:31.500
We're going to.

43:31.500 --> 43:32.500
We're going to go with that one.

43:32.500 --> 43:33.500
All right.

43:33.500 --> 43:34.500
Adding to car.

43:34.500 --> 43:35.500
Yeah.

43:36.500 --> 43:37.500
Yeah.

43:37.500 --> 43:38.500
Yeah.

43:38.500 --> 43:39.500
All right.

43:39.500 --> 43:40.500
Here we go.

43:40.500 --> 43:41.500
Go.

43:41.500 --> 43:42.500
This is the third product.

43:42.500 --> 43:44.500
Go clutch grass.

43:44.500 --> 43:50.500
This grass based coin purse is for those who categorize themselves as being in the middle

43:50.500 --> 43:54.500
of the venn diagram between loving the podcast.

43:54.500 --> 43:58.500
Go touch grass and needing a tote made out of dirt.

43:58.500 --> 44:04.500
Imagine keeping most of your daily belongings in a sack of sod while cracking the

44:04.500 --> 44:05.500
fuck up.

44:05.500 --> 44:09.500
Listening to one of Millie's foibles or even Elise's follies.

44:09.500 --> 44:15.500
The show is worth listening to, but only if you own a bag that's also a pasture.

44:15.500 --> 44:20.500
I also like the tonight show, but that's not a podcast.

44:20.500 --> 44:21.500
So that whole thing is the.

44:21.500 --> 44:23.500
I can't be for this product.

44:23.500 --> 44:29.500
I will say I think it would be really cool to sell a little clutch bag that is like

44:29.500 --> 44:31.500
aaster turf.

44:31.500 --> 44:32.500
Right.

44:33.500 --> 44:34.500
I like this.

44:34.500 --> 44:35.500
Yeah.

44:35.500 --> 44:37.500
I think a bag made of grass is fun.

44:37.500 --> 44:41.500
But I'm confused because in the copy that you wrote, you alternated between describing

44:41.500 --> 44:46.500
it as made of grass and made of dirt or sod or sod.

44:46.500 --> 44:50.500
That's the end of the way that's dead dirt or something like it.

44:50.500 --> 44:53.500
I'm confused as to the materials that are being used to make the bag.

44:53.500 --> 44:54.500
No.

44:54.500 --> 44:56.500
It's kind of like a cheap mess when you get it.

44:56.500 --> 45:00.500
It's just dirt, but you place grass in the bag on the sides.

45:00.500 --> 45:02.500
And it grows into a bag.

45:02.500 --> 45:03.500
Well, that's a good idea.

45:03.500 --> 45:04.500
I have to go.

45:04.500 --> 45:07.500
I'm down with any interpretation of this.

45:07.500 --> 45:09.500
I think I think I'm down.

45:09.500 --> 45:10.500
I think people have dumb.

45:10.500 --> 45:14.500
Like there's a fashion statement with dumb ass person.

45:14.500 --> 45:15.500
Yeah.

45:15.500 --> 45:16.500
I'm down.

45:16.500 --> 45:17.500
The end of the love.

45:17.500 --> 45:19.500
So weird person.

45:19.500 --> 45:20.500
Yeah.

45:20.500 --> 45:23.500
Like a funny bag that's shaped like a cow.

45:23.500 --> 45:24.500
The bird at bag.

45:24.500 --> 45:25.500
The bag at bag.

45:25.500 --> 45:26.500
A little tiny bag.

45:26.500 --> 45:27.500
Yep.

45:27.500 --> 45:29.500
So I definitely do think there's again a kind of natural.

45:29.500 --> 45:30.500
A natural synergy.

45:30.500 --> 45:31.500
Yeah.

45:31.500 --> 45:34.500
This is totally different than I thought.

45:34.500 --> 45:35.500
Really?

45:35.500 --> 45:38.500
It's only the kavas that we didn't quite get on board with.

45:38.500 --> 45:40.500
Which I'm on a shot by.

45:40.500 --> 45:43.500
I should have set clams to see no end kavas your way.

45:43.500 --> 45:44.500
Here we go.

45:44.500 --> 45:45.500
The next product is no.

45:45.500 --> 45:46.500
I hope it's close better than the.

45:46.500 --> 45:48.500
Because now that the smell is getting.

45:48.500 --> 45:49.500
Yeah.

45:49.500 --> 45:50.500
It's rotting.

45:50.500 --> 45:51.500
Yeah.

45:51.500 --> 45:55.500
The next branded opportunity is no such ass.

45:55.500 --> 45:59.500
At least in Millie will both post photos of their asses on main.

45:59.500 --> 46:06.500
Then if anyone asks them about it, they will critically claim that there is no such ass.

46:06.500 --> 46:07.500
Publicity Sun?

46:07.500 --> 46:08.500
Sun?

46:08.500 --> 46:09.500
Yes.

46:09.500 --> 46:10.500
But if you.

46:10.500 --> 46:11.500
Much.

46:11.500 --> 46:12.500
Sorry.

46:12.500 --> 46:13.500
Publicity Sun?

46:13.500 --> 46:14.500
Yes.

46:14.500 --> 46:18.500
But if trying to grow tomatoes has taught me anything, you can try your hardest to make something

46:18.500 --> 46:21.500
grow and it still probably won't work.

46:21.500 --> 46:24.500
Listen to go touch grass or don't.

46:25.500 --> 46:27.500
What's the product?

46:27.500 --> 46:29.500
The product is our ass on main.

46:29.500 --> 46:30.500
What's that?

46:30.500 --> 46:32.500
What is that?

46:32.500 --> 46:33.500
CTA.

46:33.500 --> 46:36.500
Like your people click is it like a only like.

46:36.500 --> 46:38.500
I'm like confused.

46:38.500 --> 46:39.500
Yeah.

46:39.500 --> 46:40.500
I'm confused as to how this works.

46:40.500 --> 46:43.500
So is it like they give us a certain amount of money?

46:43.500 --> 46:46.500
Do we have to post our ass every time?

46:46.500 --> 46:47.500
No.

46:47.500 --> 46:48.500
We hit like that.

46:48.500 --> 46:49.500
So this one.

46:49.500 --> 46:50.500
That's true of some kind.

46:50.500 --> 46:53.500
The entire ethos behind this is that, you know,

46:53.500 --> 46:56.500
if trying to grow tomatoes has taught me anything,

46:56.500 --> 46:59.500
it's that trying to grow anything is really difficult.

46:59.500 --> 47:02.500
And it doesn't matter how much sun it gets, how much you water it.

47:02.500 --> 47:03.500
It doesn't matter what you do.

47:03.500 --> 47:07.500
So why not just show hole on main and then lie about it?

47:07.500 --> 47:09.500
Or as hole?

47:09.500 --> 47:13.500
Well, there's a big difference between your personal.

47:13.500 --> 47:15.500
You're talking about the shaman.

47:15.500 --> 47:16.500
The water you spread.

47:16.500 --> 47:17.500
The water you spread.

47:17.500 --> 47:18.500
The water you spread.

47:18.500 --> 47:19.500
The water you spread.

47:19.500 --> 47:20.500
The water you spread.

47:20.500 --> 47:21.500
The water you spread.

47:21.500 --> 47:23.500
I know how it works.

47:23.500 --> 47:25.500
I understand how to show hole.

47:25.500 --> 47:28.500
We're just saying for this, do we have to show hole?

47:28.500 --> 47:29.500
I think the wire you're on.

47:29.500 --> 47:31.500
Because you're changing.

47:31.500 --> 47:34.500
You're kind of changing what the original pitch was.

47:34.500 --> 47:36.500
Because the original pitch was to show ass.

47:36.500 --> 47:40.500
So to me, that would kind of mean like a thong.

47:40.500 --> 47:41.500
It wasn't a tight.

47:41.500 --> 47:42.500
Yeah.

47:42.500 --> 47:43.500
It was a great ass.

47:43.500 --> 47:45.500
I think even a lot of people said that.

47:45.500 --> 47:46.500
Yeah.

47:46.500 --> 47:47.500
Yeah. That works.

47:47.500 --> 47:48.500
That works.

47:48.500 --> 47:49.500
The same time.

47:49.500 --> 47:50.500
I think it won't.

47:51.500 --> 47:52.500
I know the clams are really.

47:52.500 --> 47:53.500
We're talking about hole.

47:53.500 --> 47:55.500
The clams are really pundit.

47:55.500 --> 47:56.500
It's really getting.

47:56.500 --> 47:57.500
All right.

47:57.500 --> 47:58.500
Pretty crazy up here.

47:58.500 --> 47:59.500
Moving on.

47:59.500 --> 48:01.500
Moving on to the last branded opportunity.

48:01.500 --> 48:04.500
This is called this shows grass.

48:04.500 --> 48:07.500
Show your love and appreciation for hosts.

48:07.500 --> 48:08.500
Millie and Elise.

48:08.500 --> 48:10.500
By avoiding this podcast altogether.

48:10.500 --> 48:13.500
From the initial launch of the show on December 13th.

48:13.500 --> 48:14.500
Om.

48:14.500 --> 48:17.500
If anyone asks why you aren't listening to go touch grass.

48:17.500 --> 48:22.500
The perfect excuse is that the hosts skew a little too blue for your tastes.

48:22.500 --> 48:26.500
Unlike advertisers with ad space on go touch grass.

48:26.500 --> 48:28.500
People will buy that.

48:28.500 --> 48:31.500
This business opportunity is not a product.

48:31.500 --> 48:35.500
Just sometimes the best way you can show love is to let it go.

48:35.500 --> 48:37.500
Avoid the show now.

48:37.500 --> 48:39.500
Avoid the show now.

48:39.500 --> 48:41.500
Avoid the show now.

48:41.500 --> 48:43.500
Avoid the show now.

48:43.500 --> 48:48.500
You get to Andad copy.

48:48.500 --> 48:55.500
The ad copy assumes that a chant will start.

48:55.500 --> 49:04.500
Cool question.

49:04.500 --> 49:07.500
You know.

49:07.500 --> 49:11.500
I'm just going to say that.

49:11.500 --> 49:14.500
You know what I mean?

49:14.500 --> 49:15.500
You know what I mean?

49:15.500 --> 49:16.500
You know what I mean?

49:16.500 --> 49:17.500
You know what I mean?

49:17.500 --> 49:18.500
You know what I mean?

49:18.500 --> 49:19.500
Listen.

49:19.500 --> 49:20.500
I'll call up all the photobic card.

49:20.500 --> 49:21.500
I'll call up a fucking card.

49:21.500 --> 49:22.500
You better listen.

49:22.500 --> 49:23.500
Yeah.

49:23.500 --> 49:24.500
The cards are out.

49:24.500 --> 49:25.500
And the cards are out.

49:25.500 --> 49:26.500
Listen.

49:26.500 --> 49:27.500
We're from Bushwake.

49:27.500 --> 49:28.500
What's looking pull our tarot cards?

49:28.500 --> 49:29.500
We don't give up.

49:29.500 --> 49:30.500
I'm looking pull a card.

49:30.500 --> 49:33.500
I got my Metro card credit cards that I'm not paying.

49:33.500 --> 49:35.500
That is cards.

49:35.500 --> 49:39.500
I'll pull them all out and say that if you feel like we're too

49:39.500 --> 49:40.500
for us.

49:40.500 --> 49:41.500
That's a U-Prob.

49:41.500 --> 49:42.500
Yeah.

49:42.500 --> 49:44.500
We're batting 400 here with these branded opportunities.

49:44.500 --> 49:45.500
So in summary.

49:45.500 --> 49:47.500
We're going to read this last one.

49:47.500 --> 49:49.500
The last one is out.

49:49.500 --> 49:50.500
The last one is out.

49:50.500 --> 49:51.500
The first one is out.

49:51.500 --> 49:54.500
I think if you want us to show our booty hole on man.

49:54.500 --> 49:56.500
I'm going to have to say no to that.

49:56.500 --> 49:57.500
It's like a tight.

49:57.500 --> 49:58.500
Like I don't know.

49:58.500 --> 49:59.500
I feel like.

49:59.500 --> 50:00.500
To grow stronger.

50:00.500 --> 50:02.500
Another in law follows me on man.

50:02.500 --> 50:04.500
This whole thing is a blue sky.

50:04.500 --> 50:05.500
All right.

50:05.500 --> 50:06.500
We're just tossing out ideas.

50:06.500 --> 50:08.500
And it looks like the two that we settled on is that we're going to create

50:08.500 --> 50:11.500
a licensed and branded go-touch grass.

50:11.500 --> 50:12.500
Shastity belt.

50:12.500 --> 50:13.500
Shastity belt.

50:13.500 --> 50:14.500
Yeah.

50:14.500 --> 50:16.500
Which will not be for the faint of heart or randy of

50:16.500 --> 50:17.500
Loins.

50:17.500 --> 50:21.500
And then we're also going to create a dirt slash sod bag.

50:21.500 --> 50:25.500
Is that the longer you own it, the longer the grass is on the

50:25.500 --> 50:27.500
bag, growing out from it.

50:27.500 --> 50:30.500
That somehow promotes the show or not.

50:30.500 --> 50:31.500
Or saw.

50:31.500 --> 50:34.500
That's always greener on the other side of the pod.

50:34.500 --> 50:35.500
Exactly.

50:35.500 --> 50:36.500
On the other side of the side.

50:36.500 --> 50:37.500
Yeah.

50:37.500 --> 50:38.500
Yeah.

50:38.500 --> 50:39.500
I'm feeling really good about these opportunities.

50:39.500 --> 50:40.500
Yeah.

50:40.500 --> 50:41.500
I'm feeling really good about them.

50:41.500 --> 50:42.500
I'm feeling really good about them.

50:42.500 --> 50:43.500
I'm feeling really good about them.

50:43.500 --> 50:49.500
I'm feeling really good about people having been introed to y'all.

50:49.500 --> 50:53.500
I can't imagine anyone listens to this episode and doesn't want to also go check

50:53.500 --> 50:54.500
out.

50:54.500 --> 50:56.500
Go touch grass on the headgum network.

50:56.500 --> 50:59.500
So we've come to this episode.

50:59.500 --> 51:00.500
Thank you.

51:00.500 --> 51:05.500
I can imagine someone listens to this episode and doesn't immediately refer

51:05.500 --> 51:06.500
you to a therapist.

51:06.500 --> 51:11.500
In that there is lots of every episode.

51:11.500 --> 51:12.500
Yes.

51:12.500 --> 51:15.500
Honestly, a lot of the listeners themselves.

51:15.500 --> 51:17.500
A lot of the YouTube comments are like.

51:17.500 --> 51:21.500
My daily dose of poison can't wait to listen to this and then be upset for

51:21.500 --> 51:22.500
the rest of the day.

51:22.500 --> 51:23.500
Yeah.

51:23.500 --> 51:24.500
I did see.

51:24.500 --> 51:27.500
I did look at the headgum podcast and saw.

51:27.500 --> 51:29.500
I see you a lot of the vitriolic.

51:29.500 --> 51:31.500
Is vitriolic a word here?

51:31.500 --> 51:32.500
Yeah.

51:32.500 --> 51:33.500
Oh yeah.

51:33.500 --> 51:35.500
I mean, what happened about this?

51:36.500 --> 51:38.500
That sourced people.

51:38.500 --> 51:41.500
Well, you said that we should put our booty hold on.

51:41.500 --> 51:42.500
Yeah.

51:42.500 --> 51:44.500
Well, you owe me a Rolex watch.

51:44.500 --> 51:47.500
Also, as we established, is it your promising luxury?

51:47.500 --> 51:49.500
Goods to people.

51:49.500 --> 51:51.500
I did not deliver.

51:51.500 --> 51:52.500
I get that.

51:52.500 --> 51:54.500
Do you want to bring them clams?

51:54.500 --> 51:55.500
Yeah.

51:55.500 --> 51:56.500
You said some clams could see.

51:56.500 --> 51:57.500
Yeah.

51:57.500 --> 51:59.500

I mean, we just gave you 10 reasons why people are like that.

52:06.500 --> 52:07.500
I can work with that.

52:07.500 --> 52:11.500
I just wanted to have some ammunition going into the next.

52:11.500 --> 52:12.500
There are a lot of things.

52:12.500 --> 52:15.500
You're not even here and you made this room stink.

52:15.500 --> 52:17.500

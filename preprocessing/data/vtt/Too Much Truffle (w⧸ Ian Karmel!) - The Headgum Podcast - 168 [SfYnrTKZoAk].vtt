WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
New Switchboard. Really?

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Yeah.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
You're in charge of it?

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Eight different inputs for some reason.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Every time I'm in here, something changes,

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
and I'm expected to, like, you guys were just saying,

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
roll with the punchline.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Is that a cork?

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
You got a cork over there?

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
It feels like some kind of move.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Yeah.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Like, I'm, like, going to throw plates over my shoulder.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Beautiful.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
You got a Greek restaurant.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Exactly.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Yeah, exactly right.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
To Verna Tonis.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
It's an Albu.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Tony Zero.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
To Verna Tonis.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Zero.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
That's really good.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
My new alias is Tony Zero.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
I like that.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Feel free to call me Tony Zero.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Tony Zero.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Yeah.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
I'll call you in the middle of the night and call you.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
You're already heard his voice,

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
but we've got Ian Carmelo from all fantasy.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Everything on the show.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
A mirror blooming fell down the sack.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
And we'll sudden break it down.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
On you can't have sky on the back.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Is it kind of?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Did he say that correct?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Can't have sky.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
It's close enough.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
What is it?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
It's fine.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
That's Ali.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Ali Khan.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
It's a guy.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
I've thought about cutting out.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
I've thought about,

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
okay.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
I'm having to like be having to have my name out on the record somewhere.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Oh.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
I've thought about a new last name.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
What do you guys think?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Holy shit.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
I think we should come up with one right now.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Yeah.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
On your zero score.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
On your 20 zero score.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
On your 20 zero score.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
On your 20 zero score.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
That's really good.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Is that a high thinner?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Is that the whole kind of sky?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Or Tony Zero.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Kevin Kai.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
First Kevin Kai on the Tony Zero.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
It's it's Russian.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
It's the whole thing.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Yeah.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
What about on your Taylor sour?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
That's pretty good.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Yeah.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Everybody.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Everybody.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Let's get it to it.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Get stole.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Get stole.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Get stole.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Get stole.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
So it never gets there.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
But is that the first version of the second version of that song?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Thank you.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
I ask every time and no one reacts.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Come on.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
You have to let us know.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
It's the second version.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Oh, okay.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
It started.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Versus the R word.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Is that the different one?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Got it.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Was that in the first version?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
It's let's get R word R word R word.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Let's get R word in here.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
I know you play the good one.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
But I always worry that you're going to play the bad one.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Like I always worry.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
I'm like, today's gag is that you're going to play the bad one.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
We've got to do it once.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
No.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
No.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
People won't be afraid anymore.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I'm the only one who's expressed fear on this.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I forget that that first version of the song even exists.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
It was my first thought.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
It was my first thought.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Are you from Boston?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
No.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
No.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Do you ask everybody that?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
It's my voice.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
My dad is from Brooklyn.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm from Portland, Oregon.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
And no one there has an accent.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Why have some weird hybrid accent that I just can't explain?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
I've never done this before.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
I've never done this before.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
But I'm sorry to interrupt.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
You did it all the time.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Well, I was just saying you want to plug your book.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Oh, well, that doesn't come out until it doesn't come out until.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Okay.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Yes, I do.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
It's like even here.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Harry Potter.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
And the source of stuff.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Well, if you're in the jail, you'll be okay.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
For a lot of officers.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
I knew that.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
I knew that.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
I knew that.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
I knew that.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
I knew that.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
I knew that.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
I knew that.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
I knew that.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I knew that.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I knew that.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Are you going to do an audio book?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Because you have the voice for it.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
I am going to, but I'm going to do it as Gilbert Godfrey out of respect.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Then let's hear that.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
I was born and be veterinarian.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
He's been pretty good.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Yeah.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
All right.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Is he dead?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
He died.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yes.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
When?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Shark attack.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
He wasn't Boston.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
He was in the Charles River in a shark swallowed him home.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Well, well, shark.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Jesus.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
You're throwing tea.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Yes.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
You spelling the tea.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Gilbert Godfrey.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Um.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Wait, Ania's new last name.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Where's it?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Wow.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
What's that?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Turn it down.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
What'd you say?

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
I was saying we didn't crack the Ania's new last name.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Really quick before you do that.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Is that the first version of the bomb theme?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
What?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
It's Janet.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
No.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
You can see it.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
It's in show.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
It's in show.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
It's in show.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
It's in show.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
It's in show.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Julia.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
I think it's a little bit of a curse.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Sorry, I really wanted to say that.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
But it's a curse.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Emily.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Emily.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Marley.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Emily.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Emily.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Emily.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Emily.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Emily.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Emily.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Emily.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Emily.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Emily.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Emily.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Emily.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Emily.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Emily.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Emily.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Emily.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Emily.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Emily?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Yes.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.480
You're named as someone really famous, so people feel like you didn't really make it there on your own.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.640
I'm Yenobisco.

04:47.640 --> 04:48.340
That's right.

04:48.340 --> 04:50.540
That's a good, that's a good idea.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.740
I'd port Manto.

04:51.740 --> 04:52.740
Wouldn't it, Nabisco?

04:52.740 --> 04:53.240
Yeah.

04:53.240 --> 04:54.740
It's a national bisquit company.

04:54.740 --> 04:55.740
Oh my, is that?

04:55.740 --> 04:57.240
Isn't that like a port Manto?

04:57.240 --> 04:58.740
It's like national bisquit company.

04:58.740 --> 05:00.400
It's a nice, nice, nice, nice guy.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.400
I'm your son.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.680
You could get your name in Natalie Port Manto.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.060
That's not like that.

05:05.060 --> 05:07.060
That's really good.

05:07.060 --> 05:09.060
Not only port Manto.

05:09.060 --> 05:10.060
That's really good.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.060
You're in it coming in hot.

05:11.060 --> 05:18.740
I'm drinking a dandelion ginger, botanical tea.

05:18.740 --> 05:25.980
I did, um, I did a commercial one with what's his name, Dave Batista, and he kept asking

05:25.980 --> 05:28.180
for these like ginger-choose.

05:28.180 --> 05:29.180
You probably shot stuff with him.

05:29.180 --> 05:30.180
We did.

05:30.180 --> 05:31.180
Yeah.

05:31.180 --> 05:32.180
Did he ask for the ginger-choose?

05:32.180 --> 05:33.820
He did not ask for ginger-choose, but he...

05:33.820 --> 05:35.060
Was he sick?

05:35.060 --> 05:36.060
He was awesome.

05:36.900 --> 05:42.660
He was the most diligent about learning his lines out of anyone we ever worked with.

05:42.660 --> 05:47.620
He was like super off-book, and when we changed lines like the last second, it really threw

05:47.620 --> 05:48.620
him on.

05:48.620 --> 05:53.820
He really wanted to do this like stupid, cop-and-terrogation sketch he wanted to really

05:53.820 --> 05:54.820
nail it.

05:54.820 --> 05:55.820
Yeah.

05:55.820 --> 05:56.820
He was really a true sweet guy.

05:56.820 --> 05:57.820
Yeah.

05:57.820 --> 05:58.820
But that's wrestling back.

05:58.820 --> 05:59.820
Died to the shark attack.

05:59.820 --> 06:00.820
Yeah.

06:00.820 --> 06:01.820
He was a real sweet guy.

06:01.820 --> 06:02.820
But that's wrestling back.

06:02.820 --> 06:03.820
Died to the shark attack.

06:03.820 --> 06:05.980
He was the same energy as him eating a ginger-choose though.

06:05.980 --> 06:10.700
I feel like people who have made it have those specific snacks that only rich people

06:10.700 --> 06:11.700
can ask.

06:11.700 --> 06:15.540
It's probably like Dave Daven-I, who I would have put in the same kind of...

06:15.540 --> 06:19.380
Climb the ranks of professional wrestling, too, eventually.

06:19.380 --> 06:20.740
It's a falth from great.

06:20.740 --> 06:21.740
Fulfill.

06:21.740 --> 06:25.140
They come famous for having weird squiggly lines on our bald head.

06:25.140 --> 06:28.380
How do you all find that out until you shape your head for the first time, right?

06:28.380 --> 06:29.380
I don't want that.

06:29.380 --> 06:30.380
I got a brain head.

06:30.380 --> 06:31.380
Yeah.

06:31.380 --> 06:32.380
I mean, some people you can kind of guess.

06:32.380 --> 06:33.380
Yeah.

06:33.380 --> 06:34.380
I got to be smooth.

06:34.380 --> 06:39.380
I haven't ever picked it, but I got to be smooth.

06:39.380 --> 06:40.380
Have you buzzed it?

06:40.380 --> 06:41.380
I've buzzed it.

06:41.380 --> 06:42.380
I've buzzed it.

06:42.380 --> 06:43.380
Well, you would...

06:43.380 --> 06:44.380
On the show.

06:44.380 --> 06:45.380
Still right now.

06:45.380 --> 06:46.380
I've shaved my head on the show.

06:46.380 --> 06:47.380
Live show.

06:47.380 --> 06:50.380
If enough people have won me, a mirror will.

06:50.380 --> 06:51.380
Six people.

06:51.380 --> 06:52.380
Yeah.

06:52.380 --> 06:53.380
Enough people.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.380
Six people.

06:54.380 --> 06:55.380
Yeah.

06:55.380 --> 06:56.380
Yeah.

06:56.380 --> 06:57.380
Enough people.

06:57.380 --> 06:59.380
You should cut your hair because you've been growing up for three years.

06:59.380 --> 07:00.380
That's the bigger reveal.

07:00.380 --> 07:01.380
Yeah.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.380
But I fear that, like, without the hair.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.380
I'm sort of nothing better.

07:03.380 --> 07:04.380
That's real.

07:04.380 --> 07:05.380
That's real hair.

07:05.380 --> 07:06.380
Yeah.

07:06.380 --> 07:07.380
I thought it was a wig.

07:07.380 --> 07:08.380
Hi, praise.

07:08.380 --> 07:09.380
Yeah.

07:09.380 --> 07:11.380
Did you go a year without cutting your hair during the pandemic?

07:11.380 --> 07:12.380
No.

07:12.380 --> 07:13.380
No.

07:13.380 --> 07:14.380
No.

07:14.380 --> 07:15.380
Because I didn't really...

07:15.380 --> 07:18.380
I just sort of went business as usual.

07:18.380 --> 07:19.380
Yeah.

07:19.380 --> 07:20.380
Yeah.

07:20.380 --> 07:21.380
I didn't really like it.

07:21.380 --> 07:22.380
I didn't really like it.

07:22.380 --> 07:23.380
Change my mouth.

07:23.380 --> 07:24.380
Yeah.

07:24.380 --> 07:25.380
I don't care.

07:25.380 --> 07:26.380
It's good with these things.

07:26.380 --> 07:27.380
Yeah.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.380
No.

07:28.380 --> 07:29.380
Face.

07:29.380 --> 07:30.380
Yeah.

07:30.380 --> 07:31.380
Yeah.

07:31.380 --> 07:34.380
I broke up with a guy during the pandemic because of that.

07:34.380 --> 07:35.380
Because he just kept living his life.

07:35.380 --> 07:36.380
Yeah.

07:36.380 --> 07:38.380
He was like texting me from, like, will not.

07:38.380 --> 07:39.380
Okay.

07:39.380 --> 07:40.380
He kept texting me.

07:40.380 --> 07:41.380
He's like, I'm at home deep home.

07:41.380 --> 07:43.380
And I was like, what's happening?

07:43.380 --> 07:44.380
Yeah.

07:44.380 --> 07:45.380
I guess that if you're going to be in a building.

07:45.380 --> 07:47.380
That was the one with the highest ceilings.

07:47.380 --> 07:49.380
But also the one with the lowest vaccination rate.

07:49.380 --> 07:50.380
I don't know.

07:50.380 --> 07:56.380
Definitely like the least, like, what's the word?

07:56.380 --> 07:57.380
Like, like, it was not a...

07:57.380 --> 07:58.380
You don't need anything in there.

07:58.380 --> 07:59.380
No.

07:59.380 --> 08:00.380
There's no, there's, like, CVS.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.380
I can see he needed something, but...

08:02.380 --> 08:03.380
Yeah.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.380
But, like, a home deep is like, maybe I'll make a potato gun.

08:05.380 --> 08:06.380
Yeah.

08:06.380 --> 08:07.380
No.

08:07.380 --> 08:09.380
I feel like people were doing a lot of ad-home projects.

08:09.380 --> 08:10.380
Like, that year.

08:10.380 --> 08:11.380
But was like, essentials?

08:11.380 --> 08:12.380
That essentials?

08:12.380 --> 08:13.380
Is that worth risking?

08:13.380 --> 08:14.380
Your people's on the side.

08:14.380 --> 08:15.380
Unbelievable.

08:15.380 --> 08:16.380
You kind of do it.

08:16.380 --> 08:17.380
You guys are similar.

08:17.380 --> 08:18.380
Really?

08:24.380 --> 08:25.380
Bond of the week.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.380
Daniel Craig is out as Bond.

08:27.380 --> 08:28.380
He's out.

08:28.380 --> 08:29.380
Yeah.

08:29.380 --> 08:30.380
Did that actually...

08:30.380 --> 08:31.380
He's not...

08:31.380 --> 08:32.380
He's been...

08:32.380 --> 08:33.380
His last movie was the last movie he did.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.380
Oh, my God.

08:34.380 --> 08:37.380
So every week until the next James's cast, we're loving up our pick for the next double of seven.

08:37.380 --> 08:38.380
Okay.

08:38.380 --> 08:40.380
My pick this week is Wanda Sikes.

08:40.380 --> 08:42.380
That would be very good.

08:42.380 --> 08:43.380
James Bonda.

08:43.380 --> 08:44.380
Sikes.

08:44.380 --> 08:46.380
Can I do an impression on Wanda Sikes?

08:46.380 --> 08:48.380
Is that gonna be good?

08:48.380 --> 08:49.380
I'd like to hear it.

08:49.380 --> 08:50.380
If I...

08:50.380 --> 08:51.380
Is that okay?

08:51.380 --> 08:52.380
We've already got what we're saying.

08:52.380 --> 08:53.380
We've already got what we're saying.

08:53.380 --> 08:54.380
We feel like we're good.

08:54.380 --> 08:55.380
Mary.

08:55.380 --> 08:56.380
Is that?

08:56.380 --> 08:57.380
That's really good, right?

08:57.380 --> 08:58.380
I didn't feel like it was worth it.

08:58.380 --> 08:59.380
That was Wanda Sikes.

08:59.380 --> 09:01.380
Who stopped by the studio?

09:01.380 --> 09:02.380
Oh, we're awesome.

09:02.380 --> 09:07.380
Deeply video about that.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.380
She did not appear on camera because of the song.

09:09.380 --> 09:11.380
I'm going to say he was lipstick.

09:11.380 --> 09:12.380
As she said.

09:12.380 --> 09:13.380
That's right.

09:13.380 --> 09:14.380
Yeah.

09:14.380 --> 09:15.380
I'm here.

09:15.380 --> 09:16.380
Bond of the week.

09:16.380 --> 09:17.380
It matters.

09:17.380 --> 09:18.380
It matters.

09:18.380 --> 09:19.380
No, it matters.

09:19.380 --> 09:21.380
It really doesn't.

09:23.380 --> 09:24.380
Logan Paul.

09:24.380 --> 09:25.380
Why?

09:25.380 --> 09:26.380
Because he's jacked.

09:27.380 --> 09:28.380
Yeah.

09:28.380 --> 09:29.380
That's suck.

09:29.380 --> 09:30.380
On you.

09:30.380 --> 09:31.380
Pierce Brosnan.

09:31.380 --> 09:32.380
And we thought about him.

09:32.380 --> 09:33.380
He already did it.

09:33.380 --> 09:34.380
He seems like he's got it.

09:34.380 --> 09:35.380
He could come back.

09:35.380 --> 09:36.380
He had it.

09:36.380 --> 09:37.380
He has it.

09:37.380 --> 09:38.380
He could come back.

09:38.380 --> 09:39.380
That could be cool.

09:39.380 --> 09:40.380
People are doing the throwback thing.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.380
Yeah.

09:41.380 --> 09:42.380
Maybe.

09:42.380 --> 09:43.380
You don't have to be upset.

09:43.380 --> 09:44.380
No, it's...

09:44.380 --> 09:45.380
Yeah.

09:45.380 --> 09:47.380
Because like any little thing can throw me off.

09:47.380 --> 09:48.380
The entire hour.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.380
You know that a bit.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.380
And this is it.

09:50.380 --> 09:51.380
Why does it bother you so much?

09:51.380 --> 09:52.380
The idea of Pierce Brosnan.

09:52.380 --> 09:54.380
Well, because I sort of have this like agenda almost.

09:54.380 --> 09:55.380
Like how I want the show to go, right?

09:55.380 --> 09:58.380
And then that was a hard left turn for you.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.380
That was almost the opposite.

10:00.380 --> 10:01.380
I thought you were going to say want this.

10:01.380 --> 10:04.380
Which I was then going to perform to get mad at you for.

10:04.380 --> 10:05.380
Because I chose it.

10:05.380 --> 10:06.380
You thought she was going to say it.

10:06.380 --> 10:07.380
But you said it first.

10:07.380 --> 10:08.380
That was your first one.

10:08.380 --> 10:10.380
He thought I was going to make like a joke and say his idea.

10:10.380 --> 10:11.380
And then it's like grace cutting.

10:11.380 --> 10:12.380
No, I thought there'd be like parallel thinking.

10:12.380 --> 10:14.380
And then I would like playfully be like, oh, I'll piss.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.380
But like it's fun.

10:15.380 --> 10:16.380
Now I'm actually mad.

10:16.380 --> 10:19.380
The energy in this room has changed.

10:19.380 --> 10:20.380
Yeah.

10:20.380 --> 10:21.380
It's usually entirely this.

10:21.380 --> 10:22.380
Yeah.

10:22.380 --> 10:23.380
This is the whole thing.

10:23.380 --> 10:24.380
This week, minutes were late.

10:24.380 --> 10:28.380
I think my mustache is having sort of like a leveling effect on them.

10:28.380 --> 10:29.380
Because we both have mustache.

10:29.380 --> 10:30.380
Yeah.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.380
You should sort of like a we feel so important.

10:33.380 --> 10:34.380
Brothers.

10:34.380 --> 10:35.380
My brothers.

10:35.380 --> 10:36.380
Yes.

10:36.380 --> 10:37.380
Yours is better.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.380
No, I think yours is better.

10:39.380 --> 10:40.380
No, my minstum.

10:40.380 --> 10:41.380
That's alright.

10:41.380 --> 10:42.380
Yeah.

10:42.380 --> 10:47.380
You have a hero when she must.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.380
I bought it the week.

10:48.380 --> 10:50.380
I think we'll bronge him.

10:50.380 --> 10:51.380
He's on this way out of the NBA.

10:51.380 --> 10:52.380
And the next couple of years.

10:52.380 --> 10:53.380
Yeah.

10:53.380 --> 10:54.380
He was shift him right into the bond print.

10:54.380 --> 10:55.380
LeBond James.

10:55.380 --> 10:56.380
LeBond James.

10:56.380 --> 10:57.380
He's best trained.

10:57.380 --> 10:58.380
Yeah.

10:58.380 --> 11:00.380
He was great in in train wreck.

11:00.380 --> 11:01.380
Yeah.

11:01.380 --> 11:02.380
And I think he was really bad in space gym too.

11:02.380 --> 11:03.380
Is that fair?

11:03.380 --> 11:06.380
It's kind of like to put it in the basketball metaphor.

11:06.380 --> 11:08.380
Going since he and his a large fan too.

11:08.380 --> 11:09.380
Oops.

11:09.380 --> 11:13.380
You don't want to give the role player too much playing time.

11:13.380 --> 11:14.380
Yes.

11:14.380 --> 11:16.380
Sometimes it's like instant offense off the bench.

11:16.380 --> 11:17.380
Six minutes a game.

11:17.380 --> 11:19.380
And that's what LeBond did acting wise.

11:19.380 --> 11:20.380
He was great in train wreck.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.380
Yeah.

11:21.380 --> 11:22.380
Bits and pieces.

11:22.380 --> 11:23.380
And they gave him the whole film.

11:23.380 --> 11:24.380
Yeah.

11:24.380 --> 11:25.380
Can I say something?

11:25.380 --> 11:26.380
And I'm not trying to do the whole like.

11:26.380 --> 11:27.380
I'm a girl.

11:27.380 --> 11:29.380
I don't have no idea what you just said.

11:29.380 --> 11:30.380
The first part.

11:30.380 --> 11:33.380
Like you don't like the guy who's like pretty good for six minutes a game to let him play

11:33.380 --> 11:34.380
for 42.

11:34.380 --> 11:37.380
Then it's like, oh, that's too much responsibility for that guy.

11:37.380 --> 11:38.380
Yeah.

11:38.380 --> 11:39.380
He's still got nothing.

11:39.380 --> 11:40.380
You basically.

11:40.380 --> 11:43.380
You know like Christine Baransky.

11:43.380 --> 11:47.380
If she's in a movie for like 20 minutes, you're like this.

11:47.380 --> 11:48.380
Yeah.

11:48.380 --> 11:49.380
Yeah.

11:49.380 --> 11:50.380
Maybe I don't want to see like two and a half.

11:50.380 --> 11:51.380
That's the bad example because I do want to see two.

11:51.380 --> 11:52.380
No.

11:52.380 --> 11:53.380
I don't even know.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.380
It's more special if it's just cut down.

11:55.380 --> 11:56.380
She's just like, she's good.

11:56.380 --> 11:57.380
She comes in.

11:57.380 --> 11:58.380
It does five.

11:58.380 --> 11:59.380
I broke the microphones.

11:59.380 --> 12:00.380
It's a magnet.

12:00.380 --> 12:01.380
It's like a string.

12:01.380 --> 12:02.380
In low numbers.

12:02.380 --> 12:03.380
They always say that.

12:03.380 --> 12:04.380
Yeah.

12:04.380 --> 12:06.380
And so LeBond only plays six minutes out of 42.

12:06.380 --> 12:07.380
Now LeBond is great at basketball.

12:07.380 --> 12:08.380
I'm saying acting wise.

12:08.380 --> 12:09.380
I see.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.380
You was good.

12:10.380 --> 12:11.380
That was like.

12:11.380 --> 12:13.380
I wonder if we give it to brawny.

12:13.380 --> 12:14.380
Just because, you know, considering.

12:14.380 --> 12:16.380
You might not play basketball again.

12:16.380 --> 12:17.380
Yeah.

12:17.380 --> 12:18.380
Yeah.

12:18.380 --> 12:19.380
Truffle.

12:19.380 --> 12:21.380
Truffle oil is kind of that kind of thing.

12:21.380 --> 12:22.380
Yeah.

12:22.380 --> 12:23.380
Yeah.

12:23.380 --> 12:24.380
A little bit of a drop.

12:24.380 --> 12:25.380
Just a little bit.

12:25.380 --> 12:26.380
Just a drop.

12:26.380 --> 12:27.380
Just a drop.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.380
Almost un-inperceptible amount.

12:29.380 --> 12:31.380
What the fuck has happened with Truffle?

12:31.380 --> 12:33.380
And I'm just transitioning to say that.

12:33.380 --> 12:34.380
Like this is comics.

12:34.380 --> 12:35.380
And LeBond.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.380
Byron Allen.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.380
Actually, you know what we could do.

12:37.380 --> 12:39.380
We do a segment on the show called Marie could takes the rain.

12:39.380 --> 12:40.380
Slash Marie could's brothers.

12:40.380 --> 12:41.380
She's a staffer.

12:41.380 --> 12:42.380
Oh, yeah.

12:42.380 --> 12:43.380
Um.

12:43.380 --> 12:44.380
She's not going to like that.

12:44.380 --> 12:45.380
She's not here for this.

12:45.380 --> 12:46.380
I don't know why I want to do it.

12:46.380 --> 12:49.380
Let's do E in takes the rains or E in's brothers.

12:49.380 --> 12:50.380
E in's brothers for four minutes.

12:50.380 --> 12:51.380
Four minutes on the board.

12:51.380 --> 12:52.380
Four minutes on the planet.

12:52.380 --> 12:53.380
Four minutes on the planet.

12:53.380 --> 12:54.380
And I could just gripe.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.380
You can just gripe it about anything.

12:56.380 --> 12:58.380
And you do what should I actually launch in a stand-up bit.

12:58.380 --> 12:59.380
So should I go for it.

12:59.380 --> 13:00.380
The clock is going.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.380
The clock.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.380
Yeah.

13:02.380 --> 13:03.380
I started talking about Truffle oil.

13:03.380 --> 13:04.380
So this is not a stand-up bit.

13:04.380 --> 13:07.380
But it's just like, take it a fucking pig.

13:07.380 --> 13:08.380
Five minutes.

13:08.380 --> 13:10.380
Take it down a fucking notch.

13:10.380 --> 13:11.380
With the Truffle oil.

13:11.380 --> 13:12.380
All right.

13:12.380 --> 13:13.380
Now this Truffle oil on everything.

13:13.380 --> 13:14.380
All of a sudden french fries.

13:14.380 --> 13:16.380
If you put into a Truffle oil on french fries.

13:16.380 --> 13:19.380
You and I think the french fries can't speak for themselves.

13:19.380 --> 13:23.380
Now the cell phone Truffle oil in the catch-up is well.

13:23.380 --> 13:25.380
It's on the fries and in the catch-up.

13:25.380 --> 13:26.380
Truffle catch-up.

13:26.380 --> 13:27.380
There's no escape.

13:27.380 --> 13:28.380
There's no escape.

13:28.380 --> 13:30.380
I mean, it's actually an instrument.

13:30.380 --> 13:32.380
I feel like I lost a minute on their pretty.

13:32.380 --> 13:33.380
Okay.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.380
All right.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.380
What is with these farm-to-table restaurants?

13:36.380 --> 13:37.380
Yeah.

13:37.380 --> 13:38.380
I mean, farm-to-table.

13:38.380 --> 13:39.380
That's one second.

13:39.380 --> 13:40.380
Farm.

13:40.380 --> 13:42.380
That's the only place they grow food.

13:42.380 --> 13:43.380
Every...

13:43.380 --> 13:45.380
And tables the only thing you can eat on them.

13:45.380 --> 13:47.380
Every restaurant is a farm-to-table.

13:47.380 --> 13:50.380
Orbys is a farm-to-table restaurant, folks.

13:50.380 --> 13:51.380
That's good.

13:51.380 --> 13:52.380
That's good.

13:52.380 --> 14:00.380
I've been having trouble looking my wife in the ice.

14:00.380 --> 14:13.380
And I know it's not because of her.

14:13.380 --> 14:19.380
And it usually happens after I go visit home.

14:19.380 --> 14:25.380
And, you know, my parents divorced when I was 10 years old.

14:26.380 --> 14:29.380
They've always had a cordial relationship,

14:29.380 --> 14:34.380
but spending any time with them as much as I love them,

14:34.380 --> 14:40.380
does make me think about how, at one point,

14:40.380 --> 14:45.380
they thought it could never happen to them.

14:45.380 --> 14:51.380
And, you know, my one-year anniversary is coming up in two weeks.

14:51.380 --> 15:03.380
And are we just in the part of our movie before everything goes wrong?

15:03.380 --> 15:16.380
And sometimes I feel like I have this bomb inside of me just waiting to go off.

15:16.380 --> 15:20.380
That's just going to destroy everything good.

15:20.380 --> 15:26.380
And in my life, and doesn't mean I'm not going to try.

15:26.380 --> 15:31.380
That doesn't mean I'm not going to still do my best to be a good partner in this relationship.

15:31.380 --> 15:35.380
It doesn't mean I'm not going to, you know, like, you know,

15:35.380 --> 15:38.380
listen to her and support her and do things with her.

15:38.380 --> 15:41.380
You know, like, on our anniversary, just because I have this fear,

15:41.380 --> 15:45.380
it doesn't mean I'm not going to take her out to dinner.

15:45.380 --> 15:49.380
And...

15:49.380 --> 15:53.380
And if we will surprise at that restaurant, and it's fucking trouble oil!

15:53.380 --> 15:55.380
Oh my god!

15:55.380 --> 15:57.380
I can't bear my sister like that!

15:57.380 --> 15:59.380
It's still my-

15:59.380 --> 16:01.380
I'm going to lose it.

16:01.380 --> 16:03.380
I wish we could get into it.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.380
We'd do up to take a break.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.380
But thanks for sharing.

16:06.380 --> 16:08.380
Come on.

16:10.380 --> 16:13.380
Straight into an athletic green zone.

16:14.380 --> 16:17.380
This show is sponsored by Better Hell.

16:17.380 --> 16:20.380
Guys, sometimes you feel uncertain in life, right?

16:20.380 --> 16:22.380
You don't know what's going to come next.

16:22.380 --> 16:26.380
You don't know what decision is going to lead you down the right path.

16:26.380 --> 16:27.380
All right?

16:27.380 --> 16:30.380
Whether it's career, relationships, family, friends, et cetera.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.380
Could be any number of things.

16:32.380 --> 16:35.380
You never really know how to make that decision.

16:35.380 --> 16:37.380
Or, you know, when things feel shaky,

16:37.380 --> 16:40.380
when you go through a period of multiple choices,

16:40.380 --> 16:43.380
you know, what's going to make me feel the most fulfilled?

16:43.380 --> 16:45.380
And that's where talking to a therapist can help.

16:45.380 --> 16:49.380
I'm in therapy every week, and like I say on this show,

16:49.380 --> 16:52.380
you know, it's not always because you have something pressing.

16:52.380 --> 16:54.380
And sometimes you will have something pressing,

16:54.380 --> 16:57.380
but, you know, it's good to just have someone there

16:57.380 --> 17:01.380
to like support you and guide you as you along your life's path

17:01.380 --> 17:03.380
and to, you know, allow you to be the best,

17:03.380 --> 17:07.380
most fully realized version of yourself.

17:08.380 --> 17:10.380
So, if you're thinking of starting therapy,

17:10.380 --> 17:11.380
give better help a try.

17:11.380 --> 17:14.380

17:14.380 --> 17:15.380

17:17.380 --> 17:19.380
and get matched with the license therapist

17:19.380 --> 17:22.380
and switch therapists at any time for no additional charge.

17:32.380 --> 17:33.380
Thanks, better help.

17:33.380 --> 17:35.380
Y'all, I want to tell you about a podcast that you're going to love.

17:35.380 --> 17:37.380
I mean, I don't know what else to say.

17:37.380 --> 17:39.380
It's called see the thing is, right?

17:39.380 --> 17:41.380
See the thing is.

17:41.380 --> 17:42.380
Am I right?

17:42.380 --> 17:45.380
And it's hosted by Grammy award winning R&B artist,

17:45.380 --> 17:48.380
Bridget Kelly, and me a personality,

17:48.380 --> 17:49.380
Mandy Bee.

17:49.380 --> 17:52.380
Every week, Bridget Kelly and Mandy Bee offer

17:52.380 --> 17:55.380
grown honest and slightly toxic perspectives

17:55.380 --> 17:57.380
on all things music, pop culture,

17:57.380 --> 17:59.380
and, of course, dating and relationships.

17:59.380 --> 18:01.380
I love talking about dating and L.A.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.380
and dating in New York and dating and upstate.

18:04.380 --> 18:06.380
And they basically do it every week.

18:06.380 --> 18:08.380
So if you like that segment on our show,

18:08.380 --> 18:11.380
you're going to love their entire show.

18:11.380 --> 18:13.380
Do you have a hard time finding new music?

18:13.380 --> 18:16.380
I know I do, I mostly listen to old music.

18:16.380 --> 18:19.380
Are you a millennial who misses what life was like

18:19.380 --> 18:20.380
in the 2000s?

18:20.380 --> 18:22.380
Are you interested in multiple perspectives

18:22.380 --> 18:24.380
on relationships and dating?

18:24.380 --> 18:26.380
Are you interested in non-male bashing podcasts

18:26.380 --> 18:29.380
that hold both sexes accountable?

18:29.380 --> 18:32.380
See the thing is, is a podcast

18:32.380 --> 18:35.380
that allows space for a wide range of thoughts

18:35.380 --> 18:37.380
and emotions.

18:37.380 --> 18:39.380
Sound and pretty good to me.

18:39.380 --> 18:40.380
Why don't you give it a shot?

18:40.380 --> 18:42.380
Most recently, the ladies that have sat down

18:42.380 --> 18:43.380
include Ari Lennox.

18:43.380 --> 18:45.380
I'm actually a huge Ari Lennox fan.

18:45.380 --> 18:46.380
That's fucking awesome.

18:46.380 --> 18:48.380
Big Freedia.

18:48.380 --> 18:50.380
Remema Van Lathen.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.380
Robert Glassper.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.380
Dere McCasson.

18:53.380 --> 18:54.380
Chloe Bailey.

18:54.380 --> 18:55.380
Mooney Long.

18:55.380 --> 18:56.380
And Neo.

18:56.380 --> 18:58.380
Haven't heard from Neo in a while.

18:58.380 --> 19:00.380
That would also be a good intro episode.

19:00.380 --> 19:01.380
I highly recommend.

19:01.380 --> 19:03.380
So join Bridget and Mandy every week

19:03.380 --> 19:04.380

Bye weekly.

19:16.380 --> 19:17.380
That's awesome.

19:17.380 --> 19:18.380
Check it out.

19:20.380 --> 19:21.380
I have something to say.

19:21.380 --> 19:22.380
Yeah.

19:22.380 --> 19:23.380
I don't think they're doing

19:23.380 --> 19:25.380
treffle oil so much anymore.

19:30.380 --> 19:47.380
Charming grains with glee over skillet grooves.

19:47.380 --> 19:52.380
Making rice Bernarley.

19:52.380 --> 19:55.380
You'll have tons of fun as the bomb

19:56.380 --> 20:00.380
but skulls as we sing the specs of char.

20:08.380 --> 20:10.380
Oiling slick a pan.

20:10.380 --> 20:13.380
Consistency of sand.

20:13.380 --> 20:16.380
Ruining bosmati.

20:16.380 --> 20:19.380
Bomb rain white rice scorched.

20:19.380 --> 20:24.380
Japanese short grain all types of rice ignite.

20:24.380 --> 20:28.380
Will you caught or rise?

20:28.380 --> 20:31.380
Will the grains see or thus?

20:31.380 --> 20:35.380
Good learning rice not barley.

20:35.380 --> 20:39.380
We'll forget soft rice as we force it

20:39.380 --> 20:43.380
down as we house demolish rice.

20:43.380 --> 20:53.380
There is crispy rice.

20:53.380 --> 20:57.380
That's not what I mean.

20:57.380 --> 21:00.380
Crispy rice is fine.

21:00.380 --> 21:05.380
I'm talking about when it hurts to eat.

21:05.380 --> 21:09.380
Because you burn the rice for hours.

21:09.380 --> 21:12.380
Is an instrumental break now so I really have to sit in it.

21:12.380 --> 21:13.380
I had to.

21:13.380 --> 21:16.380
I had to google the real lyrics because I thought

21:16.380 --> 21:18.380
I was having a psychic break.

21:18.380 --> 21:21.380
Because I thought there's no way he actually says barley.

21:22.380 --> 21:24.380
It's a barley.

21:24.380 --> 21:25.380
But he does.

21:29.380 --> 21:34.380
Many sauces help to attain the sinch.

21:34.380 --> 21:38.380
Hosing is my favorite.

21:38.380 --> 21:43.380
It'll glob on to every grain of rice.

21:43.380 --> 21:48.380
And it'll black in the whole walk.

21:48.380 --> 21:57.540
Remember me, when you make this shift, eating rice, that's gnarly.

21:57.540 --> 22:07.980
You can tell arms be in its jealous wake that I change the game of rice when I soldered

22:07.980 --> 22:11.260
that first grain.

22:11.260 --> 22:21.100
Now we all seem specks of char.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.540
Really good backing track.

22:22.540 --> 22:23.540
Yeah.

22:23.540 --> 22:24.540
That's the first note.

22:24.540 --> 22:25.540
It's not that the lyrics were good.

22:25.540 --> 22:30.020
It's just wild with the writers' track on like the amount of talent that is accessible.

22:30.020 --> 22:34.980
Why are you saying he's technically scabbling by having written that on that note?

22:34.980 --> 22:35.980
I saw it right back.

22:35.980 --> 22:36.980
Yeah.

22:36.980 --> 22:37.980
No.

22:37.980 --> 22:39.980
What did you say?

22:39.980 --> 22:43.620
Well, first of all, he has no idea, not like that was all out of the fucking left.

22:43.620 --> 22:45.620
And he has no questions.

22:45.620 --> 22:46.620
Yeah.

22:46.620 --> 22:48.260
What do you think when that was happening?

22:48.260 --> 22:51.900
Well, he actually has sort of insight to this because he's familiar with Amzby.

22:51.900 --> 22:52.900
Is he?

22:52.900 --> 22:53.900
Amzby?

22:53.900 --> 22:54.900
Amzby.

22:54.900 --> 22:57.540
Don't work in the Museum of Science and it is.

22:57.540 --> 22:59.540
I don't know what it stands for.

22:59.540 --> 23:00.540
Amzby?

23:00.540 --> 23:04.180
You remember at the old Edgum office at the end of the street, there was that O'Negiri restaurant

23:04.180 --> 23:05.180
named Amzby.

23:05.180 --> 23:06.180
Oh, yes, there was.

23:06.180 --> 23:07.180
Did you ever go there?

23:07.180 --> 23:08.180
No.

23:08.180 --> 23:09.180
Well, so.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.180
No.

23:10.180 --> 23:12.180
Do you know how you was talking and then the music started?

23:12.180 --> 23:13.180
Yeah.

23:13.180 --> 23:15.180
And then we were going to get into trouble, O'Negiri.

23:15.180 --> 23:17.180
Do you guys mind if we talk through these lyrics?

23:17.180 --> 23:20.260
Well, how did you even before we get there?

23:20.260 --> 23:23.900
I want to know what was going through your head when you heard Jeff starting to sing

23:23.900 --> 23:26.180
a new, like, do you know the song that it was done?

23:26.180 --> 23:27.180
What's that?

23:27.180 --> 23:28.180
Yeah, yeah.

23:28.180 --> 23:29.180
I sing.

23:29.180 --> 23:30.180
Yeah, yeah.

23:30.180 --> 23:31.180
I feel so great.

23:31.180 --> 23:33.180
As we walk in fields of joy.

23:33.180 --> 23:34.180
Yeah.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.180
Yeah.

23:35.180 --> 23:38.180
But he does say fields of barley at one point, which I was like, there's no way

23:38.180 --> 23:39.180
Sting actually says barley.

23:39.180 --> 23:41.180
Is that how you pick this song?

23:41.180 --> 23:43.180
I think we referenced it last week.

23:43.180 --> 23:45.180
And then I was like, oh, you're right songs.

23:45.180 --> 23:46.180
I was just saying that.

23:46.180 --> 23:49.180
I mean, I've never seen a mere brush you off the way he just said.

23:49.180 --> 23:50.180
But he said.

23:50.180 --> 23:51.180
He said.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.180
And I said a lot.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.180
Yeah.

23:53.180 --> 23:55.180
That, that, that amount was acceptable.

23:55.180 --> 24:00.180
Charring grains with glee over skillet grooves.

24:00.180 --> 24:03.180
C'making rice, Bernarley.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.180
What's Bernarley?

24:05.180 --> 24:07.180
Bernarley.

24:07.180 --> 24:09.180
Bernarley.

24:09.180 --> 24:10.180
Oh, Bernarley.

24:10.180 --> 24:11.180
Oh, yeah.

24:11.180 --> 24:12.180
I just set this up, I guess.

24:12.180 --> 24:13.180
Set the scene in a way.

24:13.180 --> 24:14.180
That's what I'm saying.

24:14.180 --> 24:15.180
No, you have to get me.

24:15.180 --> 24:16.180
No context that I thought.

24:16.180 --> 24:17.180
I thought I'd trouble oil.

24:17.180 --> 24:18.180
A song starts.

24:18.180 --> 24:21.180
And the audience hears this every time I do a fucking song, though.

24:21.180 --> 24:22.180
Right.

24:22.180 --> 24:23.180
I'm just fascinated by doing thinking chat.

24:23.180 --> 24:26.180
GBT definitely wrote this or chat.

24:26.180 --> 24:28.180
GBT will never be able to write this.

24:28.180 --> 24:31.180
I don't know.

24:31.180 --> 24:33.180
And like I earnestly didn't know which one I thought more.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.180
So we used to get lunch from mom's being.

24:35.180 --> 24:36.180
Right.

24:36.180 --> 24:39.180
Because we were mostly in the office every day at that point.

24:39.180 --> 24:40.180
Yeah.

24:40.180 --> 24:41.180
And this was an amendment like COVID.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.180
Yeah, this was the thick of it.

24:43.180 --> 24:46.180
The thick of not only the pandemic, but the own a gear itself.

24:46.180 --> 24:48.180
Because it was a lot of rice.

24:48.180 --> 24:50.180
It was a ton of mayo.

24:50.180 --> 24:51.180
Yeah.

24:51.180 --> 24:52.180
It was a dash of fish.

24:52.180 --> 24:53.180
Just a bit.

24:53.180 --> 24:54.180
Okay.

24:54.180 --> 24:55.180
Here's the thing.

24:55.180 --> 24:56.180
I think you're giving too much detail.

24:56.180 --> 24:57.180
Okay.

24:57.180 --> 24:58.180
So let's split the difference.

24:58.180 --> 24:59.180
All right.

24:59.180 --> 25:00.180
Let's speed it up.

25:00.180 --> 25:02.180
Let's let nine to 15 more seconds.

25:02.180 --> 25:03.180
Sort of back story.

25:03.180 --> 25:04.180
All right.

25:04.180 --> 25:05.180
So we started.

25:05.180 --> 25:06.180
We started.

25:06.180 --> 25:07.180
We started.

25:07.180 --> 25:08.180
We started.

25:08.180 --> 25:09.180
We started.

25:09.180 --> 25:10.180
We started.

25:10.180 --> 25:11.180
That's.

25:11.180 --> 25:12.180
That's about.

25:12.180 --> 25:13.180
You know, rice.

25:13.180 --> 25:14.180
Yeah.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.180
The years and just in the office and on the show.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.180
And then.

25:16.180 --> 25:17.180
Yeah.

25:17.180 --> 25:19.180
It started to become burning the rice, ruining the rice.

25:19.180 --> 25:20.180
We started doing solid priorities.

25:20.180 --> 25:22.180
And I'm putting together this album that I am going to try and record it.

25:22.180 --> 25:25.180
Sound city studios under Tony Berg's direct supervision.

25:25.180 --> 25:26.180
All right.

25:26.180 --> 25:27.180
Here we go.

25:27.180 --> 25:28.180
Charring greens with Glee over skillet groups.

25:28.180 --> 25:29.180
Make the right burn.

25:29.180 --> 25:30.180
Narlie.

25:30.180 --> 25:31.180
Yeah.

25:31.180 --> 25:35.180
You'll have tons of fun as the bomba skulls.

25:35.180 --> 25:38.180
As we sing the specs of char bomba.

25:38.180 --> 25:39.180
It's a type of rice.

25:39.180 --> 25:40.180
Oh, yes.

25:40.180 --> 25:41.180
Okay.

25:41.180 --> 25:42.180
Yeah.

25:42.180 --> 25:43.180
Yeah.

25:43.180 --> 25:44.180
Is this going to be unwrapped genius at any point?

25:44.180 --> 25:45.180
Or just just genius.

25:45.180 --> 25:46.180
Just.

25:46.180 --> 25:48.180
I would like to be able to dig into it a little bit more.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.180
Yeah.

25:49.180 --> 25:50.180
Yeah.

25:50.180 --> 25:51.180
Yeah.

25:51.180 --> 25:52.180
Wow.

25:52.180 --> 25:53.180
Whaling.

25:53.180 --> 25:54.180
Slick.

25:54.180 --> 25:55.180
That's amazing.

25:55.180 --> 25:59.180
Sorry for making a fucking joke that we stopped talking about your lyrics for three

25:59.180 --> 26:00.180
seconds.

26:00.180 --> 26:02.180
We're going to write back into it, aren't we?

26:02.180 --> 26:03.180
Oiling.

26:03.180 --> 26:04.180
Slick of Panors.

26:04.180 --> 26:05.180
I'm shit.

26:05.180 --> 26:06.180
But I'm hardly topping over here.

26:06.180 --> 26:07.180
Yeah.

26:07.180 --> 26:09.180
Tell me zero the rice genius.

26:09.180 --> 26:10.180
For Charlie.

26:10.180 --> 26:12.180
Please be sure to.

26:12.180 --> 26:15.180
Maybe that's the artist's name that I should really share.

26:15.180 --> 26:16.180
The rice genius.

26:16.180 --> 26:17.180
Yeah.

26:17.180 --> 26:18.180
It's like a pan.

26:18.180 --> 26:20.180
Consistency of sand.

26:20.180 --> 26:21.180
Burning rice not.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.180
And sorry.

26:22.180 --> 26:23.180
That's also something he says a lot.

26:23.180 --> 26:24.180
He doesn't have that consistency.

26:24.180 --> 26:26.180
So sand is or rice and sort of consistency.

26:26.180 --> 26:27.180
It's not.

26:27.180 --> 26:28.180
It's not.

26:28.180 --> 26:29.180
No.

26:29.180 --> 26:30.180
It's not saying.

26:30.180 --> 26:31.180
It isn't.

26:31.180 --> 26:32.180
It's like time is like guys.

26:32.180 --> 26:33.180
It's like.

26:33.180 --> 26:34.180
But like friends with sand.

26:34.180 --> 26:35.180
But they're too either.

26:35.180 --> 26:36.180
It looks.

26:36.180 --> 26:37.180
Well, not when you burn them.

26:37.180 --> 26:40.180
Or maybe I've been even the right to hand.

26:40.180 --> 26:46.180
Long rain, white rice scorched.

26:46.180 --> 26:48.180
Japanese, short grain.

26:48.180 --> 26:51.180
All types of rice ignite.

26:51.180 --> 26:52.180
On you.

26:52.180 --> 26:53.180
No notes.

26:53.180 --> 26:54.180
No notes.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.180
That's actually.

26:55.180 --> 26:58.180
But I thought maybe like, oh, that was a good, you know, in terms of acceptance.

26:58.180 --> 26:59.180
No, I said no notes.

26:59.180 --> 27:01.180
I said no notes.

27:01.180 --> 27:03.180
I was going to have a rather one.

27:03.180 --> 27:04.180
That.

27:04.180 --> 27:05.180
Yeah.

27:05.180 --> 27:06.180
I'm feeling neutral about that.

27:06.180 --> 27:07.180
Will you categorize?

27:07.180 --> 27:09.180
Will the grains stir us?

27:09.180 --> 27:11.180
Ruining.

27:11.180 --> 27:12.180
Rosemar.

27:12.180 --> 27:14.180
That's the one of the best.

27:14.180 --> 27:15.180
Yeah.

27:15.180 --> 27:16.180
That one fucking goes.

27:16.180 --> 27:17.180
Yeah.

27:17.180 --> 27:18.180
Because what's, what's the real song?

27:18.180 --> 27:19.180
And almost sounds like that.

27:19.180 --> 27:20.180
That's why I was looking at that.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.180
We forget the sun.

27:21.180 --> 27:22.180
You'll tell us.

27:22.180 --> 27:23.180
Yeah.

27:23.180 --> 27:24.180
Yeah.

27:24.180 --> 27:27.180
We'll forget soft rice as we force it down.

27:27.180 --> 27:30.180
As we house demolished rice.

27:30.180 --> 27:32.180
And then there was a bridge that you sort of.

27:32.180 --> 27:33.180
What happened?

27:33.180 --> 27:35.180
I feel like we're having fun.

27:35.180 --> 27:37.180
Somewhere along the way we lost.

27:37.180 --> 27:38.180
There.

27:38.180 --> 27:39.180
Yeah.

27:39.180 --> 27:40.180
The bridge.

27:40.180 --> 27:41.180
Yeah.

27:41.180 --> 27:42.180
Can we hear about that would have been?

27:42.180 --> 27:43.180
What those lyrics would have been?

27:43.180 --> 27:47.180
I never read rice that ain't busted.

27:47.180 --> 27:48.180
Don't fear.

27:48.180 --> 27:51.180
But I don't have other options.

27:51.180 --> 27:58.180
I would rather go hungry than not eat carbonized jasmine.

27:58.180 --> 28:02.180
As we sing the specs of charm.

28:02.180 --> 28:05.180
I want to amend my Bernie top and joke.

28:05.180 --> 28:07.180
And instead of call you Tim Rice.

28:07.180 --> 28:09.180
Oh, that's really good.

28:09.180 --> 28:10.180
That's good.

28:10.180 --> 28:12.180
For now, John Colab Raiders.

28:12.180 --> 28:15.180
That was the Tim Rice Rice Ricel.

28:15.180 --> 28:16.180
Oh, me on rice.

28:16.180 --> 28:17.180
That's a good one.

28:17.180 --> 28:19.180
Theodore Gaisel,

28:19.180 --> 28:22.180
Doc Rice.

28:22.180 --> 28:25.180
The egotia lyrics don't make much more sense.

28:25.180 --> 28:26.180
No.

28:26.180 --> 28:27.180
Thank you.

28:27.180 --> 28:28.180
Yeah.

28:28.180 --> 28:30.180
This is like every night in the rice.

28:30.180 --> 28:32.180
That's not what I mean.

28:32.180 --> 28:33.180
Yeah.

28:33.180 --> 28:34.180
Crispy rice is fine.

28:34.180 --> 28:39.180
I'm talking about when it hurts to you because you've burnt the rice for hours.

28:39.180 --> 28:44.640
Crispy, what is crispy rice? They just deep fry it or something like what like a tuna crispy rice

28:44.640 --> 28:49.180
Yeah, but how are they doing that? That's a great question little oil in the skillet and then yeah, you like

28:49.180 --> 28:54.540
I think you put in the rice cut it in swear. How you got to freeze it? It's just a bit of stays neat as a square

28:54.540 --> 28:56.540
He doesn't know

28:56.540 --> 29:00.880
Many sauces help to attain the sinj hoisin is my favorite

29:01.260 --> 29:05.960
It'll glob onto every grain of rice and black him the whole walk

29:06.620 --> 29:08.620
Okay

29:08.620 --> 29:17.140
You'll remember me when you make this shift eating rice. That's not real. You'll remember me

29:17.140 --> 29:24.820
You can tell arms be in its jealous wake because it doesn't exist now or that I changed their game of rice

29:26.980 --> 29:31.640
When I smoldered that first grain now we all syng specks of rice

29:31.720 --> 29:33.720
Namaste

29:33.720 --> 29:39.880
This is a pro burning rice song that's what everyone should be doing. It's sort of like evangelical now

29:39.880 --> 29:42.440
Can we do the whole thing about the actual lyrics go lie my line?

29:42.440 --> 29:44.440
Would you sing the entire thing again?

29:46.440 --> 29:52.480
The actual song like switches like first it's in first person, and then he's like talking to you

29:52.480 --> 29:57.240
Yeah, this is back when we found out sting was having sex for eight hours a day

29:58.200 --> 30:02.480
I think all made sex. I think he realized he could say anything in the songs

30:02.480 --> 30:05.320
Yeah, and 15 seconds into it would be like eight hours

30:07.600 --> 30:14.260
Never think about the lyrics. I mean they're very funny. Larry. Yeah, so this is the same album when he was just like I dream of rose

30:16.160 --> 30:18.360
That song also didn't mean it no, I didn't mean it

30:20.000 --> 30:21.200
This was his old

30:21.240 --> 30:22.240
I dream of that

30:23.240 --> 30:28.480
That's for you for next time. What do you want to get something out cuz we have nothing about you're right about the Truffle oil

30:28.720 --> 30:30.720
Thank you

30:30.720 --> 30:34.200
Yeah, I think that was early 2000s. We'll be like a cool

30:35.200 --> 30:41.800
2010. Yeah, yeah, I think you're right. I think that was probably that reference was at four years four years late at best

30:42.480 --> 30:47.560
But you're still upset about it, which is okay, and I see you in here you and I make we make space for you for that

30:47.560 --> 30:49.560
You're prolonging that's pants. Yeah

30:50.440 --> 30:56.040
What's the other one desert rose? I think it was cool desert rice. I dream of a baby

30:58.480 --> 31:00.480
Oh, no

31:03.320 --> 31:05.320
He starts singing about rice again

31:07.480 --> 31:09.480
Okay, so this is just the whole show now

31:12.120 --> 31:16.200
Rice rice. I made it through all the levels of the jeopardy

31:16.200 --> 31:18.440
Auditions

31:18.440 --> 31:24.040
Going to the point where they like we're like hey, we'll use like they were like we're going through my IMDB

31:24.040 --> 31:27.680
Wow to make sure like that nothing conflicted. Wow, and either

31:28.200 --> 31:33.960
They read my tweets and decided it didn't like me or something on my IMDB was like we can't put the sky on the show

31:33.960 --> 31:39.480
Or maybe you were like almost celebrity jeopardy and they're like this is what I think that I think I'm like in between

31:39.480 --> 31:42.240
I'm definitely not famous enough to be on celebrity gentlemen

31:42.240 --> 31:48.080

Yeah, then then I have to edit it in and it looks bad

32:00.800 --> 32:02.880
So I figured doing it on the frame would be better anyway

32:02.880 --> 32:06.320
Also the GoPro cut out so nobody can see me for the rest of that the show, but this is just plug it in

32:07.080 --> 32:09.720

Yeah, let's just take a look. You look moisturized. I think the people would love to see just take that white cable right there

32:19.560 --> 32:21.560
That's plugged into the switcher

32:21.560 --> 32:23.560

We used to do this for actual cash and I used to demo people. Yeah, but yeah, but I don't know if I can do whatever that prohibitively expense

33:23.640 --> 33:26.680
prohibitively expensive they tax you on transactions now

33:26.680 --> 33:29.400
So is this but is it would it be really for like a hundred dollars?

33:30.040 --> 33:33.880

34:07.320 --> 34:09.560
Sorry if I say there's one right answer

34:09.560 --> 34:15.640
Is it something you've said? I I mean even if it was you've never seen me at a barbecue, so

34:16.280 --> 34:18.280

Oh

34:42.600 --> 34:44.600
What is that?

34:44.600 --> 34:50.600
Correct, so we can play two ways you guys can still guess or we can do it if one person gets a wrong it's over

34:51.160 --> 34:56.120
Let's get through it. We're not gonna be here all day. We substitute. Okay, the correct answer was

34:58.200 --> 35:02.600
What is you call this hosting and then you say hello well

35:03.160 --> 35:07.160
Hello, yeah, interesting. Whoa, whoa

Look at me

35:17.240 --> 35:21.400
Yeah, tell look be away we've done this before and I'm not doing it again

35:21.400 --> 35:26.920
All right barbecue fouls for barbecue fouls for oh pump fake. I want 100 at the end

35:26.920 --> 35:28.120
Asshole

35:28.360 --> 35:31.000
We're doing 300 the worst song to hear it about review

35:31.960 --> 35:38.280
That be one of the stings on yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that that your rice carried it

35:39.000 --> 35:45.960
Of what is the goal what is your rice pair the correct answer is murder most foul my Bob

35:46.680 --> 35:51.800
What is that it's a 20 minute song about JFK's sashini assassination that came out recently

35:54.040 --> 35:56.040
Really what is he painted on

35:57.560 --> 35:59.400
He doesn't even really take a stance

36:01.960 --> 36:08.680
Yeah, that's why it's 20 minutes. He has to explain the whole thing trolls the board. I'll do some more time sadness for 200 please

36:08.680 --> 36:12.840
summer times sadness for 200 coming to terms on a roller coaster

36:16.680 --> 36:18.680
What does that mean in this

36:23.080 --> 36:25.080
Coming to terms with what

36:26.040 --> 36:28.040
That's the answer

36:28.120 --> 36:33.400
Is coming what is coming to terms with what with what you have to guess what coming to terms

36:33.400 --> 36:35.400
You said oh like you figured it out

36:35.400 --> 36:38.120
But that's not the gonna be the answer that's not a question

36:39.640 --> 36:44.920
The correct answer is what did Jeff experience on his 13th birthday after his parents sat him down to say they were getting into war

36:45.800 --> 36:48.680
This is that Disney world they told you at Disney world

36:49.400 --> 36:54.360
I think beginning of the day or not divorce at the beginning of the roller coaster the end of a day and then the next day

36:54.440 --> 36:58.280
Are your parents still together? They didn't get divorced, but they really thought they were going to

37:00.280 --> 37:03.880
Which is somehow worth and choose every maybe the thrill of telling you

37:12.840 --> 37:14.120
Yeah

37:14.120 --> 37:18.600
When did they tell you they weren't getting divorced and where was that ever did they just they just never didn't water

37:18.680 --> 37:20.680
Yes

37:21.960 --> 37:29.960
I used to wait because they might have been in the process for what they might still be in years. Yeah, yeah, you can control the board

37:31.320 --> 37:34.680
Fun in the sun 300 fun in the sun for 300

37:35.560 --> 37:38.120
Sewing seeds and watching them bare fruit. Oh

37:39.640 --> 37:41.640
What is the meaning of life?

37:42.120 --> 37:44.120
Oh

37:44.120 --> 37:49.320
Oh, he's thinking about it the meaning of all life or just maybe some people certain demos

37:51.960 --> 37:53.960
Clare clarifying question from the host

37:54.600 --> 38:00.600
True back with never do that. Yeah, all right. So is it the for what you said or what I said? I guess what you said

38:03.320 --> 38:07.960
What is planting anxious thoughts amongst friends and watching the group dissipate due to infighting?

38:07.960 --> 38:09.960
Yeah

38:09.960 --> 38:11.960
Water yeah

38:11.960 --> 38:18.040
Coming up right it is coming. What is although the droughts when you run out of water? There's no drought anymore sure for now for now

38:18.920 --> 38:23.240
Well, that's what they're telling us and that's what they would tell us before we actually said

38:23.480 --> 38:25.240
We should have a conspiracy segment

38:25.480 --> 38:30.280
But I have a couple ideas. Okay, the JFK. All right, we can do water. We already talked about that 11 today

38:30.280 --> 38:35.000
So don't ask about that. Oh, yeah, you want to pitch Ian this podcast that he has good let me have it

38:35.960 --> 38:37.960
You should know

38:56.440 --> 38:58.440

from

39:49.480 --> 39:51.480
Oh

39:52.200 --> 39:58.680
Women are from Venus. Yeah, the correct answer is what is when Venus and Serena met Jason and Randy wait yours was better

39:59.000 --> 40:03.640
I thought so yeah, well, I guess I don't know because it's sort of like a quad and so it's like

40:03.640 --> 40:08.920
Well when Harry met Sally or what this one would be one Venus. What's the quad do you think the William sisters are twins?

40:14.360 --> 40:17.240
Wait, what's a quad

40:17.240 --> 40:23.160
Like four people follow okay at once, but that doesn't for his answer was still better

40:23.880 --> 40:25.400
American chose the board

40:25.400 --> 40:30.280
Let's do the movie thing again. Would be summer blockbusters for 200 and absurdist drama

40:30.280 --> 40:33.960

Gotta get to this

40:41.480 --> 40:48.680
Yeah, hitting what is hitting the high notes. That's good. That's better so I'll give it to you what we were looking for was

40:49.720 --> 40:51.720
Sing an inside dang

40:54.600 --> 40:56.600
The whole game should just be this

40:57.240 --> 41:00.680
Yeah, we can see how Ian makes better movie type of two seconds

41:01.320 --> 41:03.320

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Execute on the

41:30.040 --> 41:36.440
That's the first time anyone's actually got that's a real question by the way my yeah, this isn't an impossible game to play

41:36.440 --> 41:38.680
Everybody likes to think that it's like gotcha journalism in a way

41:38.680 --> 41:45.640
But it's like terrible revengeers that you could get sort of yeah

41:46.120 --> 41:51.800
It's have you control the board so I can ignore the question. Let me bluff. I guess I can getaways for 300

41:52.280 --> 41:57.480
Important getaways for 300 the only place to get both rays of sun and council from above

Ian controls the board. It's neck and neck's great point. I'm here has no points, but a

42:32.360 --> 42:35.880
Onion Ian are tied by the way the prize. I think is like

42:36.840 --> 42:41.560
One blue of genuine compliments. Oh for me really I contact I'm rarely earn a

42:42.200 --> 42:46.840
Will do I contact will do I contact if you break a thousand if you don't break a thousand you just you get the slew

42:46.840 --> 42:51.240

52:24.680 --> 52:30.680
This was the same one that I walked I talked about this the other week where I walked out of we were like in a hotel and there was like a

52:30.920 --> 52:36.440
We're on the bottom floor like the building and there's like a screen door that goes out to the like the deck

52:36.520 --> 52:38.520
or whatever the pool deck and

52:39.160 --> 52:43.720
I just walked straight through the screen porch and I would the reason I was walking

52:43.720 --> 52:48.840
I'm telling this poorly. I saw a group of young girls walking past. I was also young and

52:49.560 --> 52:51.560

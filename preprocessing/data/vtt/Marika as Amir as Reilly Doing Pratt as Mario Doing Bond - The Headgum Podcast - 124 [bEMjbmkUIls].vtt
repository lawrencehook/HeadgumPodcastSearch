00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Amirlox, dead.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Just like soulless kind of.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Yeah, everything okay?

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
No.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
But I don't know.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
I did come on the Zoom with just like dead eyes.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Oh, really?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
No, smile.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
It's a dead eyes promo that I'm trying to do.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
No.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
It's just over.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
See some smell.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
It's important for people to listen to the back catalog.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Yeah.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
What?

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
The dead eyes back catalog in order to...

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
No, we know what it means.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
It's just why you think it's your job to promote it and have people do that.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
On this.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Anything.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
It's my job.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
And Marika.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
And not here.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
It's just trying to have a good time, I think.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Oh, really?

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
Well, you actually, before we start recording, you said, can we get this out of the way so we can have a weekend?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
So I don't even know if you think that this is going to be a good time.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Well, this is work.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Like verbally twisted to the listeners.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Like everything that a lot of us do slash all of us really.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
If you include everything.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
That is might optically seem fun.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
But it's actually work that needs to get done.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
If you love what you do, you never work a day in your life.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
That's not true.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
Because work is cash, which makes it not fun.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
If you do something for money, then it's just to get it over with.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Do you think mechanics love working on Mazda's?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
I think some really do.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
They like sort of, yeah, like, problem solving and doing.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Find out that.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
That's true.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
That's true.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Jeff, what are your hobbies?

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Um, I, I like, opportunities.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
But if it's like, I'll be.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
One day.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
I'm on Sunday.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
What are your dreams?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
If it's one being on a Sunday, I'm probably whack in it.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Sort of wank in it.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
Jack in it, jerk in my gurkin till I finish.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
Oh, come on.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm here.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
You're wearing a V-neck tee.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Yes.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
This was a nice shirt.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
But it's really soft.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I worked a bed.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
See, you're just like, Thomas.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Yeah.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
In a way, yeah.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
This plus shorts video podcast.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
Mayor, I had, I've actually just now remembering that I had to dream that we were in the same high school class.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
And we had a reunion.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
A ring union.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
A ring union.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
We had a reunion.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
And I, like, even in the gym, I'm like, I'm weird.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
And you're like, yeah.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, what are you doing?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I think public and guests are on review review.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
We were talking about your age.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Because someone said you were born in 2002.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Me?

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
And I see.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Physically saying that.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
So that's why.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Was it you or Jeff?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Because I think there's only two people on that show.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
So you say someone said that.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
It was from a listeners and in the theme song talking about how you died.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
But it was like 2002 to forever on your headstone.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Hmm.

03:36.000 --> 03:45.000
Also, we should say the sketch of the tennis sketch is like viral on TikTok in a way.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
It's not like 400,000.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Wow.

03:50.000 --> 03:57.000
So many people being like, like, it's half people knowing who a mirror is.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
And getting the net.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
And then just half people discussing age.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
This is what I mean.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
You're humor.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I've also thought it wasn't any like.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Riley's 26.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah, right.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Thought she was.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
So I said, look at those croes.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
And I'm like, sorry, you mean laugh lines.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Bitch.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Oh, wow.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
That's a really cool one.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
That's really nice.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
That's really nice.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
That's really nice.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Yeah.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Almost half a million views.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Sorry.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
That's hilarious.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I guess we got to do a squeak wool.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
That was like the.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
And that was also me.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
I think the first sketch that I didn't write or was in for head gum.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
So it was me watching it for the first time while editing it.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
And I was cracking the fuck off.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
I was like.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
It was hard to choose which takes to do because I think you guys did like three takes.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
And they were all really good.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
But for different reasons.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
And I was like, I was having a blast editing that.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
All right.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Good sign.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
So that's really interesting.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
That it's like the one sketch that you're not a part of.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
And anyway, then the editing.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Interesting.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
It became the most.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
It blocked the reset viral viral.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Well, we.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
We're laughing a lot.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
And we had a great time making it like I feel like the energy.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
It's just right.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Studio.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
No.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
I wrote it.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
And then we improved a lot of it together.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Right.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
But he was there during the shoot.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
No.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
That's when he had COVID.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Yeah.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
He had COVID too.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
So on top of all that.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
And he think the secret sauce is me having an irreparable risk.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
I would try.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I mean, having COVID was that one?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Was that three?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
No.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Actually, not cool to make fun of people for getting COVID.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Yeah.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Well, you're not people.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
It was interesting that the.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
The more sick you get, the more viral we become.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah, the viral load increase.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
The viral load increases on both ends.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Interesting.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Also.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
If you want to go viral.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Get virus.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
He's not on.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
He's not on.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Well, and he's really wants to get COVID.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Yeah.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I said.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I just secrets out.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Bitch.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
We haven't done this for a couple of weeks.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
But.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
That's fine.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
Can I ask my genuine question about the sketch first?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
And I'm not fucking hot.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Uh, the bag in the fridge.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Oh, I think somebody's lunch, right?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
No, it was our sound designer.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
He was making.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I think it was his mom's birthday.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
He had food that he was preparing for her to bring over to her place.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
That's right.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
And so that's the bag.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
So it's a full.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
It's a double bag of.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
It's a double bag of unprepared food.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
It was a Dutchel bag because it was like going to be prepared in the Dutch oven.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
They were going to barbecue steak.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
I wasn't there.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
So I don't know.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
I just was trying to.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
That's why I was.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
It's my freaking.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
It's true.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Yeah.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Um.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
They said no.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Gen Z bonds.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Yeah.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
They said someone in the third.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Yeah.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Wow.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
So I have like four months to get this shit booked.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Yeah.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Unless you're thinking to look young for my age.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Let's go around.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Jeff.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Daniel Craig said that he's injured himself on every bond movie.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Okay.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
I think you would die.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
For a long time.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Never does.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Pictures up in your gone.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I don't think so.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
How do you think it would happen?

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Like what kind of what stunt or if even a stunt.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Or you just like.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
You think you make to the first stunt?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Absolutely not.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
I think it's like.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
And pictures up.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
And action.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
And he just croaks.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Oh.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
From the.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
From the.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
It's impossible.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Kind of.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
I think it would be from one of those like classic.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Like on mode.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Pads things.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
But the whole scene is that.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
And we're just on the back.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
And he chart.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
He.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
He shifts his weight the wrong way.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Kind of like.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
And of.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
That's really.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
The history boys.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
A play slash movie.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
He shifts his.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
The wrong way.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
And then he would die.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
From a crash.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
No.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
The hell.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
That's not the resume that gets you bombed.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
I think it's he's he's shaking a martini in a.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
And in a shaker.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
But he hits his head just so.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
That wouldn't.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
That it fully.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
No.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
That doesn't kill you.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
That knocks you out.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
You fall backwards.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Glass table.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
That kills you.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
They somehow have the coverage of it.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
On.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Doesn't make his own.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Imagine.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Just ordering from a martin.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
A mirror and casino royale.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
That's actually.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
The one bond I could fit into.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Because I do like like poker.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Absolutely not.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I've seen it.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
No.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I just assumed that in all other bonds.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
He does something much more active than playing cards.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Casino royale.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Has a torture scene.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Yes.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
The cock and ball torture scene.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
What.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Mads.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Michaelson.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Ties.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Daniel Craig to a chair.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Fully nude.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
And this.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
It's a ball.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
So it's a nodded rope.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Jesus.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
That sounds so hot.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
But he's like bond is like trained to take torture and not spill secrets.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
So it's like.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
I feel like it would be a beer.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Even though it's fake.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
It would be crazy.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Yeah.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
It would be fake.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
So wouldn't hurt.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Sorry.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
This.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Try guys thing has me like acting a fool.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Acting a fool.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I guess I'm not over it.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
It's all.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
You're violent in a way.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
How is it affecting you like which part of it.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Then the standing.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
I want to make sure myself into the discourse.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
And I have a fan of it and then what is the thing.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
I have no strong opinion about that or anything.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
So why do we want to be a part of the discourse.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
I want to trend.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Hmm,

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
You know, Armageddon is trending number 29 on Twitter right now.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
Which is end of days or nuclear it threats of nuclear war.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
tactical nuclear missiles, and that's 29. Try guys, it's not really cute.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Yeah, what is it?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
That's insane.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
Well, because the army got in his spine, it kills all of us equally.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
That's what I was going to say.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah. My body is Molly Ringwald.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Specifically. Why?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Because I want a 16 candles nod.

10:52.000 --> 10:58.000
So, bond is obviously a Lothario, and a Casanova in the specific regard of sex.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
And so, I want it to be a reverse 16 candles, but a nod within the 007 universe.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
Extended cinematic or otherwise, where like Molly gets some tail.

11:08.000 --> 11:15.000
And then she kind of like walks out of the MI5 bathroom and holds up a pair of boxers.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
And everybody claps for her.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
What are your guys' bonds of the week?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Ned.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Fomer.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Who?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Idiot.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Declassified.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Slanders.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Myed.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Flanders as bond.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
A fully animated bang.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
As Mario.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
As bond.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
That's pretty good.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
So, give us the name is bond, James Bond.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
But in Chris Prats voice as Mario.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
So, this is Riley as Prat as Mario.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
This is me. Yeah. Reus Prat as Mario as Mario.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
The name's bond. James Bond.

12:06.000 --> 12:12.000
All right. Now, I'm going to give you Riley as Prat as Mario as bond.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
So, this is me as Riley as Prat as Mario as bond.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
The name's bond. James Bond.

12:21.000 --> 12:29.000
All right. I'll do a mirror as Mario as Prat as Mario as bond.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
The name's bond. James Bond.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
That was me, not Riley. That was you.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
And now Jeff rounded up.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
No, I think that's it. I think that casting sees that.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
And then, like, behind the scenes for DVD footage, they're like,

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
I mean, when we saw Marika do a mirror doing Riley doing Chris Prat,

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
doing Mario doing James Bond. You just knew that was bond.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Do you know what I mean?

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Marika is the bond in a week.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Marika, we found it.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Yes. Nice.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Um.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
All right. Can you guys guess the friendliest country in Europe per Condé Nast?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
The friendliest country.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
Shut up. Riley and Marika. Can you guys guess the friendliest country in Europe?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Let me guess.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
You can guess after. You just clearly need like a minute.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Guess after.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
That's good.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
All right. No. I know what my answer will be.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
I live on a street where, first of all, a lot of hot people live on it,

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
but specifically, like across the street, there's like a house of models.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
But then every while someone walks across the way and they're so

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
I'll go that I'm like, you don't deserve the space.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Yeah, I was going to say Denmark.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
The fuck is wrong with you.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
I think Denmark is perfect.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
I have to change mine.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
That was going to be mine, too.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Uh, I'll go.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I can lift the way, Nia.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
And I'll win.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
I'm not that.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
I'm not that.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Mother country.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
I'm going to go.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Sweet.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Interesting.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Did any of us get it right yet?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
No.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Can I keep guessing yet?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
You only get one guess.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Ireland.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
I've almost said that I thought you were going to make fun of me.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
No, that's why I've been glued it, I guess.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
But it's followed closely by Portugal and Greece.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
Oh, well, that case.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
Ireland was sort of depressing.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
And I thought you heard famous.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
And then you became a friend of mine.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Right?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
How hard could it be?

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
How elusive?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
How famed could you be?

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
I think I have to do with thinking that Ireland is nice.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
You might think something and then it turns out to be something else.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
The Newstreet.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
The Newstreet.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
The Newstreet.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
The Newstreet.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
The Newstreet.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
The Newstreet.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Fuck.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Yeah.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
My neighbors hate me.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
That's the separate issue.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
That wasn't even about the yellow.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Yeah, it doesn't feel like that's not yours.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Yeah.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Your car.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Thanks.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Hillary Swank is expecting twins.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Although, I've actually didn't expect it at first.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Meaning.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Fuck you guys.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Give us like a second.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
She's 48.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Okay.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
That's, yeah.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
That's, that's a little bit of good info to have.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Yeah.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Interesting.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
To the set that first.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
To the foremost.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Yeah.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Sure.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Per Ares Technica.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Zell fraud is on the rise.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
And many victims are being denied refunds.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
Yes, you sell.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
I don't use Zell, but I have a friend who exclusively uses Zell.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
So what I'll have to do is I'll have to Venmo another friend.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
You can then sell that Venmo money to my other friend.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Yeah.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
You can get on Zell like in 20 seconds.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
It's actually an incredible platform.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
There's no fees.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
The set is brought to you by Zell.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
It's tied to your banks.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
You don't necessarily have to create a new service.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
It's like a pretty seamless bank to bank transfer.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
Is that was also brought to you by seamless.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
The seamless still exists, Marika.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Why are you asking me?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
But yeah.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
That's a New York thing.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Yeah.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Well, it's seamless slash grub hub.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
They're the same.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
But they're still a seamless app and website.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Yeah.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
It's a bad thing.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Like, have you our indoor dash?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
I was going to, you know.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Caviar was better before a door dash.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
I'll say it.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Yeah.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
What about your dash versus door dash?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
What's your dash?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Is that Jewish door dash?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
That's good.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
They only deliver soup.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
But it's an actual, like it's a clothing brand.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
They make jeans and stuff.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Jeane door dash.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Oh, speaking.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Your dash.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Your dashers on the way.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
You have jeans.

17:21.000 --> 17:28.000
I learned yesterday that shacks DJ name is DJ Diesel.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Yeah.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
No.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Well, his nickname was Diesel.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Was it really?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Yeah, when he was in the league,

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
he would, it's like shack diesel or just diesel.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Diesel to friends.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
I didn't confirm.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Oh, you were lying in.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
I really shook me.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
I got an email that was like DJ Diesel,

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
aka shack.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
I did have a dream last night that L.A.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
was going to rename itself to shack.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Like the city.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Yeah.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
It was going to be shack California.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
California.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
And then the Hollywood sign of a turn into just diesel.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
That's a punch up of the dream.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
But yeah.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
That's a commercial shack is it next week.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Really?

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
It's a throw a borderline un-show.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Kind of a comment.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
You cannot have to pause about it.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
Kanye West put on a fashion show where he had people

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
where bad looking T's by the way.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
So I don't see how it's a fashion statement.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Saying white lives matter.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Can you name which celebrities have said

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
they won't be wearing these shirts?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Boy, all of them.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
DJ Hadid.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Correct.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Absolutely.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
That is one of them.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Uh, yeah.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Pete Davidson.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Uh, no.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
What was that?

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
I'm trying to find these not bad looking T shirts.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
The last time I was on this show was where I like go.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
And I remember that it was you were doing a question thing.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
And if you got it wrong,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
you were kicked out of the zoom.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
And you're done recording it.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
You should bring that back.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
We don't want to get out of here, though.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
We get it wrong on purpose.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
You have to get it right to leave.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
That's funny.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Not funny because you suck.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
Everyone wants to not be.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
You should be offended by that.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
Next question.

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
The other ones were James Smith.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
What's that?

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
The other ones were Jaden Smith.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Venus Williams and Hayley Bieber.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Oh, yeah.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
It's going to the guest Venus.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Um, every stink in time.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
You're always guessing Venus.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
It's just like that's our answer for.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
Get Luke on the pod.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Look at him.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
He's a boy.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
He's a little boy.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Say something.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Talking English for the first time ever.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
It's going to happen.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
He looks so bewildered.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
He's looking at the window.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
He wins.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Finally has that.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Fathered and bewildered.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
It's Luke.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Is Luke.

20:34.000 --> 20:42.000
He's a little ear.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
He just passed away as it put him down.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Nice.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
I put him down.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Yes.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Every stink in time.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
See what got King's Charles flustered.

20:54.000 --> 21:01.000
The new king has made a square with the royal fountain pens.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Oh, god.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
He's the new right that.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
King's handgun is royal hand.

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
He had a pull out a hanky after passing the pen to Camilla who got in on her hands.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Oh, hail the angry king.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Someone tweeted.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Charles bitterly wrote off the wiki pen.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Every line is a pun.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
Every line is a pun.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Every line is a pun.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
More than King Charles first battle with a pen.

21:33.000 --> 21:39.000
A couple of days earlier when he officially ascended to the throne for claiming your majesty.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
He just shared dismissively at a chain of pens to get them taken out of his way.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
Someone on Twitter suggested send a pen guy to the tower.

21:49.000 --> 21:59.000
And when the king was seated for signing, he kept fiddling with ink and trays grimacing as he ordered an aid to get those pens away.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Someone put words in the king's mouth.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
The servant must clear my desk for me.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
I can't be expected to move things.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Royal pain.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
I'm not there.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
I'm not there.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Genie moats.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
CNF.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
New York.

22:14.000 --> 22:21.000
Can't wait to do a video where you walk in and say that speech verbatim.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
It was the first time I was like, found pen.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
The king is making a splash with a royal fountain pen.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
Pen.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Pen.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Okay.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
Please, we're talking about something.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Can't believe that aired.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I would fire that journalist.

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
What was there a tweet that was someone just like, all hail the cranky king.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Like, it's not even a burn.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
That's not news like thing.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
We don't just take a quick break, but we'll be right back with a segment.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Fitting for the season.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
Thank you to Ferry for sponsoring this episode of our show.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000

23:29.000 --> 23:37.000
Ferry grew out of their long time love of the surf mountains, road trips, beach bonfires, et cetera.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
That's why every piece is designed to be a lifetime favorite.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
In fact, their clothes get even better with age.

23:48.000 --> 23:54.000
And if anything happens along the way, Ferry will replace or fix your clothes for life no matter what.

23:54.000 --> 24:02.000
Lay your favorite pieces for a cozy fall vibe, or make it even easier with a one and done jump suit, right?

24:02.000 --> 24:07.000
I just wore a jumpsuit in next week's headgum sketch.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Thanks Ferry.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Now a word from our sponsor better help.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
Guys, you ever get stuck focusing on problems instead of solutions?

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Well, it could go differently than that.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
But it can be tough to train your brain to stay in problem-solving mode when faced with a challenging life.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
But when you learn how to find your own solutions, there's no better feeling.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
And a therapist can help get you there.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
I'm in therapy every week.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
I cannot recommend it enough.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
If you have the resources and better help makes it easier to find them,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
I think everybody should be in therapy.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
You know, if not for yourself, for those around you.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Even if you can only go every other week, you know, figure it out.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Start slow.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Baby steps.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
It's like, you know, go into the gym.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Just start slow.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
So if you're thinking of giving therapy a try, better help is a great option.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
It's convenient, accessible, affordable, and entirely online.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
And you can get matched with a therapist after filling out just a brief survey.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
And you can switch therapists at any time if the first one doesn't work out.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
So when you want to be a better problem-solver, therapy can get you there.

Thanks, better help.

25:42.000 --> 25:58.000
What do you guys see on the screen?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Nothing.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
Jeffrey James has started screen sharing.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Oh, scary clips.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Welcome to Scary Clips.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Oh no.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
How long can Riley last watching the 10 scariest jump scare?

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
It's jump scares on YouTube.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
This is bad for me too.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
This is great that how long can brownly last as well.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
This is horrible now they're gone.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
No they're back.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
God shit.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Or intravenous.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
This is just a dress rehearsal.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
So we'll figure it out on the day.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Yeah.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Um, here we go.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
My God.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
21 minutes.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Oh, no.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Not the whole thing.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
There's only four clips.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Hmm.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
I'll move you to this.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Um, like in cities.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Yeah, this is in cities.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Oh fuck.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Jeffrey.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
It's so dark.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Oh, I should also say you guys can call Uncle any time.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Or sorry, he's Uncle.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
Uh, but if you stick it out for all four clips,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
you can win up to.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
$40 that you actually can keep.

27:05.000 --> 27:11.000
Which I think is more impressive than the $500 that used to send

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
and then beg to get back.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
This is 40 real dollars you can get.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
I wonder if jump scares mean as much like broad daylight

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
watching on a dark computer.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
I wonder if I call the IRS on your ass and make sure you've been

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
doing your taxes correctly.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
Yeah, I guess.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
It's two equally important things to wonder.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
But what is this kid doing?

27:34.000 --> 27:42.000
Uh, he put like a tongue good truck and a teepee.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
And again, you can call his uncle at any time.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
Hey, this guy.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I can like barely see it.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
I can't even hear that.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
You can't hear the sound.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
No.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
No, you're more.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
What about now?

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
Uh, yeah.

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
A toy truck.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Well, it's gone again.

28:11.000 --> 28:18.000
No, that's better.

28:18.000 --> 28:29.000
So long of a buildup.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
Reiterating you can call his uncle at any time.

28:32.000 --> 28:40.000
Mostly because I don't want to spend 40 dollars.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
I just, it's like, I just don't know how long this cliff is.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
I thought they were getting really short clips.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
And now it's like, I really look like bodies.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
It's in 20 minutes.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Oh my God.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
That's a thing.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
It's like knowing that these are all clips of jump scares,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
and not knowing how long they are.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
So I know it.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
And because the music keeps going in and out, it's worse.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Because I feel like it's going to be like,

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
sudden sound and face.

29:11.000 --> 29:18.000
Oh, my God.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
That was nothing.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
And it was no face.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
Okay.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
What is this?

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Is that different put?

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
Oh, no.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Is this the rain or something?

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
I actually don't know what movie this is.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
This one's at least well lit.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
What?

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
Man.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Do you think it's scary to shoot these scenes?

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
No, kind of laughing.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
This fucking kids.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Last night.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
You guys are doing way better than I thought you would.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Well, because he's concerned that scary.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Oh, no.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
This one.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
This one.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
This one.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
This one.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
This is insidious.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
I remember seeing this movie.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
This image that's going to come up.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
It is insidious.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Because it.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
I couldn't sleep for weeks.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
It was like, that's the problem that I had.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
It was so fucking scary.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
And it also was like, I was asleep.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I had this thing where it's like, if I'm in the shower.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
And I closed my eyes.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Because I was like, I couldn't.

30:22.000 --> 30:28.000
I'd rather have my eyes burn with soap and close on us and imagine this shit coming to get

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
me.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Yeah.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
That's my that's my main problem with horror movies.

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
Like, I just can't deal with the like mental.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Yeah, mental.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Why don't want that image in my head?

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Yeah.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Like, jump scares.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
I can deal with in the moment.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
It was standing.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Maybe Rose Burner and save her.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
She doesn't deserve those.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Oh, shit.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
I mean, do you like horror movies?

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
I don't love or hate them.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I think they're like kind of fun.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
But I never actively seek them out.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
This is sort of in a great, it's like my forklash.

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
She loves horror movies.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
This movie is colored bad.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
I have notes.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Isn't Patrick?

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
Is there like an insidious series or what's this series?

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Oh, my fuck, fuck, fuck.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
I knew it was going to happen.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
No.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Mm-hmm.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Um, I hate him.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Me?

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
No, but I do this.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
It was the scariest.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Like,

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Yeah.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
To me.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Yeah.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Boba Duke.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Oh, my god.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Oh, my god.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Oh, my god.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Oh, my god.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Oh, my god.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Oh, my god.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
That wasn't even a clue.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
That was a pre-roll for her.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
But it was the Boba Duke, right?

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Yeah, that was sick.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Okay, icon.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Is it scary to watch it in the theater?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
It scared me.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
I'm watching it in a grainy video on my video.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Yeah.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
And it's not even over my screen.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Yeah.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
And it's, it's 11 a.m.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
And I'm scared.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Is this a good one?

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
No.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Girl.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Why?

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
It's just an arm-warrer.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Like, Renaissance.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
What movie is this?

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Do we know?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
It's a Twilight Breaking Dawn part.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
Yeah.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
What was that?

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Oh, fuck.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
What's that?

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
That was the conjuring.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
Oh, those are the Patrick Wilson movies.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
Patrick Wilson has his own.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Um, I gotta say, guys.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
You made it through.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
I really hope that this is not coming out as a video part,

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
and it's just audio of us.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Waiting for it.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
I'm not going to then move America's his net worth is large,

33:17.000 --> 33:22.000
but Riley and Marieka, Venmo fine or?

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
Um, I'll download Zell just for this.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
No, Venmo's great.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
You don't have to do anything.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Oh, then I'm not going to do it.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Um.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
It's a topic counts.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
It really is.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Yeah.

33:47.000 --> 33:53.000
Welcome to, uh, ear factor.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Hmm.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
Um, are you guys familiar with fear factor?

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Of course.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
Obviously, the game show where you kind of face your fears.

34:07.000 --> 34:12.000
This is a little different than.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
This is yours.

34:13.000 --> 34:19.000
This is your factor where I'm going to face your guys's ears.

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
And, um, it's sort of again a test of will and strength.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
For you endurance for for y'all.

34:27.000 --> 34:33.000
Uh, this is going to be a game where I single y'all out one by one.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
And whisper something by proxy into your ear.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
Really, I'm whispering it into the mic and then it's going through the ear waves.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
And then it's going into your headphones.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
We're all wearing headphones.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
So it real feel like I'm whispering in your ear.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
Uh, and it's going to be a really bad sentence to hear.

34:47.000 --> 34:53.000
Um, and once again, you can call Zonkel at any time.

34:53.000 --> 34:58.000
Let's see who can survive ear factor.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
Uh, let's start with just because this is the order of my zoom.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Let's start with Riley.

35:04.000 --> 35:11.000
Um, what I'm going to need the, the other two to do is mute your computer until I wave.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Okay.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
mute my computer or lung.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Yeah.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
mute your audio.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
So you can't hear me.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Riley should be the only one who can hear me.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Okay.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
So I'll give you.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Give me thumbs up.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Okay, great.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Just us.

35:26.000 --> 35:37.000
You never really know somebody's body until you've eaten their ass at least twice.

35:37.000 --> 35:43.000
It can't be like a one time experiment and experimental thing.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
It has to be an actual thing.

35:47.000 --> 35:54.000
Um, I guess also feel free to respond in any way that you guys want.

35:54.000 --> 36:13.000
Well, I guess I wasn't sure what the point of that was so it was it like, oh, how much of that can I withstand?

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
Yeah.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Okay.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
Because I hear you say shit like that all the time.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
And so it was just kind of like waiting.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
You're good at me or you can you can put volume on.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Yeah.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Again, if I wave.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
Um, should I come back or yeah.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Yeah.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Yeah.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Um, so yeah.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
I mean, I guess then I'm not scared of that.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Hmm.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Okay.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
That makes sense.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Riley and a mirror mute.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
This is unreal.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
Do we need can we have?

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
Um, our full video back.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
Thank you.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Y'all muted.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
Yeah.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
I'm so lonely.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
That I would pay a high class dominatrix.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
A rack.

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
Just to spare five minutes on the phone with me.

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
Is that it?

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
A mirror's turn.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Should I come back?

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Yes.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Okay.

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
When I wave you come back and I haven't been.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
Anything less than crystal clear about that.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
Yeah.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Meeting.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Meeting.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Marie can Riley, here we go.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Okay.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
Sometimes I'll make dinner plans with friends.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
And have someone else make the reservation.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Putting their credit card on the resume.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
So that when I inevitably cancel last minute,

37:55.000 --> 38:02.000
they have to incur the $25 ahead of cancellation fees.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Okay.

38:03.000 --> 38:09.000
And I have to tell you if that scares me.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Back to Riley.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
Oh.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Are you guys confused about the rules of the game?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
Yes.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Okay.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
It's not a game question mark.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
Okay.

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
What we all three of us know a specific private thing for now.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Yeah.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I got to Riley though.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Yeah.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Why is it?

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Why do we often mute?

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Yeah.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Why do we all?

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
I feel like why am I the only one hearing this and that makes it more uncomfortable.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Okay.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Okay.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
So we've done one of three.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Yeah.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Yeah.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
So we're going to mute.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Now we know the rules of the game.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Yeah.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
We know what's happening.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
I don't know if they're rules or a game.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
But we know what's happening.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
We're going to mute Riley's turn.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
Okay.

39:02.000 --> 39:09.000
Pressing your teeth more than once a day is truly overkill.

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
Christ me.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Ha ha ha.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
It's a little bit.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
Saying shit like that.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
All right.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
Break us turn.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
Why do I have to unmute just to hear Marika's turn?

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
I feel like I can stay muted.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Well, if you can keep.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
Just give your head whose turn it is, then yeah, but I don't trust.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Don't be mad at him.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
I'm just saying for the real thing.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
For the real thing, we should adjust that.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
All right.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
This is being recorded as a podcast.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
All right.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
Back to meeting.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
There's only one reason to carve a pumpkin.

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
And it's not to put out on your stupid October.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
It's for fucking the gourd.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
That tracks.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
I'm here.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
I'm feeling like I'm getting boring lens.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
I don't know.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Like Riley's always having to.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Now I can tell you what mine was.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
It wasn't probably wasn't any better.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
It's just see his face.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Yeah.

40:18.000 --> 40:24.000
Even like yours watching it without sounding maybe love.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
I'm here.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
Want some relationship advice?

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
Your partner should know you so well that they should be able to read your mind.

40:37.000 --> 40:43.000
If they can't figure out your needs before you even know what they are for yourself.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
And not only meet them, but go above and beyond.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Dump their ass.

40:50.000 --> 40:58.000
What kind of reactions were you hoping to get?

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Discomfort.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
You know, shifting and you see it a little bit.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
I mean, like Riley said, we hear you say this is going to show all the time.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Fine.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Then let me just do the last round to all three of you guys.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
All right.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Great.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
Shower beer.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Try shower gin.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Get's the job done quicker.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
So you can relax and slip.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Yeah.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
It's good that only Riley didn't hear that.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
I don't know why I thought it was going to rhyme.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Relax.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
And sing.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
In the shower.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
Kind of only means one thing.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
My biggest dream in life is to be a board member.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
This one's a call in response.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
Jeff deserves a seat on the board of.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Viser.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
Exactly right.

41:59.000 --> 42:04.000
This is kind of like a welcome tonight veil segment.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
But like poorly planned.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
And like the things you're saying, feel welcome tonight veil.

42:11.000 --> 42:20.000
But you could have found a better way to frame it.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
Yeah.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
It's like ASMR, but I don't like hair.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Jeff's brothers.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
I really don't want to say the last one.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
I wrote it late at night.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
And I thought that we have to now.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
You can't say that.

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
And then not it's pretty graphic and honest.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
You didn't have to admit that.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
And on worse.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
Barbecue sauce all over its face.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
I'm not going to say this one.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
Don't worry.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
You have to.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Such bullshit.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
You have to say this.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
You guys don't want to know this information.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
And I don't want to give it.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
So I feel like I shouldn't say it.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Jeff.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
You have to.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
It's just a description of my actual dick.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
No.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Don't even joke.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I think it's an actual HR violation.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
Ha ha.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
Ha.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
Ha.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
Ha.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Ha.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Ha.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Ha.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Ha.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Ha.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
Ha.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
Ha.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Ha.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Ha.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Ha.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Ha.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
Ha.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Ha.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
Ha.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
Ha.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Ha.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Ha.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Ha.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Plugs.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
When do you guys have going on?

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
What do you want to point the people towards the floor is yours?

43:38.000 --> 43:49.000
Um, I think when this comes out, the first east coast sketch will have dropped.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Holy smokes.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
East coast manager.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Yeah.

43:54.000 --> 44:01.000
So watching that if you haven't and maybe don't be mean about it.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Yeah.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Don't be mean about it.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
I guess.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
Yeah.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
You can make fun of Johnny.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
All you want.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
Yeah.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
Yeah.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
But be nice to me.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Specifically.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Um.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Um.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Yeah.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
I guess just head금 sketches.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
Generally.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Rich.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Rich.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
Rich.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Rich.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
Rich.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Rich.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Rich.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Rich.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Rich.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Um.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
Yeah.

44:32.000 --> 44:39.000
Rich's review review and everyone wants to go check out the Super Mario's Super Mario Brothers trailer.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
I think I'd love to direct people there.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Holy shit.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
You're on the street team.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
You're working with fucking Sony or whatever.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Mushroom kingdom.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Here we come.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
See you on the street.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
Just like to.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
It works.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Box office records shattered.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Um.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
We'll skip a mirror because he doesn't do jack shit.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
Uh.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
And, uh.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
At Jeff Boyardian Twitter.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
Oh.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
At Riley and Spock.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Instagram at Riley Coyote on Twitter.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
At Marie Kaylon on Twitter.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
Instagram and letter box.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
Yeah.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
I was just going to say.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Plug that letter box.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
Maybe.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
Yeah.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
See you guys again next week.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Thanks so much for listening to this episode of the head금 podcast.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
Uh.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
That's not.

45:27.000 --> 45:45.000
I have an Instagram hand.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
That was a head금 original.

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.160
Guys, you know my problem with edibles, sometimes you get way too high.

00:12.160 --> 00:15.960
It can really be difficult to control the dose it right, and there's nothing worse than

00:15.960 --> 00:19.160
being baked out of your mind when you didn't plan on it.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.920
And you know once you eat it, there's no going back.

00:21.920 --> 00:25.120
You just sit there, suffering, stone out of your mind.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.640
Well that's why when I need the perfect medium high, I hit up my friends a diet smoke for

00:29.640 --> 00:33.080
their delicious Delta 8 THC gummies.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.800
So what exactly is Delta 8?

00:34.800 --> 00:37.800
Well Delta 8 is simply a less potent THC.

00:37.800 --> 00:42.600
The THC you're probably most familiar with is Delta 9, and while both are natural to the

00:42.600 --> 00:46.960
cannabis plant, diet smoke extracts their Delta 8 from hemp.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.240
Some may call this a loophole.

00:48.240 --> 00:54.760
I call it the secret recipe to getting a smooth, stable, and most importantly, legal high.

00:54.760 --> 00:57.760
Diet smoke is legal in most states, and it's non-prescription.

00:57.920 --> 01:01.680
Check diet smoke's website to see if they ship their delicious gummies to your state.

01:01.680 --> 01:05.280
Now you're probably asking yourself, does diet smoke really look good for high?

01:05.280 --> 01:10.000
Of course, the high you get when diet smoke is best described is somewhere between the

01:10.000 --> 01:15.240
chillness of CBD, and that classic stone feeling you get with regular weed.

01:15.240 --> 01:19.440
Plus, diet smoke comes in two delicious flavors, blue raspberry and watermelon.

01:19.440 --> 01:22.960
I like blue raspberry, but Marieka Brownlee houses watermelon.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.760
I say try I'm both.

01:24.760 --> 01:29.360
So when CBD isn't enough, and traditional THC is too much, enjoy the smooth buzz of

01:29.360 --> 01:30.840
diet smoke.

01:30.840 --> 01:34.800
Each gummy is infused with 10 milligrams of Delta 8 THC derived from American grown

01:34.800 --> 01:35.800
hemp.

01:35.800 --> 01:39.920
And you know what they say, buy American, good high with American.

01:39.920 --> 01:43.600
Delta 8 gummies are low in sugar, fat free, and delicious.

01:43.600 --> 01:49.600
And I did mention their legal, yeah, so go to diet smoke.com and use promo code, what's

01:49.600 --> 01:52.240

Please use responsibly.

02:07.240 --> 02:08.240
Next, diet smoke.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.240
I haven't had gum in a minute.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.240
I haven't.

02:11.240 --> 02:12.240
I haven't either.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.760
I have a piece if you want one.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.240
I probably shouldn't cause we're recording a podcast.

02:16.240 --> 02:38.760
You all ready for audio?

02:38.760 --> 02:40.760
Come on.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.320
Right up again, Dad.

02:43.320 --> 02:46.560
You know, we're simply trying to understand what you're doing.

02:46.560 --> 02:51.960
I haven't done this show in a real long time, and I just remembered why bottoms up, right?

02:51.960 --> 02:54.560
Oh, this is a shot of espresso.

02:54.560 --> 02:55.560
Oh, yeah.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.040
Passion fruit, green tea bubble tea.

02:58.040 --> 03:05.640
I've been taking espresso like a shot of whiskey, just to see if it hits me.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.960
And oh boy, oh boy, does it.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.680
I finally feel alive.

03:10.680 --> 03:11.680
Interesting.

03:11.680 --> 03:12.680
I'm also interested.

03:12.680 --> 03:13.680
Yeah.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.680
No, it's like having a shot of whiskey in the beer.

03:16.680 --> 03:17.680
No.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.680
It's all caffeine.

03:18.680 --> 03:22.080
So it's like having a shot of whiskey and then a big cup of whiskey.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.080
It's a red eye.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.680
It's a red eye with the ingredients separated.

03:25.680 --> 03:31.680
It's like a deconstructed burger, but in terms of red eye.

03:31.680 --> 03:32.680
My good.

03:32.680 --> 03:33.680
Is that it?

03:33.680 --> 03:34.680
Correctly.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.680
Yours is a stretch.

03:36.680 --> 03:37.680
All right.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.680
Mine is, uh...

03:39.680 --> 03:41.680
Oh.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.680
There it is.

03:42.680 --> 03:43.680
He's on.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.680
He's on the cold road.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.680
He's on the espresso.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.680
You're firing on all cylinders.

03:49.680 --> 03:50.680
Let's hear about you guys.

03:50.680 --> 03:53.680
All right, because it's not the Jeff show on this podcast.

03:53.680 --> 03:54.680
Usually is.

03:54.680 --> 03:55.680
Yeah.

03:55.680 --> 03:56.680
Really?

03:56.680 --> 03:57.680
I feel like you.

03:57.680 --> 03:58.680
Yeah.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.680
You take up a lot of space on the steam roll.

04:00.680 --> 04:01.680
Damn, Daniel.

04:01.680 --> 04:06.680
Michael, what's new in what's new in the neighborhood with you?

04:06.680 --> 04:07.680
Not much, man.

04:07.680 --> 04:08.680
You left.

04:08.680 --> 04:09.680
You were here.

04:09.680 --> 04:10.680
And then you left.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.680
And now it's actually really nice out.

04:12.680 --> 04:16.680
You were here for, you were here for the three worst months.

04:16.680 --> 04:17.680
Yeah.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.680
The year.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.680
The first three days I was in New York.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.680
It was gorgeous fall weather.

04:22.680 --> 04:25.680
And then the shit hit the fan.

04:25.680 --> 04:26.680
So to speak.

04:26.680 --> 04:29.680
There was two nice days where it was above 50 degrees.

04:29.680 --> 04:32.680
Sounds like, sounds like winter.

04:32.680 --> 04:33.680
Yeah.

04:33.680 --> 04:34.680
Yeah.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.680
But, you know, I'm back.

04:37.680 --> 04:38.680
And I'm happy.

04:42.680 --> 04:43.680
Don't forget.

04:43.680 --> 04:44.680
Oh, wow.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.680
I had to go ahead and hit him with langers today.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.680
I got a turkey sand though.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.680
Just feel that New York vibe.

04:50.680 --> 04:53.680
The quiver in your voice, as you said, you were happy.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.680
It betrayed a lot.

04:55.680 --> 04:56.680
Yeah.

04:56.680 --> 04:57.680
I'm sure.

04:57.680 --> 04:58.680
Do you miss you?

04:58.680 --> 04:59.680
What's up?

04:59.680 --> 05:00.680
I was asked.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.680
What do you miss the most?

05:02.680 --> 05:03.680
What do I miss the most?

05:03.680 --> 05:04.680
Is the access.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.680
Right?

05:05.680 --> 05:06.680
And he was saying to which.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.680
I can walk across the goddamn street.

05:09.680 --> 05:13.680
If I want one here, I have to walk like four blocks.

05:13.680 --> 05:14.680
Hmm.

05:14.680 --> 05:15.680
Yeah.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.680
I think that was just like being privileged with the neighborhood.

05:18.680 --> 05:19.680
You live in for sure.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.680
But.

05:20.680 --> 05:21.680
I'm great.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.680
You live in location location.

05:23.680 --> 05:24.680
Location.

05:24.680 --> 05:25.680
America.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.680
I mean.

05:26.680 --> 05:29.680
Let's kind of like lift the veil here.

05:29.680 --> 05:30.680
Let's get into it for real.

05:30.680 --> 05:35.680
Instead of doing this like show this dog and pony nonsense that we do every week.

05:35.680 --> 05:36.680
Right?

05:36.680 --> 05:38.680
What's there?

05:38.680 --> 05:41.680
Like, I don't know like, let's be ourselves in this episode.

05:41.680 --> 05:42.680
We don't have to put on anything.

05:42.680 --> 05:43.680
Let alone the risk.

05:43.680 --> 05:44.680
All right.

05:44.680 --> 05:45.680
What?

05:45.680 --> 05:46.680
Jake.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.680
Jake.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.680
What?

05:48.680 --> 05:49.680
Jake.

05:49.680 --> 05:50.680
Jake.

05:50.680 --> 05:51.680
Jake.

05:51.680 --> 05:52.680
Jake.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.680
What's up?

05:53.680 --> 05:54.680
Yeah.

05:54.680 --> 05:55.680
Nothing.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.680
Nothing really.

05:56.680 --> 05:57.680
I don't know.

05:57.680 --> 05:58.680
I was, I was traveling a little bit.

05:58.680 --> 05:59.680
I went to LA.

05:59.680 --> 06:00.680
I went to Mexico.

06:00.680 --> 06:01.680
It was nice.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.680
I learned how to surf.

06:03.680 --> 06:04.680
And I hurt my rib.

06:04.680 --> 06:07.680
So I didn't learn that good.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.680
Did you hit like hard sand?

06:09.680 --> 06:11.680
No, I hit hard board.

06:11.680 --> 06:12.680
Oh, yeah.

06:12.680 --> 06:13.680
Yeah.

06:13.680 --> 06:17.680
Just kind of like bouncing and bobbing up and down on the surfboard and getting tossed around.

06:17.680 --> 06:18.680
Yeah.

06:18.680 --> 06:19.680
Yeah.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.680
It did a number on the old rib cage.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.680
But it's still hanging ten.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.680
I'm going to persevere.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.680
It isn't important to hang loose.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.680
Aloha lifestyle.

06:30.680 --> 06:34.680
Um, and I'll be back out there in the cut in four to six weeks.

06:34.680 --> 06:35.680
Oh, yeah.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.680
Actually doing this hurts my rib a little bit.

06:37.680 --> 06:40.680
It's a rib to twist your wrist.

06:40.680 --> 06:43.680
It hurts my rib to even breathe deeply, Jeff.

06:43.680 --> 06:44.680
So yeah.

06:44.680 --> 06:45.680
I've been doing this for a little.

06:45.680 --> 06:46.680
Have you gone to a doctor?

06:46.680 --> 06:48.680
Did you bruise your rib?

06:48.680 --> 06:49.680
I haven't gone to a doctor.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.680
But I have self diagnosed that I bruised my rib.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.680
Or theoretically, be worse.

06:54.680 --> 06:55.680
Yeah.

06:55.680 --> 06:56.680
You could be worse.

06:56.680 --> 06:57.680
You could have fractured it.

06:57.680 --> 06:58.680
Go to it.

06:58.680 --> 06:59.680
But it seems like the same.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.680
It seems like you kind of do the same thing either way.

07:01.680 --> 07:02.680
Yeah.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.680
Which is rest, rest, ice, and rest.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.680
So far.

07:06.680 --> 07:07.680
Yeah.

07:07.680 --> 07:08.680
Yeah.

07:08.680 --> 07:09.680
Yeah.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.680
I'm going to get back out there in the rib.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.680
And then you got to get back on the board, bra.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.680
And then you got to rest for four to six weeks.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.680
Cause you hurt your rib again.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.680
Can I in Mexico?

07:19.680 --> 07:20.680
Okay.

07:20.680 --> 07:23.680
So I feel like I've never gone surfing.

07:24.680 --> 07:30.680
What is the ratio of people that are on the beach surfing versus like boogie boarding?

07:30.680 --> 07:31.680
Mm-hmm.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.680
Is that still a thing that people do?

07:33.680 --> 07:35.680
Cause I would be down to the boogie board.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.680
There were some boogie boarders there for sure.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.680
The beach that we were out was like a surfers beach.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.680
And it seemed like a lot of people go there to like,

07:43.680 --> 07:45.680
to surf big waves a little further.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.680
So I surf like the new one.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.680
I was like, see, foam boogie board.

07:50.680 --> 07:53.680
You fit a shark design on it and tried to hit those waves.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.680
I'd be ostracized and laughing.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.680
No, you wouldn't be ostracized.

07:57.680 --> 07:58.680
You wouldn't be ostracized.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.680
I was doing looked lamer than what you would be doing.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.680
Because at least you would be by yourself.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.680
And you'd be self-sufficient.

08:06.680 --> 08:10.680
I was just on a board that was being held by a strong Mexican man.

08:10.680 --> 08:13.680
Kind of twisting and turning me in the surf.

08:13.680 --> 08:17.680
And then pushing the board and telling me went to paddle and went to stand.

08:18.680 --> 08:20.680
All right, cool.

08:20.680 --> 08:21.680
Action.

08:21.680 --> 08:22.680
Action.

08:22.680 --> 08:23.680
Bronson.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.680
Boogie boards.

08:24.680 --> 08:25.680
Iraq boys.

08:25.680 --> 08:26.680
That's insane.

08:26.680 --> 08:27.680
If that makes you feel anyway.

08:27.680 --> 08:28.680
It does make me feel better.

08:28.680 --> 08:32.680
I haven't gone into the ocean and I want to say over a decade.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.680
But.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.680
Wow.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.680
But it does make me feel better.

08:36.680 --> 08:37.680
What about action?

08:37.680 --> 08:38.680
Keen to Bronson.

08:38.680 --> 08:39.680
Okay.

08:39.680 --> 08:40.680
Yeah.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.680
So it's like, it was great.

08:42.680 --> 08:43.680
Really?

08:43.680 --> 08:45.680
I thought it was Keen to cause like,

08:46.680 --> 08:47.680
like a lesson.

08:47.680 --> 08:48.680
Yeah.

08:48.680 --> 08:49.680
Yeah.

08:49.680 --> 08:50.680
Um.

08:50.680 --> 08:51.680
But yeah.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.680
Abbott Elementary is pretty good.

08:53.680 --> 08:54.680
Yeah.

08:54.680 --> 08:55.680
Stress is me out.

08:55.680 --> 08:56.680
I think it's.

08:56.680 --> 08:57.680
Yeah.

08:57.680 --> 08:59.680
I think it's.

08:59.680 --> 09:00.680
I think it's a good.

09:00.680 --> 09:03.680
You don't have to agree with everyone during conversation.

09:03.680 --> 09:04.680
Yeah.

09:04.680 --> 09:05.680
Totally.

09:05.680 --> 09:06.680
I don't think that's true at all.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.680
Based on how you lead your life and the spot cast in particular.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.680
Yeah.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.680
You just screaming us as the first thing you did.

09:12.680 --> 09:13.680
Yeah.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.680
Yeah.

09:14.680 --> 09:15.680
Yeah.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.680
Yeah.

09:16.680 --> 09:17.680
Yeah.

09:17.680 --> 09:18.680
Yeah.

09:18.680 --> 09:19.680
Continue.

09:19.680 --> 09:20.680
Um.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.680
My weekend was.

09:22.680 --> 09:23.680
It's fine.

09:23.680 --> 09:26.680
The return of Formula One.

09:26.680 --> 09:27.680
We got to talk about it.

09:27.680 --> 09:28.680
We got to talk about it.

09:28.680 --> 09:29.680
We got to talk about it.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.680
I will say we I've already portioned off.

09:31.680 --> 09:32.680
Okay.

09:32.680 --> 09:33.680
Okay.

09:33.680 --> 09:34.680
Okay.

09:34.680 --> 09:35.680
Time to talk about it.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.680
Okay.

09:36.680 --> 09:38.680
I started watching drive to survive.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.680
Yes.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.680
I'm only three episodes in.

09:40.680 --> 09:41.680
She's a one season.

09:41.680 --> 09:42.680
Are you watching?

09:42.680 --> 09:43.680
Um.

09:43.680 --> 09:44.680
Um.

09:44.680 --> 09:48.680
But I know that the first race was this weekend because my buddy Kevin, who I was just skiing with in Colorado, watched it.

09:48.680 --> 09:52.680
And I never met eyes because like it's, you know, you know, no spoiler alert.

09:52.680 --> 09:53.680
All right.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.680
We were like three seasons away.

09:54.680 --> 09:55.680
Yeah.

09:55.680 --> 09:56.680
You got to.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.680
You got to either.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.680
Absolutely.

09:58.680 --> 10:00.680
Finish by the next time we record and that's not.

10:00.680 --> 10:01.680
We record this show.

10:01.680 --> 10:02.680
But we're when the next time you guys are on.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.680
I'll have caught up with problems.

10:04.680 --> 10:05.680
And that's going to do.

10:05.680 --> 10:06.680
What are your.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.680
What are your feelings on the based on the first few episodes.

10:08.680 --> 10:09.680
Yeah.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.680
There's some drama going on in those first apps.

10:11.680 --> 10:12.680
Yeah.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.680
It's tough because like I know who you guys root for.

10:14.680 --> 10:18.680
And I know that there was, you know, a driver who changed teams, you know.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.680
So that's that's why I'm trying to avoid that shit.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.680
Because I don't want to know that signs ended up.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.680
Uh, you know, you know, he's got a lock in his garage.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.680
Um, but that.

10:27.680 --> 10:31.680
So I mean, with all things in a vacuum if I was just watching the first season.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.680
And that was now.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.680
I think I would be maybe maybe a Danny Riccardo.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.680
I told him.

10:36.680 --> 10:38.680
I told him he was going to love Daniel Riccardo.

10:39.680 --> 10:44.680
And obviously, I love Danny Riccardo even more now than I do when I was first.

10:44.680 --> 10:45.680
I just don't say anything.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.680
I don't say anything goes anything goes will.

10:47.680 --> 10:48.680
Okay.

10:48.680 --> 10:49.680
Yeah.

10:49.680 --> 10:50.680
Sure.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.680
But is that it?

10:52.680 --> 10:54.680
Um, no, I like Daniel Riccardo.

10:54.680 --> 10:57.680
And then I like the, uh, I like the host team.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.680
Their drivers are somewhat boring.

10:59.680 --> 11:01.680
I don't think Kevin Magnus 10 is interesting.

11:01.680 --> 11:04.680
Um, I think Alonso got to get out of the game.

11:04.680 --> 11:07.680
I mean, what are you pushing 40 in the friends zone?

11:08.680 --> 11:09.680
This is a good.

11:09.680 --> 11:10.680
This is a good.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.680
Um, yeah, a good time for you to get into this now.

11:13.680 --> 11:14.680
Yeah.

11:14.680 --> 11:15.680
And also, I like to welcome any listeners.

11:15.680 --> 11:19.680
If you guys have been listening to Marieka and Jake Wax non-sensical about

11:19.680 --> 11:20.680
shit, you don't understand.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.680
Come aboard team Jeff.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.680
Oh, you know, sucks.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.680
The fucking Williams team.

11:27.680 --> 11:28.680
Please talk.

11:28.680 --> 11:29.680
Yeah.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.680
They do.

11:30.680 --> 11:31.680
Yeah.

11:31.680 --> 11:32.680
I don't want to listen.

11:32.680 --> 11:35.680
Like the way that the dad, the dad of the driver was like,

11:35.680 --> 11:36.680
Oh, he's never made a mistake.

11:36.680 --> 11:37.680
Like that.

11:37.680 --> 11:38.680
And she's like, yeah.

11:38.680 --> 11:39.680
Well, I mean, thank you.

11:39.680 --> 11:40.680
I was like, no, no, no.

11:40.680 --> 11:41.680
This is the first time he's done it.

11:41.680 --> 11:42.680
And she's like, all right.

11:42.680 --> 11:43.680
Whatever his name is.

11:43.680 --> 11:44.680
Uh, why?

11:44.680 --> 11:46.680
Is it with TV or Noah's stroll?

11:46.680 --> 11:48.680
Uh-huh.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.680
Is it like a stroll?

11:50.680 --> 11:52.680
Who do they drive for?

11:52.680 --> 11:54.680
Wait, what do you mean?

11:54.680 --> 11:55.680
Williams.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.680
Williams runs on a Mercedes engine.

11:57.680 --> 11:58.680
Oh, so far.

11:58.680 --> 11:59.680
Yeah.

11:59.680 --> 12:00.680
It's like, yeah.

12:00.680 --> 12:01.680
Yeah.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.680
Yeah.

12:02.680 --> 12:03.680
Yeah.

12:03.680 --> 12:04.680
Yeah.

12:05.680 --> 12:11.680
So, okay, so the way Williams did, did stroll go from Williams to you.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.680
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

12:13.680 --> 12:14.680
No, no, no, no, no.

12:14.680 --> 12:16.680
I thought he was, I thought he was, I thought he was.

12:16.680 --> 12:17.680
I was even on the first one.

12:17.680 --> 12:18.680
Yeah.

12:18.680 --> 12:21.680
I mean, he, he needs to race for a team that is dad owns.

12:21.680 --> 12:22.680
Yeah.

12:22.680 --> 12:23.680
Because otherwise he wouldn't be racing.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.680
Yeah.

12:24.680 --> 12:25.680
So I don't think he's kind of, he's probably forever.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.680
But he, you know, stick to the go cards, right?

12:27.680 --> 12:28.680
Yeah.

12:28.680 --> 12:29.680
No, he's pretty bad.

12:29.680 --> 12:30.680
Yeah, he's terrible.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.680
Um, but no, we do have some time again, portioned off.

12:33.680 --> 12:34.680
So I don't want to make it.

12:34.680 --> 12:35.680
Okay.

12:35.680 --> 12:36.680
Two for me.

12:36.680 --> 12:37.680
Okay.

12:37.680 --> 12:38.680
Yeah.

12:38.680 --> 12:39.680
I can't wait for that.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.680
Hit him with our bonds of the fucking week this week.

12:42.680 --> 12:46.680
My bond of the week is John, please.

12:46.680 --> 12:47.680
All right.

12:47.680 --> 12:48.680
Interesting.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.680
It's fun.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.680
Like a, you know, John, please.

12:51.680 --> 12:52.680
No.

12:52.680 --> 12:53.680
Here.

12:53.680 --> 12:56.680
You must not.

12:56.680 --> 12:57.680
No, John, please.

12:57.680 --> 12:58.680
You must not.

12:58.680 --> 12:59.680
No, John, please.

12:59.680 --> 13:00.680
He created.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.680
He just passed on in a minute.

13:02.680 --> 13:06.680
Now he moved to an island called Nevis, baby.

13:06.680 --> 13:07.680
You must not.

13:07.680 --> 13:08.680
No, John, please.

13:08.680 --> 13:09.680
You must not.

13:09.680 --> 13:10.680
No, John, please.

13:10.680 --> 13:13.680
Did I mention he loves somewhere named Nevis.

13:13.680 --> 13:17.680
So don't you ever, or a second, get to thinking.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.680
He doesn't like Nevis.

13:20.680 --> 13:22.680
John, please, lives on an island called Nevis.

13:22.680 --> 13:24.680
I think it's called Nevis.

13:24.680 --> 13:25.680
What?

13:25.680 --> 13:29.680
He could still not, that helpful on time, he who he is.

13:30.680 --> 13:33.680
He did something racist recently.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.680
He has some, he like, I think he's just a contrarian.

13:36.680 --> 13:40.680
I, I really dug into it when I was writing these.

13:40.680 --> 13:44.680
Generational lyrics and I was like, yeah,

13:44.680 --> 13:45.680
as any like super problematic nowadays,

13:45.680 --> 13:48.680
I think he's just like loves to go against the grain

13:48.680 --> 13:51.680
because I couldn't find anything super cancelable.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.680
All right, all right.

13:52.680 --> 13:53.680
Yeah.

13:53.680 --> 13:58.680
Um, my bond of the week, which I don't, I don't know if someone's done before,

13:58.680 --> 14:01.680
but I'm going to go with Daniel Radcliffe.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.680
Um, I saw the lost city this weekend,

14:04.680 --> 14:05.680
starring Sandra Bullock,

14:05.680 --> 14:06.680
um,

14:06.680 --> 14:09.680
Channing Tatum, one of our greatest comedic actors.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.680
Uh, and Daniel Radcliffe plays villain.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.680
And I know James Bond is not a villain,

14:14.680 --> 14:16.680
but I feel like it's, he could do a similar vibe,

14:16.680 --> 14:18.680
because he's really good at the villain.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.680
They're like fun.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.680
A eccentric guy.

14:22.680 --> 14:25.680
Actually, baby, maybe he should be in bond,

14:26.680 --> 14:28.680
and he's like,

14:28.680 --> 14:29.680
you do the segment.

14:29.680 --> 14:32.680
You force everyone to fucking talk every single time.

14:32.680 --> 14:35.680
We know we're straight from the bottom of the bill with the bond of the week.

14:35.680 --> 14:36.680
We know like, I do something like that.

14:36.680 --> 14:37.680
Bond villain, I'm sorry.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.680
You call me out on it and then we move on.

14:39.680 --> 14:42.680
My bond villain of the week is going to be

14:42.680 --> 14:43.680
Daniel Radcliffe.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.680
My bond of the week,

14:45.680 --> 14:47.680
Jesse Eisenberg.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.680
What are you talking about?

14:51.680 --> 14:54.680
How do you so sad if he was born here?

14:55.680 --> 14:56.680
That would ruin it for me.

14:56.680 --> 14:57.680
They would be, it's like trying to make,

14:57.680 --> 14:59.680
you remember when they tried to make nerds cool

14:59.680 --> 15:01.680
when it was like, yeah,

15:01.680 --> 15:02.680
it'd be like that,

15:02.680 --> 15:04.680
but that's, that can't happen.

15:04.680 --> 15:05.680
Bond can never be nerdified.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.680
That's why I'm picking Lando Norris,

15:08.680 --> 15:10.680
as my bond of the week.

15:10.680 --> 15:11.680
Who?

15:11.680 --> 15:14.680
F-1 driver from McLaren?

15:14.680 --> 15:15.680
Lando Norris?

15:15.680 --> 15:17.680
Oh, no, he comes in in season two.

15:17.680 --> 15:18.680
He's not there yet.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.680
That's so sexy, British.

15:20.680 --> 15:21.680
Yes, he is.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.680
He's a little, he's a little, he's a little,

15:23.680 --> 15:25.680
actually in season four,

15:25.680 --> 15:27.680
he's kind of a dirtbag, I think.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.680
He's a little, he's a little simply.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.680
Yeah, I mean, I get that.

15:30.680 --> 15:31.680
And I don't play him.

15:31.680 --> 15:32.680
Right.

15:32.680 --> 15:33.680
They're all, I mean, you have to be in

15:33.680 --> 15:34.680
sanely arrogant if you're driving a

15:34.680 --> 15:36.680
cart to 100 miles per hour,

15:36.680 --> 15:37.680
and you think you're the best.

15:37.680 --> 15:38.680
Yeah.

15:38.680 --> 15:39.680
There's no, there's no way that

15:39.680 --> 15:41.680
you're also like a cool casual dude.

15:41.680 --> 15:42.680
Yeah.

15:42.680 --> 15:43.680
But, yeah, sometimes when you hear everybody

15:43.680 --> 15:44.680
on the radio, you're like,

15:44.680 --> 15:46.680
I like this guy and then you hear them,

15:46.680 --> 15:48.680
like, to tell an old man to shut the fuck up

15:48.680 --> 15:49.680
and you're like, oh,

15:49.680 --> 15:50.680
I got it.

15:50.680 --> 15:57.080
No, that is, but makes me happier whenever they come over the radio and they're like,

15:57.080 --> 15:59.080
really, can you stop talking?

15:59.080 --> 16:03.920
I mean, it's like, of course, like, it wasn't the Russian Grand Prix.

16:03.920 --> 16:07.480
He's like, they were telling him to box or whatever, he was like, shut up, shut up, shut up,

16:07.480 --> 16:11.520
and then this car spun out and he could have loved it.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.120
Oh, I'm pretty at all.

16:13.120 --> 16:16.720
Yeah, Micah, bond of the week.

16:16.720 --> 16:24.000
I didn't consider that it didn't have to be an actor, but I think the, who's the guy who stars

16:24.000 --> 16:29.040
in Night of?

16:29.040 --> 16:30.040
In the Night of?

16:30.040 --> 16:35.640
Yeah, the show, the Night of the Night of the Night of the Night.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.880
Is it a resound net?

16:37.880 --> 16:40.160
Yes, it is.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.160
That's my pick.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.160
That's cool.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.160
It's good one.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.560
It's almost as good as my dev Patel.

16:45.640 --> 16:46.560
Yeah.

16:46.560 --> 16:49.600
Which would actually be to go bond.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.600
Yeah.

16:50.600 --> 16:51.600
I think I said that one too.

16:51.600 --> 16:55.040
Because it's like, it's like deviate, maybe it was you the entire time, but it's deviate

16:55.040 --> 17:01.080
from the, from a white guy, but just enough, so everyone's still comfortable with it.

17:01.080 --> 17:10.040
This just in breaking news, I think we might be the first outlet to get this.

17:10.040 --> 17:17.040
Molly Parton has withdrawn her name from nomination into the rock and roll Hall of Fame.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.040
Yeah.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.040
It's having a wish.

17:20.040 --> 17:24.760
I don't know if we're an outlet.

17:24.760 --> 17:26.520
We definitely shouldn't be called an outlet.

17:26.520 --> 17:30.120
I am going to try and get a fucking press badge to something important.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.120
All right.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.920
But honestly, I really hope you do try.

17:33.920 --> 17:34.920
Yeah, I'm going to see it.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.560
I think that'll be a good bit.

17:37.560 --> 17:38.560
Yeah.

17:38.560 --> 17:41.600
So Dolly Parton said, thinks that she's not good enough to be in the rock hall.

17:41.600 --> 17:42.600
That's not true.

17:42.600 --> 17:46.240
She thinks that she, she's never released a rock and roll album.

17:46.240 --> 17:47.240
Mm-hmm.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.240
That's true.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.240
That's what that was what she said.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.480
And she said, if she ever, that's the sides too.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.480
It's good insight from you.

17:54.480 --> 17:55.480
Yeah.

17:55.480 --> 17:56.480
Thank you.

17:56.480 --> 18:01.480
No, but I mean, I think it's honorable because yeah, she was basically, I think one

18:01.480 --> 18:04.120
of the quotes too was like, I'd love to be reconsidered.

18:04.120 --> 18:07.560
I just need to, I think this is like God winking at me that I need to release a rock

18:07.560 --> 18:12.640
album, like Linda Ronstatt style, Linda Ronstatt next year.

18:12.640 --> 18:17.080
And I think that, I mean, we should talk about it.

18:17.080 --> 18:23.240
Headgums up for, I think, at least four quill podcasting awards.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.800
For dead eyes, for best, best series.

18:25.800 --> 18:26.800
All right.

18:26.800 --> 18:27.800
Yeah.

18:27.800 --> 18:28.800
Maybe a lot of them.

18:28.800 --> 18:29.800
Colctures.

18:29.800 --> 18:30.800
Colctures.

18:30.800 --> 18:31.800
The side down.

18:31.800 --> 18:32.800
Yeah.

18:32.880 --> 18:33.800
Gumball.

18:33.800 --> 18:34.800
Best tech.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.400
I actually up for five because we're up for two gumball ones.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.400
Okay.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.480
So we have, basically, we have a lot of things in the mix.

18:42.480 --> 18:48.440
But I'm wondering if we pull it to Ollie, if we withdraw our name from the nomination,

18:48.440 --> 18:52.600
something we're getting a ton of press, because like how punk rock is that, if we're like,

18:52.600 --> 18:53.600
we don't need the award.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.480
And we don't even know if we deserve it because this stuff was good.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.720
But see what we drop next year.

18:58.760 --> 19:03.480
The difference is that I think we submitted ourselves for all of these awards.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.880
So it's kind of like, hey, do this work.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.760
Then actually never mind.

19:09.760 --> 19:10.760
We take it back.

19:10.760 --> 19:11.760
So.

19:11.760 --> 19:12.760
Huh.

19:12.760 --> 19:13.760
Yeah.

19:13.760 --> 19:14.760
It is.

19:14.760 --> 19:20.360
And like, spoiler alert, all awards, you got a submit for a pretty much stuff.

19:20.360 --> 19:24.840
I don't know if that shakes up your view of the world.

19:24.840 --> 19:27.720
I mean, this information to me, you're getting my library act right now.

19:27.720 --> 19:31.800
And I think it's pretty interesting.

19:31.800 --> 19:35.280
So it's not.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.280
I don't know.

19:36.280 --> 19:37.280
You guys.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.880
I don't know what this show's going to end up being in a couple minutes.

19:38.880 --> 19:39.880
No, I miss.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.280
I miss the the word of the week.

19:42.280 --> 19:43.280
Yeah.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.600
I just can't keep spending that much money.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.960
And I think it might have to be taxed.

19:47.960 --> 19:48.960
It doesn't.

19:48.960 --> 19:49.960
We established it doesn't.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.760
Also, you want to pay people.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.760
You could just say they found the word of the week.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.480
I should pay them over $600.

19:55.480 --> 19:59.000
You would have to you'd have to send them a 1099.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.560
They would get taxed.

20:00.560 --> 20:03.640
You actually can write that off as a loss.

20:03.640 --> 20:07.680
Well, then you know what, I'm going to send you guys something for $70,000.

20:07.680 --> 20:10.480
Well, imagine writing off more than you make.

20:10.480 --> 20:11.480
That's great.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.480
I wouldn't do that.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.480
Then I get like tens of thousands of dollars.

20:16.480 --> 20:17.480
Great.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.480
Yeah.

20:18.480 --> 20:23.120
You know, I got the word all today and two speaking of word of the week and quit the slack.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.120
Yeah.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.400
And I'm proud of you for that.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.400
I'm done.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.400
Yeah.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.400
Out.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.000
Because you got into your done.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.080
I'd always said that if I failed and I couldn't get it in six or if I got it in

20:35.080 --> 20:36.920
two, I would quit.

20:36.920 --> 20:39.000
And I've actually done both now.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.680
I need to get out the game.

20:42.680 --> 20:45.480
It's kind of the point where wordle is not fun for me.

20:45.480 --> 20:48.320
It's I wake up with a little with a small sense of dread.

20:48.320 --> 20:49.320
Yeah.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.320
I.

20:51.320 --> 20:53.160
I still think it's fun.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.880
Like it doesn't have the same.

20:54.880 --> 20:59.080
It doesn't have quite the same like thing anymore, but I'm going to keep doing it.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.080
Yeah.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.080
Like others.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.720
I've I've stopped playing like the other versions for the most part.

21:03.720 --> 21:04.720
You're not doing it.

21:04.720 --> 21:05.720
I'm too old.

21:05.720 --> 21:06.720
Pist me off so much.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.280
I haven't done those on a while.

21:08.280 --> 21:12.280
I did this a mantle yesterday and bar with my friends.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.280
As we get the meeting.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.280
Right.

21:14.280 --> 21:15.280
Yeah.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.280
Yeah.

21:16.280 --> 21:20.800
Me and my two friends were sitting at a bar all doing cement.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.800
That sounds like a American girl.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.640
Oh, the whole name.

21:25.640 --> 21:27.320
That's when you put something on a mantle.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.320
Yeah.

21:28.320 --> 21:33.560
Oh, well, we do have to take a quick break or hit in the 20 minute mark here.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.560
Thanks for sponsors.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.960
We're getting some good ones.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.560
We got fair fairity.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.560
Oh, shit.

21:38.560 --> 21:39.560
Yeah.

21:39.560 --> 21:44.640
I mean, I mean, Jake said it best.

21:44.640 --> 21:47.320
I've loved fairity's clothes for the better part of a decade.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.320
Yeah.

21:48.320 --> 21:49.640
Did you get close?

21:49.640 --> 21:52.400
I haven't used my voucher yet, but you know I'm going to go for a

21:52.400 --> 21:56.120
reversible long sleeve.

21:56.120 --> 21:57.120
No.

21:57.120 --> 21:59.400
Go to commercial man.

21:59.400 --> 22:05.360
Oh, yeah.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.720
Thank you to athletic greens for sponsoring this episode of our show.

22:08.720 --> 22:11.800
Guys, I start my day every day with athletic greens.

22:11.800 --> 22:17.440
And it makes me feel happier, healthier, wealthier and fun, really.

22:17.440 --> 22:18.840
So what is this stuff?

22:18.840 --> 22:23.160

22:32.440 --> 22:36.240
immune system, energy, recovery, focus and aging, all the things.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.840
I take it first thing in the morning.

22:37.840 --> 22:40.440
I'll have a couple of water and then I'll do my athletic greens and then an hour

22:40.440 --> 22:43.240
later I'll do my cold brew or coffee, whatever.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.360
And it just, I'm off to the races.

22:45.400 --> 22:48.000

22:48.000 --> 22:52.240
It helps me feel more balanced, more with more mental clarity, definitely.

22:52.240 --> 22:56.880
And I've even got George Sava, my roommate, starting to love this stuff.

22:56.880 --> 22:57.880
The taste is great.

22:57.880 --> 23:01.080
It's not too, you know, vegetal, let's say.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.280
It's almost a little sweet.

23:03.280 --> 23:06.760
Tons of people take some kind of multivitamin and it's important to choose one with high-quality

23:06.760 --> 23:09.600
ingredients that your body will actually absorb.

23:09.600 --> 23:10.160
A.G.

23:10.160 --> 23:13.960
One, athletic greens is drink as a small micro habit with big benefits.

23:13.960 --> 23:18.160

And your subscription also comes with a year supply of vitamin D, which is incredibly

23:21.400 --> 23:22.920
important, especially in the winter month.

23:22.920 --> 23:26.640
And then we're getting into spring here, but still, you might even want to, you know,

23:26.640 --> 23:28.920
give it going was green.

23:28.920 --> 23:32.760
Athletic greens was created when the founder experienced a ton of gut health issues and ended

23:32.760 --> 23:36.800
up on a complicated supplement routine to recover.

23:36.800 --> 23:40.960
Cost him over $100 a day, so he created athletic greens after experiencing how difficult

23:40.960 --> 23:44.320
it was to create an optimal nutrition routine on your own.

23:44.320 --> 23:48.640
So right now, it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient,

23:48.640 --> 23:51.680
daily nutrition, especially heading into cold and flu season.

23:51.680 --> 23:54.120
It's just one scoop of in a cup of water every day.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.120
That's it.

23:55.120 --> 23:57.280

Thanks, athletic greens.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.800
Guys, winter is supposed to be a hybronation time, right?

24:19.800 --> 24:22.560
And I'm not going to deny, I'm staying in more than usual, but that doesn't mean I'm

24:22.560 --> 24:25.160
not busy or that I want to spend all my time in the kitchen.

24:25.160 --> 24:29.560
Luckily, I don't have to meal plan or prep, and I can still eat well, now that I leave

24:29.560 --> 24:31.440
my meals to factor.

24:31.440 --> 24:36.440
Factor makes it easy for me to clean 24-7 with fresh, never frozen prepared meals that

24:36.440 --> 24:38.440
are so delicious.

24:38.440 --> 24:42.520
You wouldn't believe they're actually good for you.

24:42.520 --> 24:47.120
Factor saves me time by delivering Chefcrafted meals to my doorstep, eliminating the hassle

24:47.120 --> 24:48.760
of grocery shopping and meal prep.

24:48.760 --> 24:49.760
Not to mention cleanup.

24:49.760 --> 24:50.760
No dishes to wash here, alright?

24:50.760 --> 24:52.440
I don't have a dishwasher.

24:52.440 --> 24:56.800
So dishes take forever, it's my least favorite chore to do, and grocery shopping even once

24:56.800 --> 24:57.800
a week.

24:57.800 --> 24:58.800
Well, everyone's every two weeks.

24:58.800 --> 25:01.840
It can be like 45 minutes to an hour, that's a lot of time.

25:01.840 --> 25:06.080
But each factor meal arrives pre-prepared and ready to eat in just two minutes, which

25:06.080 --> 25:08.440
is faster than even ordering in.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.600
Factor tackles the tough stuff, so I don't have to.

25:11.600 --> 25:16.400
Their registered dietitians and expert chefs work hand in hand to create meals with nutritious

25:16.400 --> 25:21.160
ingredients, and with more than 29 meal options each week, I'm never bored.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.760
Factor even knows my preferences.

25:22.760 --> 25:26.640
They offer vegan and veggie meals, keto meals, low calorie options, cold press juices,

25:26.640 --> 25:31.120
smoothies, energy bites, plant-based bars, extra protein options, veggie sides, and more

25:31.120 --> 25:33.720

We lost a team member because at the end of the day, this is a team and it should feel

25:59.320 --> 26:00.320
that way.

26:00.320 --> 26:03.240
And I know it doesn't always, but you know what, we're going to really get into it.

26:03.240 --> 26:06.840
Speaking of teams, it's time to play.

26:06.840 --> 26:09.840
Ah, fuck, where's the, yeah.

26:09.840 --> 26:12.640
I would've been a really great sideway.

26:12.640 --> 26:13.640
Yeah.

26:13.640 --> 26:26.640
I believe they're not, you've actually missed nothing.

26:26.640 --> 26:37.240
Nice.

26:37.240 --> 26:38.240
Thank you.

26:38.240 --> 26:45.840
John my name, you should vote.

26:45.840 --> 26:49.840
Welcome to Gunther No.

26:49.840 --> 26:50.840
Yeah.

26:50.840 --> 26:51.840
Yeah.

26:51.840 --> 26:54.480
This is Rick's idea.

26:54.480 --> 27:02.880
So Hoss's F1 team principle, Gunther Steiner is, is quickly, in the last four years,

27:02.880 --> 27:08.400
so that may not that quick, become sort of a superstar.

27:08.400 --> 27:11.880
Have we figured out if he's French because I can't place his accent?

27:11.880 --> 27:12.880
That is German.

27:12.880 --> 27:13.880
Pretty sure he's German.

27:13.880 --> 27:18.160
Oh, da, da, donkish.

27:18.160 --> 27:19.280
So this is Gunther No.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.280
I'm going to play a sound clip.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.960
You're going to tell me whether it's Gunther Steiner or someone else.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.560
Sorry, he's Italian.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.560
What?

27:26.560 --> 27:27.760
He does not know Italian.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.760
He's Italian, Italy.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.760
Like, where was he?

27:31.760 --> 27:33.760
He's Italian American.

27:33.760 --> 27:35.760
That's insane.

27:35.760 --> 27:36.360
Yeah.

27:36.360 --> 27:37.760
It feels like he's American.

27:37.760 --> 27:41.560
And he's doing what he thinks is an Italian accent.

27:41.560 --> 27:45.560
He sounds like he's from Minnesota, but he's doing an Arnold Schwarzenegger impression.

27:45.560 --> 27:46.560
Yeah.

27:46.560 --> 27:47.560
But he sounds like.

27:47.960 --> 27:48.960
Hold on.

27:48.960 --> 27:56.160
He's a native of South Tirol, which is maybe on the border of Italy.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.160
Yeah.

27:57.160 --> 27:58.760
It's like a little bit of Switzerland though.

27:58.760 --> 27:59.760
Yeah.

27:59.760 --> 28:00.760
Yeah.

28:00.760 --> 28:01.760
That's what I'm saying.

28:01.760 --> 28:02.760
Yeah.

28:02.760 --> 28:03.760
Okay.

28:03.760 --> 28:04.760
So yeah.

28:04.760 --> 28:06.760
He speaks German and Italian along with English.

28:06.760 --> 28:08.360
What town is he from?

28:08.360 --> 28:09.760
South Tirol.

28:09.760 --> 28:10.760
South Tirol.

28:10.760 --> 28:14.160
Do you think because he's from South Tirol, that his mouth is viral?

28:14.160 --> 28:15.160
No.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.160
It's like he's good at giving head.

28:16.160 --> 28:17.160
Yeah.

28:17.160 --> 28:18.160
Here we go.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.560
Gunther or nah.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.160
This is for actual cash.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.560
$10 for every right answer.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.160
$10 is going to be very, very wrong answer.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.160
Here we go.

28:25.160 --> 28:29.160
I'm sure it's an offer and this is burning going to one.

28:29.160 --> 28:31.160
No.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.160
What?

28:32.160 --> 28:34.160
Correct.

28:34.160 --> 28:36.160
$10 to Micah.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.160
Good word.

28:37.160 --> 28:40.160
I was so worried because I've never heard him speak in any thought.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.160
We gave you another context.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.160
All right.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.160
Here we go.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.160
I don't mind.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.160
No.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.160
Maybe he didn't want to come because he had no point.

28:50.160 --> 28:51.160
Maybe.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.160
Oh, man.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.160
Yeah.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.160
Correct.

28:55.160 --> 28:57.160
$10 to Micah.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.160
Neck and neck.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.160
Here we go.

28:59.160 --> 29:02.160
Practice seeing people is trees.

29:02.160 --> 29:04.160
No.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.160
I hit the wrong button.

29:06.160 --> 29:07.160
That's correct.

29:07.160 --> 29:08.160
$10 to Jake.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.160
Jake is you're all tied at 10.

29:10.160 --> 29:11.160
Here we go.

29:11.160 --> 29:12.160
What's the party?

29:12.160 --> 29:13.160
I wasn't invited.

29:13.160 --> 29:14.160
No.

29:15.160 --> 29:17.160
To cut a Johnson.

29:17.160 --> 29:18.160
Correct.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.160
Micah.

29:19.160 --> 29:20.160
Micah pulls that with $20.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.160
Here we go.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.160
Yeah.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.160
I should get some points for you.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.160
Well, no.

29:25.160 --> 29:26.160
I'm not.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.160
I'm not.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.160
Oh.

29:29.160 --> 29:30.160
Correct.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.160
This neck and neck.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.160
$20.

29:32.160 --> 29:33.160
Micah.

29:33.160 --> 29:34.160
Here we go.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.160
Hi.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.160
My name is Guantastanza.

29:36.160 --> 29:37.160
Yes.

29:37.160 --> 29:38.160
Correct.

29:38.160 --> 29:42.160
And like when I just said when I tweeted, I hope we play Gunther.

29:42.160 --> 29:43.160
No.

29:43.160 --> 29:47.160
I really thought it was going to be like reading quotes that sort of game.

29:47.160 --> 29:55.160
But sometimes Jeff tries like outsmart us, but this is one that's just so dumb.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.160
I mean, it's a 10 minute chunk that I had outlined.

29:57.160 --> 30:00.160
I also wanted to give us time to talk about F1.

30:00.160 --> 30:01.160
Yeah.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.160
All right.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.160
Where's the time?

30:03.160 --> 30:07.160
In the name of the father and of the sudden of the Holy Spirit.

30:07.160 --> 30:08.160
No.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.160
It's a sermon.

30:09.160 --> 30:10.160
Correct.

30:11.160 --> 30:13.160
I'm going to give my $10 to Jake actually for that.

30:13.160 --> 30:15.160
Me or now it's on the connect 2020.

30:15.160 --> 30:16.160
By the way, there's not a clear winner.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.160
Nobody gets any money.

30:17.160 --> 30:18.160
So here we go.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.160
Competition.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.160
We are gathered together.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.160
It's the same song.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.160
You're around the world.

30:23.160 --> 30:25.160
You're sitting out the same fucking guy.

30:25.160 --> 30:28.160
You found three different audio files.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.160
It was Ellen.

30:29.160 --> 30:32.160
The sermon and an interview with Gunther.

30:32.160 --> 30:34.160
Those are actually three different sermons.

30:34.160 --> 30:36.160
There's a file that's been seen on the gap.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.160
Like one on a Jewish one.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.160
This is fucking shit.

30:40.160 --> 30:41.160
Gunther.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.160
All right.

30:43.160 --> 30:45.160
I'm breaking the head with $30.

30:47.160 --> 30:48.160
What was that?

30:48.160 --> 30:49.160
Good.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.160
Yes.

30:50.160 --> 30:52.160
What was that?

30:52.160 --> 30:54.160
Is that when someone slammed the door super hard?

30:54.160 --> 30:55.160
Yeah.

30:57.160 --> 30:58.160
Go ahead.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.160
Go ahead.

30:59.160 --> 31:00.160
Would you repeat that again?

31:03.160 --> 31:04.160
No.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.160
Correct.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.160
30, 30, 30.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.160
I think.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.160
Last one.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.160
Good.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.160
Good.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.160
Good.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.160
Good.

31:15.160 --> 31:16.160
Good.

31:16.160 --> 31:18.160
All right.

31:18.160 --> 31:20.160
Name.

31:20.160 --> 31:21.160
My name?

31:21.160 --> 31:22.160
Yeah.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.160
Ha ha ha ha.

31:28.160 --> 31:29.160
Um, so.

31:29.160 --> 31:30.160
Okay. Yeah.

31:30.160 --> 31:31.160
We've talked about it a little bit.

31:31.160 --> 31:32.160
But I, signs is good.

31:33.160 --> 31:34.160
Signs is good.

31:34.160 --> 31:39.160
I'm not a huge fan of the fact that he is living in his father's shadow.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.160
That's what makes it worse.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.160
Yeah.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.160
It's not a good thing.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.160
Yeah.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.160
Is that going to answer?

31:46.160 --> 31:48.160
Well, I'm paying you money.

31:48.160 --> 31:49.160
So.

31:49.160 --> 31:50.160
I think you don't.

31:50.160 --> 31:55.160
I don't know if it's a bad thing necessarily.

31:55.160 --> 31:59.160
But it's like, you know, he had like a coach for freeze entire life.

31:59.160 --> 32:01.160
So how's that more impressive than Daniel?

32:01.160 --> 32:06.160
I think just about all of these kids grew up rich and had like five coaches.

32:06.160 --> 32:07.160
Yeah.

32:07.160 --> 32:08.160
Like with the exception.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.160
Same for Louis Hamilton.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.160
Yeah.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.160
That makes me.

32:11.160 --> 32:12.160
And Hamilton more.

32:12.160 --> 32:14.160
And Estabella on.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.160
Oh, I don't know that.

32:15.160 --> 32:16.160
Cool.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.160
Um, how did you settle on.

32:18.160 --> 32:21.160
Again, with with as little spoilers as possible.

32:21.160 --> 32:23.160
Uh, how did you settle on team for art?

32:23.160 --> 32:24.160
It was at science.

32:24.160 --> 32:27.160
The two drivers currently are very hot.

32:27.160 --> 32:28.160
They're all hot.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.160
Daniel.

32:30.160 --> 32:31.160
I mean, no one is.

32:31.160 --> 32:32.160
No one is as hot as La Clare.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.160
He's like, yeah.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.160
He's the ultimate himbo.

32:35.160 --> 32:36.160
Yeah.

32:36.160 --> 32:41.160
I think Carlos is hot.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.160
Yeah.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.160
I don't.

32:43.160 --> 32:44.160
I mean, I think he's good looking.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.160
But like Carlos is just really, really sweet.

32:46.160 --> 32:48.160
I always thought he was just like a real sweetheart.

32:48.160 --> 32:52.160
And it was like whatever teammate he's with.

32:52.160 --> 32:57.160
He like created a bond that nobody else could like the fact that he did that with

32:58.160 --> 32:59.160
Lando.

32:59.160 --> 33:00.160
And then it's also doing it with La Clare.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.160
Yeah.

33:01.160 --> 33:02.160
It's nice.

33:02.160 --> 33:05.160
I listen to this like a cage.

33:05.160 --> 33:11.160
I occasionally listen to an F1 podcast that I would describe as like.

33:11.160 --> 33:15.160
The twinnovation of F1 podcast.

33:15.160 --> 33:18.160
Like a kind of business we have.

33:18.160 --> 33:20.160
And they hate Carlos signs.

33:20.160 --> 33:22.160
And they're like, he's a little sneak.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.160
He's like a little snake.

33:23.160 --> 33:26.160
He's going to steal Charles thunder.

33:26.160 --> 33:27.160
So he's so bad.

33:27.160 --> 33:28.160
I have to turn out.

33:28.160 --> 33:29.160
But that's crazy.

33:29.160 --> 33:31.160
I can't imagine not liking signs.

33:31.160 --> 33:32.160
He's like.

33:32.160 --> 33:34.160
He's he has like bad luck.

33:34.160 --> 33:36.160
He's never won a race.

33:36.160 --> 33:38.160
But he's so he's like so consistently good.

33:38.160 --> 33:42.160
He was like the only person that scored points consistently last year for like.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.160
Yeah.

33:43.160 --> 33:44.160
Eight races or something.

33:44.160 --> 33:45.160
Yeah.

33:45.160 --> 33:46.160
He's quiet.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.160
He's quiet.

33:47.160 --> 33:48.160
He's good.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.160
Yeah.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.160
Yeah.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.160
The house was crazy though.

33:51.160 --> 33:52.160
Season one.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.160
You see a shot of this like pool.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.160
And I'm like, who's pool is that?

33:54.160 --> 33:55.160
He's huge mansion.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.160
And then they have that kitchen where they have.

33:56.160 --> 33:59.160
You have like like 18 of everything in the pantry.

33:59.160 --> 34:01.160
And they're like sitting down for breakfast.

34:01.160 --> 34:04.160
But with like the nicest breakfast movies I've ever seen.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.160
Carlos.

34:05.160 --> 34:06.160
He's a good follow on Instagram.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.160
Yeah.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.160
When they're like he off season.

34:08.160 --> 34:09.160
And he just like goes home.

34:09.160 --> 34:12.160
And he's just like living on the ocean surfing with his dog.

34:12.160 --> 34:13.160
Yeah.

34:13.160 --> 34:14.160
His dog's really cute.

34:14.160 --> 34:17.160
He's a terrible food photographer.

34:17.160 --> 34:18.160
He's hilarious.

34:18.160 --> 34:19.160
He's a bad.

34:19.160 --> 34:20.160
For like all of these.

34:20.160 --> 34:22.160
He's had a couple bites.

34:22.160 --> 34:23.160
I mean, I know.

34:23.160 --> 34:26.160
It's like, so it's so bad.

34:26.160 --> 34:27.160
You have to follow it.

34:27.160 --> 34:28.160
And you'll see.

34:28.160 --> 34:30.160
He's great though.

34:30.160 --> 34:31.160
Yeah.

34:31.160 --> 34:32.160
I love Carlos.

34:32.160 --> 34:33.160
No spoilers.

34:33.160 --> 34:34.160
Landos.

34:34.160 --> 34:35.160
Great.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.160
Um.

34:36.160 --> 34:38.160
And I like Lewis Hamilton.

34:38.160 --> 34:39.160
I really do.

34:39.160 --> 34:44.160
But you guys don't feel bad rooting for like the team that wins it every time pretty much.

34:44.160 --> 34:45.160
I don't.

34:45.160 --> 34:46.160
I don't.

34:46.160 --> 34:47.160
But I don't.

34:47.160 --> 34:48.160
I wouldn't.

34:48.160 --> 34:50.160
I don't feel bad when he wins.

34:50.160 --> 34:51.160
Yeah.

34:51.160 --> 34:54.160
He what he's got that he does is kind of like insane.

34:54.160 --> 34:57.160
Like he wins a lot of races that anyone else will lose.

34:57.160 --> 34:58.160
Yeah.

34:58.160 --> 35:00.160
Just beyond any other driver.

35:00.160 --> 35:04.160
I really wanted him to win last year.

35:04.160 --> 35:07.160
Soly because I was like.

35:07.160 --> 35:09.160
He would have achieved the goal.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.160
Like he would have beat.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.160
Michael Srivaka's record.

35:11.160 --> 35:13.160
Like there's no more after that.

35:13.160 --> 35:14.160
Like it doesn't matter.

35:14.160 --> 35:15.160
Yeah.

35:15.160 --> 35:16.160
And it would have been like less dramatic.

35:16.160 --> 35:18.160
And now it's more dramatic.

35:18.160 --> 35:21.160
And I just I want him to win to get to that place.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.160
Like right.

35:22.160 --> 35:23.160
I'd rather someone else win.

35:23.160 --> 35:25.160
But I want him to win to.

35:25.160 --> 35:26.160
I'd rather.

35:26.160 --> 35:28.160
I would like him to win this year after the.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.160
How bad he got fucked at.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.160
Uh.

35:31.160 --> 35:32.160
And I would not be.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.160
He got lucky feed.

35:33.160 --> 35:34.160
Yeah.

35:34.160 --> 35:35.160
Yeah.

35:35.160 --> 35:36.160
Yeah.

35:36.160 --> 35:37.160
Spoiler.

35:37.160 --> 35:39.160
There's no way Jeff doesn't.

35:39.160 --> 35:40.160
I didn't know that.

35:40.160 --> 35:42.160
But also like the show.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.160
The show is not really about like explain.

35:44.160 --> 35:45.160
Like things that happened in F1.

35:45.160 --> 35:47.160
It's things that are happening behind the scenes.

35:47.160 --> 35:48.160
Like I.

35:48.160 --> 35:49.160
Yeah.

35:49.160 --> 35:50.160
I watched that race.

35:50.160 --> 35:51.160
Would be exactly.

35:51.160 --> 35:53.160
I watched every race last year.

35:53.160 --> 35:55.160
And I'm still loving season four.

35:55.160 --> 35:56.160
Yeah.

35:56.160 --> 35:57.160
Yeah.

35:57.160 --> 35:59.160
Like it gives you more of your thoughts on Christian Horner.

35:59.160 --> 36:00.160
How do you feel about him?

36:00.160 --> 36:01.160
I haven't.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.160
I wouldn't go across him.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.160
Yeah.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.160
I've truly.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.160
You must.

36:05.160 --> 36:06.160
No.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.160
There's the whole.

36:07.160 --> 36:08.160
What about the.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.160
Daniel Ricardo.

36:09.160 --> 36:10.160
His like contract thing.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.160
This an app doesn't that happen early.

36:12.160 --> 36:13.160
Yeah.

36:13.160 --> 36:14.160
But the other the other.

36:14.160 --> 36:15.160
The other drivers.

36:15.160 --> 36:16.160
Max.

36:16.160 --> 36:16.660
Something.

36:16.660 --> 36:18.660
Christian Horner's the team principal for.

36:18.660 --> 36:19.660
Oh.

36:19.660 --> 36:22.660
He's like seeing him talk to like Ricardo's dad.

36:22.660 --> 36:25.660
And he's like like trying to like butter him up a little bit.

36:25.660 --> 36:27.660
But who knows.

36:27.660 --> 36:28.660
Micah.

36:28.660 --> 36:30.660
You know, just because you haven't seen any F1 stuff.

36:30.660 --> 36:33.660
It seems like he watched his first race this weekend.

36:33.660 --> 36:34.660
Oh, I watched.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.660
I watched a few races last season too.

36:36.660 --> 36:39.660
What did you think?

36:39.660 --> 36:40.660
It was exciting.

36:40.660 --> 36:41.660
At the time.

36:41.660 --> 36:42.660
It was exciting.

36:42.660 --> 36:43.660
And then in between those times.

36:43.660 --> 36:44.660
It was going to be boring.

36:44.660 --> 36:45.660
Yeah.

36:45.660 --> 36:46.660
But it's a perfect.

36:46.660 --> 36:49.660
If it is the perfect phone companion.

36:49.660 --> 36:50.660
Yeah.

36:50.660 --> 36:51.660
It's like the perfect.

36:51.660 --> 36:52.660
Sun day act.

36:52.660 --> 36:53.660
Sun day.

36:53.660 --> 36:54.660
Yeah.

36:54.660 --> 36:55.660
But there on Sundays.

36:55.660 --> 36:56.660
I wouldn't know.

36:56.660 --> 36:57.660
I'm not going to watch them.

36:57.660 --> 36:58.660
I'm not going to watch them.

36:58.660 --> 37:00.660
I'm not going to watch them.

37:00.660 --> 37:01.660
I can't.

37:01.660 --> 37:03.660
I probably will just check in on qualifiers.

37:03.660 --> 37:05.660
But Micah was that cock of yours.

37:05.660 --> 37:06.660
He was into F1.

37:06.660 --> 37:09.660
He was going to talk about that.

37:09.660 --> 37:11.660
You said we didn't work anymore.

37:11.660 --> 37:21.660
I am going to the Canadian Grand Prix.

37:21.660 --> 37:22.660
I am going to the Canadian Grand Prix.

37:22.660 --> 37:23.660
Hmm.

37:23.660 --> 37:24.660
When is that out?

37:24.660 --> 37:25.660
In June.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.660
Have you guys seen Love Is Blind?

37:27.660 --> 37:28.660
Yes.

37:28.660 --> 37:29.660
I've loved it.

37:29.660 --> 37:30.660
I've loved it.

37:30.660 --> 37:32.660
I want to spend the rest of my life with.

37:32.660 --> 37:35.660
I've never seen her before.

37:35.660 --> 37:38.660
Welcome to Love Is Fines.

37:38.660 --> 37:39.660
Okay.

37:40.660 --> 37:41.660
So.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.660
The name of the game is Love Is Fines.

37:43.660 --> 37:45.660
Jake, I know you're married.

37:45.660 --> 37:47.660
I understand there's some.

37:47.660 --> 37:48.660
There's some tension though.

37:48.660 --> 37:50.660
Cause Jill reached out to me, which was weird.

37:50.660 --> 37:51.660
It's a miracle.

37:51.660 --> 37:52.660
It's marital.

37:52.660 --> 37:53.660
It's marital.

37:53.660 --> 37:54.660
Bliss.

37:54.660 --> 37:55.660
For me.

37:55.660 --> 37:56.660
And it's marital.

37:56.660 --> 37:57.660
This for Jill.

37:57.660 --> 37:58.660
Meaning.

37:58.660 --> 38:01.660
I am dismissed from my bliss.

38:01.660 --> 38:02.660
And she has.

38:02.660 --> 38:03.660
With a slap on the wrist.

38:03.660 --> 38:05.660
She has a wrist.

38:05.660 --> 38:08.660
So basically, I can, you know, it's safe to say you guys are all

38:08.660 --> 38:10.660
looking for love.

38:10.660 --> 38:13.660
And so this is a game where you're going to, you know,

38:13.660 --> 38:14.660
go on dates.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.660
So to speak with the love of your life,

38:16.660 --> 38:17.660
potentially.

38:17.660 --> 38:18.660
But you can't see who they are.

38:18.660 --> 38:19.660
And it is really nice.

38:19.660 --> 38:21.660
So why don't we start with Marika.

38:21.660 --> 38:23.660
Marika, let's say you're on a first day.

38:23.660 --> 38:24.660
You're in your little pod.

38:24.660 --> 38:26.660
What's the first question you might ask?

38:26.660 --> 38:29.660
I'd probably ask him why he.

38:29.660 --> 38:31.660
Spoke out in supportive.

38:31.660 --> 38:32.660
Jake, you're outing.

38:32.660 --> 38:33.660
Hmm.

38:33.660 --> 38:34.660
I'm a god.

38:34.660 --> 38:37.660
I wouldn't live forever.

38:38.660 --> 38:39.660
Yeah.

38:39.660 --> 38:40.660
That's not a good first day.

38:40.660 --> 38:42.660
Yeah, not a good, not a good response.

38:42.660 --> 38:44.660
And then boom, you're in your talking head.

38:44.660 --> 38:45.660
What are you saying about fines?

38:45.660 --> 38:46.660
I mean, sorry.

38:46.660 --> 38:47.660
So he's a turf.

38:47.660 --> 38:49.660
For sure.

38:49.660 --> 38:50.660
For sure.

38:50.660 --> 38:51.660
Yeah.

38:51.660 --> 38:53.660
All right.

38:53.660 --> 38:54.660
Let's swing it over to Michael.

38:54.660 --> 38:56.660
Michael, you're on your first blind date,

38:56.660 --> 38:59.660
which is should we say fines date with someone you don't even know.

38:59.660 --> 39:00.660
You can't see who they are.

39:00.660 --> 39:01.660
You're going to get to know him.

39:01.660 --> 39:02.660
What's your first question?

39:02.660 --> 39:03.660
Is it ray fines?

39:03.660 --> 39:04.660
What's that?

39:04.660 --> 39:06.660
Is it, is it ray fines?

39:06.660 --> 39:08.660
Like that's your first date with.

39:08.660 --> 39:09.660
Yeah.

39:09.660 --> 39:10.660
Who is it?

39:10.660 --> 39:11.660
You know, you're not allowed to see them.

39:11.660 --> 39:13.660
You can infer maybe based on the voice.

39:13.660 --> 39:15.660
You said it was ray fines.

39:15.660 --> 39:17.660
I said love is fines.

39:17.660 --> 39:19.660
Meaning you're not going to be able to see who you're talking to.

39:19.660 --> 39:21.660
And it is ray fines.

39:21.660 --> 39:22.660
Okay.

39:22.660 --> 39:28.660
I would ask him if he's going to be in the next bond film.

39:28.660 --> 39:30.660
Or who the next bond is.

39:30.660 --> 39:34.660
I require your warm.

39:35.660 --> 39:37.660
He doesn't seem like a good listener.

39:37.660 --> 39:39.660
I require your bond.

39:39.660 --> 39:42.660
I mean, I'd say I require your bond or blood.

39:42.660 --> 39:43.660
Which one?

39:43.660 --> 39:44.660
One.

39:44.660 --> 39:46.660
I don't really.

39:46.660 --> 39:49.660
I thought I had Michael got to choose the next bond.

39:49.660 --> 39:55.660
Like they do that they seeded power to choose the next bond to ray fines.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.660
And actually could just play bond.

39:57.660 --> 39:58.660
Actually he was.

39:58.660 --> 39:59.660
He was.

39:59.660 --> 40:02.660
But he gives his power to Michael.

40:03.660 --> 40:05.660
All right, Jake, you're in your pod.

40:05.660 --> 40:06.660
What's your first question?

40:06.660 --> 40:09.660
How many sexual partners have you had?

40:09.660 --> 40:11.660
Some to a few times a day is a nice lift.

40:11.660 --> 40:12.660
I should sue.

40:15.660 --> 40:16.660
Clearly avoiding the question.

40:16.660 --> 40:17.660
It must be real.

40:17.660 --> 40:18.660
It must be a lot.

40:18.660 --> 40:19.660
Yeah.

40:19.660 --> 40:21.660
Changing the subject.

40:21.660 --> 40:24.660
Also, I almost got in two bar fights in Crested Beauty.

40:24.660 --> 40:25.660
Why?

40:25.660 --> 40:28.660
People are aggressive in that town, man.

40:28.660 --> 40:29.660
I didn't start either of them,

40:29.660 --> 40:31.660
but I definitely matched the aggression.

40:31.660 --> 40:33.660
Because I, and I'm not an aggressive person.

40:33.660 --> 40:34.660
So that was surprising to me.

40:34.660 --> 40:37.660
The first time we were in this bar.

40:37.660 --> 40:38.660
It was St. Patrick's Day.

40:38.660 --> 40:40.660
So also, I mean, I was really just picked.

40:40.660 --> 40:41.660
It's a big fighting day.

40:41.660 --> 40:42.660
Irish tradition.

40:42.660 --> 40:43.660
Yeah.

40:43.660 --> 40:44.660
But there was this guy.

40:44.660 --> 40:45.660
He was like in his 50s.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.660
He was like really drunk and yelling.

40:47.660 --> 40:49.660
And then the bartender took like popcorn.

40:49.660 --> 40:50.660
It was like shut the fuck up.

40:50.660 --> 40:52.660
And like through popcorn atom.

40:52.660 --> 40:56.660
And then later we thought that this pool table was open.

40:56.660 --> 40:57.660
That he had been playing on all night.

40:57.660 --> 41:00.660
So like my friend Kevin lined up the, the white ball.

41:00.660 --> 41:04.660
And he was like, hey, like this is my table.

41:04.660 --> 41:05.660
And they were like, oh, sorry.

41:05.660 --> 41:06.660
Like, didn't think you were still playing.

41:06.660 --> 41:07.660
He was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:07.660 --> 41:09.660
Well, this is my house.

41:09.660 --> 41:11.660
So you don't, like, you don't want to fuck with the table.

41:11.660 --> 41:13.660
I was like, all right, sorry.

41:13.660 --> 41:16.660
And then he went back and didn't play again.

41:16.660 --> 41:18.660
And then Kevin was like, like, what are the odds?

41:18.660 --> 41:20.660
He like grab a ball and run to the bathroom.

41:20.660 --> 41:21.660
And I was like, I don't need to do odds.

41:21.660 --> 41:22.660
I'm just going to do it.

41:22.660 --> 41:24.660
So I grabbed like one of the balls and like,

41:24.660 --> 41:25.660
pretended to run to the bathroom,

41:25.660 --> 41:26.660
but didn't even.

41:26.660 --> 41:28.660
And then came back and put it right there.

41:28.660 --> 41:31.660
And then he like got in my face and was like,

41:31.660 --> 41:34.660
like, you know, like, if you, you shouldn't look for trouble here.

41:34.660 --> 41:36.660
Like, this isn't the place to look for trouble.

41:36.660 --> 41:37.660
He's like, where you from?

41:37.660 --> 41:38.660
And I was like, like, well, L.A.

41:38.660 --> 41:40.660
And he's like, yeah, well, I lived down the street.

41:40.660 --> 41:41.660
And I was like, all right.

41:41.660 --> 41:43.660
And he's like, so you don't want to, like,

41:43.660 --> 41:45.660
and I was like, there's not going to be any trouble.

41:45.660 --> 41:46.660
And like, I was like, also in his face,

41:46.660 --> 41:48.660
which I was like, shouldn't have done probably.

41:48.660 --> 41:49.660
And then he was like, yeah, like, again,

41:49.660 --> 41:50.660
this is my house.

41:50.660 --> 41:51.660
And I was like, this is your house.

41:51.660 --> 41:53.660
Is that why the bartender was throwing popcorn at you earlier

41:53.660 --> 41:55.660
until you just shut the fuck up?

41:55.660 --> 41:57.660
And he like kind of stumbled and he's like, what?

41:57.660 --> 41:58.660
Shake my hand.

41:58.660 --> 41:59.660
And I was like, no.

41:59.660 --> 42:02.660
And then he's like, and then he's just like kind of like shook his head

42:02.660 --> 42:04.660
and like walked away.

42:04.660 --> 42:06.660
And then he like, we were like,

42:06.660 --> 42:08.660
stayed where we were standing next to the pool table.

42:08.660 --> 42:10.660
And then we started doing bits about something else.

42:10.660 --> 42:11.660
We completely moved on.

42:11.660 --> 42:12.660
And then he thought we were laughing at him.

42:12.660 --> 42:15.660
And then he like came up to like trying to start something

42:15.660 --> 42:16.660
with us again.

42:16.660 --> 42:18.660
And I was just like, let's just move over there.

42:18.660 --> 42:21.660
And then the second time I was in line

42:21.660 --> 42:22.660
to go to the bathroom at a different bar.

42:22.660 --> 42:24.660
And there were three people in front of me.

42:24.660 --> 42:27.660
And everybody was going in and just it was like a one-stall bathroom.

42:27.660 --> 42:28.660
Nobody was closing the door.

42:28.660 --> 42:29.660
It seemed fine.

42:29.660 --> 42:30.660
Everybody was drunk.

42:30.660 --> 42:31.660
I was late in the night.

42:31.660 --> 42:32.660
I didn't think twice about it.

42:32.660 --> 42:34.660
So when I went in just following everybody else's lead,

42:34.660 --> 42:36.660
I'd peed with the door open.

42:36.660 --> 42:38.660
And then like this guy bursts into the bathroom.

42:38.660 --> 42:40.660
And he's like, like, what are you doing?

42:40.660 --> 42:41.660
Like, being with the door open?

42:41.660 --> 42:43.660
And I was like, dude, get out of here.

42:43.660 --> 42:46.660
And it was like, it was truly space for one person.

42:46.660 --> 42:49.660
So he was like inches away from me as I'm actively peeing.

42:49.660 --> 42:51.660
And then like when I finally like walk out,

42:51.660 --> 42:53.660
he was like, like, what the fuck was that?

42:53.660 --> 42:55.660
And he was like, or he said that to me.

42:55.660 --> 42:57.660
And I was like, what the fuck was that?

42:57.660 --> 42:58.660
What was the fuck was that?

42:58.660 --> 42:59.660
You don't walk into the bathroom when someone's peeing.

42:59.660 --> 43:01.660
And then he was like, everybody else was peeing

43:01.660 --> 43:02.660
with the door open.

43:02.660 --> 43:03.660
And it wasn't a fucking issue.

43:03.660 --> 43:04.660
Do you even work here?

43:04.660 --> 43:06.660
And he was like, yeah, I'm the bouncer.

43:06.660 --> 43:08.660
And I'm like, oh, oh.

43:08.660 --> 43:09.660
I'm so sorry.

43:09.660 --> 43:11.660
Then he's like, oh, now you're sorry.

43:11.660 --> 43:12.660
I'm like, yeah.

43:12.660 --> 43:15.660
Because I was your son guy who like assaulted me basically.

43:15.660 --> 43:18.660
If you're the bouncer, then of course I shouldn't do it.

43:18.660 --> 43:19.660
Like, yes, I'll listen to you.

43:19.660 --> 43:20.660
And then you make the rules.

43:20.660 --> 43:21.660
Yeah.

43:22.660 --> 43:24.660
And then I apologize to him on our way out.

43:24.660 --> 43:25.660
And it was all fine.

43:25.660 --> 43:28.660
But closest I've come to being in a fight in a long time.

43:28.660 --> 43:30.660
And what about was it with a 50 year old?

43:30.660 --> 43:31.660
Yeah.

43:31.660 --> 43:33.660
I mean, he wasn't going to fight me.

43:33.660 --> 43:36.660
That's why I was like, I wanted to raise him a little bit.

43:36.660 --> 43:40.660
Anyway, you were peeing with the door wide open.

43:40.660 --> 43:42.660
Everybody was doing it.

43:42.660 --> 43:45.660
I thought we got a lot of things.

43:45.660 --> 43:46.660
Was it a stall door?

43:46.660 --> 43:50.660
So there was like a door to the bathroom and then the stall door was on.

43:50.660 --> 43:53.660
I feel like you're not putting your eggs in the basket that is fine.

43:53.660 --> 43:55.660
And you're never going to find love if not.

43:55.660 --> 43:56.660
Well, it's fine.

43:56.660 --> 43:57.660
Second day.

43:57.660 --> 43:58.660
That's fine.

43:58.660 --> 43:59.660
Second day.

43:59.660 --> 44:02.660
So know that you can ask maybe some more personal questions.

44:02.660 --> 44:04.660
Here we go.

44:04.660 --> 44:08.660
Oh, just, I mean, again, I'd probably follow up on my previous question.

44:08.660 --> 44:11.660
I don't think I'd be on the day with a, any more.

44:11.660 --> 44:12.660
Because he didn't answer.

44:12.660 --> 44:13.660
But for the sake of argument.

44:13.660 --> 44:18.660
For the sake of argument, just ask another question.

44:18.660 --> 44:19.660
Yeah.

44:20.660 --> 44:25.660
Oh, I probably ask him why he likes doing the Kingsman movies.

44:25.660 --> 44:27.660
Because I don't like them.

44:27.660 --> 44:28.660
Mmm, that's good.

44:28.660 --> 44:31.660
It's, um, I parachute it out of a plane.

44:31.660 --> 44:33.660
My parachute's caught on a tree.

44:33.660 --> 44:37.660
And I'm dangling about, you see, this big precipice.

44:37.660 --> 44:42.660
And this is my escape trying to get out using knives that I have on me.

44:42.660 --> 44:47.660
Because I take off a boot, I put a knife in the tail of the boot, which I used to chip into the ice.

44:47.660 --> 44:48.660
And I climb up.

44:48.660 --> 44:51.660
And so a lot of it is digital enhancement.

44:51.660 --> 44:52.660
Mmm.

44:52.660 --> 44:53.660
Yeah.

44:53.660 --> 44:54.660
So not, not really answered.

44:54.660 --> 44:55.660
Could have been an answer.

44:55.660 --> 44:59.660
It could potentially be a, like, I like he likes doing this.

44:59.660 --> 45:00.660
Yeah.

45:00.660 --> 45:02.660
I don't know if that was in those movies.

45:02.660 --> 45:04.660
Also, what he, it was in coherent rambling.

45:04.660 --> 45:06.660
That's not what happens in the Kingsman.

45:06.660 --> 45:07.660
Second day.

45:07.660 --> 45:09.660
Uh, what do you do for fun?

45:09.660 --> 45:14.660
I think Ginny's honesty and integrity of huge value to me.

45:17.660 --> 45:20.660
He's a Ginny's honesty and integrity.

45:20.660 --> 45:22.660
I thought he's a Ginny.

45:22.660 --> 45:23.660
No.

45:23.660 --> 45:25.660
I thought he said Ginny.

45:25.660 --> 45:27.660
Jake?

45:27.660 --> 45:33.660
Describe, uh, describe your penis to me in detail.

45:33.660 --> 45:34.660
Too greedy.

45:34.660 --> 45:41.660
Um, but I also, uh, might seem so many things that I just, like, want to totally grab all.

45:41.660 --> 45:42.660
Who is that?

45:42.660 --> 45:44.660
That was Paul Baino.

45:45.660 --> 45:46.660
Why?

45:46.660 --> 45:48.660
You can't just have one participant on him.

45:48.660 --> 45:49.660
Do you mind?

45:49.660 --> 45:50.660
Or love his mind?

45:50.660 --> 45:53.660
I want to go on a date with Paul Diano.

45:53.660 --> 45:54.660
Um, alright.

45:54.660 --> 45:56.660
Maria, can I bring us home?

45:56.660 --> 45:58.660
One last thing.

45:58.660 --> 45:59.660
For fines.

45:59.660 --> 46:00.660
Yeah.

46:00.660 --> 46:02.660
Uh,

46:02.660 --> 46:05.660
What's his favorite movie?

46:05.660 --> 46:06.660
I love you.

46:06.660 --> 46:08.660
Too fast.

46:08.660 --> 46:10.660
And I love his earning to be honest because I really

46:10.660 --> 46:11.660
nagged him.

46:11.660 --> 46:12.660
So.

46:12.660 --> 46:13.660
I really.

46:13.660 --> 46:17.660
Can't believe Jake got the Diano quote.

46:17.660 --> 46:25.660
That was love his dad and Mano.

46:25.660 --> 46:27.660
Um, that really didn't go well.

46:27.660 --> 46:29.660
Oh, it finds.

46:29.660 --> 46:34.660
I keep deciding to do that at home.

46:34.660 --> 46:36.660
Very less.

46:36.660 --> 46:39.660
Like, when the word is out of my mouth.

46:40.660 --> 46:45.660
You can make it play all really quickly.

46:45.660 --> 46:46.660
All right.

46:46.660 --> 46:47.660
Plugs.

46:47.660 --> 46:48.660
What do you guys have going on?

46:48.660 --> 46:50.660
What do you want to point to people to the floor is yours?

46:50.660 --> 46:52.660
Let's start with Micah.

46:52.660 --> 46:53.660
Oh, God.

46:53.660 --> 46:54.660
I don't have anything.

46:54.660 --> 46:56.660
Or about a wallet, though.

46:56.660 --> 46:57.660
Oh, cop.

46:57.660 --> 46:58.660
Yeah.

46:58.660 --> 46:59.660
Buy our wallet.

46:59.660 --> 47:00.660
We made wallets.

47:00.660 --> 47:03.660
Are you guys still selling hats?

47:03.660 --> 47:04.660
We are.

47:04.660 --> 47:05.660
Yeah.

47:05.660 --> 47:06.660
We sure are.

47:06.660 --> 47:08.660
Actually, I need one because I gave one to some random guy.

47:08.660 --> 47:09.660
Random guy.

47:09.660 --> 47:10.660
Random guy.

47:10.660 --> 47:11.660
Kind of.

47:11.660 --> 47:14.660
I'll talk about it.

47:14.660 --> 47:16.660
We'll chat offline.

47:16.660 --> 47:18.660
We'll chat offline.

47:18.660 --> 47:20.660
I gave it to Dayno on an on a date.

47:20.660 --> 47:21.660

47:21.660 --> 47:22.660
Hey, it's.

48:38.660 --> 48:43.660
Uh, Nicole buyer and Lauren Lapkas are watching the MCU

48:43.660 --> 48:50.660
are bridged and great for me kind of sometimes I hear about the movies

48:50.660 --> 48:54.660
that they don't like and get a deep sadness within me.

48:54.660 --> 48:55.660
But it's fine.

48:55.660 --> 48:56.660
And it's fun.

48:56.660 --> 48:58.660
Uh, and you should listen because it's really funny.

48:58.660 --> 49:01.660
Um, I had a pitch for newcomers season.

49:01.660 --> 49:02.660
What it would be.

49:02.660 --> 49:03.660
Five or six.

49:03.660 --> 49:04.660
Six.

49:04.660 --> 49:06.660
Double WWE.

49:06.660 --> 49:08.660
They would hate that.

49:08.660 --> 49:11.660
The story lines are, I don't watch it, but George's friend watches it.

49:11.660 --> 49:13.660
And sometimes George would be like, hey, this.

49:13.660 --> 49:16.660
So this is a storyline happening in the WWE and it's fucking crazy.

49:16.660 --> 49:20.660
Uh, they could just watch it like for eight weeks leading up to WrestleMania.

49:20.660 --> 49:23.660
Cool.

49:23.660 --> 49:25.660
Do you want to yes in the room?

49:25.660 --> 49:26.660
Thank you.

49:26.660 --> 49:28.660
It's under consideration.

49:28.660 --> 49:29.660

WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.640
Boy must your guy's faces be red.

00:34.640 --> 00:36.240
Why?

00:36.240 --> 00:41.440
Because I'm fucking back, it feels like...

00:41.440 --> 00:43.280
It feels like you are.

00:43.280 --> 00:46.000
I don't know yet, I wanted to hear you guys have to say.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
You're already backpedaling.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.160
I don't know what's going to happen.

00:50.160 --> 00:54.800
You had the tone of someone who had that fucking confidence,

00:54.800 --> 00:58.000
but it seems like it's a thin veneer.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.960
You're actually a scared little boy, aren't you?

01:00.960 --> 01:04.080
And also, like, what is Johnny going to do, you know?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.640
Hell yeah, I don't have any kind of leverage there.

01:08.640 --> 01:09.840
Oh, I'm not going to help you.

01:10.560 --> 01:11.040
Really?

01:11.040 --> 01:12.560
I'd like to maintain my job.

01:12.560 --> 01:13.280
Yeah.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.080
Yeah.

01:14.080 --> 01:20.160
Ideally, you reinstate me in the next five to ten minutes.

01:20.160 --> 01:20.720
Sure.

01:20.720 --> 01:22.160
And then we have a normal episode.

01:22.160 --> 01:23.360
Sure, I am.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.320
So happy as I've ever seen him.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.240
He wanted a life raft.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.120
We threw him a honey nut Cheerio.

01:35.120 --> 01:35.760
All right.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.120
Oh.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.200
I'm pretty happy about those to be honest.

01:45.200 --> 01:50.880
I can't personally deal with posting another audio book

01:50.880 --> 01:54.080
reading at 12.30 a.m.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.200
Because it truly gave me nightmares.

02:00.880 --> 02:01.200
Yeah.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.400
And what was that episode title?

02:04.240 --> 02:05.120
Fuck it.

02:05.120 --> 02:05.440
Yeah.

02:06.640 --> 02:07.920
Got your attention, didn't it?

02:08.960 --> 02:10.800
That was released this morning at 1 a.m.

02:10.800 --> 02:15.040
Pacific and here you fucking are out of obligation.

02:15.040 --> 02:18.400
Technically, we agreed to this before that went up.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.160
Here are your options.

02:21.040 --> 02:21.360
Right?

02:21.360 --> 02:22.080
What options?

02:23.040 --> 02:23.440
You're back.

02:24.800 --> 02:29.040
Oh, so I'm playing celebration to be mad at us.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.960
You can be a little happier doing it.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.760
You guys are like begrudgingly allowing me back to how it's the show.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.160
So it is a head-gump podcast again.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.120
Yeah.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.320
It always was.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.600
You was seemingly commendier the feed or something.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.280
I do have a couple

02:44.400 --> 02:47.520
requests demands really going forward.

02:48.480 --> 02:49.040
Okay.

02:49.040 --> 02:52.960
I want complete creative autonomy.

02:54.720 --> 02:56.320
You've already had that.

02:56.320 --> 03:01.040
I want a fee for hosting the show every week.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.040
You get paid to do that.

03:03.040 --> 03:06.400
I want a microphone that I can keep at my house.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.280
So if I have to do ads or record from home, I can.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.000
Yeah.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.160
Where are you doing right now?

03:12.160 --> 03:13.360
Okay.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.960
And I want access to both studios depending on what city I'm in.

03:17.040 --> 03:17.920
Yeah.

03:17.920 --> 03:18.960
You have schedules open.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.880
You definitely have keys, key cards.

03:22.720 --> 03:23.120
Okay.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.880
Then see you're fine.

03:25.840 --> 03:26.400
My demands are done.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.440
All your demands are met.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.160
Yeah.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.200
So we're just going to move on.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.560
Like nothing happened for three weeks.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.040
I think you know what you want it.

03:33.040 --> 03:33.360
Yeah.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.800
Like what else would you, what do you want?

03:40.080 --> 03:40.480
Yeah.

03:43.440 --> 03:43.920
I don't know.

03:43.920 --> 03:45.120
I kind of got everything I wanted.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.240
I guess I got us for a raise.

03:47.200 --> 03:51.360
I think you guys need me more than I need you.

03:53.040 --> 03:56.080
Demanded to get hired back and you said,

03:56.080 --> 03:56.720
fuck it.

03:56.720 --> 03:57.360
Promobly.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.640
Pretty much rule at your witsend.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.240
I'm at my witsend.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.200
You haven't seen my witsend.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.200
All over the place.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.800
And you got a focus.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.640
I would like to have me.

04:08.640 --> 04:09.200
Yeah.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.240
Yeah.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.640
The things are too wild.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.960
Just focus.

04:15.440 --> 04:16.880
Try your fascinies.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.400
Have you ever been to Mad Happy?

04:20.240 --> 04:21.040
No.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.880
I don't hear what we are again.

04:22.880 --> 04:23.920
You're back peddling.

04:23.920 --> 04:26.320
The qualities are already getting worse as we go on.

04:26.320 --> 04:26.880
I think I've done that.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.320
You're mentioning something so specific.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.040
But where is it?

04:31.920 --> 04:33.760
I think there is a real one in there.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.320
There is three one in Williamsburg.

04:37.600 --> 04:38.720
I think it closed though.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.480
Jeff is Mad Happy.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.000
You're mad and then you're happy.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.960
Bouncing back between those two.

04:46.960 --> 04:49.360
I didn't have a great time the last three weeks.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.720
Because I thought I was unemployed.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.360
Oh, also can we talk about it?

04:53.360 --> 04:54.880
So you did.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.000
You got fired.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.120
But you somehow snuck into our company offsite.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.440
The neck, the like the very next week.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.600
I don't really understand how that happened.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.760
But you did suddenly show up at the on-dogs.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.720
And we haven't really discussed the offsite.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.560
And I sneak in.

05:14.560 --> 05:18.080
I want to talk on-dogs because ultimately that is on-dogs.

05:18.080 --> 05:18.960
Johnny, let's start with you.

05:18.960 --> 05:23.520
What was your rosebud thorn of the headgum company offsite slash retreat?

05:24.560 --> 05:25.200
Two and a half.

05:25.200 --> 05:25.600
So the rose?

05:26.640 --> 05:29.600
The rose was arriving in a very sunny Arizona.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.960
I had the world at my fingertips.

05:32.960 --> 05:33.520
It felt like.

05:33.520 --> 05:36.720
And then the thorn, let's just get right to it,

05:36.720 --> 05:40.720
was getting that message from you saying that we are going to be

05:40.720 --> 05:42.960
roaming together at the on-dogs.

05:44.960 --> 05:45.760
This is a true thing.

05:45.760 --> 05:46.960
We did room together.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.560
Everyone else got their own room.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.080
Including our own fire.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.280
The Monday before.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.640
Yeah, but like, are we really going to put a new

05:54.640 --> 05:57.760
higher in with like, you know, Marty?

05:57.760 --> 06:00.960
That seems to be like the worst possible situation.

06:00.960 --> 06:05.520
I think I also, I'd never brought this up with anyone during the thing.

06:05.520 --> 06:09.040
Did anyone else's rooms have overhead lights?

06:09.840 --> 06:12.880
Because mine did not, and I, it was just a thing.

06:12.880 --> 06:13.600
A struggle.

06:13.600 --> 06:17.600
I had to like go around and like turn on a bunch of different lamps to get

06:17.600 --> 06:20.640
enough light in like the bedroom area.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.320
Yeah, major killer.

06:22.320 --> 06:28.320
Every lighting designer knows that homes and bedrooms

06:28.320 --> 06:30.640
should never have overhead lighting.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.200
No.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.560
It is my lamps.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.360
What's that?

06:39.120 --> 06:42.000
It's going to take some time to heal from this, by the way.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.280
From what?

06:43.280 --> 06:47.760
You've, you've had a big, big, big, big house on the company.

06:47.760 --> 06:48.960
I didn't stop working.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.760
None of us dead to be clear.

06:53.760 --> 06:58.000
Well, trust me, you understand why Jeff didn't get his own room, obviously.

06:58.880 --> 07:04.080
And yeah, you can sort of understand why you were the best sort of roommate for Jeff.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.000
Like, who else could we have put with Jeff?

07:06.480 --> 07:09.440
That would have resulted in a better outcome than you.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.040
I guess he could have stayed with you.

07:11.040 --> 07:11.840
I understand.

07:13.440 --> 07:18.320
I can personally understand, yeah, I could have, I probably am the only person who could have

07:18.320 --> 07:23.520
tolerated him just because I'm a, I'm a pacifist and I don't want to hurt anybody.

07:23.520 --> 07:25.120
But Jeff really did.

07:25.120 --> 07:26.160
Yeah, you wouldn't be wrong.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.120
If you want to.

07:27.120 --> 07:31.040
Did you guys get, were you guys on the same schedule or were you like one of you

07:31.040 --> 07:32.960
asleep before the other awake before the other?

07:33.280 --> 07:36.000
Well, we were pretty much on the same schedule.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.400
So any time that's been, I would wake up, he would be right behind me.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.200
That's a good.

07:44.560 --> 07:45.920
Anything to say about it?

07:45.920 --> 07:46.640
Yeah, can I speak?

07:46.640 --> 07:47.280
Yeah, Jeff.

07:48.080 --> 07:48.560
What's it?

07:48.560 --> 07:49.920
Um, can I speak?

07:50.880 --> 07:51.520
Oh, yeah.

07:51.520 --> 07:54.480
I mean, you've been talking slash yelling this whole episode.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.000
You could definitely speak.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.640
Now here's a loop for some reason.

08:03.600 --> 08:09.360
When I show up to the show and like try to have a normal conversation, you guys also tear me apart.

08:09.360 --> 08:13.040
And then the listeners get angry because this isn't what they subscribe for.

08:14.880 --> 08:15.920
I'm delivering what they want.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.040
So be a better host.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.080
Be a better host.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.360
How I really is.

08:22.400 --> 08:27.840
We had a complete audit where we told you exactly what we needed to do to get better.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.760
Did you take any of the advice?

08:29.760 --> 08:30.400
Probably not.

08:30.480 --> 08:36.320
Also we asked you to speak on what conversation we were talking about.

08:38.720 --> 08:41.360
And then turn you're just yelling at us again.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.120
What are we talking about the on-dogs?

08:43.120 --> 08:45.360
Yeah, what does it do you time for?

08:45.360 --> 08:46.480
Johnny said it's hard.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.000
Now we have to hear his rows and bug.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.640
God, I already said the rows being arriving in sunny Arizona.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.040
And but I guess, but I'm looking forward to.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.240
I guess going back again.

08:56.880 --> 08:57.440
Yeah.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.720
Wait, we're going next year.

08:58.720 --> 08:59.920
We're going back to the on-dogs.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.960
Where else I don't know anywhere else?

09:03.360 --> 09:03.920
Interesting.

09:04.560 --> 09:05.280
You know.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.920
Marty will take that into consideration.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.160
I liked the on-dogs.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.920
I just like new experiences.

09:11.920 --> 09:12.560
Right.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.160
Reno would be fun if we were in there.

09:14.560 --> 09:15.440
I love Reno.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.400
Been in the airport.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.120
Nice.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.400
My rows?

09:26.400 --> 09:26.720
Yes.

09:28.720 --> 09:32.000
Getting to see all the people that I met yet.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.320
And that I work closely with like Katie and on-ion KC.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.120
That was really fun.

09:39.440 --> 09:44.800
My thorn, the fact that my room didn't have any overhead lighting.

09:46.640 --> 09:58.160
And my bud would be at some point hopefully coming to LA to meet Sam,

09:58.240 --> 10:00.720
who was the only person that I still haven't met.

10:01.360 --> 10:05.120
Yeah, Sam couldn't release her shackles enough to go to Scottsdale.

10:05.120 --> 10:05.600
Nice.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.440
That's a joke for nine people.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.560
Yeah, not even the whole company.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.280
Just nine.

10:16.080 --> 10:22.160
No, what I was going to say before I was totally interrupted.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.160
What's who nobody interrupted you.

10:27.120 --> 10:30.320
You didn't mean to me ever to work instead.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.960
That's a real threat actually.

10:32.960 --> 10:33.760
Don't do that please.

10:35.360 --> 10:38.240
Some of the world's most respected interior designers will

10:38.240 --> 10:43.600
are on record saying you said overhead lighting into that.

10:43.600 --> 10:48.160
Fine, but when the entire space is one room,

10:48.720 --> 10:50.240
I have a problem with that.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.280
And then lamps were low-hanging.

10:53.280 --> 10:56.000
That lamps were low-hanging night to the bed.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.240
And you're right, but with better lamps,

11:00.240 --> 11:02.800
I don't think we'd be having, we'd be having it in one session.

11:02.800 --> 11:03.520
We wouldn't.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.920
100% just fucking cries.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.760
You're so underqualified to talk about anything.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.920
I did outline a normal episode, should we just do it?

11:15.920 --> 11:16.960
I think it's going to take some time.

11:16.960 --> 11:17.920
What about a mirror?

11:18.800 --> 11:19.440
Oh, great.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.080
And you.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.600
Wait, I'm here.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.720
What's your rosebud thorn?

11:25.360 --> 11:27.520
The highlight was getting the hangout with everybody.

11:28.480 --> 11:33.360
IRL, sharing a meal, learning how to golf.

11:33.360 --> 11:38.400
It was really fun discussing our shared visions for growing the company.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.480
Have you never golfed before?

11:40.480 --> 11:41.280
Never golfed.

11:41.280 --> 11:42.080
I've done mini golf.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.160
I've never done driving range real golf before.

11:44.160 --> 11:47.520
Aren't you like, you were like one of the top people on the leader board?

11:47.600 --> 11:48.880
Yes, thank you for bringing that up.

11:48.880 --> 11:52.320
I was sort of a natural because of my proclivity for

11:52.320 --> 11:55.120
racket sports and playing a lot of tennis.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.760
And that kind of translated to my golf game.

11:57.760 --> 11:58.080
Yeah.

11:58.080 --> 12:05.120
Yeah, I consider myself somebody who's sort of primed to learn slash get to know golf

12:05.120 --> 12:06.320
on a more meaningful level.

12:06.320 --> 12:10.160
I'd like to learn about the clubs, sort of survey the greens,

12:10.160 --> 12:12.080
and putting is always fun and mini golf.

12:12.080 --> 12:15.360
So that would be fun to sort of pair with my top golf ability.

12:16.240 --> 12:20.960
And the thorn, the thorn.

12:20.960 --> 12:24.480
And we're part of the weekend.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.640
Um, might have been the soup.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.520
He loved the soup.

12:29.520 --> 12:32.160
I didn't care for the soup.

12:34.560 --> 12:39.040
That was an 11 30 AM 93 degrees out.

12:39.040 --> 12:42.000
Middle of the summer in the desert.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.680
Mushroom Bisc.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.000
It was a kind of a parsnip soup.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.240
I had a new mommy.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.240
Sort of definitely a new mommy.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.920
Plus it has been my shirt.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.520
Using yes.

12:53.520 --> 12:56.960
And it's not like I'm not even close to done.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.080
I want to more could you say?

13:07.440 --> 13:11.920
I was going to say I couldn't put my finger on the spices of it.

13:11.920 --> 13:12.720
Yeah.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.280
Yeah, somebody said one on the day, too.

13:15.280 --> 13:16.080
Yes, exactly.

13:16.080 --> 13:20.960
Symmag is like, yeah, it could have been all, that's like a little tangy, right?

13:21.760 --> 13:24.960
To me, it struck me as sort of like a grain chowder.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.280
Again, I can vibe with that.

13:34.080 --> 13:34.640
Great.

13:34.640 --> 13:42.000
I would say the food in Arizona, not my fave overall.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.160
Wow.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.680
That's my hot, my hot take.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.160
I thought there was some good food.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.360
What about that Taco Bell that we got the last night?

13:52.080 --> 13:55.440
Yeah, the pizza that I got, the last night.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.600
Casey and I got a pizza that was delicious.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.240
We're going to an outdoor club.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.360
I think that was probably worth mentioning.

14:03.360 --> 14:09.280
The type of place where ladies bring out your orders like ring side girls,

14:09.360 --> 14:11.920
with whistles and fireworks for some reason.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.120
I think of place.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.320
I didn't see that.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.120
Yeah, yeah.

14:16.320 --> 14:19.600
So as I just saw it like, it wasn't every order.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.720
It was just the champagne bottles, I guess.

14:22.720 --> 14:28.320
It was sort of a hooters meets sports bar vibe where they were showing

14:28.320 --> 14:30.640
the guy's hockey game.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.040
It's my sports bar.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.240
I'm single to Maya.

14:34.240 --> 14:34.880
Yeah.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.680
Oh, and well, I guess I feel bad if he's listening.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.480
Never mind.

14:42.480 --> 14:43.200
No, please.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.960
Let's throw people under the bus.

14:44.960 --> 14:48.720
Actually, he felt like he didn't know that you were still like making content.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.040
So I think it's fine to talk about because he's not going to hear this.

14:51.040 --> 14:54.560
Some guy comes up to a mirror and says,

14:54.560 --> 14:55.840
Oh, yeah, this is okay.

14:55.840 --> 14:58.240
I thought you were talking about somebody in our community.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.040
No, no.

14:59.040 --> 15:01.440
Yeah, we could talk shit about strangers all we want.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.400
So this guy here, this.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.560
Comes up to a mirror and he's like trying to make a mirror,

15:04.560 --> 15:06.640
place a bet on some game.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.440
Yeah, he was a sports betting app.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.640
He walked from table to table, trying to get people to sign up for it.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.240
But I don't know if you noticed this a mirror.

15:14.240 --> 15:17.600
He was like, how much can I put you down for a mirror?

15:17.600 --> 15:19.760
Yeah, he knew my name right off the bat.

15:19.760 --> 15:22.960
And then afterwards he was like, and what's your name by the way?

15:22.960 --> 15:24.640
Yeah, you're like, I said it.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.320
Yeah.

15:26.320 --> 15:30.080
Maybe he maybe he said your name and you didn't react to it.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.880
So that's what he wanted to do wrong.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.480
Yeah, I did not hear the name.

15:34.480 --> 15:37.040
Like it was a joke and then you told him and he's like, no,

15:37.040 --> 15:39.360
like, I'm just kidding, bro, like I know who you are.

15:39.360 --> 15:39.680
Right.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.120
And then you were like, oh, cool.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.560
Yeah, it was a very awkward interaction.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.480
I liked that I wasn't the center of it.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.360
Like he said he was, he said he was a fan of mine and Jake.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.640
And then I was like, oh, Jake's right there.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.560
And he's like, now, all right, I'll talk to you guys later.

15:50.560 --> 15:54.080
Like, did not care about to do the same bit to Jake whatsoever.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.680
He left and never came back.

15:55.680 --> 15:56.320
Yeah.

15:56.320 --> 15:57.280
Yeah, we did never see it.

15:57.280 --> 15:58.480
Also, did he work for an app?

15:58.480 --> 16:00.640
Or did he just try to get you to get?

16:00.640 --> 16:03.520
Or did he just have a t-shirt and a promo code?

16:03.520 --> 16:04.720
Yeah.

16:04.720 --> 16:07.760
I saw other people from that place around there.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.040
Johnny bought some lays.

16:12.800 --> 16:13.760
I got laid.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.360
Oh, they're doing a woman.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.840
That's good.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.160
I got a couple.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.720
Don't put down the other guests.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.480
I purchased a few lays from a woman walking around.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.840
Initially, when she first came around,

16:31.840 --> 16:36.400
I said no, but I promised her I'd buy a few later.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.640
And she didn't need to come back around.

16:38.640 --> 16:41.040
And I made good on my promise.

16:41.040 --> 16:41.520
So, yeah.

16:42.560 --> 16:43.520
That's nice of you.

16:44.480 --> 16:45.520
Nice to see you.

16:45.520 --> 16:48.720
I got pretty drunk that night.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.720
And I rushed goodbye.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.040
I was dead sober.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.120
Did you leave by yourself?

16:55.520 --> 16:56.080
I did.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.040
You just like sort of walked away because you were drunk?

16:59.760 --> 17:00.240
Yeah.

17:01.120 --> 17:05.600
I went to the bathroom and like the urinals were taken.

17:05.600 --> 17:10.400
So I sat down to pee and some guy who was right behind me tried to pee.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.240
You don't have to sit down in the stall by the way.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.440
You can still stand up.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.280
I know, but I was like the room was spinning.

17:16.400 --> 17:20.000
And the guy behind me tried to jokingly push through the door

17:20.000 --> 17:21.520
as I was going into the stall.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.120
And I was just like, nice.

17:23.120 --> 17:25.120
I was going to close the door on him.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.240
And I was like, I got to get out of here.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.280
I hate this bar.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.960
And if I stay, I'm going to embarrass myself.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.280
So I went back to the on-dogs.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.240
How do you get back?

17:34.800 --> 17:35.600
I lifted.

17:36.720 --> 17:40.560
Why do you ask, you ask questions about like the worst part of stories?

17:42.560 --> 17:46.320
It's kind of hard to get a car there because it was like they closed down street.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.120
Someone really asked.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.200
I walked like two blocks and a car.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.080
That's the fucking answer to your question.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.280
And that's not good to hear.

17:53.920 --> 17:54.800
That's kind of what you said.

17:54.800 --> 17:58.800
Are you not saying no or not, you don't even have to ask.

17:59.840 --> 18:00.160
All right.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.760
So you get back to the on-dogs and who's there?

18:02.720 --> 18:08.000
That's going to be Casey, America, Maria.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.640
On-ya, eventually.

18:11.200 --> 18:15.200
I went back to my room for a little bit just to like drink some water and settle down.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.440
And then people were ordering foods.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.200
So I met everybody around a fire.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.320
And it was Joel, Brad, on-ya.

18:23.280 --> 18:28.560
Johnny, Adam, and Berkman.

18:29.520 --> 18:34.400
And you were wasted at this point or you were saying you're getting sobered up by then.

18:34.960 --> 18:35.360
Okay.

18:36.080 --> 18:39.120
Did you order food or just sort of eat whether the people ordered?

18:40.880 --> 18:42.560
I think you owe it other people ordered.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.960
Yeah, we're almost chicken nugget.

18:44.960 --> 18:45.840
Here we go.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.680
Taco Bell, Doritos Locos.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.120
But who ordered that?

18:49.920 --> 18:50.960
Them cells, these.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.080
Who's did you steal from there?

18:54.720 --> 18:56.480
I ordered the Doritos Locos, but

18:57.440 --> 18:59.600
because I took so long to sober up in our room.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.640
By the time I got there, it was soggy and cold.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.160
So I had one bonus chicken nugget.

19:09.680 --> 19:10.800
That's a great, man.

19:11.680 --> 19:12.000
Yeah.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.800
You know, I'm going to take five minutes.

19:15.440 --> 19:15.920
Okay.

19:16.880 --> 19:21.440
Because I'm so, I'm feeling violent right now.

19:23.280 --> 19:31.680
And what I need, excuse me, I'm having a this nixie.

19:34.480 --> 19:37.120
Sparkling water, watermelon mint.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.080
That's getting me all.

19:40.560 --> 19:43.520
Burpee.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.240
Oh, there we go.

19:48.240 --> 19:54.800
At drink nixie is the Twitter Insta for it.

19:58.240 --> 20:02.560
Where we say, we just take five because you're feeling.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.480
Should we cut to a commercial?

20:08.480 --> 20:10.800
Like, there's no need for the five minutes to happen.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.520
And then we can cut to an ad.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.920
Let's wrap it in the ad.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.840
I made a, I made this t-shirt.

20:21.840 --> 20:22.800
If we want to talk about it.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.000
Why won't you die?

20:26.800 --> 20:27.440
Guess not.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.720
That is to him, you're late.

20:30.720 --> 20:31.520
I do want to hear it.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.000
I heard you want to hear it.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.040
No, I want to hear it.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.720
Now you want me to talk?

20:45.440 --> 20:48.400
Let's take a break and then we'll hear about Marie's tattoo.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.840
Yeah, let's take a break.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.080
This podcast is sponsored by Better Help Online Therapy.

20:58.080 --> 21:02.000
Guys, life can be overwhelming and many people are burnt out without even knowing it.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.080
Symptoms can include lack of motivation, feeling a helpless or trapped,

21:06.240 --> 21:08.080
detachment fatigue, and more.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.880
I go to therapy every week.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.800
It helps me be less of those things,

21:13.840 --> 21:16.400
especially in periods of stress, you know,

21:17.360 --> 21:24.080
when you're banking podcast episodes, when you have interpersonal conflict with your friends and family,

21:25.120 --> 21:29.280
that's hard, yeah, but therapy makes it feel all better.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.880
We associate burnout with work, but that's not the only cause.

21:33.280 --> 21:37.120
Any of our roles in life, again, can lead us to feeling burned out.

21:37.120 --> 21:41.280
And Better Help Online Therapy wants to remind you to prioritize yourself.

21:41.280 --> 21:46.320
By talking to someone, you can help you figure out what's causing stress in your life and help you handle it.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.720
Again, I'm in therapy every week.

21:50.080 --> 21:53.840
I think if you have the funds, you should be in therapy.

21:56.080 --> 22:00.480
Better Help is customized online therapy that offers video, phone, and even live chat sessions with your therapist.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.960
So you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to.

22:02.960 --> 22:06.560
It's also much more affordable than in person therapy, traditionally,

22:06.560 --> 22:09.840
and you can be matched with a therapist and under 48 hours.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.040
So you can get started right away.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.320
Oh, we let's hear about this shirt.

22:32.320 --> 22:33.920
Oh, my God.

22:33.920 --> 22:39.440
You can't act like that wasn't the clumsyest eight minutes in podcast in this story.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.280
We can't just rebound from that.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.480
I'm no stranger to being a rebound.

22:45.920 --> 22:50.800
No, I form emotional connections with women who have just gotten out of long-term relationships.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.120
And then I get my feelings hurt because of it.

22:53.760 --> 23:04.400
Yeah, so I made a shirt that I don't know if you can see what it says, but yeah, it's like white on pink.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.520
So it's hard to read.

23:05.520 --> 23:06.720
I first.

23:06.720 --> 23:13.120
It's all of the movies that have come out recently that are just titled with an animal.

23:13.120 --> 23:19.440
So it says first cow, pig, lamb, wolf, dog, and then men.

23:19.840 --> 23:23.040
That's good.

23:23.040 --> 23:26.400
Yeah, that's also just a list of animals though.

23:26.400 --> 23:30.880
Not bad, but yeah, in men, but that's an animal, and also first cow.

23:31.680 --> 23:32.320
Like it's cool.

23:33.120 --> 23:36.160
It's the first one, so it didn't in its first cow.

23:36.880 --> 23:37.760
Have you seen men?

23:38.320 --> 23:39.600
I haven't seen men yet.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.120
It comes out this week.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.280
There it is out today.

23:43.520 --> 23:56.560
And honestly, I've only seen first cow, pig, and dog, because lamb, I think, is too scary for me.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.560
I'll watch you all for a bunch of me.

23:58.560 --> 23:59.520
It's not.

23:59.520 --> 24:02.160
It was very confusing that lamb movie.

24:02.160 --> 24:06.880
Yeah, I just don't like the vibe of his little head and his little body.

24:07.760 --> 24:08.960
I love lamb's though.

24:09.200 --> 24:14.800
It is even more like a zodiac shirt or something like that.

24:15.520 --> 24:19.360
Yeah, like if they get it, they never really get it.

24:19.360 --> 24:25.520
Yeah, that's sort of your niche is really hyper-specific t-shirts where you get, you love it.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.880
But most people definitely have no idea.

24:29.920 --> 24:34.080
Actually, the Sam on shackled shirt might be a good one for your next collection.

24:34.080 --> 24:34.880
That would be great.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.040
You just come up with that, Amir?

24:38.000 --> 24:42.960
Welcome to Fish Row V Wade Davis.

24:46.240 --> 24:47.440
Who's Wade Davis?

24:48.480 --> 24:50.000
He was an MLB player.

24:53.200 --> 24:53.920
Wade?

24:53.920 --> 24:55.040
There's a lot of it.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.080
What about Dean Wade?

24:59.120 --> 25:00.320
That would have been good too.

25:00.320 --> 25:05.760
No, he was a babe Ruth award winner.

25:05.840 --> 25:10.400
And a member of the Royals 2015 World Series winning team.

25:10.400 --> 25:13.680
Listen, there's been a lot of dark legislation

25:14.960 --> 25:21.280
being discussed in past or being teed up to put a pass.

25:21.280 --> 25:23.680
So I thought we could kind of lighten the mood a little bit

25:24.400 --> 25:29.600
by making our own row v-wid and that's going to be fish row v-way Davis.

25:30.400 --> 25:35.440
So we have to decide which is more important fish row,

25:36.160 --> 25:40.480
which is the basis for caviar and oftentimes on sushi,

25:40.880 --> 25:45.360
or Wade Davis, the former World Series champion.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.560
Which is more important?

25:50.240 --> 25:50.640
Yeah.

25:55.600 --> 25:56.880
So that's the game.

25:56.960 --> 25:59.600
There's no like rounds or anything, just like a debate.

26:00.480 --> 26:01.600
It's mostly a debate.

26:01.600 --> 26:05.600
I mean, so row for those who don't know is the fully ripen

26:05.600 --> 26:10.480
turnle egg masses in the ovaries of a fish and also certain marine animals,

26:10.480 --> 26:14.000
like shrimp, urchins, it's like row.

26:14.000 --> 26:14.960
It kind of creased me out.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.000
I'm not a huge fan of it.

26:16.000 --> 26:16.800
Never had it.

26:17.520 --> 26:18.400
I mean, he's there.

26:18.400 --> 26:22.480
It doesn't seem like it's those orange balls, you know,

26:22.480 --> 26:25.680
that sometimes come on sushi, not for me.

26:27.040 --> 26:30.080
Yeah, I guess it's kind of like caviar.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.640
Caviar is different though.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.040
Caviar is a row from a sturgeon.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.880
Yeah, so it's not really that different.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.720
So I said it's kind of like caviar.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.560
You said that's actually caviar is different.

26:40.560 --> 26:42.240
It's a row for the sturgeon.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.000
That's everyone keep going.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.600
I have no other fish like the flathead grain mullet.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.560
So that's row.

26:49.760 --> 26:51.120
Caviar is row.

26:53.600 --> 26:56.640
If we were in the studio, I would be so

26:57.440 --> 26:58.560
you would what there.

26:58.560 --> 27:01.760
I think I think what we should hire you back.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.600
I think the fish eggs are more important.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.960
And wait Davis?

27:06.960 --> 27:07.760
Yeah.

27:07.760 --> 27:08.720
Yeah.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.560
Then the other thing is to debate.

27:10.560 --> 27:16.320
Because the fish eggs like provide jobs for a lot of people

27:17.040 --> 27:17.920
for their jobs.

27:17.920 --> 27:20.320
I mean, talk about vitamin B12.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.160
Like, I mean, these things are carry.

27:22.160 --> 27:22.560
They're there.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.280
See you agree.

27:23.280 --> 27:24.560
Grenades and that's shit.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.800
Yes, no, I'm not taking aside a mediator.

27:27.760 --> 27:33.200
You say you're not mediating by by asking like leading questions.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.400
I'm not a lawyer.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.440
Okay.

27:39.040 --> 27:39.680
Thank God.

27:44.720 --> 27:47.280
You know what else do you want us to say?

27:48.160 --> 27:49.600
Is that the fucking consensus?

27:49.600 --> 27:52.240
Because I think Wade Davis is a 36-year-old person.

27:52.240 --> 27:55.120
All right, with a huge career ahead of him outside of baseball.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.280
You think he's a 36-year-old person?

28:03.760 --> 28:08.880
How is this episode worse than the fucking the audio book of Sonic Gale?

28:10.000 --> 28:11.520
Yeah, he's gone.

28:12.080 --> 28:15.760
Chris has just gone really, really, go.

28:16.560 --> 28:19.680
He also sort of had a meltdown the last time we did this show.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.120
The hundredth episode.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.560
So sort of becoming a,

28:23.520 --> 28:25.360
and I used to leave early.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.640
Now he's leaving.

28:26.640 --> 28:27.920
Oh, where'd you go?

28:27.920 --> 28:29.760
I've been congested for a year.

28:29.760 --> 28:30.480
So what'd you do?

28:31.200 --> 28:33.520
I, uh, some snout came out again.

28:34.800 --> 28:35.440
Thanks.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.960
You should do nasal irrigation.

28:36.960 --> 28:37.680
Right.

28:37.680 --> 28:38.880
I want to meddle you.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.000
Yeah, I need to do a netty.

28:40.800 --> 28:41.280
Yeah.

28:41.280 --> 28:43.520
Now we have Bunky Pock's going around.

28:43.520 --> 28:44.160
My God.

28:44.160 --> 28:44.880
Oh, yeah.

28:44.880 --> 28:48.160
My mom, my mom texted me yesterday.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.160
We were talking about, sure.

28:50.640 --> 28:51.440
You can keep talking.

28:51.440 --> 28:52.080
Keep talking.

28:52.080 --> 28:52.480
Never, man.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.360
We have to move on, but I want to hear the story.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.120
Just let the song play and we'll be in the new segment.

28:57.120 --> 28:57.920
And then he'll be talking about it.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.560
I think we decided fish row, right?

29:02.240 --> 29:02.720
Yeah.

29:20.800 --> 29:25.120
What are you saying?

29:25.120 --> 29:26.880
I'm making nothing.

29:29.840 --> 29:32.240
Oh, sharing screens again.

29:32.960 --> 29:33.360
Okay.

29:33.360 --> 29:34.400
Can you see this?

29:34.400 --> 29:35.120
Yeah.

29:35.120 --> 29:38.800
It looks like there's a picture of something called Ready Ice.

29:38.800 --> 29:41.440
And then there's like some picture to the right of it,

29:41.440 --> 29:43.520
which is part of that picture or something.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.720
It's kind of glitching.

29:44.720 --> 29:45.440
Yeah.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.480
Welcome to!

29:50.240 --> 29:52.240
The price of ice.

29:57.440 --> 30:00.160
Prices, right rules, price of rice rules.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.440
Basically, we're going to be guessing the price of ice.

30:05.200 --> 30:08.000
And that's it.

30:08.000 --> 30:08.320
So.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.160
Okay, I guess.

30:10.160 --> 30:10.480
Okay.

30:10.480 --> 30:11.040
Yeah, what do we think?

30:11.040 --> 30:12.880
This is seven pounds of Ready Ice.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.400
Let's say 99.

30:14.400 --> 30:15.600
399?

30:16.560 --> 30:18.000
Getting me with that.

30:18.160 --> 30:20.320
Ready, get you better than that.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.560
You're better than that, man.

30:22.560 --> 30:23.200
Getting me?

30:24.080 --> 30:25.040
Stop.

30:25.040 --> 30:25.760
What?

30:25.760 --> 30:27.600
Let it go.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.800
Let other people do this.

30:28.800 --> 30:29.760
Yes.

30:29.760 --> 30:30.320
Yeah.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.280
You're leading.

30:31.280 --> 30:33.120
You said it's price is right, rules.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.120
I'm going to be kidding.

30:37.760 --> 30:39.120
Don't throw it temper tantrum.

30:39.120 --> 30:39.600
Yeah.

30:39.600 --> 30:40.640
I'm just kidding.

30:41.920 --> 30:44.480
Drew Carey never threw a hissy bit.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.720
Because he did something wrong.

30:48.080 --> 30:48.560
Johnny.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.040
259.

30:51.040 --> 30:51.920
Okay.

30:51.920 --> 30:52.480
I'm here.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.440
499.

30:57.440 --> 30:59.040
That's going to be 129.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.560
Because it's only seven pounds.

31:00.560 --> 31:01.760
Let's just see a lot of.

31:01.760 --> 31:02.720
That's a lot of water.

31:02.720 --> 31:03.920
Yeah, that's a lot.

31:03.920 --> 31:07.200
Like, how much of that would cost if it was water?

31:07.920 --> 31:08.800
Yeah, I mean, uh.

31:10.560 --> 31:11.200
20 30.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.240
Smart water is all right.

31:12.240 --> 31:13.200
You're a leader.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.000
There you go.

31:14.000 --> 31:14.400
All right.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.600
What is a shaved ice?

31:15.600 --> 31:16.560
What's the hell in here?

31:16.560 --> 31:17.760
That's going to be party ice.

31:18.400 --> 31:19.200
Pretty ice.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.800
It's 20 pounds.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.080
What is party ice?

31:22.080 --> 31:22.640
20.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.080
10's party sized ice, I think.

31:25.280 --> 31:25.760
Shut.

31:27.520 --> 31:28.000
Fuck.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.040
I told myself this one.

31:30.080 --> 31:30.240
Very.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.520
It just looks like a bag of snow.

31:33.520 --> 31:35.840
I really need to know what kind of ice I'm dealing with.

31:35.840 --> 31:38.880
Because if it's like crunchy ice, if it's like a sonic ice,

31:39.920 --> 31:41.600
that's some other mongame.

31:41.600 --> 31:42.800
That's like creamy ice.

31:43.760 --> 31:44.400
Uh huh.

31:47.680 --> 31:49.440
That was just, name your price of ice.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.760
How many 20 pounds?

31:51.760 --> 31:52.320
20 pounds.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.720
Fucking, I don't know, 750.

31:56.720 --> 31:57.920
Okay, Johnny.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.040
I'd say, uh, three bucks.

32:01.600 --> 32:02.000
Oh, wow.

32:03.360 --> 32:03.680
Ammer.

32:05.280 --> 32:05.920
301.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.240
Correct.

32:10.240 --> 32:11.600
That's going to be 529.

32:12.560 --> 32:13.360
The mirror is the closest.

32:13.360 --> 32:13.760
Here we go.

32:13.760 --> 32:15.200
Arctic glacier premium ice.

32:15.200 --> 32:15.920
20 pounds.

32:16.880 --> 32:17.440
Fucking hell.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.480
What did you think would have?

32:22.480 --> 32:22.720
Yeah.

32:26.160 --> 32:29.120
You don't get to make the game and be grudge it.

32:29.120 --> 32:30.800
This is because of you.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.200
I was not like that.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.440
I want to know what the ice looks like.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.200
This is the bag of ice.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.680
That's, we know the way translucent.

32:40.320 --> 32:41.920
Since it's premium, I'll go high.

32:41.920 --> 32:42.720
899.

32:44.720 --> 32:47.520
Just going to go fucking six dollars.

32:47.520 --> 32:48.720
I don't care anymore.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.160
Jesus, you broke Marika.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.200
You realize how hard that is.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.400
I love ice.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.000
And she loves my favorite stuff.

32:54.000 --> 32:54.800
Yeah.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.400
Yeah, John.

32:58.800 --> 32:59.760
7 bucks.

32:59.760 --> 33:00.480
Go in the middle.

33:01.840 --> 33:03.600
Marika was 599.

33:05.120 --> 33:06.240
You're off by a penny.

33:07.040 --> 33:09.280
Iron head premium.

33:09.280 --> 33:14.320
toplase with the resecible bag.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.040
So that was the premium bag.

33:17.040 --> 33:20.080
Yeah and they're all roughly between

33:20.080 --> 33:20.880
7 dollars.

33:20.880 --> 33:22.880
No $200.

38:16.040 --> 38:18.920
My bond of the week is um will you emerge?

38:22.520 --> 38:25.560
Broken down so many times during this record

38:27.160 --> 38:30.520

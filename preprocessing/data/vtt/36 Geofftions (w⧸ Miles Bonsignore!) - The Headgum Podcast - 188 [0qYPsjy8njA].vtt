00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
This is a head gum original.

00:05.000 --> 00:16.000
So I was like not turning the AC on like part of the show.

00:16.000 --> 00:25.000
I can't see Brad.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
So it can't be Brad's name.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Let's get it started.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Let's get it started.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
New studio.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
New studio paint color.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
It's no cola. It's no terracotta, but it is charcoal.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
It's black.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Speaking of cola, I am having an iced Coca Cola.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Is that iced Coca Cola? It's not coffee.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Well, I was going for a coffee.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
So I went for an iced Coca Cola.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
You know we have cola under finished chips or beer.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Thank you.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Well, cold brew sometimes sends me a shiver through me timbers.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
It's the same as coffee.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
No, but the iced nature of it in the country in nature of it,

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
it really makes me sort of get sent off on a wild goose chase of my own tail of your own design.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
So I went for the cola, it's a special little Friday treat.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
I wonder if this becomes one of those shows where like the host talks for like five minutes,

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
and then the guests get to say something, because I feel like I'm already getting steam rolled by specifically will.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
You asked one question, two miles.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
See, answered it.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Okay.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
And now you're talking about getting steam rolled by will by will by who he hasn't talked.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
And you know, we're changing.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
We're working on the new camera angles here in the studio right now.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
What I have set up has it.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
So when I talked to Jeff, I can see just one eye looking at me.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
That's great.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
In between the camera.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
It's incredible.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
I love that there's three professional great studio cameras.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
And then just still rock in the GoPro.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Yeah.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
No lighting on me, by the way.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Because this is the only show where the producer really is kind of shown.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
You choose to sit over there.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Exactly.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Right.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Just so I don't have to edit the multi-cam session later.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
We've got will con over on the sacks, Brad Hild on the facts.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
Miles Bonson, you're a bringing up the rear in case you don't have you for good measure.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Sure.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
Sounds a lot like popcorn.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
It's going to be mixed with high quality.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
So the audience isn't good.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
It's just going to sound like a pause.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
And then it's going to be using.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
I know.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
But just the pause sounds a lot like.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Like popcorn.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Can I play a song that sound that's going to make you feel more comfortable, Miles?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Is it going to be loud?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Yes.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
It's going to be this.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
So that's a sound effect.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
That I use on my show.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Perfect person.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
That everyone can check out.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
We plug it stuff.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
That everyone can check out.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
It's a head game show.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
It's a call out of my show.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
And I'd love if you'd come on over and tune on it.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Jeff's turning off the cameras.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
What are you doing?

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
It wasn't framed up exactly right.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
I didn't frame it.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
But you have to stop moving the cameras without unlocking the pan.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Really?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
That's what you're trying to get at.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Not just without, I'm like, I'm moving the camera.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
I hate the one eye.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
It really feels threatening now.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
It's like mad.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
I'm moving.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Talking away from the mic.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Just turned off.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
I can't see that.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
I'm going to turn it around.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Turn it around.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Turn 180 degrees away.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Yeah.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
And then said something into the wall.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
I wanted to get straight to Will's favorite segment.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Bond of the week.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Let's start with Will.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Who's going to be next bond?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
You don't know what it is.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
You hate it this segment.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
I just don't pay attention.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
How does it work for you?

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
I'm sure that wasn't super tight.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Mario.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Super Mario.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
No.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Super Mario.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Mario.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
All right.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Nice.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Brad.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Luigi Mario.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Whoa.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Is that Luigi's first and last name to you?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yes.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Mario Mario and his brother Luigi Mario.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
That is right.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
That is true.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
That is true.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
That is true.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
That is true.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
And then there's Mario Mario and while Luigi Mario.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Who came up with the shit?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
I think J. Pan.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
I think Baby Bowser would be a good double a seven.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
One tree of Japan.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Yeah.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Um.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Okay.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Casey.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Bond of the week.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
My.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
My.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
My.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
My.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
My.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
My.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Because will con over and I will bond over.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
All right.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Has this already been done on the show.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Miles Bond.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
I like that a lot.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Well, I said it.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I backed it up.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
I think that's great.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
You'll you do back it up.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
I saw you in the clearer.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Thank you.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
So for noticing.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Um.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
How's everybody feeling today?

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
I feel like everybody's on different wavelengths.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Feeling good.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I got some editing done.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
You're practicing yesterday.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I did get into a car accident yesterday.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
But I'm okay.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Thankfully.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Oh, my God.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
It was crazy.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
It was right before the head got Mario cart live for you.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
And you stole Baby.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
And I gunned it to the studio.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
And I said.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
He was hit with a blue shell.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
I got hit from a high by Baby.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Good.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Good.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
You know, a guy peeled out in front of me.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Came out.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Fucker came out of nowhere.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Sounds a lot like I wasn't being attention.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
But the guy peeled across several insetrapic in front of me.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
And I hit his back like corner of his car.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Because he was trying to like get ahead of me and make this turn.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
And then I was like fuck.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
And I stopped turned on my hazard.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
It's got it at the car to be like, let's check out this guy.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Make sure he's okay.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
And also see if his car is okay.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
I hit him.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
And then he just kept driving.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Good night.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I think he said that when you showed up to the studio.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
He said, I got hit by a car.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
But it was a hit and run.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
But I hit him.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
And he ran.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
Because I think he was either drunk or didn't have a license.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Or you were brandishing a gun.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
I did not have anything like that.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
You know, I had my prone intent to switch control.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Okay.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Which you might have been intimidated by.

06:28.000 --> 06:28.500
Sure.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.500
How were you brandishing it?

06:29.500 --> 06:30.500
Yeah.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.500
It was holding it like a gun.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.500
Yeah.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.500
Yeah.

06:33.500 --> 06:38.500
I'm sorry.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.500
The mood with that.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.500
With the sound effect.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.500
I just feel like your story.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.500
Here's what happened.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.500
Everyone laughed.

06:44.500 --> 06:45.500
Yeah.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.500
And right at the, uh, what's the opposite of apex?

06:47.500 --> 06:48.500
At the down end.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.500
At the tail end of the laughing.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.500
You play the sound effects with women that we sat in silence.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.500
Yeah.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.500
And instead of continuing.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.500
Yeah.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.500
Instead of continuing the conversation, the flow of the show.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.500
Right.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.500
Jeff chose to just stop.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.500
Lee Lee stop.

07:04.500 --> 07:05.500
Of what it is.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.500
Yeah.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.500
Will.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.500
How am I feeling to that?

07:09.500 --> 07:10.500
Yes.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.500
It looks like you got the HD on.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.500
On zoom.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.500
You're looking great.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.500
Do I look good?

07:16.500 --> 07:17.500
I think you're camera.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.500
Yeah.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.500
Always look good.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.500
Well, you're a great.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.500
Great.

07:21.500 --> 07:22.500
Um.

07:22.500 --> 07:23.500
I'm doing good today.

07:23.500 --> 07:24.500
It's Friday.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.500
It's weekend.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.500
Come on, guys.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.500
It's ready for the weekend.

07:27.500 --> 07:28.500
Hey.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.500
Yeah.

07:29.500 --> 07:30.500
Yeah.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.500
And it's Friday.

07:31.500 --> 07:32.500
This release is on a Friday, right?

07:32.500 --> 07:33.500
It's a Friday.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.500
So it's a Friday when you go listen to home.

07:35.500 --> 07:36.500
Oh, my God.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.500
Happy Friday.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.500
Good.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.500
Everybody.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.500
Here you go.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.500
There you go.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.500
Um.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.500
This one's sort of a free practice.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.500
Sure.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.500
Yeah.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.500
Well, this one might not go out.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.500
Oh, okay.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.500
Good to know while we're doing it.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.500
What's that?

07:54.500 --> 07:55.500
Useful.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.500
You know, our time is valuable in that way.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.500
Do you plan this weekend, Will?

08:00.500 --> 08:01.500
Why are you excited?

08:01.500 --> 08:03.500
Uh, no major plans.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.500
Am I trying to see poor things?

08:05.500 --> 08:06.500
Is that a movie?

08:06.500 --> 08:07.500
Are you just going to go in there?

08:07.500 --> 08:08.500
Damn.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.500
Souls.

08:09.500 --> 08:10.500
The street.

08:10.500 --> 08:11.500
Yeah.

08:11.500 --> 08:12.500
Damn.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.500
Souls.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.500
No.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.500
Some movie.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.500
Emma Stone.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.500
It's a movie.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.500
It looks good.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.500
Herdiver.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.500
I like her.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.500
I like her.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.500
I like her too.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.500
Do you guys like this?

08:25.500 --> 08:26.500
This is a show.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.500
Is.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.500
How are you doing this weekend?

08:29.500 --> 08:30.500
Yeah.

08:30.500 --> 08:31.500
This is.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.500
Jeff.

08:32.500 --> 08:33.500
Jeff.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.500
Jeff has weird energy right now.

08:35.500 --> 08:38.500
He's like, he'll ask a question and then quietly, like,

08:38.500 --> 08:40.500
fold within himself.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.500
Yeah.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.500
It's really inappropriate.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.500
We can't.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.500
Brad and I can't see Jeff.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.500
And we can't hear the sound effects.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.500
Yeah.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.500
Yeah.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.500
Yeah.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.500
Yeah.

08:51.500 --> 08:52.500
Yeah.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.500
Yeah.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.500
Yeah.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.500
And barely hear.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.500
You can barely hear us.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.500
Oh, man.

08:59.500 --> 09:02.500
I mean, Jeff was like, every time I've done the show, Jeff is in a full-blown panic.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.500
When I walk into the studio, trying to get the tech to work.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.500
And then he finally does.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.500
And he's.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.500
His mood hasn't lifted from that panic.

09:09.500 --> 09:13.500
Well, again, I resent the fact that it's always pinned on me that the tech doesn't work.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.500
We're in the middle of building out another studio.

09:15.500 --> 09:16.500
That works perfectly.

09:16.500 --> 09:20.500
I think everyone's in a really good job, except for you.

09:20.500 --> 09:24.500
Jeff, do me a favor and hit the the the the wall.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.500
No.

09:25.500 --> 09:31.500
You see the microphone on the zoom with the the arrow pointed up.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.500
I want to see if I could get the for giving them the right audio.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.500
Okay, we are definitely not.

09:37.500 --> 09:41.500
We're giving you the right audio, but my best guess is Jeff, like,

09:41.500 --> 09:43.500
turns the volume down on the mic.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.500
We don't have to keep doing this.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.500
To make sure the levels don't peak.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.500
This is all going in, right?

09:50.500 --> 09:51.500
This is all staying.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.500
This is all staying.

09:52.500 --> 09:53.500
Yeah.

09:53.500 --> 09:54.500
Okay.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.500
Brad, what are you excited for for the weekend?

09:56.500 --> 09:57.500
How do you feel?

09:57.500 --> 09:58.500
Yes.

09:58.500 --> 10:04.500
Browned of applause for that.

10:04.500 --> 10:07.500
It was awesome.

10:07.500 --> 10:12.500
Brad, I got to say your hat and jacket combo is really cool.

10:12.500 --> 10:15.500
I like the cream tones.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.500
Is that better?

10:16.500 --> 10:17.500
Is that better?

10:17.500 --> 10:18.500
Creamy mood today.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.500
I really like.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.500
What does that mean?

10:20.500 --> 10:23.500
I got in trouble for saying that last night in the live stream.

10:23.500 --> 10:24.500
I did.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.500
I said I was going to cream every night.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.500
You said you're going to cream their asses.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.500
I said, go.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.500
I was going to cream her shells ass.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.500
Yeah, right.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.500
That's going to go down.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.500
And I do it.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.500
That's where you went.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.500
I met nothing to say that.

10:38.500 --> 10:39.500
But I can't say that.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.500
Absolutely.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.500
You need to mean what you say.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.500
And say what I do mean to say.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.500
Don't look at me through the line.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.500
There's bad eye moodie.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.500
And then there's sad eye job.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.500
Casey, what are you looking forward to this weekend?

10:54.500 --> 10:56.500
How do you feel right now?

10:56.500 --> 10:57.500
Oh, how do I?

10:57.500 --> 10:59.500
What am I looking forward to?

10:59.500 --> 11:00.500
How do I feel right now?

11:00.500 --> 11:01.500
So.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.500
I feel pretty good.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.500
It's Friday after all.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.500
I have no plans this weekend.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.500
And I kind of liked that.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.500
I kind of liked going into a weekend with nothing on the

11:13.500 --> 11:14.500
Docket.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.500
And I could do whatever I want.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.500
Really?

11:17.500 --> 11:18.500
That's freeing.

11:18.500 --> 11:19.500
Miles is on his phone.

11:19.500 --> 11:20.500
Sorry.

11:20.500 --> 11:21.500
I have an important call.

11:21.500 --> 11:26.500
How to go.

11:26.500 --> 11:32.500
It was really good.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.500
Are you a millennial with Mrs.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.500
What life was like in the 2000s?

11:36.500 --> 11:37.500
Right?

11:37.500 --> 11:41.500
A hard time finding new work, curated music.

11:41.500 --> 11:48.300
Are you interested in multiple perspectives on relationships dating and music?

11:48.300 --> 11:53.000
Then you're going to love see the thing as a podcast hosted by Grammy Award winning

11:53.000 --> 11:59.500
R&B artist Bridget Kelly and media personality and podcast trailblazer Mandy V.

11:59.500 --> 12:04.500
Twice a week, Bridget and Mandy have nostalgic conversations in their grown

12:04.500 --> 12:10.500
segments, political pop culture conversations in their honest segments and relationship

12:10.500 --> 12:14.500
hot take conversations in the slightly toxic segment.

12:14.500 --> 12:19.500
The opinions on the show are real and brought to you by the genuine connections that the

12:19.500 --> 12:23.500
ladies have with their guests who they like to call their friends with benefits.

12:23.500 --> 12:28.500
Each week you'll leave with some new music recommendations or a curated playlist that

12:28.500 --> 12:32.500
you didn't even know you needed in their freshly squeezed music segment.

12:32.500 --> 12:38.500
Most recently the ladies have sat down with Remi Ma Muni Long and Chloe Bailey.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.500
So you're not going to waste this guesting action.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.500
You're not going to want to miss this guesting action.

12:42.500 --> 12:48.500
Follow and subscribe to see the thing is on Spotify, Apple Podcasts or on YouTube.

12:48.500 --> 12:53.500
New audio episodes drop every Tuesday and Friday and visuals are available every Wednesday

12:53.500 --> 12:54.500
and Saturday on YouTube.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.500
Check it out.

12:56.500 --> 12:59.500
Oh, and we're back.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.500
I think that's a lawsuit.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.500
I think you should have a lawsuit.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.500
Now we're here right now.

13:04.500 --> 13:09.500
Julia Roberts dished on watch what happens live with Andy Cohen.

13:09.500 --> 13:12.500
She said that the hardest drug she's ever tried was.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.500
Take a good weed.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.500
True.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.500
It's got the MS room.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.500
Let's go.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.500
It was true.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.500
It was mushrooms.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.500
It was silicide.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.500
This kid started.

13:25.500 --> 13:31.500
Um, was it the art of the pellet in brief.

13:31.500 --> 13:36.500
We got to figure this shit out.

13:36.500 --> 13:40.500
It's hard and I have will to come over on the show and again,

13:40.500 --> 13:43.500
it's, I can't see him either.

13:43.500 --> 13:46.500
So again it feels like he's right behind me right here.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.500
Grab my shoulder.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.500
It just be like, was it on the set of pellet in brief?

13:50.500 --> 13:54.900
Well, I have no reason why you can't, you have the monitor right in front of you.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.220
Yeah, you should be able to see that.

13:57.220 --> 13:58.500
You can duplicate the monitor.

13:58.500 --> 14:03.140
If I duplicate and mirror them, then you guys see me pressing the fucking sounds.

14:03.140 --> 14:04.740
I wanted to be a surprise.

14:04.740 --> 14:06.500
Um, I have a clip I'd like to set up.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.740
This is, I really am not sure about the clip.

14:10.740 --> 14:15.140
This is a conversation with my self-post shower from the Jeffrey James Vimeo.

14:17.140 --> 14:19.140
How did you find this shit man?

14:20.100 --> 14:22.900
Now, this is, it looks like Jeffrey's younger.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.660
It's just from seven years ago.

14:24.660 --> 14:27.220
This was an assignment for film school.

14:27.220 --> 14:28.500
This is an assignment for film school.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.700
Yeah, I just wanted to tee up the clip.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.780
Jeff, do you want to say anything about the clip before we play it?

14:31.780 --> 14:33.940
Just that I'm already embarrassed that this is about to be played.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.140
Do you want me to play it on that?

14:35.780 --> 14:37.780
Yeah, I would love if you could play it for everybody.

14:37.780 --> 14:39.780
I mean, I don't want to play it for anybody.

14:39.780 --> 14:42.180
But just because you went through the effort of finding it.

14:42.180 --> 14:45.940
Every time I join the show, I like to bring a little bit of a segment of my own.

14:45.940 --> 14:48.420
You like to embarrass me publicly and physically.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.620
I just expense.

14:50.340 --> 14:53.700
And I think sometimes just forgets that everything is Googleable.

14:55.860 --> 14:59.060
Last time, of course, I brought a very intimate emotional interview with Jeff.

14:59.780 --> 15:02.660
More he said that he plays comedy like a guitar.

15:02.660 --> 15:03.380
Like a glove.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.100
I like a glove.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.900
I wear it like a guitar and I play it like a glove.

15:06.900 --> 15:09.700
And yeah, so I'm really excited about this clip.

15:09.700 --> 15:13.940
And everyone, please check out Jeffrey James's Vimeo

15:13.940 --> 15:15.780
or a conversation with myself post shower.

15:15.860 --> 15:19.380
And the good thing is that everything will be scrubbed by the time the episode comes out of your life.

15:22.420 --> 15:23.300
Here we go.

15:23.300 --> 15:24.980
Conversation with myself post shower.

15:31.700 --> 15:33.060
Can't hear anything.

15:33.060 --> 15:34.020
Well, thanks so much for-

15:34.020 --> 15:35.300
We won't be able to sit down.

15:35.940 --> 15:36.980
And this is Jeffrey.

15:36.980 --> 15:40.900
And I can see that he's got some wine bottles in his college dorm.

15:40.900 --> 15:41.140
Yeah.

15:41.140 --> 15:41.540
That's there.

15:42.180 --> 15:43.140
Is that what is that?

15:43.140 --> 15:44.580
Is that sweet for move, Jeff?

15:44.660 --> 15:46.580
This is Samsung the frame.

15:46.580 --> 15:47.060
Why?

15:47.060 --> 15:49.780
Like, how is it my fault that it's not playing out of this?

15:49.780 --> 15:50.900
I did everything for this.

15:50.900 --> 15:53.460
Like, and I guess, like, my question is what?

15:53.460 --> 15:55.460
You're over 100 episodes of the show, right?

15:55.460 --> 15:56.820
Almost 200, yeah.

15:58.820 --> 16:00.820
This used to be my favorite podcast.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.300
This is so fucked up.

16:03.300 --> 16:03.540
Yeah.

16:04.420 --> 16:05.060
All right, here we go.

16:08.900 --> 16:12.100
Well, thanks so much for sitting down to talk with me for an interview.

16:12.340 --> 16:13.300
Showered me.

16:14.180 --> 16:17.220
I've got a lot to come on, so it's an honor.

16:17.220 --> 16:18.580
A privilege, rather.

16:19.860 --> 16:20.660
Sure.

16:20.660 --> 16:21.620
No problem.

16:21.620 --> 16:22.820
Pre-showered, Jeff.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.180
But let's just make this as quick as possible.

16:26.180 --> 16:26.980
Actually, I don't know what you mean.

16:26.980 --> 16:27.620
Can you pause?

16:27.620 --> 16:28.580
Yeah, let's just-

16:28.580 --> 16:29.620
Let's just pause for a second.

16:29.620 --> 16:32.900
I just want to know what the mood was like in the class when you showed this.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.260
Other silence, of course.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.460
It was kind of into the studio at the end.

16:38.660 --> 16:41.140
Like, I don't remember what the assignment was.

16:41.220 --> 16:42.900
I do know that I didn't follow the rules.

16:44.500 --> 16:49.700
This was document, uh, a pretty picture outside or something.

16:49.700 --> 16:52.100
Yeah, you mean, it's getting a flower, right?

16:52.100 --> 16:53.700
Yeah, this is what I scream.

16:53.700 --> 16:58.900
I'm afraid that this is going to take an inappropriate amount of time.

17:00.340 --> 17:00.580
What?

17:01.780 --> 17:03.620
Look, I only agreed to this because I thought so.

17:03.620 --> 17:04.820
Let's get right into it.

17:04.820 --> 17:05.300
Shall we?

17:06.820 --> 17:07.140
Fine.

17:08.260 --> 17:10.020
So, tell me.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.300
Stop it again.

17:11.300 --> 17:11.620
Yeah.

17:11.620 --> 17:12.740
There's another note.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.140
Jeff?

17:13.140 --> 17:13.860
I got to know.

17:13.860 --> 17:16.660
Yeah, it's not even fun to watch in this forum.

17:16.660 --> 17:17.860
It's actually the same.

17:17.860 --> 17:19.620
I can't imagine one forum.

17:19.620 --> 17:20.500
It would be fun to be.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.660
To get a fucking B-plus in the class.

17:24.660 --> 17:25.060
Sure.

17:25.060 --> 17:26.260
Sure.

17:26.260 --> 17:29.380
Uh, my note is a performance note.

17:29.380 --> 17:29.700
Yeah.

17:29.700 --> 17:32.340
Which is, uh, I think you've gotten better.

17:33.540 --> 17:34.180
I think so.

17:34.180 --> 17:35.380
Yeah, I think so.

17:35.380 --> 17:37.380
Like I can see, I hope so.

17:37.460 --> 17:41.940
I can see the seeds of Jeff, the performer in here.

17:41.940 --> 17:43.940
But it's not, it's not quite.

17:43.940 --> 17:44.980
It's not there there.

17:44.980 --> 17:45.780
Blossoming.

17:45.780 --> 17:46.580
Tell you what.

17:46.580 --> 17:47.620
Jeff?

17:47.620 --> 17:48.100
Yep.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.220
About the shower.

17:49.220 --> 17:50.020
No, no, no, no, no.

17:50.020 --> 17:52.180
Don't just say about the shower.

17:52.180 --> 17:53.620
Like, it's a no-brainer.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.500
Look, now I'm just blowing smoke.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.220
So, I will just...

17:59.300 --> 18:00.420
We can't keep doing this.

18:00.420 --> 18:02.660
Is this a Rothcut or this was the final one?

18:02.660 --> 18:03.460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:03.460 --> 18:05.300
This is before I did my editing practicum.

18:05.300 --> 18:06.900
This was before I learned that

18:06.900 --> 18:09.140
it was supposed to edit around the emotional apex of the scene.

18:09.140 --> 18:09.860
Mm-hmm.

18:09.860 --> 18:10.180
Yeah.

18:11.380 --> 18:13.380
Well, that's, yeah, that's uh...

18:13.380 --> 18:14.020
That's all you need.

18:14.020 --> 18:14.660
That's all I need.

18:15.700 --> 18:16.340
That's all I need.

18:16.340 --> 18:17.700
I got an A in that concept.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.380
That's actually, it makes sense.

18:19.380 --> 18:20.020
It wasn't hard.

18:20.020 --> 18:21.220
It wasn't too high school.

18:21.220 --> 18:23.300
Yeah, you see, just given degrees away.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.100
If you want to see it.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.300
If you want to see it.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.260
Do I see what?

18:26.260 --> 18:28.260
The whole thing ends with me asking.

18:28.260 --> 18:30.260
If I saw that, I masturbated in the shower.

18:32.020 --> 18:35.940
Anyway, um, well, that, that really made me want to kill myself.

18:36.900 --> 18:38.500
I didn't mean to get out of the brain.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.700
I didn't mean to get out of the brain.

18:41.700 --> 18:42.740
But we didn't, we didn't.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.260
I just heard.

18:44.260 --> 18:46.740
Guys, taking care of your health isn't always easy,

18:46.740 --> 18:49.540
but it should be at least if nothing else simple.

18:49.540 --> 18:51.700
And that's why for the last two and a half,

18:51.700 --> 18:55.620
almost three years, I've been drinking A.G.1 every single day.

18:55.620 --> 18:56.740
No exceptions.

18:56.740 --> 18:59.860
It's just one scoop mixed in water once a day.

18:59.860 --> 19:03.860
And it makes me feel way more energized, less brain foggy,

19:03.940 --> 19:06.020
and just ready to take on the day.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.820
It's one thing that I do every morning

19:08.820 --> 19:10.820
that gets the day started off right.

19:10.820 --> 19:12.660
I wake up, I have a glass of water.

19:12.660 --> 19:15.220
I have my A.G.1, and then I have some coffee.

19:15.220 --> 19:18.420
And if I do those three things in that sequence,

19:18.420 --> 19:20.900
I at least have done one thing right that day.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.900
And that pays dividends over time.

19:22.900 --> 19:26.420
That's, uh, whatever the opposite of diminishing returns is.

19:26.420 --> 19:31.940
Games, uh, each serving of A.G.1 delivers a daily dose

19:32.020 --> 19:35.220
of vitamins, minerals, pre and probiotics, and more.

19:35.220 --> 19:38.500
And it's a powerful healthy habit that's also powerfully simple.

19:38.500 --> 19:41.460
You don't have to figure out what vitamins you want to take.

19:41.460 --> 19:43.940
You can just get it all in one nutritional insurance.

19:43.940 --> 19:44.980
And that's why I love it.

19:44.980 --> 19:48.820
Instead of 12, 40 different pills and supplements to look out for my health.

19:48.820 --> 19:53.620
I have A.G.1, and I get it in one delicious, kind of tropical fruit tasting drink.

19:54.820 --> 19:58.020
Now, how do you know for sure that A.G.1 is a high quality product?

19:58.020 --> 20:01.060
Well, I know based on how I feel.

20:01.140 --> 20:04.500
And also that every batch of A.G.1 goes through rigorous testing,

20:04.500 --> 20:07.940
processes, more than one process.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.300
So you know it's safe.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.940
And their ingredients are sourced for absorption, potency,

20:11.940 --> 20:14.580
and nutrient density, which is very important.

20:14.580 --> 20:17.060
You don't want to just get any multivitamin.

20:17.060 --> 20:19.700
You want to make sure that it's coming from high quality sources.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.380
And that's what you're getting with A.G.1.

20:21.380 --> 20:24.500
So if there's one product, I had to recommend to elevate your health.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.380
It's A.G.1.

20:25.380 --> 20:29.460
And that's why we've partnered with them for so long, so many years.

20:29.460 --> 20:32.260
So if you want to take ownership over your health,

20:32.260 --> 20:33.540
start with A.G.1.

20:33.540 --> 20:38.980
Try A.G.1 and get a free one-year supply of vitamin D3K2

20:38.980 --> 20:43.060
and five free A.G.1 travel packs with your first purchase.

20:43.060 --> 20:47.380
Exclusively at drinkag1.com slash what's that?

20:47.380 --> 20:51.380
Again, that's drinkag1.com slash what's that? Check it out.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.620
Public, that'll be cut out.

20:53.620 --> 20:56.980
But I will keep in that I talk to something you didn't want me to say.

20:57.780 --> 21:00.740
Um, I mean, here we are yet again.

21:00.740 --> 21:04.020
Uh, I guess we should head into our first segment, right?

21:04.020 --> 21:07.140
You didn't even ask Brad and Will what they thought about the video.

21:07.140 --> 21:07.460
Yeah.

21:07.460 --> 21:09.620
What did you guys, you, we're all chiming in.

21:09.620 --> 21:11.460
It felt like they didn't have anything to say.

21:11.460 --> 21:12.980
We're just, we're just going to have a copy there.

21:12.980 --> 21:13.380
At them.

21:13.380 --> 21:14.260
They're on high view.

21:14.260 --> 21:15.220
We man.

21:15.220 --> 21:16.820
Well, there's a great shirt.

21:16.820 --> 21:19.540
You got to, you got to check out Jeff's shirt.

21:19.540 --> 21:20.260
All right.

21:22.260 --> 21:24.020
That's an amazing shirt.

21:24.580 --> 21:24.980
Yeah.

21:27.380 --> 21:31.380
A magician like Reveal, while we were all watching the video,

21:31.380 --> 21:35.140
you were, you were understanding where our eyes were.

21:35.140 --> 21:37.540
So really, I did chime in on the video.

21:37.540 --> 21:39.300
Yeah, really.

21:39.300 --> 21:40.980
This is actually merch.

21:40.980 --> 21:42.100
Uh, we're working on for the.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.540
Oh, that's awesome.

21:43.540 --> 21:45.300
The Hilt King's podcast.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.300
Yeah, sold on the back.

21:47.300 --> 21:48.500
Hilt King's fun.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.940
That's awesome.

21:51.940 --> 21:52.580
Yeah.

21:52.580 --> 21:53.620
I liked that a lot.

21:53.700 --> 21:54.260
Yeah, really.

21:54.260 --> 21:54.660
Thanks.

21:54.660 --> 21:55.380
Yeah, tune in.

21:58.100 --> 22:00.180
Uh, I'll buy one.

22:01.940 --> 22:03.300
My dad certainly will.

22:03.940 --> 22:04.820
Oh, wow.

22:04.820 --> 22:06.580
He's a third break.

22:07.300 --> 22:07.860
No way.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.700
10 seconds.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.060
You don't have that many ads.

22:11.060 --> 22:14.180
I think it's going to be bars and tone right now.

22:16.020 --> 22:20.580
Also, that's, that is an assault.

22:20.580 --> 22:21.300
That is in here.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.180
You name alert.

22:30.020 --> 22:30.900
Damian Sounder.

22:32.660 --> 22:33.460
Who?

22:33.460 --> 22:34.020
Damian?

22:34.980 --> 22:35.620
Is the first name.

22:35.620 --> 22:36.820
The last name is Sounder.

22:37.620 --> 22:38.580
Okay, Sounder.

22:38.580 --> 22:39.460
My heart later.

22:39.460 --> 22:40.020
Come on.

22:40.020 --> 22:40.900
That's really come on.

22:41.860 --> 22:42.660
I like that.

22:42.660 --> 22:43.140
Thanks.

22:44.580 --> 22:45.140
Stop.

22:49.300 --> 22:49.620
What?

22:50.580 --> 22:52.980
What was that green man?

22:52.980 --> 22:57.140
You're like, looking at me, like, what do you want from me?

22:59.780 --> 23:00.500
It's typing.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.100
He's typing on his computer now.

23:02.100 --> 23:03.220
He's embarrassed, I guess.

23:04.820 --> 23:06.020
He's pulling something up.

23:06.020 --> 23:06.580
What are you pulling?

23:20.260 --> 23:39.220
Welcome to, okay, I'll guess.

23:39.220 --> 23:41.060
You know exactly what it is, that's here.

23:41.060 --> 23:42.740
It's so long and loud.

23:42.740 --> 23:47.700
It's either the price is tight or the price is right.

23:49.700 --> 23:52.660
The price is right, the tight is right.

23:52.660 --> 23:53.860
The tight is right.

23:55.140 --> 23:58.900
Welcome to, the kite is right.

23:59.940 --> 24:01.460
Right, okay, right, okay.

24:01.460 --> 24:04.740
You should have, it was a great opportunity to do a race thing.

24:04.740 --> 24:05.140
Yeah.

24:05.140 --> 24:05.620
Yeah.

24:05.620 --> 24:06.500
It could have been really good.

24:06.500 --> 24:08.660
Um, I don't think it would have been.

24:08.660 --> 24:11.140
I think if I had a done that, you guys would have been like,

24:11.140 --> 24:12.260
had different complaints.

24:12.980 --> 24:17.140
This is the price of kites of kites of kites.

24:18.020 --> 24:19.700
I thought it was the kite as price.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.540
It says fucking matter.

24:21.540 --> 24:23.620
We're banking episodes, man.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.780
The price is kites.

24:27.140 --> 24:28.900
This is the price of kites.

24:30.340 --> 24:32.420
It's the price is right of kites.

24:32.420 --> 24:35.140
So basically, we're going to all, okay,

24:35.140 --> 24:38.260
our guess, prices is right, rules, all right.

24:38.260 --> 24:40.500
For how much we think these kites cost?

24:40.500 --> 24:41.860
Closers without going over, right?

24:41.860 --> 24:42.100
Yeah.

24:42.100 --> 24:43.700
Closers without going over exactly, right?

24:43.700 --> 24:47.060
Uh, let's, Brad, will, do you guys think you know

24:47.380 --> 24:49.220
the market price of kites?

24:49.220 --> 24:50.180
100%.

24:50.180 --> 24:51.380
Yes.

24:51.380 --> 24:53.860
I've never seen you more confident than anything.

24:54.900 --> 24:55.620
Other than now.

24:55.620 --> 24:56.180
I'm suck.

25:01.300 --> 25:04.100
I'm a slightly less sure, but I'm willing to give it a go.

25:04.820 --> 25:08.100
Will is the optimist that we all need on this.

25:08.100 --> 25:10.180
Yeah, I might need to be more of sorry.

25:10.180 --> 25:12.020
I wasn't anywhere close to done.

25:12.900 --> 25:14.100
Why not?

25:14.180 --> 25:18.100
Will is the optimist that the show didn't beg for,

25:18.100 --> 25:25.060
but needed like, uh, my eyes need radioactive frequency therapy.

25:25.060 --> 25:25.540
Yeah.

25:25.540 --> 25:29.460
I got my eyes zapped by a rod last Friday.

25:29.460 --> 25:30.500
Lacing.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.500
Worst, a cattle prod?

25:32.500 --> 25:35.220
More like a cattle prod, just underneath the eyes.

25:35.220 --> 25:36.020
Why?

25:36.020 --> 25:39.300
Basically, it's a way to stimulate the collagen underneath your eye

25:39.380 --> 25:44.020
lids to kind of regenerate dead tear glands.

25:44.020 --> 25:49.460
So, you know, topical anesthetic jelly that wears off after a couple of seconds.

25:49.460 --> 25:50.580
So it works for a while.

25:50.580 --> 25:52.020
It feels like a nice eye massage.

25:52.020 --> 25:53.300
Zap.

25:53.300 --> 25:55.140
Your, your asses out of the chair.

25:55.140 --> 25:57.620
You're wondering why they didn't warn you that it was going to be painful.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.620
Why did you, do you don't have tear glands?

25:59.620 --> 26:02.100
I'm losing my lipid glands.

26:02.100 --> 26:03.860
So what does that mean?

26:03.860 --> 26:05.300
Like is that the price is kite?

26:06.500 --> 26:07.860
What do we all think?

26:07.940 --> 26:09.780
This kite, you can't reveal your eyes.

26:09.780 --> 26:11.780
Compromising medical information.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.620
And then try to pivot into a segment.

26:13.620 --> 26:16.980
You guys, we zled your way into a hippo violation.

26:16.980 --> 26:18.260
I'll get my ass.

26:18.260 --> 26:19.060
I don't appreciate it.

26:19.060 --> 26:20.260
Let's get into the game show.

26:20.260 --> 26:21.060
Okay.

26:21.060 --> 26:22.500
All right.

26:22.500 --> 26:23.860
This kite is 1299.

26:23.860 --> 26:24.740
You know, that's the kite.

26:24.740 --> 26:26.980
That's, that's the kite that we're guessing first.

26:26.980 --> 26:28.420
There's a lot of other ones for the game.

26:29.460 --> 26:30.020
1299.

26:30.020 --> 26:30.980
That's too small.

26:30.980 --> 26:31.780
Yeah, thank you.

26:32.580 --> 26:34.500
Okay, Casey's guess is 1299.

26:34.900 --> 26:37.620
Miles?

26:37.620 --> 26:39.620
Come on.

26:39.620 --> 26:41.620
14.

26:41.620 --> 26:43.620
14.

26:43.620 --> 26:45.620
1299.

26:45.620 --> 26:48.580
That's a 2499.

26:48.580 --> 26:49.220
All right.

26:49.220 --> 26:50.420
Okay.

26:50.420 --> 26:51.620
Will?

26:51.620 --> 26:52.580
999.

26:56.580 --> 26:57.620
Will?

26:57.620 --> 26:58.420
No.

26:58.420 --> 27:00.420
What the fuck?

27:00.420 --> 27:01.300
Gone over.

27:01.300 --> 27:04.420
Are you reverse image searching, man?

27:05.380 --> 27:08.900
I wish I could see the image back clearly.

27:08.900 --> 27:11.220
That's insane.

27:11.220 --> 27:12.340
I don't think it's that insane.

27:12.340 --> 27:16.020
I think 999 makes sense for like a kite.

27:16.020 --> 27:17.140
Standard price.

27:17.140 --> 27:17.700
What is that?

27:19.300 --> 27:20.420
I think that's crazy.

27:21.220 --> 27:24.100
Will is winning with 999.

27:24.900 --> 27:25.300
Not that.

27:25.300 --> 27:26.340
Get them any points.

27:26.340 --> 27:27.460
Well, isn't that the thing?

27:27.460 --> 27:29.300
It's like you get the price of the item.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.140
Get in cash on the game.

27:31.140 --> 27:33.380
I feel like I get the item, right?

27:33.380 --> 27:34.340
No, I think it's not.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.100
Isn't it just to move on to the next round?

27:36.100 --> 27:37.220
Just move on to the end.

27:37.220 --> 27:38.020
You do all the stuff.

27:38.020 --> 27:39.220
Will is the only one who moves on?

27:40.020 --> 27:41.700
Yeah, now he's going to go play like that.

27:41.700 --> 27:42.500
No, he knows.

27:42.500 --> 27:43.220
He'll go.

27:43.220 --> 27:44.100
Just will.

27:44.100 --> 27:45.700
Let's just all move on.

27:45.700 --> 27:46.500
Okay.

27:46.500 --> 27:47.700
Uh, here we go.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.140
Uh, in this segment.

27:49.140 --> 27:49.700
Yep.

27:49.700 --> 27:50.900
Really good segment, man.

27:51.540 --> 27:52.500
Awesome.

27:52.500 --> 27:53.700
You got to do at least.

27:53.700 --> 27:55.460
Right, you got to go.

27:55.460 --> 27:57.700
This is a kite surfing kite.

27:57.700 --> 27:59.620
So a little bit of context there.

27:59.620 --> 28:01.540
Uh, what do we think this is priced at?

28:02.500 --> 28:05.860
It's not going to tell the size of this is this meant to carry a human in the air.

28:05.860 --> 28:09.220
Uh, it's meant to keep someone surfing at their will.

28:09.220 --> 28:09.700
Okay.

28:09.700 --> 28:11.540
$279.

28:11.540 --> 28:13.140
It's okay.

28:13.940 --> 28:14.980
Why are you mad at that?

28:14.980 --> 28:15.940
Hmm.

28:15.940 --> 28:20.580
Oh, you're out of the game.

28:20.580 --> 28:23.220
Oh, you're out of the game for the other hand.

28:23.220 --> 28:25.780
If you guess that's far off, you're out of the game.

28:25.780 --> 28:26.780
No way.

28:26.780 --> 28:27.780
I'm sorry.

28:27.780 --> 28:29.780
Oh, go wait in the kitchen.

28:29.780 --> 28:30.740
I'm going to go in the kitchen.

28:30.820 --> 28:33.300
Wait until if you're far off, thank you so much, Miles.

28:34.660 --> 28:35.540
No one else.

28:36.820 --> 28:38.980
If anyone else had to add out of the gas, maybe.

28:38.980 --> 28:40.020
But I think they're all in line.

28:40.020 --> 28:43.220
So, but if I guess badly, I get to get out of the game.

28:43.860 --> 28:44.180
Yeah.

28:45.300 --> 28:46.580
Well, a million dollar kite.

28:49.940 --> 28:51.140
A million dollar kite.

28:52.420 --> 28:54.500
Yeah, that's pretty wrong.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.540
Actually, I think Miles is back in because KC's was so off.

28:57.540 --> 28:58.020
What?

28:58.020 --> 28:58.500
It's a context.

28:58.500 --> 28:59.860
Well, we're creating on a sliding skill.

28:59.940 --> 29:02.340
I figured action sports kites got to be pricey,

29:02.340 --> 29:03.460
so they know they're made of.

29:03.460 --> 29:03.620
Yeah.

29:07.220 --> 29:08.500
There's never been more of a dud.

29:09.460 --> 29:10.900
There's never more of a dud.

29:11.860 --> 29:12.660
We're moving on.

29:12.660 --> 29:14.980
There was, there was a lot more of a dud.

29:14.980 --> 29:15.940
Wait, I didn't get to get it.

29:15.940 --> 29:17.620
There was a lot more of a dud.

29:17.620 --> 29:18.900
There was a lot more of a dud.

29:18.900 --> 29:19.940
Oh, the gas.

29:19.940 --> 29:22.420
It was an angel with a whole bunch.

29:22.420 --> 29:24.740
That looked like a, like, a prison bus.

29:25.940 --> 29:27.860
What is one curious people?

29:27.940 --> 29:30.180
Well, I knew that one.

29:30.180 --> 29:31.300
You got too nervous.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.300
You got to go through the segments, people.

29:33.300 --> 29:34.180
The long guesses.

29:35.300 --> 29:38.020
We have to move on because the next segment's going to take a while.

29:38.020 --> 29:39.140
Oh, my god.

29:39.140 --> 29:41.940
This is not what the guests want to hear.

29:41.940 --> 29:43.300
They don't want to hear the second.

29:43.300 --> 29:44.500
It's going to be really long.

29:55.380 --> 29:57.540
Are you guys familiar with the 36 questions?

29:57.620 --> 29:58.500
That lead to love.

29:58.500 --> 30:01.940
Yeah, I've done a lot.

30:01.940 --> 30:03.140
I got with everyone, but I guess about it.

30:03.140 --> 30:03.540
Okay.

30:03.540 --> 30:06.100
Well, I sort of created my own.

30:08.100 --> 30:10.900
I wondered if we could get two volunteers.

30:12.100 --> 30:13.140
I'll do it.

30:13.140 --> 30:13.540
Brad.

30:13.540 --> 30:13.780
Yeah.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.420
Brad and Miles are Brad and Will.

30:16.420 --> 30:18.500
Is it only two of us get to answer?

30:18.500 --> 30:20.020
Yeah, get gazing and I go.

30:21.060 --> 30:22.820
Alright, let's just pair up.

30:22.820 --> 30:23.540
Let's pair up.

30:24.580 --> 30:25.700
Miles in Brad.

30:25.700 --> 30:26.020
Great.

30:26.020 --> 30:27.380
Will and Casey.

30:28.260 --> 30:28.740
Here we go.

30:28.740 --> 30:29.700
First question.

30:29.700 --> 30:32.100
And again, these are the 36 questions that lead to love.

30:32.100 --> 30:32.740
Jeff Edyston.

30:32.740 --> 30:33.380
Yeah.

30:33.380 --> 30:34.180
Number one.

30:34.180 --> 30:34.660
Sorry.

30:34.660 --> 30:35.700
How are we teams?

30:36.500 --> 30:39.860
Not so much teams more like partner up because like the question.

30:39.860 --> 30:42.260
We too fall in love at the end of it.

30:42.260 --> 30:42.660
Got it.

30:42.660 --> 30:44.100
In a way, at the very least.

30:44.100 --> 30:50.100
So Miles and I are collectively trying to fall in love with Casey and Will as

30:50.100 --> 30:52.740
like those are the two guys like that sense.

30:53.780 --> 30:56.820
Do you like seeing I try to fall in love quicker or harder?

30:56.820 --> 30:57.780
Yeah.

30:57.780 --> 30:58.180
Or Miles and Miles.

30:58.180 --> 30:58.980
It's competitive.

30:58.980 --> 31:00.580
I think let's make it competitive.

31:00.580 --> 31:02.420
This is basically the semi finals, right?

31:02.420 --> 31:06.180
So it's going to be Miles and Brad and then whoever falls in love the hardest

31:06.180 --> 31:09.540
between the two of you move on to face the winner of Brad.

31:09.540 --> 31:10.180
I like that.

31:10.180 --> 31:11.460
Will versus Cassie.

31:11.460 --> 31:11.940
So Cassie.

31:11.940 --> 31:12.580
Cassie.

31:12.580 --> 31:13.060
So Cassie.

31:13.060 --> 31:13.540
What's that?

31:13.540 --> 31:14.100
It's Casey.

31:14.100 --> 31:14.260
Yeah.

31:14.260 --> 31:15.060
It's Casey.

31:15.060 --> 31:15.860
It's Casey.

31:15.860 --> 31:17.860
I think the 36 Jeffs.

31:17.860 --> 31:18.900
What's that?

31:18.900 --> 31:20.500
Yeah, the 36 Jeffs.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.220
That's really good.

31:21.220 --> 31:21.860
Okay, here we go.

31:21.860 --> 31:22.500
One.

31:22.500 --> 31:23.380
Well, okay, let's start.

31:23.380 --> 31:24.820
This got to be rapid fire because guys,

31:24.820 --> 31:26.580
because we're already fucking 20 minutes into the shit.

31:26.660 --> 31:28.100
Are there 36?

31:28.100 --> 31:29.060
There are 36.

31:29.060 --> 31:29.940
Oh my god.

31:29.940 --> 31:32.260
There are 36, but there's a catch after the 24th.

31:32.260 --> 31:33.780
So we'll see how you got to answer that.

31:33.780 --> 31:35.060
And that might decide this.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.900
That might decide the winner of the fucking championship.

31:36.900 --> 31:39.140
So the first round, let's go one by one.

31:39.140 --> 31:40.980
So this is going to be Miles and Brad.

31:40.980 --> 31:42.100
Number one.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.220
Ask each other's this question.

31:44.100 --> 31:44.900
Actually, you know what?

31:44.900 --> 31:46.500
You're asking the question, though.

31:46.500 --> 31:47.460
Don't tell me that.

31:47.460 --> 31:48.500
That's the question.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.340
I don't know what the question is.

31:50.340 --> 31:51.140
Okay, wait, you know what?

31:51.140 --> 31:52.020
That's a good question.

31:52.020 --> 31:52.660
That's a good point.

31:52.660 --> 31:55.060
I'm sending the first set to Miles.

31:56.580 --> 31:59.060
Overtext and Miles will ask Brad to.

31:59.060 --> 32:01.220
And yeah, okay, so here we go.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.060
Here we go.

32:02.060 --> 32:03.060
Miles, you're ready?

32:03.060 --> 32:04.060
Yeah, just went through.

32:04.060 --> 32:05.060
It just moved through.

32:05.060 --> 32:11.300
I don't know where my phone is, so you can't do this for me.

32:11.300 --> 32:14.100
Well, number one, given the choice of any time in the world,

32:14.100 --> 32:17.220
when would you want someone as a dinner guest?

32:18.100 --> 32:20.340
When would I want someone to repeat the question?

32:20.340 --> 32:21.380
That was too fast.

32:21.380 --> 32:24.100
Given the choice of any time in the world,

32:24.100 --> 32:26.500
when would you want someone as a dinner guest?

32:26.740 --> 32:27.540
Dinner time.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.100
That's really good.

32:30.100 --> 32:32.260
By the way, I'll be the judge of who's falling in love the hard drive.

32:32.260 --> 32:34.340
I think a seven PM is good.

32:34.340 --> 32:36.260
Yeah, I'm going to give that one to Brad.

32:36.260 --> 32:37.140
That's one to Brad.

32:37.140 --> 32:38.420
I asked the question.

32:38.420 --> 32:41.220
Right, but you asked Brad to tell more and love with you.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.180
Thank you, Phil.

32:42.180 --> 32:43.540
Yeah, are you not getting this?

32:43.540 --> 32:44.660
What about this as confused?

32:44.660 --> 32:48.660
Number two, would you like to be infamous in what way not?

32:49.460 --> 32:53.300
You're just taking the 36 questions and changing the little bit.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.780
But no, it is the 36 questions.

32:55.780 --> 32:57.220
I didn't say it was going to be drastically different.

32:57.220 --> 32:58.420
I said it was Jeff edition.

32:58.420 --> 32:59.220
Jeff?

32:59.220 --> 32:59.940
Hey, no!

32:59.940 --> 33:00.740
No!

33:02.740 --> 33:05.620
We don't want to be, what, infamous is what?

33:05.620 --> 33:06.500
The opposite of famous?

33:06.500 --> 33:08.340
And that's like being famous for something bad.

33:08.340 --> 33:10.180
More than, no, it's not.

33:10.900 --> 33:12.900
Jesse James was infamous.

33:12.900 --> 33:13.860
Well, he was a criminal.

33:13.860 --> 33:15.860
So there's a negative connotation for sure.

33:15.860 --> 33:18.260
I don't think I want to be infamous, though.

33:18.260 --> 33:18.740
Okay.

33:18.740 --> 33:22.100
And what ways would you not want to be infamous, though?

33:22.180 --> 33:26.420
For, I don't want to be famous for building the shit as someone.

33:26.420 --> 33:27.140
I'm crap.

33:27.140 --> 33:28.420
Commenting a crime.

33:28.420 --> 33:30.500
Do you ever beat the shit out of someone?

33:30.500 --> 33:32.180
Well, I don't want to be famous for it.

33:33.540 --> 33:35.540
I want to beat the shit out of people I don't want to know.

33:35.540 --> 33:37.380
No, it's not so scary to me to be honest.

33:37.380 --> 33:39.060
I've never beat the shit out of it, but yeah.

33:39.060 --> 33:39.860
All right.

33:39.860 --> 33:41.060
Brad?

33:41.060 --> 33:43.460
I have I ever beaten the shit out of any country?

33:45.460 --> 33:46.900
That's not bad as a second question.

33:48.180 --> 33:49.860
Well, let's have you answer that.

33:49.860 --> 33:51.140
I have, yeah.

33:51.220 --> 33:52.020
Whoa.

33:55.460 --> 33:58.980
So I'm going to the next time I'm in LA.

34:00.260 --> 34:00.900
Awesome.

34:00.900 --> 34:01.860
Holy shit.

34:01.860 --> 34:02.660
It's cool.

34:02.660 --> 34:05.460
I'm going to get that to miles because Brad is my violin.

34:07.860 --> 34:09.140
This is, sorry.

34:09.140 --> 34:10.820
So I just continue asking any questions.

34:10.820 --> 34:11.300
Correct.

34:11.300 --> 34:12.420
So you have the fucking list.

34:12.420 --> 34:13.380
And then, sorry.

34:13.380 --> 34:16.740
What are you going to make me and will do all of the questions?

34:16.740 --> 34:18.980
Pick up the pace, man.

34:19.060 --> 34:20.020
This is great.

34:20.020 --> 34:21.540
Why don't we just all answer the same time?

34:23.220 --> 34:24.020
Would that be better?

34:24.020 --> 34:25.300
Oh, no.

34:25.300 --> 34:27.300
You're really, really good.

34:27.300 --> 34:28.020
You're really good.

34:28.020 --> 34:28.340
All right.

34:28.340 --> 34:29.220
Let's do it all at once.

34:29.220 --> 34:31.940
Let's have Brad Will and K.C.

34:31.940 --> 34:32.900
Catch up.

34:32.900 --> 34:33.620
Let's ask.

34:33.620 --> 34:35.700
I don't remember the first question so passed.

34:35.700 --> 34:36.980
Given the choice of any time in the world,

34:36.980 --> 34:38.580
when would you want someone to just dinner?

34:38.580 --> 34:38.980
Yes.

34:38.980 --> 34:40.180
Oh, dinner time.

34:40.180 --> 34:40.580
All right.

34:40.580 --> 34:41.540
Well, it's kind of steel.

34:41.540 --> 34:43.300
I mean, I copied my answer.

34:43.300 --> 34:43.940
Copy that.

34:43.940 --> 34:44.900
Well, one day.

34:44.900 --> 34:45.940
Valentine's Day.

34:45.940 --> 34:48.580
I'm going to give that one to Will because it's not plagiarized.

34:48.980 --> 34:51.140
And would you like to be infamous in what we're not?

34:51.140 --> 34:53.060
Slash, have you ever beaten the shit out of anybody?

34:53.060 --> 34:53.780
Yeah.

34:53.780 --> 34:55.460
I would not like to be infamous.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.620
Uh, infamous.

34:59.620 --> 35:01.060
What's that?

35:01.060 --> 35:01.540
Is that?

35:03.300 --> 35:04.900
That's me saying what's that.

35:04.900 --> 35:06.100
Oh, I like that.

35:06.100 --> 35:06.740
All right.

35:06.740 --> 35:07.700
And I don't have to do it.

35:07.700 --> 35:08.340
I don't have to do it.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.580
You don't think you do it.

35:10.580 --> 35:10.900
All right.

35:10.900 --> 35:11.540
Three is.

35:11.540 --> 35:12.900
No, well, didn't answer.

35:12.900 --> 35:12.980
Oh, sorry.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.820
No, I want to be loved.

35:16.820 --> 35:18.180
That one's going to Will just because of the

35:18.180 --> 35:20.580
specificity and how fast he said it with the conviction.

35:20.580 --> 35:21.140
All right.

35:21.140 --> 35:21.620
Three.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.220
Before making a telephone call,

35:23.220 --> 35:26.020
do you ever rehearse what you aren't going to say?

35:26.020 --> 35:26.660
Who?

35:28.660 --> 35:31.700
You're going to be really just changing what you're saying.

35:31.700 --> 35:33.860
I don't think that's the question.

35:33.860 --> 35:36.580
Uh, no, I rehearse what I am going to say.

35:36.580 --> 35:41.060
And I guess who, uh, me.

35:41.140 --> 35:42.100
Yeah.

35:42.100 --> 35:43.140
Yeah.

35:43.140 --> 35:43.940
Do you understand?

35:43.940 --> 35:45.140
Sure.

35:45.140 --> 35:45.700
Me.

35:47.700 --> 35:48.500
Miles?

35:48.500 --> 35:49.780
Uh, no.

35:49.780 --> 35:50.180
Okay.

35:50.180 --> 35:51.860
I'm going to give that to Brad for specificity.

35:51.860 --> 35:52.180
Yeah.

35:52.180 --> 35:52.980
Okay, see?

35:52.980 --> 35:56.260
Uh, I do think sometimes I do rehearse what I'm not going to say.

35:56.260 --> 35:59.620
Like I do think about like,

35:59.620 --> 36:00.420
yeah.

36:00.420 --> 36:02.100
How am I going to start this call?

36:02.100 --> 36:02.660
Good day.

36:02.660 --> 36:02.980
No.

36:04.260 --> 36:05.780
Go with good morning.

36:05.780 --> 36:06.260
For sure.

36:06.820 --> 36:08.820
Um, and who the bank?

36:08.820 --> 36:09.300
Nice.

36:09.300 --> 36:09.780
Yeah.

36:09.780 --> 36:10.180
Well.

36:11.940 --> 36:12.900
I agree with Casey.

36:12.900 --> 36:14.660
I think sometimes I can make a list.

36:14.660 --> 36:15.460
Given it to Casey.

36:15.460 --> 36:15.700
Yeah.

36:15.700 --> 36:16.180
I've got the four.

36:16.180 --> 36:16.980
And who?

36:17.220 --> 36:17.860
Casey.

36:17.860 --> 36:18.420
Wow.

36:18.420 --> 36:20.420
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

36:20.420 --> 36:21.220
No, I'll give it to Chris.

36:21.220 --> 36:21.860
No, all right.

36:22.740 --> 36:23.460
Before.

36:23.460 --> 36:23.780
All right.

36:23.780 --> 36:27.060
So we're three questions in four to 36.

36:28.980 --> 36:30.260
He's a scraper.

36:32.660 --> 36:35.380
It is nine minutes until my weekend.

36:35.380 --> 36:35.780
Yeah.

36:35.780 --> 36:36.500
Let's pass it up.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.700
Fasten it up.

36:37.700 --> 36:38.260
All right.

36:38.260 --> 36:40.580
What would constitute a fine day for you?

36:42.020 --> 36:47.620
Brad, I guess a little bit of exercise and hang it out

36:47.620 --> 36:51.060
with friends listening to music or playing music.

36:51.060 --> 36:55.060
Maybe getting some dinner, maybe going to a brewery,

36:55.060 --> 36:59.220
maybe ordering some pizza, playing with my dogs, a little bit.

36:59.220 --> 37:01.540
Maybe we go climbing in the room.

37:01.540 --> 37:02.980
Maybe I go on a run.

37:02.980 --> 37:08.180
Oh, maybe I, maybe I go on a chat with Will.

37:08.180 --> 37:10.340
Maybe I chat with my boy.

37:10.500 --> 37:11.620
You know, I love that.

37:11.620 --> 37:12.660
Maybe we catch up.

37:12.660 --> 37:15.380
We see what's going on in New York City.

37:15.380 --> 37:16.740
We see how he's been.

37:16.740 --> 37:17.940
We see what he's been up to.

37:17.940 --> 37:20.740
What has he been watching recently?

37:20.740 --> 37:24.420
I know that he's planning on going to maybe see a movie this weekend.

37:24.420 --> 37:26.180
Maybe we talk about how the movie was.

37:26.180 --> 37:29.860
Maybe we talk about Emma Stone, our favorite Emma Stone films.

37:29.860 --> 37:33.300
Have you been watching the rehearsal on Showtime?

37:33.300 --> 37:35.460
We've got a deal that I'd like to know.

37:35.460 --> 37:36.420
It is the curse.

37:36.420 --> 37:37.060
The curse.

37:37.060 --> 37:37.540
The curse.

37:37.540 --> 37:37.860
Sorry.

37:37.860 --> 37:38.420
The curse.

37:38.420 --> 37:38.820
The curse.

37:38.820 --> 37:40.020
See that would come up.

37:40.100 --> 37:41.380
Been in the conversation.

37:42.580 --> 37:44.580
That's what would make it fine, really.

37:44.580 --> 37:50.580
So that's a little bit of a moment friends where you're not afraid to

37:50.580 --> 37:52.980
correct each other because you're close like that.

37:52.980 --> 37:55.140
You know, you've kind of got that rapport.

37:55.140 --> 37:57.140
You know, that is a fine day.

37:57.140 --> 37:58.580
And then maybe I don't know.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.260
I'd get laid.

38:04.820 --> 38:06.980
Miles, I don't think you should even try for this one.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.100
That one's going to Brad.

38:08.260 --> 38:10.420
Honestly, I was going to say getting laid.

38:10.420 --> 38:10.980
All right.

38:10.980 --> 38:11.860
Miles, you're sorry.

38:11.860 --> 38:12.500
Will, Casey.

38:13.860 --> 38:15.220
Getting laid.

38:15.220 --> 38:15.940
All right.

38:15.940 --> 38:16.580
Played Drizzam?

38:16.580 --> 38:16.740
Will?

38:16.740 --> 38:17.140
What do you got?

38:17.940 --> 38:18.980
Porking tickets.

38:18.980 --> 38:19.620
There you go.

38:19.620 --> 38:20.020
All right.

38:20.020 --> 38:20.820
Then we're going to Will.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.100
Purchase all the scores.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.460
Brad has got three points.

38:23.460 --> 38:24.260
Getting laid.

38:25.460 --> 38:26.100
Oh.

38:26.100 --> 38:26.900
Yeah.

38:28.900 --> 38:29.860
Everybody.

38:31.140 --> 38:31.700
What's that?

38:33.860 --> 38:34.180
Okay.

38:34.180 --> 38:35.460
So far, this is the Tally.

38:36.260 --> 38:39.540
Brad is in first of his challenge.

38:41.140 --> 38:42.180
Oh my god.

38:42.180 --> 38:44.580
Will is winning his battle of love.

38:44.580 --> 38:46.260
I believe the show is such a headache.

38:47.620 --> 38:48.340
Number five.

38:48.340 --> 38:49.140
Let's hear it.

38:49.140 --> 38:50.580
We got to make this faster, guys.

38:50.580 --> 38:52.580
Wait, we got it.

38:53.380 --> 38:54.820
We got to click in the face.

38:54.820 --> 38:55.300
You can't.

38:55.300 --> 38:55.460
Sorry.

38:55.460 --> 38:57.780
So you know, how long was the price?

38:57.780 --> 38:59.060
Is kite going to take?

38:59.060 --> 39:01.460
It was going to be 15 minutes.

39:01.460 --> 39:02.580
This all took you long.

39:02.660 --> 39:03.220
Precious kite.

39:03.220 --> 39:04.420
We answered two guys.

39:04.420 --> 39:06.420
And you said that through as some of the

39:06.420 --> 39:07.060
fights.

39:08.420 --> 39:09.060
Well, okay.

39:09.060 --> 39:12.340
When did you last sing passive aggressively to someone else?

39:15.620 --> 39:17.780
Last weekend, band practice.

39:19.780 --> 39:20.980
You were like, oh, you want to play?

39:20.980 --> 39:22.180
Are you singing a different key?

39:22.180 --> 39:26.420
I mean, it was like they were kind of like stalling a little bit.

39:26.420 --> 39:27.940
And I was ready to rehearse.

39:27.940 --> 39:30.580
Oh, and I was like, come on.

39:31.540 --> 39:33.300
Oh, I like that.

39:33.300 --> 39:33.860
I like that.

39:33.860 --> 39:35.140
Beat it up.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.020
You know, it's good.

39:36.020 --> 39:37.060
It's what you got.

39:37.060 --> 39:37.620
Can't beat that.

39:37.620 --> 39:40.420
Uh, no, definitely can't beat that Jeff, but I'm going to put

39:40.420 --> 39:41.300
myself in the running.

39:42.660 --> 39:47.140
Sometimes I sing to my baby in a passive aggressive.

39:47.140 --> 39:52.500
I'm like, Julie, and don't grab that.

39:52.500 --> 39:53.700
It's not for you.

39:54.020 --> 39:54.820
Who?

39:54.820 --> 39:58.820
Hey,札札.

40:02.820 --> 40:05.220
You Tay.

40:07.220 --> 40:08.580
That's important.

40:10.580 --> 40:15.860
Rememberä to untie now as much during our

40:15.860 --> 40:22.420
dream race

40:22.420 --> 40:29.420
It's going to miles, I'm sorry, Brad.

40:29.420 --> 40:30.420
Yes.

40:30.420 --> 40:32.420
Will in KC, what do you got?

40:32.420 --> 40:33.420
I forgot the question.

40:33.420 --> 40:34.420
Moving on to five.

40:34.420 --> 40:36.420
You guys both get four foot that right now.

40:36.420 --> 40:37.420
Moving on to six.

40:37.420 --> 40:39.420
If you were able to live in the age of 90,

40:39.420 --> 40:41.420
I lived to the age of 90.

40:41.420 --> 40:44.420
And it's either the mind or body of a 30 year old woman

40:44.420 --> 40:47.420
for the last 60 years in your life.

40:47.420 --> 40:50.420
Why wouldn't you want that sexist?

40:50.420 --> 40:52.420
I think I would want that.

40:52.420 --> 40:55.420
I would want that, but I would want it to be in a world

40:55.420 --> 40:58.420
where equality has truly been achieved,

40:58.420 --> 41:02.420
which is what I'm constantly striving for as a fan in it.

41:02.420 --> 41:04.420
I wouldn't want it till everyone can get married.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.420
I don't understand what I'm saying.

41:06.420 --> 41:07.420
I don't understand what I'm saying.

41:07.420 --> 41:08.420
I don't understand what I'm saying.

41:08.420 --> 41:12.420
If you were able to live to the age of 90, and retain either the mind or body of a 30 year old woman

41:12.420 --> 41:15.420
for the last 60 years of your life, why wouldn't you want that sexist?

41:15.420 --> 41:17.420
I think I would want that.

41:17.420 --> 41:18.420
I would want that.

41:18.420 --> 41:20.420
I don't understand what I'm saying.

41:20.420 --> 41:23.420
So mind and body of a woman.

41:23.420 --> 41:25.420
I'm a body.

41:25.420 --> 41:27.420
Oh mind or body.

41:27.420 --> 41:34.420
So does that mean I'm living for like 30 years in my body, my mind,

41:34.420 --> 41:38.420
and now I have a different mind, different body.

41:38.420 --> 41:39.420
Exactly right.

41:39.420 --> 41:43.420
Like just another person entirely.

41:43.420 --> 41:44.420
You're still pretty.

41:44.420 --> 41:45.420
You're pretty.

41:45.420 --> 41:47.420
Maybe you would have my mind.

41:47.420 --> 41:49.420
You have hive mind.

41:49.420 --> 41:50.420
Oh.

41:50.420 --> 41:54.420
That one's going to go to will just because of what Casey's doing right now.

41:54.420 --> 41:56.420
No, I was trying to understand what he was saying.

41:56.420 --> 41:57.420
He was asking me.

41:57.420 --> 41:58.420
Yeah.

41:58.420 --> 41:59.420
We'll just want the round.

41:59.420 --> 42:00.420
No.

42:00.420 --> 42:01.420
Thank you.

42:01.420 --> 42:02.420
No.

42:02.420 --> 42:04.420
Well, doesn't want the point.

42:04.420 --> 42:06.420
I can take her leave it.

42:06.420 --> 42:07.420
I'll take it.

42:07.420 --> 42:09.420
I'm going to give it to Brad.

42:09.420 --> 42:10.420
Give it to Brad.

42:10.420 --> 42:12.420
So I point to give.

42:12.420 --> 42:14.420
That's so fucked up.

42:14.420 --> 42:15.420
Okay.

42:15.420 --> 42:16.420
Here we go.

42:16.420 --> 42:20.420
Do you have a secret drunch about how you will die?

42:20.420 --> 42:22.420
What's the original question was hunched?

42:22.420 --> 42:23.420
And being the word hunched?

42:23.420 --> 42:24.420
Drunch really?

42:24.420 --> 42:27.420
I guess my guess is drunch is a dreadful hunch.

42:27.420 --> 42:28.420
Yeah, I like that.

42:28.420 --> 42:29.420
A dreaded hunch.

42:29.420 --> 42:30.420
Drunk hunch.

42:30.420 --> 42:31.420
Drunk hunch.

42:31.420 --> 42:32.420
You get drunk.

42:32.420 --> 42:33.420
You have existential dread about a hunch.

42:33.420 --> 42:36.420
Well, do you have a drunch about your how you'll die?

42:36.420 --> 42:39.420
I think I'm going to be physically stabbed in the back.

42:39.420 --> 42:40.420
Yeah.

42:40.420 --> 42:42.420
Absolutely.

42:43.420 --> 42:44.420
You see, love that.

42:44.420 --> 42:46.420
I wish I didn't know it's so much joy from everyone in the real life.

42:46.420 --> 42:48.420
It won't be me, but it'll happen.

42:48.420 --> 42:50.420
I'll go, I, of course.

42:50.420 --> 42:51.420
Yeah.

42:51.420 --> 42:53.420
Makes sense.

42:53.420 --> 42:55.420
I'll stab you in the back from the front.

42:55.420 --> 42:58.420
They need rehab for personalities.

42:58.420 --> 43:00.420
For me.

43:00.420 --> 43:03.420
Look, you feel like you've stepped program to be a president.

43:03.420 --> 43:05.420
Yeah, your personality's cost.

43:05.420 --> 43:06.420
I can, you would like to change it.

43:06.420 --> 43:07.420
Exactly.

43:07.420 --> 43:08.420
Right.

43:08.420 --> 43:09.420
And now it's on a strong human.

43:09.420 --> 43:14.420
You need to be taken out of society placed in some, you know, nice house and, you know,

43:14.420 --> 43:15.420
Malibu or something.

43:15.420 --> 43:16.420
Exactly.

43:16.420 --> 43:17.420
Yeah.

43:17.420 --> 43:18.420
I wouldn't mind that, actually.

43:18.420 --> 43:20.420
Just to like, better myself on a bluff.

43:20.420 --> 43:21.420
Mm-hmm.

43:21.420 --> 43:22.420
That does sound nice, by the way.

43:22.420 --> 43:25.420
It's sort of the grad school promise.

43:25.420 --> 43:26.420
Yeah.

43:26.420 --> 43:29.420
You get to sort of escape from society and learn.

43:29.420 --> 43:31.420
Do you guys have a drunch about how you're going to die?

43:31.420 --> 43:33.420
Back flip off the motorcross.

43:33.420 --> 43:34.420
That's awesome.

43:34.420 --> 43:35.420
I got to give it to miles.

43:35.420 --> 43:36.420
We'll see what you got.

43:36.420 --> 43:37.420
Come on.

43:38.420 --> 43:44.420
I'm always, I've always hoped to be natural causes and like old age,

43:44.420 --> 43:48.420
but I've also thought that if I was to like start losing my mind,

43:48.420 --> 43:51.420
I can't remember, you know, family members.

43:51.420 --> 43:52.420
That's sort of thing.

43:52.420 --> 43:56.420
I would probably drive into the Grand Canyon.

43:56.420 --> 43:57.420
Yeah.

43:57.420 --> 43:58.420
That's pretty good.

43:58.420 --> 43:59.420
Will, what do you got?

43:59.420 --> 44:01.420
Of boredom on this show.

44:01.420 --> 44:03.420
I'm going to give it to Casey because I have my feelings.

44:03.420 --> 44:04.420
Here we go.

44:04.420 --> 44:05.420
Eight.

44:06.420 --> 44:07.420
Eight.

44:07.420 --> 44:08.420
We're not even in double digits.

44:08.420 --> 44:09.420
It's not my fault.

44:09.420 --> 44:11.420
You guys are dragging your goddamn feet.

44:11.420 --> 44:12.420
Okay.

44:12.420 --> 44:13.420
Eight.

44:13.420 --> 44:14.420
Miles.

44:14.420 --> 44:15.420
All right.

44:15.420 --> 44:16.420
Eight is going to be, hang on.

44:16.420 --> 44:17.420
Sorry.

44:17.420 --> 44:18.420
I was bored.

44:18.420 --> 44:20.420
So I started playing Angry Birds.

44:20.420 --> 44:23.420
Number eight is assume three things.

44:23.420 --> 44:25.420
You and your partner don't agree on.

44:25.420 --> 44:27.420
Miles, let's start with you.

44:27.420 --> 44:29.420
Assume three things we don't agree on.

44:29.420 --> 44:31.420
Well, I leave the cabinet doors open.

44:31.420 --> 44:32.420
She doesn't care for that.

44:32.420 --> 44:34.420
No, not you and your partner, you and Brad.

44:34.420 --> 44:36.420
Oh, Brad, what do you think that we don't agree on?

44:36.420 --> 44:39.420
Because I see that you've got a really cool, um,

44:39.420 --> 44:41.420
tube television in the back that takes BCR.

44:41.420 --> 44:43.420
I'm thinking that that's really nice.

44:43.420 --> 44:45.420
Yeah, we definitely agree on that.

44:45.420 --> 44:46.420
Yeah.

44:46.420 --> 44:51.420
Um, I don't know what's your stance on, uh,

44:51.420 --> 44:56.420
just kind of the entire state of the economy.

44:56.420 --> 44:58.420
It's pretty bad, right?

44:58.420 --> 44:59.420
Yeah.

44:59.420 --> 45:00.420
Yeah.

45:00.420 --> 45:01.420
I agree there.

45:01.420 --> 45:02.420
Yeah.

45:02.420 --> 45:03.420
What about the modern.

45:03.420 --> 45:06.420
How do you feel about the British royalty?

45:06.420 --> 45:08.420
I don't care about that at all.

45:08.420 --> 45:09.420
Yeah.

45:09.420 --> 45:10.420
It's sucking.

45:10.420 --> 45:12.420
No, it's not talked to you this person about it.

45:12.420 --> 45:14.420
It's just state three things.

45:14.420 --> 45:16.420
You think that they disagree with you on.

45:16.420 --> 45:17.420
I was going to do Casey.

45:17.420 --> 45:18.420
Do you like Tom Cruise?

45:18.420 --> 45:19.420
Because I think he's gone.

45:19.420 --> 45:20.420
I like Tom Cruise.

45:20.420 --> 45:21.420
I do too.

45:21.420 --> 45:23.420
This was a dummy episode.

45:23.420 --> 45:25.420
We actually have a lot in the comments.

45:25.420 --> 45:26.420
I have a lot in the comments.

45:26.420 --> 45:27.420
I think we should do that.

45:27.420 --> 45:28.420
You guys are getting a point for this.

45:28.420 --> 45:29.420
Yeah.

45:30.420 --> 45:31.420
Casey.

45:31.420 --> 45:32.420
Three things.

45:32.420 --> 45:33.420
Casey named three things.

45:33.420 --> 45:34.420
You think.

45:34.420 --> 45:35.420
Birkin stop.

45:35.420 --> 45:36.420
That will don't agree.

45:36.420 --> 45:38.420
You have the same ones.

45:38.420 --> 45:39.420
I love it.

45:39.420 --> 45:41.420
I think they should keep going.

45:41.420 --> 45:42.420
They're really hitting it all.

45:42.420 --> 45:43.420
Let's move on to number nine.

45:43.420 --> 45:46.420
The whole thing was we was supposed to fall in love.

45:46.420 --> 45:47.420
Number nine.

45:47.420 --> 45:48.420
The one in your life.

45:48.420 --> 45:49.420
The one in your life.

45:49.420 --> 45:50.420
The leads to love organically.

45:50.420 --> 45:53.420
For what in your life do you feel the least grateful?

45:53.420 --> 45:55.420
What a horrible question.

45:55.420 --> 45:57.420
I love this guy.

45:58.420 --> 46:01.420
I'm least grateful for what.

46:01.420 --> 46:03.420
That's the question.

46:04.420 --> 46:06.420
Being alive.

46:06.420 --> 46:07.420
Damn.

46:07.420 --> 46:08.420
Will.

46:10.420 --> 46:12.420
The sidewalk.

46:14.420 --> 46:16.420
Is that because you just take it for granted?

46:16.420 --> 46:18.420
Or you actually think exactly.

46:18.420 --> 46:19.420
Got it.

46:19.420 --> 46:21.420
I just feel like it should be there.

46:21.420 --> 46:23.420
So I'm not going to worry about it.

46:24.420 --> 46:27.420
Well, what do you do if you're walking down the street and the sidewalk ends?

46:27.420 --> 46:28.420
But you still got to keep going.

46:28.420 --> 46:29.420
How do you feel?

46:29.420 --> 46:31.420
We keep asking these side of the sidewalks.

46:31.420 --> 46:33.420
I think that was a really good question.

46:33.420 --> 46:34.420
On topic.

46:34.420 --> 46:36.420
Shell Silverstein style.

46:36.420 --> 46:37.420
Yeah.

46:37.420 --> 46:38.420
I think I explore.

46:38.420 --> 46:39.420
What then?

46:39.420 --> 46:40.420
The whole world open.

46:42.420 --> 46:43.420
Miles, what do you got?

46:43.420 --> 46:44.420
Okay.

46:44.420 --> 46:49.420
I think I feel the least grateful for like pissy, shitty people that exist in life.

46:49.420 --> 46:51.420
You know, in my world.

46:51.420 --> 46:52.420
Yeah.

46:53.420 --> 46:54.420
I get that for sure.

46:54.420 --> 46:55.420
Yeah.

46:55.420 --> 46:56.420
So.

46:56.420 --> 46:57.420
Brad.

46:57.420 --> 47:02.420
I probably least grateful for shitty and pissy people.

47:02.420 --> 47:03.420
Oh, that's awesome.

47:03.420 --> 47:04.420
Me too.

47:04.420 --> 47:05.420
I agree with you guys.

47:05.420 --> 47:06.420
I hate those kinds of people.

47:06.420 --> 47:08.420
Now you're not in on this.

47:08.420 --> 47:09.420
For sure.

47:09.420 --> 47:11.420
Do you want to do 10?

47:11.420 --> 47:12.420
Yep.

47:15.420 --> 47:17.420
I don't like how this has become me.

47:17.420 --> 47:19.420
Like why am I reading the questions?

47:19.420 --> 47:20.420
Why end into Casey?

47:21.420 --> 47:22.420
I don't know where my phone is.

47:22.420 --> 47:23.420
Fine.

47:23.420 --> 47:24.420
I'll keep it going then.

47:24.420 --> 47:26.420
If you could change one thing about the way you were raised.

47:26.420 --> 47:29.420
Why would you embarrass your parents like that by saying it on a podcast?

47:29.420 --> 47:30.420
I wouldn't change anything.

47:30.420 --> 47:31.420
They did a great job.

47:31.420 --> 47:32.420
There you go.

47:32.420 --> 47:33.420
Yeah.

47:33.420 --> 47:34.420
Casey?

47:34.420 --> 47:35.420
I just answered.

47:35.420 --> 47:39.420
I meant to say Miles.

47:39.420 --> 47:41.420
I meant to say Miles.

47:41.420 --> 47:42.420
Yeah.

47:42.420 --> 47:44.420
Yeah.

47:44.420 --> 47:45.420
Um.

47:45.420 --> 47:47.420
Okay.

47:48.420 --> 47:53.420
I think why would you embarrass your parents like that by saying it on a podcast?

47:53.420 --> 47:55.420
So.

47:55.420 --> 47:57.420
If I could change one thing about the way I was raised.

47:57.420 --> 47:59.420
This is so bad.

47:59.420 --> 48:00.420
We have to know.

48:00.420 --> 48:01.420
We have to know.

48:01.420 --> 48:02.420
We have to know.

48:02.420 --> 48:03.420
I have to know.

48:03.420 --> 48:04.420
I have to know.

48:04.420 --> 48:05.420
I have to know.

48:05.420 --> 48:06.420
I have to know.

48:06.420 --> 48:07.420
Who do you think this is?

48:07.420 --> 48:08.420
Yo!

48:08.420 --> 48:10.420
I created the list of questions.

48:10.420 --> 48:11.420
It's supposed to be rapid fire.

48:11.420 --> 48:14.420
I want you to say how you think this is going to go.

48:14.420 --> 48:15.420
Good.

48:16.420 --> 48:17.420
I got to be kind of fun.

48:17.420 --> 48:18.420
Okay.

48:18.420 --> 48:19.420
All right.

48:19.420 --> 48:20.420
Casey was here when I was.

48:20.420 --> 48:22.420
Let me ask you something out loud at the question.

48:22.420 --> 48:23.420
Yeah.

48:23.420 --> 48:24.420
Let me produce this a little bit.

48:24.420 --> 48:25.420
Okay.

48:25.420 --> 48:26.420
All right.

48:26.420 --> 48:27.420
So if I'm producing the show.

48:27.420 --> 48:28.420
Okay.

48:28.420 --> 48:29.420
And I'm like, okay.

48:29.420 --> 48:30.420
Thirty-six questions.

48:30.420 --> 48:33.420
How long do I think as the producer this is going to take?

48:33.420 --> 48:35.420
Thirty-six questions.

48:35.420 --> 48:37.420
Four people talking.

48:37.420 --> 48:38.420
Yeah.

48:38.420 --> 48:42.420
Let's say it's a minute a question.

48:42.420 --> 48:43.420
That's thirty-six minutes.

48:43.420 --> 48:44.420
Yeah.

48:44.420 --> 48:45.420
All right.

48:45.420 --> 48:46.420
So you need the show.

48:46.420 --> 48:47.420
One-and-a-half the episode available.

48:47.420 --> 48:48.420
And I would know that going in.

48:48.420 --> 48:49.420
Okay.

48:49.420 --> 48:52.420
This is going to be thirty-six minutes minimum.

48:52.420 --> 48:53.420
Probably closer to forty-five.

48:53.420 --> 48:55.420
Especially if the questions are good.

48:55.420 --> 48:56.420
Yeah.

48:56.420 --> 48:57.420
And like people are riffing and talking.

48:57.420 --> 48:58.420
Having conversation.

48:58.420 --> 48:59.420
You know.

48:59.420 --> 49:00.420
Recording a podcast.

49:00.420 --> 49:01.420
That's where he disagreed.

49:01.420 --> 49:02.420
I didn't want to be here.

49:02.420 --> 49:03.420
Close to the mic.

49:03.420 --> 49:05.420
I didn't want to expect.

49:05.420 --> 49:06.420
I didn't want to be here.

49:06.420 --> 49:07.420
Close to the mic.

49:07.420 --> 49:09.420
I didn't want to expect.

49:09.420 --> 49:10.420
I didn't want to be here.

49:10.420 --> 49:11.420
Close to the mic.

49:11.420 --> 49:13.420
I didn't want to expect.

49:14.420 --> 49:16.420
Something.

49:16.420 --> 49:17.420
Oh, withouterness.

49:17.420 --> 49:19.420
We're taking a huge SUV.

49:21.420 --> 49:24.420
Take four more minutes.

49:24.420 --> 49:25.420
Don't be shy.

49:30.420 --> 49:32.420
I didn't think of through.

49:32.420 --> 49:33.420
I didn't think of through.

49:33.420 --> 49:34.420
You don't have it said.

49:34.420 --> 49:35.420
Obviously.

49:35.420 --> 49:36.420
Obviously.

49:36.420 --> 49:37.420
What prepare me.

49:37.420 --> 49:38.420
seulement.

49:38.420 --> 49:39.420
We're learning.

49:39.420 --> 49:40.420
What do you need?

49:40.420 --> 49:41.420
What do you need.

49:41.420 --> 49:42.420
Tornwaready.

49:42.420 --> 49:47.780
gained any quantity of cash. How much would that be? I think that's kind of interesting because you know what you

49:47.780 --> 49:50.100
If you have a billion dollars that you might not be happy

49:50.420 --> 49:55.860
But I think if you have ten million dollars you might smile. Oh, I'd be overjoyed if I had ten million dollars

49:55.860 --> 49:57.380
So what's the amount?

49:57.380 --> 50:00.740
But you wanted to not be so much. No, I do want to be a lot

50:01.860 --> 50:05.780
A billion yeah a billion really a billion yeah if I woke up and had a billion dollars on puke

50:06.420 --> 50:09.140
Yeah, you think so shards. I don't know how anyone else

50:10.100 --> 50:17.060
Wouldn't like it's a million dollars a billion. That's small much more. It's but I guess what I like about a billion is that you could be like

50:17.300 --> 50:23.140
It's easiest slice it up. You'd be like yeah a billion. All right, you know what 500 k. Let me build the coolest town

50:23.700 --> 50:25.700
In the same

50:27.700 --> 50:29.700
Just buy a fucking joke down

50:29.700 --> 50:31.700
And then build a house

50:32.260 --> 50:37.540
Well, I don't know. I want to buy a ghost town and make it like a fun place to have you keep saying

50:37.780 --> 50:39.540
Okay, make sure a macho

50:39.540 --> 50:41.540
Yeah, is one

50:42.180 --> 50:44.020
2000 of a billion yeah

50:44.020 --> 50:45.460
Yeah, it wouldn't buy a town

50:45.460 --> 50:50.740
That's my point. You buy one house and it's a bill a billion dollars is is is enough money where you know

50:50.900 --> 50:55.940
You can like do the finances and figure out how much money do I need? Yeah, which is like and then be said

50:55.940 --> 50:57.540
I pay myself a million

50:57.540 --> 51:00.740
Dollars a year for the next 60 years of my life. Okay

51:01.060 --> 51:06.260
60 million that's put in a little pocket for me. Yeah, and then beyond that all the rest of my life

51:06.260 --> 51:08.500
I just have to like it like a doctor

51:09.140 --> 51:12.420
I'm gonna buy it. Yeah, so you just do like standard billion

51:12.980 --> 51:14.180
But

51:14.180 --> 51:16.180
Who share the

51:16.500 --> 51:23.860
I do charity for a bunch of buy a town build fucking wells in space build well wells in California

51:26.100 --> 51:28.420
Is that the problem? That's not the problem

51:36.260 --> 51:42.820
Exactly, all right moving on to set two if a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself

51:42.820 --> 51:49.460
Your life the future or anything else what mundane nonsense would you waste that wish on a crystal? I have a good one for this

51:49.460 --> 51:54.260
I have a good one. Let's hear it. I want to see every photo that I've ever photo

51:55.380 --> 51:57.380
Oh, that's a

51:59.700 --> 52:02.100
That's good that would be really good

52:03.060 --> 52:05.060
Casey

52:06.660 --> 52:09.300
Miles sorry, I'm just recovering

52:09.860 --> 52:15.380
All right number 14 is there's something that you've dreamt of doing for a long time stop that

52:16.900 --> 52:18.900
Whoa

52:18.900 --> 52:23.380
Okay, number 15. What is the greatest to come so that was just a command what's that?

52:25.060 --> 52:27.060
That this is the list of demands

52:28.020 --> 52:30.020
What's that?

52:30.020 --> 52:37.220
This is a random list of demands were hostages. Yeah, it's all coming together. What is the greatest accomplishment of your life?

52:37.860 --> 52:39.860
That's it

52:41.860 --> 52:43.860
Me start with miles

52:45.540 --> 52:49.780
I don't want to be belittled by stating what I think it is all right Casey

52:52.980 --> 52:56.820
Don't say the color of the walls in the studio. No, it's not the color of the look

52:57.300 --> 52:59.300
I thought

53:01.460 --> 53:09.140
Brad we've been killing it honestly we've been killing it here. Yeah, we just put out you know the David Cross show with Bob

53:09.140 --> 53:13.060
Great great work on the same day that doughboys put out Andy Samberg

53:14.420 --> 53:18.100
All these recorded in the head-gum studios. Oh, yeah, and then we also did a live

53:18.900 --> 53:24.900
Stream show all in the same day. So I'm I'm actually really proud of what we're doing here me too

53:25.380 --> 53:28.100
Hell yeah, of you. Sorry to

53:29.140 --> 53:31.140
Sincerely answer that question

53:32.340 --> 53:34.340
Brad that's it

53:35.620 --> 53:37.620
That's it

53:38.180 --> 53:40.180
Yeah, it's all say it and you listen

53:40.180 --> 53:42.180
That's it

53:42.180 --> 53:47.460
Okay, what do you what do you guys value? Why do you are sorry? This one's directed directly at will

53:48.020 --> 53:50.740
Why do you value friendship? That's weird

53:50.900 --> 53:52.900
Oh

53:53.300 --> 53:55.780
Friendship makes life worth living

53:56.740 --> 54:00.020
All right, this one's directed just to Brad you thank you

54:00.020 --> 54:06.100
This one's directed just to Brad what is your most treasured memory don't tell us just think about it

54:11.380 --> 54:12.660
Moving on

54:12.660 --> 54:17.620
The disappointing thing is the questions have gotten better. I like these questions a lot more than the first

54:17.620 --> 54:21.780
There's a lot more like meet on question air commentary

54:25.460 --> 54:34.660
When I walked in the studio Jeff was working on these and he looked at me said I've just made my magnum opus

54:35.540 --> 54:41.060
He did say they said the final part of it really ties into your show and I think you're really gonna like it

54:41.060 --> 54:42.580
And he was really proud of himself

54:42.580 --> 54:46.740
I'm sitting here laughing, so that's why it's like what you guys are like what did you think was gonna happen?

54:46.740 --> 54:48.100
I thought this was gonna be kind of fun

54:48.900 --> 54:52.660
What is your most terrible memory will and let's all answer that one?

54:54.340 --> 54:56.340
Last time I was on the Hedgen Puckest

54:57.700 --> 55:02.260
Sox yeah, same answer for me. Yeah, that might be a unanimous you guys want to say it in unison

55:03.460 --> 55:05.460
The last time I guess

55:06.740 --> 55:08.740
This is the worst

55:09.700 --> 55:16.100
If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly would you tell people to elicit sympathy

55:17.860 --> 55:19.860
No immediately

55:20.500 --> 55:25.140
I don't think I would tell a soul. I would keep it to myself and I would just live every day like it was my last

55:25.700 --> 55:32.020
That's cool. Brad speaking of David Cross. There's a really good Mr. Show sketch about this

55:32.740 --> 55:37.860
About like getting sympathy when you're about to die. So I would do it and I would play it off just like that sketch

55:38.420 --> 55:40.820
Nice go watch senses working over time

55:41.620 --> 55:47.380
Yeah, I'm gonna plug that was really good. Okay. Here we go. Why doesn't friendship mean nothing to you?

55:50.500 --> 55:54.500
Why doesn't friendship mean nothing to you?

55:55.380 --> 55:57.380
It's a double negative. Yep

55:57.380 --> 56:05.540
What is he saying? I don't know. It's a I wonder that a lot with him. It is honestly kind of a repeat of the question that was just for me

56:05.780 --> 56:07.780
It's basically what does friendship mean

56:09.700 --> 56:11.700
Yeah, which is the actual question

56:14.580 --> 56:16.580
Magnum opus

56:16.580 --> 56:19.380
What roles do love an affection player in your life?

56:20.260 --> 56:25.300
That is just the question from the problem. Yeah, that's not a jet ship is the question

56:29.620 --> 56:30.820
All right

56:30.820 --> 56:33.860
If you guys don't have immediate answers we really are approaching an hour here

56:33.860 --> 56:36.820
Sorry to take some minute to wrap our heads around the question

56:37.060 --> 56:42.660
Sharing something you would consider a bad trait of your partner share a total of nine

56:44.580 --> 56:46.580
Sh nine

56:46.580 --> 56:53.220
I want you to say nine bad things about Brad Brad same thing reciprocate to miles and then a wheel and Cassie will exchange

56:53.220 --> 56:55.220
Well

56:55.460 --> 57:01.860
I don't even know I don't think I could name nine bad things about anybody because I think everyone's a pure soul me too

57:02.180 --> 57:04.420
I think Brad is no different you need to

57:05.620 --> 57:11.220
All right here we go. Do you ever feel a sneaking suspicion that other people's families are closer and warmer than yours?

57:11.220 --> 57:15.620
Do you feel your child? It was more tragic than most let this this one's just for Casey

57:19.780 --> 57:22.020
Got a very supportive family got it all right

57:22.020 --> 57:27.540
How do you feel about your relationship this for everybody how do you feel about your relationship with your pastor and then in front of the season

57:27.540 --> 57:30.100
It says if no pastor and conversation

57:30.740 --> 57:32.100
I don't have a pastor

57:32.100 --> 57:33.140
I don't have a pastor

57:33.140 --> 57:36.420
Don't go on. So that's the end. It's good conversation. We're done

57:38.580 --> 57:42.260
Not the end of the conversation. I'm gonna list the last 12, but we're not gonna answer anything

57:42.260 --> 57:48.020
This is rapid fire. Okay, just so we can know just so we can know well actually no, I'm just gonna jump ahead to the organic plug of your ship

57:49.300 --> 57:51.300
How does it tie it?

57:51.300 --> 57:56.180
Fine, I'll say all 12. You have to stay in all the well lead into it make three vague

57:56.340 --> 58:00.820
We statements for instance. We both in this room are feeling blank complete this sentence

58:00.820 --> 58:05.300
I wish I had someone with whom I could haggle with in specific regards to having blank

58:06.180 --> 58:11.060
If you were going to become a close friend with your partner, please share what wouldn't be important for them to know

58:11.700 --> 58:19.220
Tell your partner what you're fine with about them of be very honest to this time saying things you might not say to someone you've just met

58:19.860 --> 58:23.540
Share with your partner and embarrassing moment that happened during this podcast

58:24.020 --> 58:27.860
When did you last cry in front of another normal?

58:28.580 --> 58:30.580
What about a famous

58:31.300 --> 58:37.220
Tell your partner something that you like about them already, but that might change later. Did you cry in front of someone famous? What's that?

58:38.420 --> 58:40.980
Did you cry in front of someone famous? He heard the question

58:42.260 --> 58:48.020
I am curious about that because it just seemed like a personal story. I sobbed in front of George Santa's just because I really believed him

58:48.260 --> 58:53.300
What if anything is too hilarious to be serious about

58:54.420 --> 59:01.060
If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone what would you most regret not having told someone? Who cares?

59:02.260 --> 59:04.740
This is what I feel like is going on in Jeff's head

59:05.300 --> 59:10.900
He's just spinning his wheels so he gets tired and get at the end of the day. You're house containing everything

59:10.900 --> 59:16.340
This one's a really good one. It's dog. This one's a really good one. The dog chasing that thing that's going on a string

59:16.820 --> 59:23.140
Speaking of dogs. Your house containing everything you own catches fire after saving your loved ones and pets

59:23.380 --> 59:30.100
You have time to safely make a final dash to change your mind and put your loved ones and pets back inside

59:30.500 --> 59:32.500
Would you do that

59:32.900 --> 59:39.460
If I changed my mind, though, it would not do that, but it's nice of you to ask of all the people in your family who's death

59:39.460 --> 59:42.660
Would you find most financially gainful? Where?

59:43.140 --> 59:50.580
And finally share a personal problem and ask your partners advice on how they might handle it

59:50.580 --> 59:58.020
If their advice sucks, call in to the perfect person podcast hosted by Miles Bonsiorer

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.820
He's good

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:22.100
plugs. What do you guys have going on? What do you want to point the people towards any parting wisdoms or otherwise? Let's hear. Let's start with Brad

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:25.000
The Instudium 2.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Friday December 30th, another year in the books, I don't know what else to say,

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
let's get this shit over with because we all have New Year's Eve to get to, you know what I mean?

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Yeah, you usually date it to when we record, so it's cool to see you thinking about,

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
because right now it's December 13th, just a Tuesday afternoon.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
So much will also happen between now and the 30th.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Wow, that's...

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Bond of the week, this week is, we say, I'm gonna show.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Oh yeah, we got Billy Skiffiery back on again.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Brad Hild, making his return after a month's long, I ate, it's really an

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Amir Blumentfeld who just recorded with Adam Demarco from White Lotus.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Did I miss anything?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
God, man.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Just a bit behind the curtain.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Let's see if we can get this episode done in 30 minutes.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
My turn, my turn, my turn.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
People behind the curtain right before we hit record Jeff said,

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I have to edit this thing immediately.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
So if you find Jeff operating with past today listeners, that's why.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I think I'm operating with patience.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
No.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Do you have a flight home like three hours or something?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Yeah, I'm going to bask.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Where?

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
I'm going to bask in the sunlight.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
London.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
I've got a flight to catch to bask in paradise.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
That's really funny.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
That's really funny.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
He tells himself.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Brad, who's your bottom of the week, man?

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Harry Potter.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
That's a fictional character.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Well, Daniel Radcliffe.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
It's time for a bondy with a wandy.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
That's good.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
That was really good.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Let's go.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Did you have that prepped?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
No.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
My wife has been re-listening to all the Harry Potter audiobooks.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
It's time for a bondy with a wandy.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
So in James Bond's next movie, he has a wand.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Harry Potter is James.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
So it's Daniel Radcliffe as James.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
As Harry James Potter as nice James Bond.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Harry James Bond Potter.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
That's really good.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
That's one of the best.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
So I don't even have the bad.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
I'm going to jump the button.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm going to jump the button.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I'm going to jump the button.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
That's one of the best bonds of the week recently.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Brad.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
And the fact that it wasn't even planned is incredible.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Well, it feels sour by that interaction.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
But that was a really satisfying.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I'm here.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
It's hard not to 70's dad.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
My body not to react to that.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Like I know it didn't mean anything, but my fighter flight.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
You can't tell your brain that that meant nothing.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Harry.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
That's really good.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
James bonds.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
It's time for a bonds with a bondsy.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Yeah.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Oh, what about a bondy?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Well, thank me and freed.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
And it's time for a bondsy scheme.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
That's good.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
That's good.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
That's good.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Also good.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
It's time for a bondsy with a bondsy.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Yeah.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I wonder where back from the freed will be on December 30th.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Like we are right now.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Oh, no.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I got a third bond of the week.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Nobu Matsuhisa.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
It's time for a bond zoo.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Like bondsu.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Did you just wipe your mouth or are you buying yourself time?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
In that moment, Jeff.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
A little bit above.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
I had some vanilla ice cream before this.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Just come to get the, uh, glucose.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Brad, how's your, um, how's your life?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I haven't talked to you in a couple of months.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I do see a Van Lewin bag.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
So the ice cream thing might not be a joke.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Did you, um, postmates Van Lewin?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
It's already pretty expensive.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
So I can only imagine that's like a 20 to 40 dollar pint of ice cream.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Yeah, delivered.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Uh, my roommate got that delivered.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
I just had a court of briars.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
A court.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
An entire court.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
But I have a court in the freezer.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
I have like three bites.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
One 30 PM rolls around and you're like, it's time for my briars.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
There's briars.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I screwed in the fridge at the office.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Vanilla.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
No, that's dryers.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
And I'm not even, that's, that's eddies.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Did you get that ice cream too?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
He spent like $150 on dairy.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
The last time I was on this podcast.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
It was.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
It has an ad shirt.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Oh, yeah.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Well, spoiler alert.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Yeah.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
And I got a dairy rich episode coming up.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Spoiler just for me.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Cost him like 150 bucks.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
There's dryers and there's briars.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
There's dryers in the freezer at the office.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Did Adam ask about that?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
He didn't notice.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I looked at it before he arrived.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
And thought of it after he had left.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Let's keep it going.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
You know, I'm the only one trying to force any energy into this.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I think Billy's coming in with some energy.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Brad looks.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
I guess hindered and Amir looks tired from the previous record.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
So hindered?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
What's that?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
What do you mean by hindered?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
It looks like something's holding you back.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
And I don't know if I should dive into that.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Or if I want to give you your privacy.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Well, you asked me how I was.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
And then we started talking about ice cream for like two minutes.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Okay.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I'm good, by the way.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Really?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
What's the best thing that's happened to you in the past 16 weeks?

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
I booked a trip to LA next month.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Well, I guess next month if this is the 30th.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
So we should hang, man.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
I'm down.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
But I am going to.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
I just have to like warn you.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
I'm doing a job.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
No, I was talking to Billy and Amir.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Solid.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
That was really good.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
And we are playing hang, man.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Yeah.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Brad is low key in Fuego right now.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
He is on fire.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
He's just landing.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
He's heating up.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Let's see if that's their plans.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Billy, how is your sex life?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Because you just moved to Highland Park.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
And I'm wondering if the move sort of reunited the spark between you.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
And I've actively been trying to be a kinder guest to you.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
The past couple of times.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
But these are the moments where you trick the worst in.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
You trigger the worst in me with questions like this.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
I'm just moving on and I'll maintain my positive energy and good vibes.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Okay.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Amir.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
What about you?

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
I'm doing well.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
I hit a game winning three with Billy on Sunday.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Billy passed me the ball and I hit a three and the game ended on it.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
And I said game when he shot it, which makes it extra cool.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
That's what the party went in.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Yeah.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
You shot it.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
It was in the air and I said game.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
It felt so.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
That's awesome.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
That's cool.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
I wish I heard the game part of it.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Well, I did.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
That's cool.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I'm sure other people heard it.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
So it would have been risky if I'd break it bad.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Yeah.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
And you said game.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Yeah.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I'd look like an idiot.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Everyone would tease me.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Jesus.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Teach up by you.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Jesus Christ.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Shit.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Jeff, you're really bringing your knees into the frame.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Well, it's hard.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
You know, like they have to do face the light.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
But this is a couch that's like obviously facing this way.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
So I'm sitting down.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
What's that?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
There's plenty of seating.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Why?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Why are you?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Why are you sitting like that?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Why am I sitting like that?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Or just why do I exist?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Why are you?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Why?

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
What's keep shit going?

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
You know, like I said, this is coming out December 30.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Ron's birthday.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
LeBron James's birthday is December 30.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
He's 30.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Thirty.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Thirty eight.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
You're turning 40.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Right.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
I was talking about LeBron.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Yeah.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Um.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Jesus.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Tiger Woods too.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Also on the 30th.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
That's interesting.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Yeah.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
The two.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
What do they ask for in the same day?

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
It's interesting because like every time Brad and Billy talk,

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
they're really some dopamine because I like to hear what they have to say.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
And then every time a mirror talks, it's like the inverse of that.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
It's like instant like seasonal effect of disorder.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
But the drama is.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Yeah.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
I'm a him.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Slaps of season.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Do you think, um, a holy night ever takes a moment to be like,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I'm really him.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Is a holy night a him or a crown?

09:07.000 --> 09:15.000
That looks violent on your face right now.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Jeff, it looks like that would be uncomfortable for me.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
That's a trial and light.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Good.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Holy healed.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Scuff your e.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Omir's cock.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
You should have said it last day.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Brad healed.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Scuff your e.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
Blue and filled.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
Brad, can you say something?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Uh, I agree with him here.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
I think that would have been better.

09:47.000 --> 09:53.000
I think you kind of dropped the ball on the song on the day.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
You dropped the ball on the song slash day.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Just in general on this day.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
Um, December 30th.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
End of the year.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Even though we're not on our holiday break just yet.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Everyone else pretty much is.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Some people might be working, but you know,

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
I feel like people don't have as much time to listen to this shit anyways.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
So let's see if we can squeeze this episode in in 30 minutes.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Right?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
What are we at right now?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
We're at 11.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
And we've a lot to get into.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
We've had an attitude to have.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
I think it's a helpful attitude to have because like people are fucking busy.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
New Year's Eve is tomorrow.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
People have resolutions that they need to like lock in.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
People have parties.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Maybe people want to like get away.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
They're visiting home.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
They want to get away from their family.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
They want to listen to their favorite podcast.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
And it's this fucking show for some reason.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
What are you doing for New Year's?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Let's say that.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Let it refer the holidays.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Me?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
You're not.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
You're not from Portland.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
No, we're not.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
We don't really have any friends here.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
So we're going to find something to do.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Not to bring the vibe down.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Maybe we don't know how.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Haven't your hunt for friends.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
How does one go about that?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
I don't know.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Maybe you.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
I'm just shooting from the hip here to try and give you New Year's plans.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
But maybe you list like 10 different types of people.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
You want in your social circle for 2020.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
That could get dangerous.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Didn't you go out and see who could find them?

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
Brad, I actually, one of Georgia's friends from Cincinnati lives in Portland.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
And I met her like a couple months ago.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
And I was like, oh, like, she just moved there too.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
And she's trying to make friends.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
And I was like, you would vibe with my friend Brad or lives in Portland.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
So I'm good.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
That was so fast.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Let's take it into news of the day.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
Um, Drake considered proposing 42 times.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
And memorialized exes with a chain featuring 42 diamond engagement rings.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
That's way too many.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Yeah.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Yeah.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
You saw that.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
We're losing 42 times to this.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
So much so that he, no, to 42 different people so much so that he bought them

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
fucking rings and then didn't ask.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
And then kept the rings and put them on a chain.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Are you listening?

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
That's he 42 times bought a engagement ring.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
And then never ever gave them out.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
And then to memorialize the 42 times he put them on a chain.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Yeah.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Imagine going to buy ring 37.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Yeah.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
This is going to change things.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
This one will be different.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Yeah.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Five more rings.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I don't believe that story quite frankly.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Okay.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Well, it's per complex and billionaire.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
You guys did a project for complex.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
So unless you think everything complex does is bullshit.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
I think you would believe the headline, right?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Or was the series never came out.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
It was bullshit in the end.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Yeah.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Like, complex ended up selling to this other company that ended up

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
shuddering down.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Yeah.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
It was like a right wing comedy company.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
It was getting pretty funny.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Yeah.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Well, is it rated red?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Yeah.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
And their home page was just like a cowboy trying to catch a chicken.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
And we're like, all right.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Well, that's fun here.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Yeah.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
It was all right.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
It was pretty fun.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Actually.

13:21.000 --> 13:31.000
GQ reports that in our hyper niche style era, there's a core for everyone, right?

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
There's cowboy core, gorp core, cottage core, norm core, et cetera.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
So I wanted to talk about what each others cores are, right?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Norm.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Yours is norm core.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Yeah.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
Like, sort of thought yours was like dialysis core.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
Just in terms of like the wiry grays.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Nice.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
And the overall era of stray.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
That has to do with kidney failure.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
What's that?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
My harbing gray.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
I just feel like you look ill most of the time.

14:05.000 --> 14:13.000
You look at ease and also like, you know, it seems like when you go home at night, you have to plug yourself into a machine.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Yeah.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Jeff, can you give us all of our cores?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
You gave him your his dialysis core.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
What kind of core are you giving me?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I feel like you're like athletes your core.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
It's definitely elevated.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
It's not like Lulu Lemon nonsense, but like the other day you were wearing that Boris had me sweatshirt.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
It was kind of vintage.

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
And then like the pants, which are like not tight fitting, but like tailored.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Can you guys hear that?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Yeah.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Sounds like a train.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Yeah.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
I moved to a canyon to not have this kind of shit.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
And I feel like I have half a mind to open the window and say stop that.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
This dude's trimming hedges.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
That's fine.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
No, it's not.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
LA's full creatives.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Like there's someone.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Oh my god.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Brad, you're climb core.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Climb core, I guess.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
I thought that would.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
I thought you would really like that.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
You're crunch core.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Which honestly sounds like cereal.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
This guy sucks.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Stop!

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
He's doing his job.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
You're doing yours.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Some better than others is.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Is this legitimately harder?

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
Yeah, he is getting actually a really close shave.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
It's a kind of visual ASMR in a way.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I mean, there, I think I'm dumb core.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
You're sort of baggy core.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
You're really baggy loose fitting clothes.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
I'm wearing like the Bruce Springsteen jeans right now though.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
Well, not really actually, but like yeah.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Like how much excess fabric is in the shirt.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Like take your pants off.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
It probably goes all the way down to your knees.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
There's so much fabric.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
It's a fucking blouse.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
It's a parachute.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
There's so much excess fabric.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
You're supposed to do the bag.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
The big shirt with the fine pants.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Jerry's.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
I don't know.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
I don't know.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I'd label you clumsy core too.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
The clumsy core.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
The clumsy core.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
I've been in person with you.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
The room has been a mess.

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
Like a five-year-old just like spills and like stains that weren't cleaned.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Okay, okay.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
Let's, let's rain it in.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
With the messy shit.

16:30.000 --> 16:37.000
Uh, although there is a ring light that fell that I didn't bother to pick up over there.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
That's kind of still on.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Are you wearing white sneakers?

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
I'm not wearing any shoes because I'm not a fucking monster in the house.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Monster in the house.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
I'm not having shoes on.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Free.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
That was a courties in the house.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
I don't love it.

17:00.000 --> 17:07.000
Really, either got him or maybe go, he made him go to a place.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Not only did that not work at all.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
You guys don't even know what the reference is to know how wrong it was.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Okay, Brad knows.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
I know a courties in the house is.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
Here are the 10 luckiest baby names of 2022.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000

New luckiest?

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Yeah, there's also a Lakshmi.

This is per parent's magazine.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Felix?

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Like these kids got good news in their first year or something.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
What makes them lucky?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Does it explain? Does people explain?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Uh, it says need some inspiration.

And forebears.io to compile the most popular lucky baby names of 2022.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
Some of the names literally translate to lucky, like Amen and Sadia.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Well, I have an association with luck.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
For example, iris derived from the Greek word for rainbow.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
No matter which one you choose, your child might be rewarded with hope,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
serendipity and good fortune.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
S-A-I-E-S-A-I-D.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Maybe it's Saeed.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
And iris.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
And Daniel.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
Um, I really want to get the appetisters on the show.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
I feel like that would be funny.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Very good luck.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Good luck.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
There's no way.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
Nor would it be a good episode.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
How would you reach out?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
How would you reach out?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
What would your email say?

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
Oh, my son, you suck.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Well, my friend is loose friends with iris.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
So I'd rather be like, yeah, like they hung out a couple times.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
She was almost in a movie that he did.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
But he produced.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
She was like attached and then she had a conflict.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Loose is a tough word before friend.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Yeah.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I was a loose friend.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
That's the only inside track.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
The worst thing is thieves.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
According to USA today, why can't we be friends?

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
Lack of social contact harms Americans mental and physical health.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
So my question is, amir, how do you deal with social isolation?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I don't have social isolation.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
That's what I mean.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
I mean, constant contact with dozens of friends.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
Both socially and digitally.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
Can confirm.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Bread.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Help.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Help me.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
He's going to confirm with a mere bread, Lee.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
All right.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
An apple news article today was titled, they vaporized a trillion dollars.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Then they vanished.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
So they what?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Vaped cash and then died?

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
Is this the FTX scandal that crypto money?

20:35.000 --> 20:41.000
Or does it mean actually setting cash on fire?

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
Um, it was like an audio article.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Yeah.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
So I didn't.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
God.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Well, I didn't ultimately do my new diligence.

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
There was no sort of sweat equity to be had there.

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
What I will say is that Thursday I worked from 10 a.m. to what to midnight 30.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Then Friday I worked from noon to 11 30 p.m.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Then Saturday I worked from noon to 11 p.m.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
And then Sunday I worked noon to 10 p.m.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
And then yesterday I worked noon to 11 p.m.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
So in this morning, shut up for a second.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
And then this morning, I had a meeting from 10 a.m. to one p.m.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
outlined this episode between one and two and now we're recording it too.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
So I haven't had a mental break since last Wednesday morning.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Sounds like you're having a mental break right now.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
That's funny.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Uh, that's not exactly how you reach out to a friend.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
You should go yell at the landscape outside some more.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
He stopped.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
So now it's actually the perfect time.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
He'll hear me.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Hey.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
He's walking away.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
Uh, he's taking a quick break.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
But, uh, seriously, thank you guys so much for being here today.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
I really appreciate it.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
And, uh, let's think some sponsors get some of this cash.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Let's get this bag.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Uh, Namaste.

21:54.000 --> 22:05.000
Our next partner has a product that I literally use every day.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
And it's called athletic greens.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
I started taking athletic greens because I'm not a healthy individual, right?

22:10.000 --> 22:15.000
Uh, I also used to take a bunch of different pills and vitamins in an attempt to be healthy.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
But it ultimately was too many of the little fuckers that I stopped doing it.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
It was hard to be consistent with athletic greens.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
It's easy.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
All right.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
It's just one scoop of athletic greens AG1 in a couple of water every day.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
I take it in the morning.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
I do water.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Athletic greens cold brew.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
I'm set.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
I'm off to the races.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Rat or otherwise.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Uh, I also have a lot of sleep issues.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
And athletic greens has helped me.

22:37.000 --> 22:43.000
I am guys happy to say that I'm gotten on a somewhat normal sleeping schedule.

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
And I have to assume at least half the reason is because of athletic greens AG1.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
So what is this stuff?

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
Well, with one delicious scoop of athletic greens, you're absorbing 75 high quality vitamins,

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
minerals, whole foods, or superfoods, probiotics, and adaptogens to help start your day right.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
This special blend of ingredients supports your gut health, your nervous system, your immune system,

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
your energy, recovery, focus and aging.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
All the things.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
Uh, again, I kind of take it in the morning.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
It's part of my morning routine at this point.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Uh, and I look forward to it.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
I, you know, it helps me feel like I'm doing something right.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
If I have my water, if I have my athletic greens up, I have my coffee.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I've done something right already.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
And it's not even 10 30.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
You know what I mean?

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
Uh, it's lifestyle friendly, whether you're meaning whether you eat keto, paleo, vegan, dairy,

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
free, or gluten free, it's all for you.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
It contains less than one gram of sugar, no GMOs, no nasty chemicals, or artificial anything,

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
while still tasting good.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
It also supports better sleep quality and recovery.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Supports mental clarity and alertness.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
And it's the one thing with the best things because athletic greens uses the best of the best product

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
products based on the latest science with constant product iterations and third party testing.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
It costs less than $3 a day and you're investing in your health.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
And it's also cheaper than your cold brew habit.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
I have both, but that's fine.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
It's also cheaper than getting all the different supplements yourself.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I used to spend hundreds of dollars.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Every couple months on supplements.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
Now, it's all less than $3 a day with athletic greens.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
And you're investing in all in one nutritional insurance.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Right now, it's time to reclaim your health.

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
And our immune system with convenient daily nutrition, especially heading into the winter, which is as we know, cold and flu season.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
This is just one scoop in a cup of water every day.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
No need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health.

24:23.000 --> 24:31.000
And to make it easy, athletic greens is going to give you a free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
Vitamin D is so important, guys, especially if you don't live somewhere that's sunny all the time.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
All you have to do is visit athleticreens.com slash.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
What's that?

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Again, that's athleticreens.com slash.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
What's that?

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
To take ownership of your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Thanks, athletic greens.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
And we're back, or should I say, and we're bad, right?

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
It's time to play a new game that we have never played on the show.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
Let's see if we can get this whole thing done in seven minutes.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Kind of knock it out in 30.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Welcome to Bass Master.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Have you guys seen Bass Master?

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
I don't think so.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
All right, it's a British panel show.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Well, this is Bass Master, right?

25:18.000 --> 25:29.000
So I'm going to shoot a couple of Bass Words at you as in words that from the language of Bass, which is sort of this like,

25:30.000 --> 25:38.000
ethnicity, ethno region, I guess, would be the word that straddles along between France and Germany, and it's a dying language.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
So I thought that we could kind of keep it alive.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Bass in the language of Bass.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
So here we go.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
For every word you correctly translate from Bass to English, I'll give you oven when you're five dollars.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Here we go.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Kai show.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
What do we think that means?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Day.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Nearby.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
Uh, it's got to be something dumb.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Joy.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Joy?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
You think joy is dumb?

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
He looks like joy dumb.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Kai show is hello.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Uh, all right.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Jatexia.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I'll go with goodbye.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
It's a good guess.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Thank you.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
I'm going to go food.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Brad was close.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
It's actually restaurant.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Uh, here we go.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Zortheon.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Loving that buzzer coming in after each word.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
Um, good morning.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
Good luck.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Are you, you googled that?

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
No, I speak bass.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
That's absolutely correct.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Brad has five bucks to his name.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Here we go.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Brad spelling that correctly.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Zortheon.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
You exclaimed that twice.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
You spelled that phonetically perfect.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I'll never tell.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Did you google it?

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Because I'm not going to give you cash.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
It wasn't fun or tell.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
It was the way you said it.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
It was like a muzzle of Jeff's body position right now.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
It's just top now.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
One arm fully back.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Offering a lover.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Sorry.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
My landlord is leaving.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
I'm distracted.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Shit because they're super.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
It's like really fucking shiny.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
And yeah.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Is arm acting as a kickstand.

27:46.000 --> 27:52.000
Jeff has Albert Brooks core.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
I get that.

27:55.000 --> 28:00.000
Kamuna Nondago.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Persona Nondaga.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
That's just what you're thinking.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
This is unbelievable.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
Both of my landlords are leaving at the same time.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
And this guy is now trimming our hedges.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
I guess he works for both of these buildings.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
You have two landlords?

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
They're married.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
That's awesome.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
Kamuna Nondago.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I'm your guest.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Persona Nondrada.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
Let's get guesses from Brad and Will.

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
Left.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
Like the left hand or left foot.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
There's actually no English translation.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
Where are the toilets?

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Oh, here we go.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
Oh, so on, though.

28:55.000 --> 29:01.000
There are the toilets.

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
Very well.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
Good night.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
It's very good.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
Brad is also disqualified from the game.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
Just using Google translate, which did not get that one correct.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Because we are trying to, we have three minutes left.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
We have a whole other segment.

29:21.000 --> 29:26.000
It's kind of crazy.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Or caught to.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
What?

29:30.000 --> 29:40.000
Bar caught to.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
Brad any guesses?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I was also going to.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I'm also going to go with bark.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
That's a French dog.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
Soccer.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
Correct answer is excuse me.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Bar caught to.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
Bar caught to.

30:02.000 --> 30:08.000
The man who is rushing to make this a 30 minute episode is taking his sweet time.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
That was bass master.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
The only person who made any cash would have been Brad, but he cheated.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
So no, we've got to join anybody.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Did you guys like that game?

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
No.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I don't remember.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Really.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
To remember the actual bass words.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Obviously not.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Well, you had Osoando.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
You had Bar caught to.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Bar caught to.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
We have to move on.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Wow.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
Bar caught to.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
You get out of this show.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
What you put into this show, right?

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
So when you guys come at me with sour, you're going to get sour in return.

30:43.000 --> 30:49.000
When you come at this with joy with participation, with genuine enthusiasm, you'll

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
leave feeling that way as well.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
You started the whole thing was I came on here.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
I'd never met Billy before.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I said nice to meet you when you said it.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Is it?

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
I just didn't think it would.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
The meeting I watched it happen.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
I was an objective third party.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
It looked like it was a fine meeting.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
It did not seem like it was great to meet him.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
And same from Billy.

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
If I got on a zoom and I saw you in this frame Brad, I would not be like, oh, can't

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
wait for the next 45 minutes.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
That's wrong with this frame.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
There's so much going on in the background.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
You have the overhead lights on.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
You should never use overhead lights.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
You should only use floor lamps.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
It's also daytime.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Why is it on?

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Master.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
This you were going to have sales.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
You have a microphone on a mic arm.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
And you're not a podcaster.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
I sound a mic arm.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
It's a stand.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
And I play music asshole.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Everybody has a right here.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
I just get into it.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
You're stupid.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
I'm gonna start.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
I'm gonna start.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
I'm gonna start.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
I'm gonna start.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
I'm gonna start.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Yes.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
I'm gonna start.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Yes.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Brad wins.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Oh.

31:52.000 --> 31:59.000
I just got my freaking ass hand and turn it back.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
That.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
That was unexpected.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Yeah.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Yeah.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Yeah.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Yeah.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Because you came out of him.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
And then he did this.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
Don't talk about my frame.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I'm very good.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
Fucker.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
Um.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
It's that time of the year again, guys.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
It's new years.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
The turning of the tide.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
It's the changing of the season.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Twenty twenty three is nigh.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
And nigh.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
I don't know.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Fuckin' twenty four hours away.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Forty eight hours away.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Forty seven.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Actually.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Pacific time.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
I think it's important that we reflect.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
That we project.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
And that we expect.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Success.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Um.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
For the next year.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Right.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
So Brad, you were hired this year.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Um.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
I had gum.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
It's been a joy to work with you.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
And very far away from you at the company.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Both have been true and both have been good.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Um.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
You mean.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Haha.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Uh.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
No.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
I met Brad at the offsite.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
The company retreat.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
We had a ball.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
We had a blast.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
We had the ball to.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Make it last.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Shake our ass.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
And shake our ass at whatever the fuck that wretched club was called.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
We went to in.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Scottsdale, Arizona.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Um.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
So could you just speak to your year Brad?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Like, what you regret?

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
What you experienced joy?

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
What?

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
Why?

33:34.000 --> 33:39.000
And maybe what a resolution or nine would be for 2023.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Let's start with you.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
You want me to do 10 resolutions?

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
I said a resolution or nine.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Or nine.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Okay.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Got it.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Well, this year.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Sorry.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
I thought you were going to say something.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
Is the music going to keep going?

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Do you want other silence while you'd like?

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
No.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
This is good.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
I just wanted to be sure.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Uh.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Yeah.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
It's had ups and downs.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
It's been six months.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
It had gum.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
And I've made so many new connections, so many new friends.

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
It was so nice to get to know everyone and work with everyone at the company.

34:14.000 --> 34:19.000
And although I may be far away in Portland, Oregon.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
So many people have come to visit me.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
I had Marty in town.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
I had Joel.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
One of his goals.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
I had Joel.

34:28.000 --> 34:35.000
I got to meet Billy and a mirror from the Bucket's podcast.

34:35.000 --> 34:40.000
And then I had to do this show for five times.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
And got to her.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
I had to.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
All right.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
And that pretty much sums it up.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
If I had to pick a resolution and probably be to make a friend.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
I'm offering you a friend on a silver platter in her name.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
I'm good.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Okay.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Ideally, the friend wouldn't know you.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Any sexual resolutions?

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Billy?

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Pass.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
On the whole thing?

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Just the sexual stuff.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
Then Billy, how was your 2022?

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Let's reflect.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Let's expect success.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
What?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
What did you enjoy?

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
What did you regret?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
How did you regress?

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
And name some of your success?

35:34.000 --> 35:39.000
And then let's do a resolution or nine for the next calendar year.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
It was a good year.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
I moved into a new home that has a lovely yard.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
A mirror has visited.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
And then how did you grow and change, too?

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Also add that on the hand.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
How did you grow and change?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
My hair got longer.

35:52.000 --> 35:57.000
And from a change standpoint, I think that I just...

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
I think I'm just trying to grow up a little bit more.

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
Trying to shed some of the boy qualities and transition to the man.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
It's a good goal.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Shut up.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I would say from my resolution,

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
I'd like to hit 190 pounds in 2023.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Is that losing weight or gaining weight?

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
That would be like gaining 10 pounds.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Why?

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Perfect downbeat.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
I'd go back.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
I didn't go to a gym.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
All of the pandemic.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
And now I've joined a gym.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Got it.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
What about sensual resolution?

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
So it's not sexual.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
But like, how do you want to use your senses?

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
Smell, sight, taste, oral.

36:43.000 --> 36:48.000
I'd like to commit to putting on more moisturizer.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Very good.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Skin hair.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Skin hair.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Skin and hair.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Yeah.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
I started doing a skin routine.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Sarah V.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Obviously cleans the shit.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
A little bit of moisturizer.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
It's a facial moisturizer.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
No, you're right.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
I'm here.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
What did you ask me?

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
I've said it twice now.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
But yeah, here it goes for a third time.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Sorry, audience.

37:21.000 --> 37:26.000
You can blame a mirror that I'm saying the same exact fucking sentence for the third time.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
How did you grow and change this past year?

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
What are your regrets?

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
How did you expect success?

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
And for next year, a resolution or nine?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Let's hear it.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
How did you expect success?

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Makes no sense.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
He's committed to it.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
It means nothing.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
How did you expect success?

37:47.000 --> 37:53.000
Sorry, I'm here to force yours.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
I expected it unconditionally.

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
And without honor.

38:01.000 --> 38:09.000
And I hope to be using my phone less as always in 2023.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Heck yeah.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
Drop your skin care routine, King.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Sarah Vita cleans the shit.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Moisturizer all around.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Under eye cream.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
A little bit of vitamin C serum.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
That's how you go.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
You guys are all around.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
All around.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
All around.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
And then I'm all around.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
And then I'm here.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
What about a sensual resolution, right?

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
So something, well, way that you want to experience.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Light.

38:42.000 --> 38:48.000
You don't want to see here taste or feel anything new in the next year.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
Asked and answered.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
Wow.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Okay.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Um.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
Anybody want to know how I expected success?

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Sure.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
We heard it 52 times this year.

39:10.000 --> 39:15.000
Does anybody want to know how I expected success?

39:15.000 --> 39:20.000
Or do you all not care about how I was expecting it?

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
I think, you know, I was living in New York at the beginning of the year.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
I don't know what else to say.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
And then I made the decision to come back to LA.

39:32.000 --> 39:37.000
And it paid dividends.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
You know, professionally and personally.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
Sexually and sensually.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Real T-wise too.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
I had to move.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
I got kicked out of my old home.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Really.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
It was more than a house.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
It was.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
It was made over the past two and a half years into a home.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
You know, a home base.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Um.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
A comfort haven for the road slash ages.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
But ultimately it never was on the road.

40:05.000 --> 40:11.000
It was because that was where I would return to after a hard day's work.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Um.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
And that's obviously jarring.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
You know what I mean?

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
You get COVID.

40:18.000 --> 40:23.000
And the day you test negative, you have to move boxes upon boxes upon boxes.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
Like that can't help but shake things up for the better.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
And now I live in a canyon.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
And the walls that hug me.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
Each and every morning noon and Eve.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
In part there wisdom.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
In part there.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Honestly.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Joy.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
On to me.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
And I can't help but feel like.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
It's.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Going to leave just some kind of.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Positive growth.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
And that's why I'm expecting success.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Uh.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Next year.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Uh.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
You have such an opportunity.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Perfect.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
It was done.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
It was.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
It was done.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
You were done.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
And the violin goes.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
And.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
The.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
Not.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
And.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
30 minutes.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
So tight.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
30.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
He's done.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
And.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
We're on our fifth.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Um.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
And a resolution for next year.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
Is.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I want to do a couple of live shows of this show.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
I don't care who's on them.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
The biggest obstacle with those is going to be getting.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
I'm here in Marika.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
I want to go anywhere.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
But.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Uh.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
You know, I think last week's episode with Billy Ska Fury.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Uh.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
And Corey Lane.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Alex Burkeman and Marika.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Uh.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
If anything, it proved.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
The only to be.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Yeah.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
Not only to be a hit, but to.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
Serve as an example of an episode, which was a.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
A hit.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
A banger.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
That doesn't need anyone, frankly, that works.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
The network on it.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
And.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
Um.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
So yeah, I'm excited to do a show in L.A.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Maybe in San Francisco.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
Maybe in Big Sur.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Maybe in New York.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Maybe I have gone podcast tour.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
I love to make it happen.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
But at the very least in L.A. show.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
And in that regard, I am.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
True to my word.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Good.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Wrap it up.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
This is crazy.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
This is mental.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
This is a big.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Sir.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
In that regard.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
I'm sure you were.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Wrap it up.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Dude.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
It's been like five minutes of just you.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Uh.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Your van.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
Um.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
And camping.

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
I really want to do a show at the Henry Miller Library in Big Sur.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Because they have this outdoor amphitheater.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
I was talking to Danny in case he about this yesterday.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
Uh, they have this outdoor scrolling so much, right?

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
They have this outdoor amphitheater in the woods next to the library.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
That like a bunch of like old folk bands have played that.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Can't really cool.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
It's really.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
It's really.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
It's really.

43:05.000 --> 43:10.000
And Danny was like, if a tree falls.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
So I think it'd be funny if like eight people show up.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
But we still do a full episode.

43:16.000 --> 43:22.000
Um, and you know, a big part of the idea of doing that tour or even just one show in L.A.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
is what keeps me going.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
You know, it's not just the audience reaction on a weekly basis.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
It's also the goals that I have set for the show, right?

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
And, uh, if you don't have something to aim for, uh,

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
I think you'll fall for anything.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
And, uh, that's a big reason too.

43:38.000 --> 43:43.000
I think I try to use this platform to encourage people to be their best selves.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
You know, I don't try to squash anyone down on this.

43:45.000 --> 43:50.000
I try to lift people up to experience joy.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
And to be wise, uh, and on that note,

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
I'd also like to release some limited edition headgun podcast merch.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
So that's all I'll say.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
What?

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
That's all I'll say.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
So, now must stay to you.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Now must stay to yours.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
And now must stay on the beat.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
Uh, so a couple more things, uh,

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
the ways that I've changed this year have also been

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
concurrent with the changing landscape of media.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
I would say, right?

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
So like, we've been in the podcast game for a minute.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
I don't know what else to say.

44:26.000 --> 44:32.000
And, uh, with that comes a certain adaptability to not only the show itself,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
as it goes and grows through time,

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
but also normal conversation, right?

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
So I'll be at like 4100 bar and like talking to a stranger.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
And I know how to hold my own now more than I ever did,

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
because of the conversations that we share on this platform.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
Because of the ways that we all listen to each other.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
It's this ping pong dialogue back and forth.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
And, you know, I can't help but use that to put other people on

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
notice.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
I'm coming for your head, Conan.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
I'm coming for your head.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
Scott Ockerman.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
I'm coming for your head.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
Ball off Tompkins.

45:04.000 --> 45:09.000
This time next year, the show is going to be the biggest show on spot.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
I can hold.

45:10.000 --> 45:16.000
And, um, if there's one last thing that I can impart onto

45:16.000 --> 45:33.000
the, I guess it would be go out and in 2023, spread joy, legs, and libel.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
I have a heart out in three minutes as a heads up.

45:36.000 --> 45:43.000
I have a heart on in two.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
I didn't want to mention the heart out,

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
just talk for 11 minutes.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
Here we go.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
Um, that was all I had to say.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
At Jeffery James on Instagram, at Jeffery and Twitter,

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
I'm going to head out, but y'all, you can plug you guys a

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
stuff.

45:56.000 --> 46:01.000
James out.

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
Terrible ending.

46:05.000 --> 46:23.000
That was a hit dumb original.

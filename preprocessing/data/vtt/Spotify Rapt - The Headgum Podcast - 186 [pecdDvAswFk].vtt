00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
How does him Jeff wear headphones?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
She's the engineer.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
What I guess is that I can first of all, I can't hear, yeah, I can't hear the sound effects whatsoever.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
These cameras, we've got two of them.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Hold on, I have so many questions.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
And I don't mind it.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
You didn't reset the cameras.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
It didn't reset the cameras.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
He's not listening to the audio recording.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
The headphones are right outside.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
I can go get them.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
I think you probably should.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
If y'all could just kind of steer the ship while I'm doing it.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Do you want me to fix the cameras?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
You're a host of the fucking pit.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Well, why don't you take over.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
We can do what you know what we should do.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Are all the mics on, even?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
All the mics are on.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah, I'm hearing y'all.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
No, you're not hearing, you're not hearing anything.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I'm hearing all four of them.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
He's hearing us in the room.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
He's not hearing us in the room.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
He's hearing us in the room.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Right, yes, but I'm getting levels on everything.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
The only thing is that you're hearing really loud.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Like is it sounds that are bad?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Well, you need a monitor.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Who's three?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
That's you, Ali.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
I guess so.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Yeah, say something.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
All right.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
No, not for levels.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Like say something awesome.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Say something awesome.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm talking to you.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Jeff, is your mic then?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Because I can barely hear you.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
My mic is on.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
We're getting some good ass levels on my shit.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
How can you tell if you're.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Because I didn't know.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
It's hard.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Why are we going to love it?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
It's like a loafing for him.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Last, on well, on the episode.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
It's kind of like how some people can visualize color.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
He's in his deja.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
That's it with the audio.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Jeff, I always thought you were like, Lord.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
The Lord.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Lord musician or Ryan.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
I know.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Hello, our DE.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Our God and save you.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
I always thought you were like a little Lord.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Like someone was a little bit of far quiet.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
A little bit of Lord.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I don't know what.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Everyone else seems to have that Friday feeling other than me.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
I'm riding levels.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
I'm making sure the tech is not falling off the rail.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
You're not.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
You're not.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
You're not.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
You're not.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
You're not.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
You're not.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
You can't see on your whatsoever.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
So what's this?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
What are the three cameras showing, right?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
We have.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Camera one is on you and Casey.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Okay, great.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
It's tilted at an angle.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
God.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Just style.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Camera two is all alley everything.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Yeah.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
So it's going to be.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
And there's a little bit of on you, but it is mostly alley.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
And then camera three is also alley focused.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
But on you's in it because she's kind of squirming.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Is your camera on?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
My camera's on.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
I'm not really coming through in visual stereo.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I kind of look like garbage today.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
That doesn't have to do with the GoPro.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
I think.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
You have nothing to do with my happiness.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I think.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Talk amongst yourselves.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
You're going to keep me off camera.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
No, I'm about to adjust the cameras.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Okay.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
But I need y'all.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
I think we should do a fucking Casey's brothers because

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Cinematic music emotional.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
We have Adam Connovers notes here.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
I was wondering what that was.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
All right.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Here we go.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
This is a Casey's brothers.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Oh, like X the cameras.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
You know.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
What?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Traffic.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Guys, let me do my brothers please.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah, you can do it about Jeff.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
No, this is Casey's.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
So he just talks uninterrupted.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
But yours is about traffic.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Traffic is so bad.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
It's a different angle.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
He's going to say that it's fine or something.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Traffic.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Well, let me get to it.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Here he says.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Traffic is bad.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
This time of year specifically.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Interesting.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Like, it's, I don't know what it is about Los Angeles,

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
but when the, when the, when the days get shorter.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Yeah.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
This angle.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
What is this?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Cover by a bag.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
The teleprompter?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Cover by a bag.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
As we call it in the industry.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
The traffic is bad.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Like, like worse than the usual around.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Uh, the sunset.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
And it's always, I notice in LA.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
It's always between, like, Thanksgiving and, like,

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
The music is so loud and you're so quiet.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
And then, well, not to the listener.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I feel like I'm in a spot.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
And you're talking in the next room about traffic.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Just trying to, like, brothers that.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I need an ask to do these brothers.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
When you said sunset, you mean the street or the time of day.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Oh.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Sunset.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Sunset.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Sunset.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
It's awful.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
There's a last place I want to play.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
You guys.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Fuck Mary kills.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Sunrise sunset.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Hi, noon.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Oh, it's just a kill.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Hi, noon.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Easily kill.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Easy.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Okay.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
That's fair.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
That's the worst lighting.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
It's the hottest part of the day.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
I wish I could hear what you said.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
But I can only hear the music.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Oh, the music is still going here.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Headphones off.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
I'm moving.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
I'm such a role follower.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
I won't do it.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
He'll high noon.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Yeah.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
The lighting is the worst.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
It's the hottest part of the day.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
That's correct.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Mary Sunrise.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
That's right.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
And fuck it sunset.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Fuck it sunset.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Funggy.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Sunrise is crazy.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Not only.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Or too early.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Exactly.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
That's why I would honestly kill Sunrise.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
I'm killing Sunrise too.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Yeah.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Yeah.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
I don't want to be.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
That's like.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
If you're leaving a heart.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
It's bad.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
And if you're.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
I'm.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
I'm.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
I.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
I.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
I.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
I.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
I.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
I.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
I.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
I.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
You're basically inside of.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
It's.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Well, I knew.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Yeah.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Yeah.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Exactly.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
It's more of a metaphor.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
That's on the film.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
I might.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Yeah.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
See if I could get.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
I haven't seen it in a while.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Sort of.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Don't.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
That's where the guy is.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
I feel like.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
There's guys coming.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
We got to protect the town.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
And then like.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
All I remember is.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
There's no one.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
This is the episode yet.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
This is been.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
It's.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Yes.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
It's.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
It's.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
It's.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
It's.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Not even.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
In.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
This has been literally zero.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
This is.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Yeah.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Mosted by.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Tony's.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Tony's.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Case.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
You.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
I don't care to be associated with the worst.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
But this program has ever been.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Tried.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Pile.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Tried being.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Andrew.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.640
Venon has, is the series called worst episode ever?

06:40.640 --> 06:42.800
One through six.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.240
She doesn't deserve.

06:44.240 --> 06:50.120
Um, can I debut a new sound for y'all?

06:50.120 --> 06:51.360
Oh, okay, I get it.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.200
Okay, here we go.

06:52.200 --> 06:52.720
Are you guys ready?

06:52.720 --> 06:54.240
My ears are my instrument.

06:54.240 --> 06:55.240
Okay.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.560
They're my livelihood.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.920
Oh, that's me saying what's that.

07:01.920 --> 07:02.760
Oh my god.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.480
Yeah, that's from what that's what.

07:05.480 --> 07:08.040
She just has a star stroke.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.680
Wait, is that really you?

07:10.680 --> 07:13.480
It felt like ventrican.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.080
Should we try, should we try that?

07:16.080 --> 07:17.320
Yeah, Melda.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.080
But I don't know what he's doing.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.040
Well, shouldn't it be my mouth?

07:19.040 --> 07:20.520
Because it's not supposed to come out like that.

07:20.520 --> 07:23.560
Hey, you shouldn't be mangled.

07:23.560 --> 07:26.560
It gives all of her spotlight for once.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.520
Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with you.

07:29.520 --> 07:30.360
Sorry.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.360
I just...

07:32.440 --> 07:34.440
We got into a whole conversation earlier

07:34.440 --> 07:37.040
while we were like testing, testing for the,

07:37.040 --> 07:40.280
the Mario Kart live stream, where you were like,

07:40.280 --> 07:41.960
we'll have happened weeks ago at this time.

07:41.960 --> 07:42.960
Yeah, like four weeks ago.

07:42.960 --> 07:45.440
And you were like, do people respect me as a boss?

07:45.440 --> 07:46.600
We all led you.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.920
And, uh, we'd like to meet myself.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.120
Well, come on.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.720
If you want to say what really happened.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.280
Yeah.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.360
Over Slack, you asked us in a group chat

07:55.360 --> 07:57.800
if we respect you as a boss and then when I answered you,

07:57.800 --> 08:00.120
you edited what the question was.

08:00.120 --> 08:00.800
Oh, that's right.

08:01.760 --> 08:04.560
So I said, you guys respect me as a boss.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.360
And then you said, in what way?

08:06.360 --> 08:07.040
Yeah.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.040
And then I edited my question to just say,

08:09.040 --> 08:09.680
good night.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.720
And then I responded in what way.

08:11.720 --> 08:12.880
So it was kind of weird.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.200
Did anybody see it before?

08:14.200 --> 08:15.200
Not.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.520
Allian, I saw it, yeah.

08:16.520 --> 08:17.480
We all saw it at the world.

08:17.480 --> 08:18.040
The original question too.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.160
It just didn't make any sense.

08:19.160 --> 08:19.920
I was diagnosed.

08:19.920 --> 08:20.920
Yeah.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.440
Oh, what you didn't see the question?

08:22.440 --> 08:24.040
I didn't see it until it was edited.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.840
So it said, good night in what way.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.080
I was like, well, this is the first you're finding out

08:28.080 --> 08:28.920
about this.

08:28.920 --> 08:29.920
That's what you have.

08:31.120 --> 08:31.640
Yeah.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.440
You guys remember the folders in your mouth?

08:35.440 --> 08:36.440
Has the show started?

08:36.440 --> 08:37.960
This is it.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.200
This has been it.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.160
This will be it.

08:40.160 --> 08:40.840
There was a case.

08:40.840 --> 08:41.360
He's brothers.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.720
There was me setting up the cameras,

08:42.720 --> 08:46.360
which at this point has become canon, right?

08:46.360 --> 08:49.720
That folder song is legitimately one of the best songs

08:49.720 --> 08:51.960
of like the 80s or 90s or whenever it came out.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.200
And it was like a full commercial, like minute,

08:54.200 --> 08:55.920
minute and a half version of the song.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.680
That really sounds like a radio hit.

08:58.680 --> 09:01.200
And it was just an added jingle for coffee.

09:01.200 --> 09:01.560
OK.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.560
And let's go to our radio correspondent,

09:03.560 --> 09:06.240
on your kind of sky or rather on your zero.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.760
Is it good radio or was that kind of free of what I

09:08.760 --> 09:10.920
would consider the cinema of radio?

09:10.920 --> 09:12.920
Ultimately, it was not alive for whatever when you're talking.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.640
Yeah, can you do folders?

09:14.640 --> 09:15.600
Yeah, you were on.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.200
Yeah.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.600
You guys are on part of what it is.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.200
I know the song.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.440
I've never heard a full version of it.

09:19.440 --> 09:20.560
Folders in your clothes.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.360
Yeah, there's like a first.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.200
You're full.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.800
And today, I have a wake up.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.160
Are we going to talk about the folders

09:26.160 --> 09:27.000
in your clothes commercial?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.840
Well, the folders, the folders girl.

09:28.840 --> 09:29.600
That's right.

09:29.600 --> 09:30.200
She died.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.040
Manson.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.160
Murderer.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.160
Oh, my god.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.160
Oh, my god.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.360
Yeah, that's great.

09:36.360 --> 09:36.960
Wait.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.360
I'm not seeing.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.600
It's not a new app.

09:39.600 --> 09:40.840
It's a 46 seconds.

09:40.840 --> 09:41.760
OK, 46 seconds.

09:41.760 --> 09:42.760
OK, here we go.

09:42.760 --> 09:43.520
Longer than a couple.

09:43.520 --> 09:43.760
Oh, wait.

09:43.760 --> 09:44.280
Listen to this.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.480
Yeah.

09:45.480 --> 09:46.280
Tell me if you like this.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.520
It includes this beeping for some reason.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.520
The guy waking you up.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.800
Is this like an amber alert?

09:52.800 --> 09:53.800
Yeah.

09:53.800 --> 09:54.520
Should we be back?

09:54.640 --> 09:55.160
Soft.

10:02.940 --> 10:04.840
The bestこと we can have.

10:04.840 --> 10:05.800
It's the duo.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.900
The right thing is.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.380
The mandony rum are always coming.

10:11.380 --> 10:11.920
Reward.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.720
The best part of what's up with you.

10:15.720 --> 10:20.040
It's photos in your, and now I'm writing happy new ideas.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.040
What year is this?

10:23.040 --> 10:27.040
It looks like the 90s 90s. Is this pentatonic?

10:38.040 --> 10:41.040
That wasn't that great? I've never seen you respond to music like that.

10:42.040 --> 10:45.040
It's like pentatonic. It's a 1998, by the way.

10:46.040 --> 10:49.040
There's an album. It's a 30 second version.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.040
It's so fucked up.

10:50.040 --> 10:53.040
It's the Carmen San Diego. Is that who's saying Carmen San Diego?

10:53.040 --> 10:54.040
Yeah, the sucks.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.040
Oh, is it the same guy?

10:57.040 --> 10:58.040
It's the same song.

10:58.040 --> 11:01.040
It's just a 30 second version of it for the captain.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.040
Can you play a...

11:03.040 --> 11:06.040
Jeff, can you play the Carmen San Diego theme song?

11:07.040 --> 11:09.040
And then I guess the chillies would be alright after that.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.040
Yeah, then we could do chillies with it.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.040
These are the people that did the Carmen San Diego.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.040
And then, and then Sullivan Otto.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.040
The Carmen San Diego game show, right?

11:16.040 --> 11:18.040
The game show theme song.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.040
That's like...

11:20.040 --> 11:21.040
Jeff, here's a question.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.040
No pentatonic's is the only...

11:25.040 --> 11:26.040
Oh my God.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.040
Yeah, there we go. Good transition.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.040
Yeah.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.040
And then, did it say who's sing this?

11:29.040 --> 11:30.040
What's that?

11:30.040 --> 11:31.040
Did it say who's sing this?

11:31.040 --> 11:34.040
This is where in the world this Carmen San Diego is a band of the aquatologists.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.040
Yeah, is it the Folgers 4?

11:36.040 --> 11:37.040
Is it the Folgers 4?

11:38.040 --> 11:39.040
Who's singing this?

11:39.040 --> 11:40.040
I don't fucking know.

11:40.040 --> 11:43.040
It doesn't join at me's music channels.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.040
Show it out.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.040
And the description.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.040
It's the South Bay groovy system.

11:52.040 --> 11:53.040
I don't like it.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.040
This is really good.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.040
I think he's right.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.040
It sounds like a South Bay.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.040
Should we get it?

11:58.040 --> 11:59.040
I can't hear you.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.040
I can't hear you.

12:00.040 --> 12:02.040
I can't hear you.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.040
Have you seen the Christmas Folgers commercial?

12:04.040 --> 12:05.040
Sounds like your fist.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.040
I think it looks like a flower.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.040
That's your point.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.040
This is getting like anything in your saying.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.040
What's that?

12:10.040 --> 12:15.040
You said play the Folgers Carmen San Diego.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.040
That's what we're doing.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.040
This is you.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.040
I can't say that.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.040
This might be part of your druthers.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.040
You've had to eat that fucking.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.040
Oh my God.

12:23.040 --> 12:26.040
Did you play this video?

12:26.040 --> 12:27.040
What can you do then?

12:27.040 --> 12:28.040
I did.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.040
I did.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.040
Did you ever watch this show?

12:31.040 --> 12:32.040
This is the game show?

12:35.040 --> 12:38.040
Did you find a new level to make it louder?

12:38.040 --> 12:41.040
Did you find a new level to make it louder?

12:41.040 --> 12:43.040
Did you find a new loudness level?

12:46.040 --> 12:48.040
I'll not open.

12:48.040 --> 12:51.040
Why is this so long?

12:51.040 --> 12:53.040
I've been done with this for a while.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.040
I'll probably.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.040
It's the group.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.040
Carmen San Diego.

12:59.040 --> 13:02.040
So many things I can be doing right now.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.040
We have another minute.

13:04.040 --> 13:06.040
The three-minute song.

13:06.040 --> 13:08.040
It's a radio edit.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.040
It's a radio free edit.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.040
You can turn it off.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.040
You can switch it off.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.040
I look like you're at it.

13:13.040 --> 13:15.040
It's a TV show theme song.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.040
It hasn't even started.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.040
You can turn it off.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.040
You can turn it off.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.040
It's a TV show.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.040
You can turn it off.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.040
It's a TV show theme song.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.040
It hasn't even started.

13:25.040 --> 13:31.040
But you're playing another song underneath this?

13:31.040 --> 13:33.040
There's a nice fade out there, I guess.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.040
But what a waste of all of our time.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.040
That was Cassie's idea.

13:37.040 --> 13:42.040
Anyways, the Folder's Christmas commercial,

13:42.040 --> 13:44.040
no one's picking up on this.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.040
So the Folder's theme song,

13:45.040 --> 13:48.040
when I was looking it up, was written in 84.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.040
So that maybe that commercial?

13:49.040 --> 13:50.040
Maybe that commercial.

13:50.040 --> 13:52.040
I added this emotional soundtrack back in

13:52.040 --> 13:54.040
because this has to be still part of Cassie's brothers.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.040
So wrap it up.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.040
Otherwise that was all a waste of time.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.040
So far he's just said that traffic is bad.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.040
Traffic is bad.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.040
That sunset on sunset.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.040
That sunset on sunset.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.040
Where the the brother comes home from

14:07.040 --> 14:09.040
from the 90s as well.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.040
From like the Peace Corps.

14:10.040 --> 14:14.040
And his sister greets him.

14:14.040 --> 14:17.040
You guys don't know the commercial I'm talking about.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.040
I think so.

14:18.040 --> 14:19.040
You guys should watch it.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.040
It's the Folder's Christmas commercial

14:21.040 --> 14:22.040
that was like really missed cast.

14:22.040 --> 14:25.040
Like they cast the brother in the sister to close an age.

14:25.040 --> 14:29.040
So when when they come home and they have this like emotional reunion.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.040
Over a cup of coffee.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.040
It's extremely sexy.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.040
Yeah.

14:32.040 --> 14:33.040
It was a romantic.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.040
Yeah.

14:34.040 --> 14:37.040
I do have to bring up that because you said casting.

14:37.040 --> 14:40.040
Casey has a feature like movie that is in development.

14:40.040 --> 14:48.040
I do have to bring this up because you said casting.

14:49.040 --> 14:53.040
I just had one question about the casting process for your movie.

14:53.040 --> 14:58.040
I just had one question about the casting process for your movie.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.040
A audition still open.

14:59.040 --> 15:03.040
Is it going to be the traditional you know like bringing in a casting director?

15:03.040 --> 15:05.040
There's a mostly like personal connections.

15:05.040 --> 15:07.040
Like anybody could just sort of submit.

15:07.040 --> 15:12.040
Who's going to say or is it mostly like more like an Indian cast where it's like.

15:12.040 --> 15:15.040
Each role is regard to like what you know the total.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.040
You know the total.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.040
I'm not a million exactly.

15:17.040 --> 15:19.040
The cast system of Hinduism.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.040
Oh.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.040
A cast system.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.040
Yeah.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.040
Exactly.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.040
What's the casting system for your movie?

15:25.040 --> 15:26.040
The cast system.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.040
Or is it through like.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.040
You know.

15:28.040 --> 15:30.040
Genie McCarthy or something.

15:30.040 --> 15:32.040
McCarthy Abelera.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.040
We're still figuring it out.

15:34.040 --> 15:37.040
But we have having considered a cast system.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.040
You have not considered that.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.040
No.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.040
But it's something to consider.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.040
It does because I feel like.

15:43.040 --> 15:46.040
Listen, all the rage in Hollywood right now is like, Oh, diverse.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.040
You know, which is racist in a way in itself.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.040
Sure.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.040
Look at it that way.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.040
But if you're going to, you might as well do it like, you know.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.040
Quarter.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.040
So I should have like a prince in the movie.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.040
I really don't think he's understanding what I'm saying.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.040
Everyone else gets it.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.040
You want to be in the movie.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.040
It seems like that's exactly right.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.040
Is there a character similar to Jeff's?

16:04.040 --> 16:05.040
Anything.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.040
Yeah.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.040
His status in our company.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.040
They can be duity long hair.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.040
Yeah.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.040
I could play.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.040
I could play like a footstool to you on set.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.040
Imagine it.

16:14.040 --> 16:18.040
Imagine if Casey's movie ended up kind of as a ballie would hit.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.040
That'd be amazing.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.040
Like that.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.040
I don't even know how we would even get there.

16:22.040 --> 16:25.040
Because I don't know like musical numbers.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.040
Yeah.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.040
Folders.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.040
The song.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.040
Yeah.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.040
The good thing is when you cast enough.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.040
Good point.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.040
Yeah.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.040
Brown people are going to do that.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.040
Oh, my God.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.040
Poor.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.040
Do you like a pillow, right?

16:36.040 --> 16:37.040
What's that?

16:37.040 --> 16:38.040
You appreciate that.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.040
That's what you got.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.040
Fultre seemed to be in the song on an Acapella level.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.040
What's that?

16:42.040 --> 16:43.040
That's good.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.040
That's really good.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.040
I did Acapella in high school.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.040
Oh, that was the group called.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.040
The US males.

16:48.040 --> 17:05.040
This show is sponsored by Better Help.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.040
Guys.

17:06.040 --> 17:12.040
guys, sometimes you want to keep the same things about yourself, the same kind of tenants

17:12.040 --> 17:17.640
in your life as we get into the new year, right? Where are you already crushing it? You know,

17:17.640 --> 17:21.720
the opposite of New Year, New Year, New Year's, you know, around New Year's, we got obsessed

17:21.720 --> 17:26.200
with how to change ourselves, you know? Instead of just expanding on what we're already doing

17:26.200 --> 17:31.240
right, what good habits we already have in place. Maybe you finally organized one part of your

17:31.240 --> 17:35.080
space, right? And you want to tackle another, just keep that momentum going. You don't

17:35.080 --> 17:39.960
mean you have the fully change who you are, or maybe you've been taking your supplements every

17:39.960 --> 17:44.360
morning and now you actually want to eat breakfast too, not just take pills and supplements.

17:44.360 --> 17:49.880
That's where therapy can help you find your strengths. So you can ditch the extreme resolutions and just

17:49.880 --> 17:54.360
make changes that really stick. I'm in therapy twice a week and as we head into this new year,

17:54.360 --> 17:58.200
I'm definitely going to be having to fight the urge to completely change everything in my life and

17:58.200 --> 18:02.200
rather just like figure out what's working and build upon that, rather than starting from scratch.

18:02.200 --> 18:06.520

18:35.960 --> 18:43.240
had a hard time finding new or curated music. And you're interested in multiple perspectives on

18:43.240 --> 18:49.640
relationships, dating, music, etc. And because of all that, I have the perfect podcast for you.

18:49.640 --> 18:55.080
It's called See the Thing is, a podcast hosted by Grammy Award-winning R&B artist Bridget Kelly

and Media Personality and Podcast Trailblazer Mandy Bee. Twice a week, Bridget and Mandy have

19:00.040 --> 19:05.640
nostalgic conversations in their grown segments, political pop culture conversations in their honest

19:05.640 --> 19:12.520
segments, and relationship hot take conversations in the slightly toxic segment. The opinions on

19:12.520 --> 19:16.680
the show are real and brought to you by the genuine connections that the ladies have with their guests

19:16.680 --> 19:20.600
to they like to call their friends with benefits. Each week you'll leave with some new music

19:20.600 --> 19:25.160
recommendations or a curated playlist that you didn't even know you needed in their freshly squeezed

19:25.160 --> 19:30.440

19:51.960 --> 19:56.360

The movie is called, yeah. I'm not going to get into the details on the movie. Okay.

20:04.680 --> 20:09.720
You don't have to do that. I do have a roll for you. Okay, and is it? It's a PA to the

20:09.720 --> 20:13.000
PA. That's what I was going to say. Is it like a personal assistant to a PA?

20:13.000 --> 20:19.720
Oh, this is a German. It is. It's a dry, I'm a teamster. I have to pay union fees to start being a teamster.

20:19.720 --> 20:23.000
Hey, come on. Hey, come on. What's that? As an actor, you mean?

20:25.000 --> 20:30.120
Well, we'll work our way there. I need to see if we'll first learn my offense to this. He's going to be

20:30.120 --> 20:36.760
one of those PA's that pays to be on set. You know, it's how people work their way. It's an unpaid

20:36.760 --> 20:41.960
internship. No, it's unpaid. Yeah, I'm not paying you, but you are going to have to pay me.

20:42.680 --> 20:46.440
Right. But I still have to produce it. But yeah, you'll get credit as a system to the

20:46.440 --> 20:49.240
assess. Yeah. I don't know. We're at 33 taps. You said I was going to be your

20:49.240 --> 20:52.600
assistant. That's because he was drunk off of beer. Well, you're going to be a producer on the

20:52.600 --> 20:56.200
project. Thank you. You have nothing to worry about. No, no, no, you're you're a full

20:56.200 --> 21:03.480
flood. Does she have to do anything for that? I switched cameras to the wrong one. I don't know.

21:03.480 --> 21:06.840
Jeff has some experience under his body. He was on the neighborhood.

21:06.840 --> 21:11.160
Nobody ever gives a shit about that. I remember that. You were on a, I remember that.

21:11.160 --> 21:16.840
Shut up. Come on. You just because you're in the commercial, right? Or you are in the neighbor.

Cell as a mean. You know how to be a production system. You mean like literally in the

21:20.680 --> 21:24.200
neighborhood? No, I just because you're like kind of around here. Yeah, just because you're around.

21:24.200 --> 21:28.600
Oh, yeah. Let's down. Let's see. Yeah. I just was around. Yeah. Well, hey, hang out

21:28.600 --> 21:34.520

21:34.520 --> 21:38.200
to me yesterday. I'm sorry. And then we'll get to what Alex had because he was gassing me up.

21:40.200 --> 21:45.720
What is going to be beefed out because I was like, which on you said, hey, can you update your

21:45.720 --> 21:52.440
address in the gum ball system for us to send you shit? When I did just say to Brad and this is a

21:52.440 --> 21:57.000
brag that I was like, have the brand stop sending me shit. I'll just lie. Yeah.

21:57.000 --> 22:04.280
Humble bread. Come on. Sorry. So was that why you just wanted to know where I lived so you could

22:04.280 --> 22:09.160
you could dox my answer again? Can I say something honestly? You may not. Didn't look gum ball,

22:09.160 --> 22:13.400
but you told me that's where you live. Oh, I'll go. What is this? It's fine. I know where you

22:13.400 --> 22:19.400
was. The name was. What? I know where you live. You live on a grudel Avenue. No, you keep making

22:19.480 --> 22:31.560
up. You were saying that I'm a ton of experience. I don't know. No, I'm a little more neutral.

22:35.560 --> 22:46.120
They're all going to laugh at you. From. Yeah. I'm here. Dye Coke Brothers. Oh, my god. Call me a mere zero.

22:46.680 --> 22:52.360
I'm having a Coke zero. Yeah. No, that's a guy. Call me Dye at a mere. Why? Because I'm, yes,

22:52.360 --> 22:58.360
sort of the worst version of you. Joke at the app so far.

23:06.840 --> 23:12.040
Bond the week is Oscar the Grout. Oh, you don't ask us anymore. You just decide. Bond the

23:12.120 --> 23:20.600
week. Oh, come on. Beyond the trash. What's that? Beyond great joy. That's not bad.

23:20.600 --> 23:25.880
That's good. Yeah. All right. That's good. That's like, I like that.

23:25.880 --> 23:28.040
I like that. Like I'm going to.

23:28.920 --> 23:36.360
Per week of the draft. Hey. Hey. Hey. What's with this whole like international

23:36.440 --> 23:42.440
referendum on fossil fuse fuse. You want to take that again? Take that again.

23:42.440 --> 23:46.680
What's with this like international like a sudden a version of fossil fuels climate change?

23:47.880 --> 23:55.880
Really? It's like the, yeah. The polar caps are melting. Yeah. Yeah. Is this leading? Irversible

23:55.880 --> 24:02.040
damages that were. Yeah. Irversible like Irver. No irreversible like we are hurtling towards

24:02.760 --> 24:09.400
dilemma slash. A burning burning or I got my face zapped by a rod.

24:09.400 --> 24:13.800
There you two and a half hours ago. So excuse me if I say Irver,

24:13.800 --> 24:21.000
Irversible like a taser like a rod. So it's like you have to run a cat prod on my

24:21.000 --> 24:26.440
fucking eyelids, by the way. Can you imagine it's just like I got taser. I can't imagine.

24:26.440 --> 24:29.960
Show it up. You always show up flustered and we never know why. And if you got taser,

24:30.920 --> 24:37.880
excuse me. This is my eye doctor with Zac Efron. Did he create this procedure? Is it like

24:37.880 --> 24:43.640
procedure that everybody does? And he's one of the few people that can. The machine costs according

24:43.640 --> 24:49.240
to Arthur a quarter million dollars. Very Russian. The nurse Bella Russian. Interesting. So.

24:49.240 --> 24:58.680
And did your doctor give you any fun tidbits about Zac? He doesn't like to disclose who he works with

24:58.680 --> 25:02.760
or what they said or anything, but he does have kind of a wall of fame with all the celebrities

25:02.760 --> 25:07.160
that we worked on. Okay. So he does respect? No. Confidentiality. Does he know you host this podcast?

25:07.160 --> 25:12.600
Yes. He actually took a picture of the picture and said on the internet that he went to that doctor.

25:12.600 --> 25:17.960
I, well, here's what, here's what happened. I said, wait, what did I say? I did come up. They were like,

25:17.960 --> 25:21.240
what do you do for a living? Finally, you have been going there for three years. And he was like,

25:21.240 --> 25:24.600
what do you do for a living? And I was like, I, I don't know. I do a little bit of this, a little bit of that.

25:24.600 --> 25:28.440
He's like, what does that mean? And I was like, well, one thing I do as I host a podcast.

25:28.440 --> 25:32.520
And he was like, uh, oh, like, do people listen to it? And I was like,

25:32.520 --> 25:36.520
some. And I was like, also, I have plugged your name first and last on the show a lot.

25:36.520 --> 25:39.640
Because you're a really good eye doctor. And he's like, and then he demanded to know how many

25:39.640 --> 25:43.720
listeners we have, how many Instagram followers I have. So hopefully he did. What's that?

25:44.440 --> 25:49.000
He demanded to know. Yeah. Well, not him, but the person next to him is kind of his business.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.120
You weren't even talking to your doctor. I was talking to him and Rita and Arthur, right? Oh,

25:54.120 --> 26:00.040
very rationed. What's Arthur's last name? Or a zero. Zero is really good. Arthur's zero.

26:01.400 --> 26:06.200
But they tried to get me to post to my story that I was at the eye doctor. And I was like,

26:06.200 --> 26:12.120
that's not going to move the needle for y'all at all. No free pub. Exactly. Right. So I told

26:12.120 --> 26:17.400
we do a CTI. Yeah, you should have gotten a free zip out of it. Yeah. My CPI was cost per eye

26:17.400 --> 26:23.400
of lip of flow. So basically, I was like, for one eye, I'll do one post for two eyes. I'll do. Yeah.

26:23.480 --> 26:27.480
When you send me a screenshot of your calendar invite and it said lip of flow,

26:27.480 --> 26:31.400
I thought you were doing some sort of like cool sculpting. I did too. I did too. I did too.

26:31.400 --> 26:35.560
I like those. That's it. I like that too. There's nothing in life. I've always wanted to know.

26:37.240 --> 26:41.320
Don't look at me when you talk. I just am looking for I'm scanning everyone's eyes.

26:41.320 --> 26:46.840
Yeah, we don't want you to. No, because the issue is when you're already this shredded

26:46.840 --> 26:52.360
jacked and lean, you're malnourished. Really? Yeah. You're making thin. Oh, we did see me eat two

26:52.360 --> 26:56.600
bags of potato chips. Yeah. That's all I've had today though. Yeah. It's often all you've had today.

26:56.600 --> 27:01.800
It's often, yeah, because people make fun of me for having the baggy clothes for having the thin ass ankle.

27:01.800 --> 27:06.040
Yeah. Nobody ever talks about the masculinity. Nobody says we don't like you. See a

27:06.040 --> 27:11.320
pain. Yeah, we can't see that because of the baggy clothes. Yeah. Right. Anyway. So cool sculpting.

27:11.320 --> 27:17.240
You said, I'll make an appointment. No, don't. Linden advantage, at least I had a horrible experience.

27:17.240 --> 27:23.640
I don't do it. You guys. I won't. I won't. I won't. I thought hers was like,

27:23.640 --> 27:27.240
guys, I don't always get the best sleep, right? The show is sort of evidence of that.

27:28.040 --> 27:32.920
But if you're a long time listener, you might know that I've been drinking AG1 for about two years

27:32.920 --> 27:39.480
now and it's severely helped my sleep quality and the clarity with which I wake up in the morning.

27:39.560 --> 27:43.960
When I started drinking AG1 daily, I was living in New York, Micah showed it to me in the office

27:43.960 --> 27:48.920
and I kind of tried it just to be like, what does it taste like? And it tasted great. And I realized

27:48.920 --> 27:54.280
that I'd spent all these years spending a ton of money on various pills and vitamins and supplements

27:54.280 --> 27:59.640
in pill form where I was taking like 12 pills a day. And eventually you can't afford it or

27:59.640 --> 28:03.560
and or you just don't want to do it. You don't want to swallow that many pills every day.

28:03.560 --> 28:08.920
And that's where AG1 came in where I was getting a baseline nutritional insurance,

28:09.000 --> 28:13.240
where each day I knew I was getting my vitamin C. I knew I was getting my B vitamins. I

28:13.240 --> 28:18.680
knew I was getting my magnesium to support my immunity and my sleep and lower my stress levels,

28:18.680 --> 28:23.640
et cetera. It really does work. And that's because AG1 is a foundational nutritional supplement

28:23.640 --> 28:29.160
that supports your body's universal needs, like gut optimization, stress management and immune

28:29.160 --> 28:34.920
support, things everyone needs. Since 2010, AG1 has led the future of foundational nutrition

28:35.000 --> 28:39.720
continuously refining their formula to create a smarter, better way to elvine your baseline health.

28:40.520 --> 28:45.240
I've been telling all my friends and family to start taking it and I've even had some family

28:45.240 --> 28:48.680
members and friends start taking it and tell me that they do feel like they're more energy when

28:48.680 --> 28:53.080
they wake up, like they wake up without that sluggishness. So, you know, if that's something

28:53.080 --> 28:58.440
you value, I would definitely give AG1 a try. AG1 is the supplement that I trust to provide the

28:58.440 --> 29:02.920
support my body needs daily and that's why they've been a part of the show for so long. So,

29:02.920 --> 29:08.600

29:21.480 --> 29:25.400
Plus, it's hard. No, it was cool sculpting. Yeah, do you never recover from that, so.

29:25.400 --> 29:29.880
What's that? And we're back. We're so back and you kidding me?

29:29.880 --> 29:34.040
It does sound like you right now saying it's crazy. That's the reason it's crazy.

29:34.040 --> 29:38.680
And it probably said it. It sounds like it's in this room. That sounds like it's in this room.

29:38.680 --> 29:41.400
That's what I was going to say. Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say.

29:41.400 --> 29:44.440
I think I said it in this room. I do have some segments. Yeah. Okay.

29:44.440 --> 29:49.960
Is this episode going to come out this year? I don't think so. This is January. I think it's

29:49.960 --> 29:56.520
either December 29th or whatever Friday that is or it's the new year. So, last episode of that year

29:56.600 --> 30:00.600
or a first episode of the next year. I'm going to say something. But no mention of any of that stuff.

30:00.600 --> 30:05.320
We were booked well into January that's what I'm going to say. Wow. Like this could have been in

30:05.320 --> 30:10.360
the new year, but then Jeff can't sell the bunch of recordings. I feel like we already recorded a

30:10.360 --> 30:17.320
January 6 episode or was that earlier this year when I knew, say, for why I'm going to do

30:17.320 --> 30:21.800
you first week of January sort of a revolution. January 6. Like,

30:22.120 --> 30:27.480
I remember recording it. It's just going to be a celebration. It's just going to be a remembrance

30:27.480 --> 30:32.360
or something. And are you going to look for evidence? A lot Lady Gaga. I think I might wear

30:32.360 --> 30:40.120
meat all of her, but I might also take, yeah, action. Right. Right. You're sort of pulling it

30:40.120 --> 30:44.360
from different eras. Exactly. Right. So, I'm going to like, I'm going to kind of like,

30:44.360 --> 30:52.840
smirk and smile out of, I get it. As I walk into my house, rather, but in me, in heat,

30:54.360 --> 31:04.840
and I'm going to steal a pony impression. Okay, come on. Casey's impression of me is just goofy.

31:08.840 --> 31:11.960
There comes the time when it's too much. Are we there?

31:14.440 --> 31:20.120
Are we on the line? Whatever you were about to say is what I was going to say. What was the last

31:20.120 --> 31:28.360
audition you went on? This weekend I've auditioned for night court. Wait, you went back in time?

31:29.560 --> 31:35.560
Yeah. You look like a night court is better. After the 30-rock episode, they still brought it back.

31:36.120 --> 31:41.720
That's right. Same never. Same as what it's called. It really is something with the episode.

31:42.360 --> 31:50.360
It would be funny if your agent sent you on, like, had to make up fake auditions for you.

31:50.360 --> 31:53.480
And that's what I'm just going to be nice to him. I'm just going to be nice to him.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.640
I'm just going to be nice to him. I'm just going to be nice to him. Yeah. Really?

31:57.640 --> 32:02.680
I mean, that sounds fake, but apparently it's real. Yeah. Yeah, I'm peacock, I believe. It's like

32:02.680 --> 32:08.440
already out, like on. I think so. Yeah. I've seen commercials. Well, Jeff, I'm written for you.

32:08.520 --> 32:12.280
Here's the thing. I just want to make a ton of money. Sure. Like, what's that? Sure.

32:13.320 --> 32:17.240
There's your shirt. Sure. There's your ways to make a ton of money.

32:17.240 --> 32:18.600
Can you say what's that to himself?

32:19.640 --> 32:24.040
Setting himself up for what's that? Well, my point is, like, these show, like, you know, not a,

32:24.040 --> 32:29.400
not a, I don't want to get up. What part on my court, the judge? Docteur.

32:29.400 --> 32:36.920
Docteur? Sure. So you want to be like true detective. I want to be in a show where the

32:36.920 --> 32:41.240
residuals are thus. Like, I did that one episode of the neighborhood and it paid me,

32:41.240 --> 32:47.160
I'm going to believe this. No way. Yeah. Yeah. Every single one of you, have, okay. Yeah.

32:47.160 --> 32:51.240
That makes sense for the way he's like money as a child. That's like a day right. I'm going to cut this.

33:00.360 --> 33:01.720
Everything cool in your phone or

33:01.720 --> 33:10.120
are we, are we podcasting right now? So you know this song. Do you know this song?

33:10.120 --> 33:19.640
You're the only person here or another song. It's, it's a, they just, they just, is this the remastered version?

33:19.640 --> 33:25.400
Uh, yeah, but in 2008, were you about to say they just remastered it? Yeah. It's been

33:25.400 --> 33:31.000
15 minutes. They just put out 10. That was the replacement. It was. They just remastered 10.

33:31.000 --> 33:37.080
It sounds great. Uh, Spotify wrap. Let's fucking talk about it. I want to know what you're going to

33:37.080 --> 33:41.960
choose that song to lead us into it. That's it. Number one song. No. Really? Yeah. You know what the best

33:41.960 --> 33:46.920
fucking part of it is? It's this part. Hang on. Wait, Jeff, you're going to lose your mind. Do you know

33:46.920 --> 34:01.800
whose favorite band this is? Nick. Yeah. That's real. I love it. I can't believe it. I thought you

34:01.800 --> 34:09.080
liked the great full-dead. Exclusively. You can like a lot of music. You love it not that. Landband.

34:09.160 --> 34:19.320
Hmm. I would love to read for you, my um. Are you Dave Matthew? I got you seem like a

34:19.320 --> 34:23.720
Dave Matthew. I seem like a diver. Yeah, you seem like a diver. You like this song? The

34:23.720 --> 34:30.920
rootest thing I knew when I think ever said to me, uh, I'm not a diver. It's, yeah, I'm just

34:30.920 --> 34:36.680
all making fun of. I'm not making fun of anybody. I'm saying I'm not a diver.

34:38.280 --> 34:44.840
Take her with speak, Dave. Is this your number two song? This is his version of

34:44.840 --> 34:53.000
burning down the house, what I do like because he just kind of is that an 11 out of 10? Yeah,

34:53.080 --> 35:01.640
I bet you like that. But I'm not a diver. Allie. Yeah. Spotify wrapped.

35:03.640 --> 35:16.440
Spotify. Oh, what? Here's your bomba. Char the grains. Yeah, can everybody

35:16.440 --> 35:24.680
air drop me their raft? I don't fucking listen to Spotify. I don't. Songs. I'm my Spotify

35:24.680 --> 35:31.080
game air drop. I can't participate. I'm sorry. You have though, listen to music on Spotify this

35:31.080 --> 35:36.520
year, which means you would have a plan to air drop what? I'm a little wrapped by this segment.

35:36.520 --> 35:44.360
How do you? Allie. Allie. Yeah, I got yours. I want to be realist because I was a really

35:44.360 --> 35:48.920
good idea that air drop across the room all the day to have. I did. I did. I did. I did kind of

35:48.920 --> 35:53.160
about that. That's what's going to say. No people found here. Number four has a lot to do with you.

35:53.160 --> 36:00.760
I can't do it. Okay, I'm sending you mine. Okay. Very good. Okay, and then let's get Casey's for sure

36:00.760 --> 36:04.840
and then mirrors to boot. You're not showing up on my air drop. I think you might have blocked me

36:04.840 --> 36:11.800
as a contact. Yeah. I don't know Spotify premium, does that? Do I need that? I mean, our serious

36:11.800 --> 36:19.720
question, not no connotation. What generation are you technically? I was born in 83, so I think I'm

36:19.720 --> 36:24.920
the oldest millennial. What's tough for me is that Casey just sent me his whole playlist of your

36:24.920 --> 36:29.960
tops. Isn't that what you wanted? No, I wanted this. It's hard because I'm talking to a bunch of

36:29.960 --> 36:37.480
the millennials. Whoa, sorry. Except for you. Allie, you're Gen Z. I'm I'm Casp. I'm technically

36:37.480 --> 36:45.640
a millennial. Yeah. All right. Now I'll take that. I'll take everybody. Okay, let me try this again.

36:45.640 --> 36:52.040
Where are the raft? Thank you. Do you want my top songs or my top artists?

36:52.040 --> 36:59.320
God. Don't do that. Sorry. You both, I have a whole area. Yeah, I'm so happy. I'm only one that understands you.

36:59.320 --> 37:03.240
Yeah, the only one who's understood the assigned. Because you guys are both Gen Z.

37:03.880 --> 37:10.680
All right, I'm sorry. You might talk about this. All very, very white 40 year old. Yeah.

37:10.680 --> 37:17.800
Day Matthews. Not even. It's the what was it called? The boardwalk empire soundtrack and then

37:17.800 --> 37:23.960
a boardwalk singing quartet. And the the people who did the Folders commercial. Oh, yes,

37:23.960 --> 37:28.920
that would be number one. The Bay Area South Groover. Yeah, my top fan is like,

37:29.880 --> 37:36.920
everyone. Oh, that's why. That's why my number four is so funny. What's fucked up is that all five,

37:36.920 --> 37:41.320
all four of you guys. Sorry, the fifth one was me leaving room for Jesus Christ. The all four of

37:41.320 --> 37:46.120
you guys didn't air drop the same thing and then a mere text did me the right thing, but he texted.

37:46.120 --> 37:49.080
It's me. He didn't air drop. You're not telling us what the right thing is.

37:49.080 --> 37:54.920
Oh, I don't fucking care at first. This is my idea. And you said it was what it is.

37:54.920 --> 38:00.920
I said it was genius. I just texted you something else. Yeah. It's just fucking unbelievable.

38:00.920 --> 38:07.240
I just thought you would text us as fuck you. So, I don't know. All right, let's do up. Do up.

38:07.240 --> 38:14.840
Do all my do. The best aroma is always coming true. It should be honestly, but I let it

38:14.840 --> 38:23.160
tie a mug. Folders inside of a cup whipped cream inside of bean juice. That's how you char the

38:23.560 --> 38:28.360
foam. If you could whip from rice to coffee, I think that could be a whole new album.

38:28.360 --> 38:35.000
Oh, it's a place inside of home. That's how my number four. It's rice record first.

38:35.000 --> 38:40.440
Yeah, what about rice and then there's the bean? Because I'm going to bean juice, bean juice.

38:45.080 --> 38:50.120
All I need is a light roast, light roast. All this looks like you

38:51.080 --> 39:00.600
game to the system. I didn't. That's how it goes back off. Yeah, it is so in the cultural

39:00.600 --> 39:05.640
conversation with this. I know. You really have everything around the pulse. Yeah, I try. I'm trying.

39:05.640 --> 39:10.280
Artists are Taylor Swift. This is an order. Taylor Swift, Boy Genius, Sizzah, Chappell

39:10.280 --> 39:16.360
Rown for Phoebe Bird. That's just pretty cool. Like, what everybody think is cool music.

39:16.840 --> 39:21.960
It's almost, it is almost like you were like, what musicians do cool people think are cool to

39:21.960 --> 39:26.200
listen to. And then I thought those aren't intentional. Basically put those on over that.

39:26.200 --> 39:33.960
Yeah, I was actually, yeah, not even close to finished. Basically, I'm not jacuzziing you,

39:33.960 --> 39:39.240
but I do fear that you just put cool music on on repeat as you fell asleep.

39:39.960 --> 39:43.800
Which is what I said earlier. Is that what you said? Because I was about to say that.

39:43.960 --> 39:48.920
I said it first. And before you. Yeah. And already. And then we'll just, yeah.

39:49.720 --> 39:56.360
I feel like my answers are cooler than I'm dying to hear mirrors. I want a lot of our

39:56.360 --> 39:59.880
listeners too. This is, this will be new for me. Should we, should we hit him with an

39:59.880 --> 40:07.320
on you? Radio free, uh, radio recap show? Yeah. I'm free of some seeding as much disassociating.

40:08.200 --> 40:14.600
I always feel a fishbowl and a foul. I feel a skew. I feel off kilter. I feel like I have

40:14.600 --> 40:19.240
vertigo of the eyes and ears when you're on the show by that. Yeah, we know. Number one is Londo,

40:19.240 --> 40:24.200
right, for you. No, I thought you were reading a music. I don't know. I was like, same.

40:25.960 --> 40:30.120
While I love her, I don't think it's accurate, but that's fine. Number two is crazy for you. I know.

40:30.120 --> 40:35.320
Number two is Johann Sebastian Bach. I know. So, do you do work to him or yeah? But again,

40:35.880 --> 40:39.720
seems off. Yeah. Number three isn't even a band. It's just like a collection of people

40:39.720 --> 40:47.560
had chatting. No, it's a, um, it's like your own pop, do it. It's like a modern talking. Let's say

40:47.560 --> 40:53.880
on the same time. Three, two, one. Modern and talking also. Just modern. They're German, um,

40:53.960 --> 41:01.960
Anders and Thomas. So, uh, you're a little too European for my taste. Is that fair to say?

41:02.920 --> 41:07.480
It's not okay. Really? Just say it all. That's true. That's true.

41:07.480 --> 41:12.840
It's xenophobic. Yeah. Iraq and phobic. Because there's eight countries that don't like in

41:12.840 --> 41:19.880
Europe. And Germany and Russia are right up there. That's exactly wrong. Yeah. I mean,

41:19.880 --> 41:24.600
ultimately the biggest perpetrators. Yeah. That's not true. It's great. And ultimately,

41:24.600 --> 41:29.560
biggest perpetrators or the podcast grace are the Los Angeles. That was a really good joke.

41:30.360 --> 41:35.880
You can tell me what number four? Number four is US Marine Band. So, I don't know what that's about.

41:35.880 --> 41:41.480
That really feels like violence. Did I not show you this? No. It said it was like US Marine

41:41.480 --> 41:46.520
Band. Month, most listened to February. And I was like, oh, that's when we needed to play

41:47.080 --> 41:53.560
music in the public domain during the last year. And I think what happened was that Jake

41:53.560 --> 41:59.800
are overnight engineer left the Spotify all night. Because it somehow took the number four

41:59.800 --> 42:04.840
Spotify. Wow. So, you don't listen to Spotify that much. Or that is your, no, she does.

42:04.840 --> 42:11.480
You're just trying to group people in with your ass. This is an intervention. This is an

42:11.480 --> 42:17.080
intervention. People who use Apple music. You use Apple music. I actually don't listen to that

42:17.080 --> 42:21.480
much music. That's what you. That's what I was waiting for you to say. I usually use YouTube.

42:21.480 --> 42:27.000
Except for when I'm listening to, I don't know if you want to get to mine already,

42:27.880 --> 42:31.000
or if I'm last. We're in the middle of onions. I don't know why you're trying to listen to it.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.400
Yeah. Respect here as a boss. I'm sorry. I got some names wrong. Modern

42:35.400 --> 42:39.000
talking is Dieter Bolin and Thomas Anderson. I feel like I need to put respect on their names.

42:39.240 --> 42:43.640
Yeah. I'm really sorry. Thank God. Again, it is important to

42:43.640 --> 42:48.280
number five and sleep with Mac. Yeah. You can burn your own child. What you're going to

42:48.280 --> 42:55.720
don't think is right. Like these are not my top songs or more accurate because it's your

42:55.720 --> 43:02.520
own experience. I think that we are not brain-tops Spotify artists is a bomb a race. The soy

43:02.520 --> 43:06.440
like a glob. I completely agree with you. Mine has never felt true to me.

43:06.440 --> 43:11.640
I saw this guy on a bar. Excuse me, Jeff, we're talking. Sorry. I will give you adults our talk.

43:11.640 --> 43:15.960
Jeff, if you could for a second. I saw a guy on TikTok post how he still has his last

43:15.960 --> 43:21.720
FM account linked and then he was like, they don't run up. That I believe that. However, I will say

43:21.720 --> 43:27.320
the most important part of this whole conversation is that it will have it's airing about

43:27.320 --> 43:31.160
a month to a month and a half after every, but he's done talking about their Spotify right?

43:31.160 --> 43:36.280
We're already working hard on our 224 ramps. No one's going to find this interesting

43:36.280 --> 43:40.120
at all. A lot of people. But I didn't think the US Marine Band one was relevant to you, Jeff.

43:40.120 --> 43:43.320
I thought you would like that, but you didn't react at all. I don't remember that at all because

43:43.320 --> 43:47.480
that whole thing was kind of a 24 hour dissociative episode for me. That's at me a year long spiral.

43:48.600 --> 43:53.960
What am you? We are starting a new one right now, which is right. I'm so nervous to come

43:53.960 --> 43:59.960
in for the Mario Kart. 48 hours. I do think 48 hours would be really funny. If there's built

43:59.960 --> 44:04.920
and done to sleep, I don't know. I don't want to be so funny. I don't want to do it,

44:04.920 --> 44:11.960
but it would be so funny. Built and timed to sleep. So, not that exciting first.

44:11.960 --> 44:17.240
Like 48 hours stream would like an eight hour window to sleep. Just a pass.

44:17.240 --> 44:23.320
It's exactly your right. What does she do? She was like in a live streamed house for, I don't know.

44:23.320 --> 44:27.480
I think it was like a couple of days. It was like 72 hours. That's cool.

44:27.480 --> 44:34.040
They're kind of cracking down. There's no load that's too low. They want people to be interacting

44:34.040 --> 44:38.600
with the chats and you can't do that if you're sleeping on a stream. I've seen the TikTok

44:38.600 --> 44:43.640
where it's like, like people like it. People create an alarm in my room or the fact that people

44:43.640 --> 44:48.040
are talking over you, the different kinds of indicative of the generational gap. Like, as you get

44:48.040 --> 44:51.960
older, what you have to say will be like, come less and less important. The government? I have a

44:51.960 --> 44:58.360
question for you. If you don't say that, say that, Casey. Casey said the CIA is a

44:58.360 --> 45:04.760
project of YouTube. Sorry. I never try saying that 10 times down to you. This has been the weirdest

45:04.760 --> 45:09.080
episode. There was like multiple, it's like, does not feel like the episodes started.

45:09.080 --> 45:13.560
It's like, we're sort of like, multiple conversations happening at the same time. That's never happened

45:13.560 --> 45:20.760
on the show. Say that down time, on you. On two different people having two different conversations.

45:21.480 --> 45:25.240
You can't do the last thing on a Friday and you just can't. It's too weird. It's looping.

45:25.240 --> 45:29.320
A mirror. Here we go. What are yours? Do you listen to music or are you going to those guys?

45:29.320 --> 45:32.520
I don't. I don't listen to music that much. I listen to any of your songs that like,

45:32.520 --> 45:37.080
oh, I should listen to the song, but I use YouTube. Except for. I feel like, can I guess?

45:37.080 --> 45:41.640
Yeah. Number one is that song. I don't care. I love it. I do like that song. That's not number one.

45:41.640 --> 45:49.240
Number one. I do you spotify too, listen to the Boburnam inside special. That was two years ago.

45:49.400 --> 45:52.840
Yeah, but I still think about it. And when I play it, I only listen to it on Spotify.

45:52.840 --> 45:57.640
What do you find everyone song for me? I like a lot of songs on there, but I do like

45:57.640 --> 46:03.320
welcome to the internet. And I like that that's how the world works song. And I like that,

46:03.320 --> 46:06.920
that funny feeling the one that he plays on guitar. Is this, did you book this?

46:07.720 --> 46:13.000
Boburnam Cross promo stuff? No, but Amir is doing just kind of mad. No, that's just natural.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.360
What I listen to. It's Spotify. Have you ever seen Bridger's cover?

46:16.360 --> 46:21.400
Yeah, she did a cover of that. I saw that. I saw that they were dating, but I haven't heard that version.

46:21.400 --> 46:26.520
Also, I knit to you later. Okay, cool. And then the other four are just bands that I've played slash like,

46:26.520 --> 46:33.080
which is like Eminem Weezer. Eminem. Yeah, a bunch of white dudes. What's your favorite Eminem?

46:33.080 --> 46:36.600
And I will say is that Eminem song, what's the one lose yourself? Lose yourself. Yeah.

46:37.400 --> 46:43.640
Never has a song been used by so many mediocre men to hype themselves up for something that doesn't matter.

46:44.360 --> 46:49.000
It's not mom spaghetti. You're about to like log in to like lumber. I just watched.

46:51.000 --> 46:56.600
I'm just saying lumber guy worked in a mile. Is it? I think so. Similar. I'm so synchronous.

46:57.160 --> 47:01.240
Synchronicious. Synchronicious. I'm so synchronicious. Synchronicious. This song. He's doing it.

47:01.240 --> 47:05.800
Eminem song right now. I'm synchronicious. Rappurnicious.

47:06.120 --> 47:13.160
I'm rapped with your Spotify rapped. And then there was one that I forgot. It was Weezer.

47:13.160 --> 47:18.200
Maybe Ben Folds. Like it's got to be the Ben Folds five. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't have to be the Ben Folds.

47:18.200 --> 47:25.000
I saw Ben Folds be Ben Folds. Really? It could be for for a mirror. I saw Ben Folds debut his symphony.

47:25.000 --> 47:31.480
He wrote a symphony because any debut in Cleveland. My friend sister played the cello in it.

47:31.800 --> 47:39.880
So sick. Awesome. I saw Weezer in concert on September 12, 2001. Well Ben Folds. I was just going to say they did not cancel their show.

47:39.880 --> 47:46.040
Ben Folds that album came out on 911. Yeah. All right. Here we go. This is it. That's weird for you.

47:46.040 --> 47:51.560
There was my musical taste having evolved since I was 18. It's because you haven't gone out of your comfort zone.

47:51.560 --> 47:57.240
I don't think it knew they need to necessarily. I was just shocked to hear Eminem second. I feel like a mirror would like hot to go.

47:57.480 --> 48:01.560
Did you know that I had pictures of Eminem and my, you didn't know. Here I'm telling you for the first time.

48:01.560 --> 48:08.280
I had pictures of him taped up in my locker. And I would like before class. I thought he was so cute.

48:08.280 --> 48:13.400
Did I tell you who my first Instagram or one? And then my dad shot me. So you saw them in M2?

48:13.960 --> 48:21.560
Not a long time. I was like 12. Of course. My dad bought me a walkman and I asked my mom to buy me the Eminem CD.

48:21.560 --> 48:26.760
She didn't know it was. I think it was the Marshall mother's LP. And then my dad was like,

48:26.760 --> 48:32.920
let me try out this. Do you know what? I want to know what it like, the sound quality.

48:32.920 --> 48:37.320
You just said walkman. You held your hands out as if you were using a walker.

48:38.600 --> 48:39.800
And then he listened to that.

48:39.800 --> 48:44.840
No, let's do that. Let's see. Did he said I can't listen to Eminem anymore? Interesting.

48:44.840 --> 48:49.480
Your dad couldn't listen to that. What's that? Thank you. This is the segment you had playing?

48:49.480 --> 48:54.680
There's more. There's absolutely more. There's kind of a lot more. Oh shit. Okay, we have to

48:54.680 --> 49:00.520
keep this fucking going. What did you see? 45 minutes. God, I thought you looked out and

49:00.520 --> 49:03.320
saw it. Yeah, I could have been trying to get into the studio. All right, here we go.

49:03.320 --> 49:05.400
Yeah, to go. Oh, shit. He has a gun.

49:06.760 --> 49:08.440
Tap around. You would like to chop around.

49:08.440 --> 49:18.040
H-O-T-T-O-G-O. You can't take me hot to go. What a dance to it. What are the words?

49:18.040 --> 49:21.240
What is the word he's spelling? He's spelling hot to go.

49:22.200 --> 49:26.280
It's like taking a coffee hot to go, but like someone's going to like, yeah, sort of fucker.

49:28.600 --> 49:32.200
Who sings this? Chappel around, so. It's not for us. Yeah, for me.

49:32.200 --> 49:34.840
None of your business or mine. All right, this is rapid-fire.

49:34.840 --> 49:39.400
I'm just going to say this about Casey. It's one joke. You're, sorry. Okay. Yeah.

49:39.400 --> 49:43.000
All of these read like names that I would use as an alien. Beek.

49:43.560 --> 49:47.240
Chloe Francis.

49:47.240 --> 49:51.240
Link Ray with a W.

49:51.240 --> 49:55.880
With a W. Andrew Valentino and the chats. All right, here we go.

49:55.880 --> 50:01.720
We got yours. I'm here to have one or he sent me one. Okay, these are all, yeah.

50:01.720 --> 50:03.960
We just talked about it. We just talked about it. We just talked about five.

50:03.960 --> 50:06.760
We do have to move on. We had to move on five. Was Ben Folds the fifth one?

50:07.400 --> 50:11.160
Nice. Has Ben Folds comes in five. The Ben Folds five coming in at five?

50:12.120 --> 50:17.480
Here we go. This is a game I like to call a medical procedure or cheating. Let's start with IUD implantation.

50:18.920 --> 50:23.080
Is that, is that a medical procedure or are you actually just cheating on your partner?

50:23.800 --> 50:28.840
The episode should end right there. But if you want to have this whole segment, that's a medical

50:28.840 --> 50:37.640
procedure. Yeah. Really? Yeah. But someone else is in there, Jeff.

50:38.440 --> 50:44.920
Ha ha ha ha. Whatever. Let's keep going. The next cross state exam.

50:45.880 --> 50:52.120
Yeah. It's like medical procedure or cheating. I'm sensing a pattern here. That one's cheating, right?

50:52.120 --> 50:55.400
That one's cheating depends on who's doing it. The doctor, a doctor at a

50:55.400 --> 51:01.000
fucking. Well, that is cheating. Exactly. Well, it's, I almost feel like, and we're the location.

51:01.560 --> 51:07.400
It could be a doctor, but if you're in a motel. That's what I'm saying. It's like

51:07.400 --> 51:12.440
I would never get a prostate exam if I was in a monogamous relationship. That's not fair to them.

51:14.280 --> 51:19.640
That's why or you're scared of what they might find. Or of them going in. And is that a rule?

51:19.640 --> 51:24.280
Or if you like. No, I don't think he's scared of them going in. I think he's scared of what's inside of

51:24.280 --> 51:31.320
the. Yeah. He's afraid of fishers in his ass or the relationship coming. That's a loss. That's the loss.

51:31.880 --> 51:32.440
What?

51:33.080 --> 51:36.440
Babes. Finally got you. That's so much worse.

51:38.600 --> 51:39.080
Wonderful.

51:43.240 --> 51:48.120
That's also you. It's pial. His stereoscopy. His stereoscopy. His stereoscopy.

51:48.680 --> 51:52.600
His stereoscopy. I mostly brought this up because I didn't realize that. Don't look at me.

51:54.920 --> 51:57.400
Don't make eye contact during this segment. What's the chicken or the egg?

51:57.480 --> 52:02.760
Histeria or the fact that a lot of gynecological exams and procedures start with

52:02.760 --> 52:10.600
his stereoscopy? No, his stereoscopy. You're talking about the camera in the uterus.

52:10.600 --> 52:16.600
His stereoscopy is removed. Remove. Not removal of his camera. Does hysteria come from

52:16.600 --> 52:22.360
gynecological exams? And is that the etymology of hysteria that that has a thing?

52:22.520 --> 52:26.760
We are hysterical. Are these medical procedures named after hysteria?

52:27.960 --> 52:33.960
I bet it's like backed in through sexist ideology that's like only women can be hysterical.

52:33.960 --> 52:37.720
And it's based on. Is that your lawyers? Who the hell is that? Is that Nick? Yeah.

52:37.720 --> 52:41.720
Nick. Ask about the band. Ask about replacements. Tell them. Never

52:41.720 --> 52:44.360
guess. Ask about the mayor's field session. I'm Spotify. Ask about the mayor's field.

52:44.360 --> 52:45.560
Ask about the mayor's field. Ask about the mayor's field. Ask about the mayor's field.

52:45.560 --> 52:49.160
That's another thing that's never happened before. It was something weird. Well, she is having another

52:49.160 --> 52:55.400
conversation. It was a replacement. I think you were Spotify. Well, no, it's not a second.

52:55.400 --> 52:59.400
On the phone, who he can't even hear what they're saying. And she had no hesitation to pick it up.

52:59.400 --> 53:02.920
You remember Jeff, when I'm last year, for like a second? For more than a second,

53:02.920 --> 53:06.760
what felt like an eternity? I think there might be the worst episode ever. No, I don't think so.

53:06.760 --> 53:12.600
I think it's a secret. Are you coming here? What? Nick? Oh, I didn't because I was busy.

53:13.320 --> 53:22.040
busy with what? Dating him? Yeah, you don't mind. I'll get it expense. We need, we need just

53:22.040 --> 53:26.280
like plastic tarps to paint the studio. Does he not have a day job? How is he able to do this on

53:26.280 --> 53:31.320
paid? She's out of him. So it's not helpful to her. It's out of the core on a Friday and here in Los

53:31.320 --> 53:36.040
Angeles. It's like, what about? Okay. We have to go out. I'll text you. General, yourology appointment.

53:36.040 --> 53:41.400
Is that cheating or a better procedure? Bye. What is the procedure? General, yourology

53:41.400 --> 53:45.560
appointment? Is that cheating or a medical procedure? We're still doing this segment. I thought we were

53:45.560 --> 53:51.560
done. Did nobody like this one? This might be a dud. I've never seen you before. What?

53:52.760 --> 53:56.120
What about? Sorry. I took a phone call because we have to paint the studio a little bit. Nick is

53:56.120 --> 54:01.000
painting the studio. He's coming to help us get stuff out. What is that? Who's this guy? James Bond.

54:02.200 --> 54:09.000
I don't like that you're looking at me through. Through the tribe. There's like a tri-pod here

54:09.000 --> 54:13.560
and I'm looking through it. It feels like you're going to shoot. I'm not having sex with someone

54:13.560 --> 54:19.960
other than your monogamous partners. Is that a medical procedure? I'm cheating. I'm cheating. Very good.

54:19.960 --> 54:24.760
I did cut you off at the scene. The hysteria of it all. Yeah, I do it. You're onto something

54:24.760 --> 54:29.800
there for sure. I consider reading radical feminist theory. You might, like, it might really

54:29.800 --> 54:35.640
stuff up for you. I took a gender studies class once. Yeah, you see. A year or two ago.

54:35.720 --> 54:41.800
This was a decade ago. What did you get? I got 14. I got to do not pass, but it was more like

54:41.800 --> 54:48.520
you shall not pass. The teacher told you this as you were trying to get into the classroom. Well,

54:48.520 --> 54:54.600
it wasn't the teacher as like a troll and I refused to pay the toll. So I didn't learn much.

54:54.600 --> 55:00.920
Just switched gender to where are you studying? Oh. Melting. He's melting. He cannot do this.

55:01.880 --> 55:06.680
Uh, all right. This is the second one I like to call. Oh, wow.

55:09.480 --> 55:15.080
Jeopardy. It's called, uh, it's called plugs. Right. Let's get the fuck out of here. Let's start with

55:15.080 --> 55:20.440
the mirror and let's go left to right as if I was reading a book. Gosh. I got to promote segments

55:20.440 --> 55:24.600
my new podcast on the head game that we're not really. Oh, sure. It doesn't hurt.

55:25.560 --> 55:33.560
Also on TikTok. Okay. To say nothing about my Instagram account at a mirror. I posted some wedding

55:33.560 --> 55:38.040
photos the other week that are doing. They look really cleanly well. Engagement wise. They didn't look

55:38.040 --> 55:45.800
like that on the day. Well, I've been told. And then I'm also on X. I'm on X to see right now. So

55:45.800 --> 55:53.640
we don't have to get out of here. But my name is there is Bloomingfeld. So follow me follow me follow me.

55:53.640 --> 55:59.240
Yeah. No, number two on this. Follow fire. Yeah. It goes Bo Burnham M&M. Yeah.

55:59.960 --> 56:12.040
Oh, uh, calling me. No. Oh, no. No. That's take on me. Yeah. This is data. What did you say? Call. Call me. Call me.

56:12.200 --> 56:19.000
No. I know you're saying. That's out of my screen. That's out of green. No, it's. That's an

56:19.000 --> 56:27.800
old green. Call me. Call me. That's out of green. That's a different. I was so

56:27.800 --> 56:34.520
blondie. I said. I feel like we never have the cookie brownies. Listen to the pit wall.

56:34.520 --> 56:41.880
No way. No. No. No. No. We're going to. No. We're going to.

56:42.680 --> 56:47.000
I don't know when this episode comes out that we're recording right now. We're going to do an episode

56:47.000 --> 56:53.320
about the Ferrari movie. Sometimes soon. Really? Can I recommend this for this? Stop looking at

56:53.320 --> 57:00.040
me through the tripod. Ford versus Ferrari versus Ferrari comparing those two movies. I don't know.

57:00.040 --> 57:04.200
Wow. That's really good. And you have to bring me on because I did Ford versus Ferrari. Okay.

57:04.200 --> 57:08.440
Yeah. Like the conversation for I. Okay. And is there moving? Well, I'll do. I'm going to do. We're

57:08.440 --> 57:13.480

running low. The well is empty. Yeah. And we are reupping in January. So please, we're begging you.

59:46.520 --> 59:53.560
You all need help. I'm sure. Can I say that? Um, yeah. And uh, it's going to be a new show live stream show coming

59:53.560 --> 59:58.440
to Twitch rock and roll radio show hosted by me. Jeff will never be a guest, but everybody else here

59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.560
more than welcome. I'm all in on that. Although now that you listened to bands, other than

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:05.720
the grateful dead, we have a lot to talk about. That was never with my only been hit. It's a music

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:10.760
radio show live on the head gum twitch, a radio free on the on Instagram. I already said that.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:16.600
Thanks Jeff for having us. Um, I will say that if anybody didn't like medical procedure or cheating

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:21.240
as a segment, my girlfriend came up with that. That wasn't me. I really like your girlfriend. So now I

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:25.640
see it differently. That's what I knew that would happen. So I just feel like it won't be relevant to

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:29.960
people, what you're saying right now, because you will have cut the segment. So really, it was

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:33.720
bad. And I had to take a phone call during it. Yeah, but you know, that means that Nick was basically

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:38.600
on the show. It's going to say whatever the title of this episode is, and then it's going to say

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.280
with Nick, whatever his last name is, Bond or whatever.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:04.280
That was a hit gum original.

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
I can't believe you're doing this.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
I already know what this is.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
No, that's a grand tourismo.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Boom boom shii shii!

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Welcome!

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Nice!

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Welcome to the shit wall!

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
It's like...

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
That's...

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
This is a legit song.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
That's the theme song of the fucking song.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Show you host.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Is it really?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Yeah.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Do you want me to do that whole intro again?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I worked kind of hard on it.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
I legitimately did not.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
I even listened to a recent episode.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
This is a head-gum.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
You probably skipped for the head-gum original.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
So here we go.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
This is the theme song of the host show that we all host.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Mostly Casey, but yeah.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Me and Maurice.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Okay, thanks.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
And maybe it's a banger.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Boom boom boom shii shii!

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Yeah.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
It's a boom boom shii shii!

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Welcome to the shit wall.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
This is the Jeff One podcast for shit fans.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
So for those of you who don't know, let's plug it up top.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Casey and Marika.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
What is the pit wall?

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
The pit wall is a formula one podcast for casual fans.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
It's a podcast about the goings on.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
The world of formula one.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
We talk about all of the boys and their expensive toys.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
And how they drive them all around the world.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
And then we also like watch movies when there's no races.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
I'm your shot cast principal Jeffrey Donahue.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
And I'm joined by Marika.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
You guys are married?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Good girl.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
This is a small wedding.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
I'm embarrassed that we didn't invite.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Yeah.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Shot me too.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
I'm joined by Marika W.E.F.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Brownlee.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
That's won't ever finish.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
Andrew dial up as in he's old and he loves tech.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
And Casey Donna, who cares about formula one?

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
That's a great question.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
That we asked our audience every week.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Would you say that this is similar to how the pit wall goes so far?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
So far.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
So yeah.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
Let's talk about Sims.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Oh God.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Look at your guys.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
It's energy.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Look at your guys.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
You can still don't know if I'm in a trap right now.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Really?

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
I'm having a hard time figuring out what you're supposed to do.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm being attacked.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
Or I act a friend or an enemy.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
This so far that was all the attacks on your guys' character that I had.

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
But the rest is going to, you know, who knows what has and what I have in store other than me.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
This is the shit wall.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Yeah.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
For shit fans.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Like fans of shit.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
No, like shitty fans.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Like casual fans.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
No.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
These fans are pretty shitty.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
They don't actually watch the races.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
They don't show up to the records.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
But it's a Jeff one podcast.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
So is it shitty fans of you?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Exactly.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
So this episode is for the shittiest fans of me.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Got it.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Got it.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
It's like the fan.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
It's the people that don't watch the headgun podcast.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
They don't watch headgun sketches.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
They're tuning in to the YouTube channel.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Just to watch the Jake and a mirror videos.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
This episode is for fans of the pit wall who haven't heard the headgun podcast.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
No, nobody.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Definitely.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Actually, no.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
There might be a person.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
They're genuinely might be someone.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Someone did DMS like, who is this Jeff guy?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
There.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Let's do that.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
It was me.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
I DM that.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Oh, yeah, fair.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
Imagine for a second a world where there's a headgun sim.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Like a racing sim.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
But for a headgun.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Well, Marty.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Racing sim is just a simulator, right?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
So it's a simulation of a race.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
This is a simulation of the goings on of headgun.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Right?

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
So let's say if we played the Sims, but made all of us characters.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Well, less of the Sims and more like what is the racing sim called?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
What's the name of that game?

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Oh, there's all sorts of games.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
The racing sim is a piece of equipment.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
It's a steering wheel and pedals that you plug into.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
The metal.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Gaming system or your gaming PC.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
God.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
If it was a headgun simulator, though, what would happen?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
It wouldn't be like the Sims, Marika.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
So don't say that again.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
But basically, it's like if the company was simulated,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
how would things be different?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
How would things be the same?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
How do you think that might go?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Let's simulate it for five years.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
What do you think happens?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
It's pile.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Are we looking at a sale?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Are we selling to high-heart radio?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Are we selling to Shopify?

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
That'd be great.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Not a table.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Do those exist?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Do what exists?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
In five years?

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
In five years in this sim that we've created?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Yeah.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
How is high-heart radio doing in five years in this?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
This is a pretty expansive sim that it's also

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
simulating other companies.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Yeah.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
It's open world.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
It's open world.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
It's an open world.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
It's an open world.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
It's open world.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
You wake up in the morning.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
You have to decide what copy shop of the five copy shops around you.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
It's over to go to...

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Are you going to...

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Are we playing ourselves or not?

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
We're playing ourselves.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
We're not like...

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Well, you know how?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Like...

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
That's the thing.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
NBA players will always be like...

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
You'll be doing the press day, the media day,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
that would just happen the earlier this week.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Like...

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
I got to admit...

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
I don't play as myself in 2K.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
I play as LeBron.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
So it's like...

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
If you were...

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Like, let's go down the line.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
If you were doing a headgum sim,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
who would you want to play?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Hmm.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Is this...

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Is this just whose job do you want?

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
It's a little bit more complicated than that

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
because it isn't a sim.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Well, I'd say if it was...

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
If I'm playing this headgum sim...

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
The...

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
The role...

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
To be as Marty because...

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Yeah.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
You make...

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
You're making all the...

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
The...

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
The decisions for the track that...

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
That the sim is going to be on.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Right?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
It's like...

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
But the question is, do you want that authority?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Do you want that responsibility?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Like in the sim or in real life,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
do I want to be CEO of Headgum?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
What's the sim?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
But it's the stake of horror.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
And the sim...

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Okay.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Sure.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I will try all sorts of crazy things.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
I'll probably set it.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
That's true.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
That's true.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
But you're just on the phone all day talking to people.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
That's what I was going to say.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
I think...

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Well...

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Well, in the sim, I would...

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I would make my own track.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
You know?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
It's like creating them on the phone.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
I would like creating them on the phone.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
And...

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
In a sporty period.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
You're not on the phone all day.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Wouldn't it fail?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
That is the question, isn't it?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
And that's the question.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
No, it's not the question.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
It's not the question.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Basically in your sim...

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
It's not the content creator.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
I feel like that's a more exciting sim.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Well, here's the big question.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Are we not in a sim right now?

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Well, we're playing the headgum sim.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Are we also using pedals and a steering wheel?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Of course.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
That's fine.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
In that case, I do want to be Marty because he has the biggest car.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
He has the biggest and best car.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Best car.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
He has the nicest car.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Yeah.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yeah.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
But Jake, just because he gets the cash of Marty, but with eight and eight of the work.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Right?

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
So like he gets to do the pit wall or not.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
He has the Brooklyn townhouse.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
He has the budget for a place upstate.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
And it's almost better.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
I would say to have the budget for a place upstate than to have the place upstate.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
I think pile can speak.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Agreed.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
100%.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
100%.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Because you forget that you like the money.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Yeah.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
You don't want the slap.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
The amount is here.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
The massive crack in the level.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.040
You know what I mean?

08:56.040 --> 09:00.000
And because I think about slap boundation case, you know, is that you can't get under

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
there.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
There's no cracking crawl space, so you're talking about tearing up flooring in

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
having just the lay out, you're not talking about going underneath the fucking beams.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Yeah.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
Man, your preaching to the choir.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Lail, no.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
I'm a basement guy for life.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
What's that?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
What are all spades?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Can you, like?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Sorry, you have to be better rested if you're going to say that.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.160
if you're going to say that sentence.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.600
Cause you looked like he didn't even come and sucked in a year.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.960
I have it's left in a three years.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.840
He just like five, right?

09:29.840 --> 09:32.480
Why is he just turning three?

09:32.480 --> 09:34.360
I don't think it's him that's keeping me up.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.440
I think it's the same.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.320
My stress, my life.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.160
Yeah, the same.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.520
I'm not putting my character to sleep at all.

09:41.520 --> 09:42.360
Yeah.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.800
Marie, could you be in the same?

09:45.800 --> 09:47.440
I said, Jay.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.720
I'd also want to be Marty, but I don't understand

09:50.720 --> 09:53.320
like, if I'm playing Marty in the sim,

09:53.320 --> 09:58.320
do I just have to do the things that Marty does every day?

09:58.320 --> 10:02.440
Or can I make my own path for this Marty character

10:02.440 --> 10:04.720
and see what happens?

10:04.720 --> 10:08.320
Like, can I take the, do I have to take the racing line

10:08.320 --> 10:10.480
or can I go off to the side?

10:10.480 --> 10:14.320
And you're asking if you can let D die?

10:14.320 --> 10:16.760
Oh, I would never.

10:16.760 --> 10:19.360
I would never.

10:19.440 --> 10:23.320
And be like, what the fuck are you talking about?

10:23.320 --> 10:26.600
It's a sad board of, well, things that we've said.

10:26.600 --> 10:27.600
Yeah.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.840
But this is the shit wall.

10:28.840 --> 10:29.840
So we're talking about the shit wall.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.600
The most work you've ever put into a shit.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.600
Yeah.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.600
Yeah.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.600
Yeah.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.600
Yeah.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.600
Yeah.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.600
Yeah.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.600
Yeah.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.600
Yeah.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.600
Yeah.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.600
Yeah.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.600
Yeah.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.600
But this is the shit wall.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.600
So we're talking about the shit wall.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.600
Yeah.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.600
Yeah.

10:46.600 --> 10:47.600
Yeah.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.600
Yeah.

10:48.600 --> 10:51.120
I woke up in various other kinds of sports cars.

10:51.120 --> 10:56.880
This is a segment I like to call DRS or repossess.

10:56.880 --> 11:00.720
Here we have some of this thing who don't know what DRS is.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.840
A drag reduction system.

11:02.840 --> 11:03.840
Exactly right.

11:03.840 --> 11:07.120
How do I know not to be like, the slip stream.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.120
Exactly.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.120
Kind of.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.120
Kind of.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.120
Kind of.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.640
So this is a two part.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.320
This is a kind of a two-prong game, rather.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.760
We're going to get, I'm showing you guys cars.

11:16.760 --> 11:21.800
You're going to tell me which driver on the F1 grid this car belongs to.

11:21.800 --> 11:24.080
And then you're going to say DRS or repossess.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.080
There's no wrong answers.

11:25.080 --> 11:29.120
It's just, would you use this to drive in a slip stream or would you like, rather

11:29.120 --> 11:30.120
send this to a jumpsuit?

11:30.120 --> 11:32.080
Specifically in a slip stream.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.080
Behind who.

11:33.080 --> 11:40.520
So I'm driving, I'm driving this car while right behind somebody else.

11:40.520 --> 11:44.520
Behind Marty in the same, but you're in real life.

11:44.520 --> 11:45.520
Does this all make sense?

11:45.520 --> 11:46.520
Yeah.

11:46.560 --> 11:47.520
Because it's car.

11:47.520 --> 11:48.520
Yeah.

11:48.520 --> 11:49.520
It's definitely Charles's car.

11:49.520 --> 11:50.520
It's Ferrari.

11:50.520 --> 11:51.520
It's got the way to restrate.

11:51.520 --> 11:52.520
Yeah.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.520
Yeah.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.520
And are you DRS singer, are you repossessing?

11:55.520 --> 11:56.520
Absolutely DRS.

11:56.520 --> 11:57.520
But I can't drive.

11:57.520 --> 11:58.520
I can't drive.

11:58.520 --> 11:59.520
I can't drive.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.520
I didn't know that.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.520
Can I ask you?

12:02.520 --> 12:03.520
So Tyler, are you into cars?

12:03.520 --> 12:04.520
Can I ask?

12:04.520 --> 12:05.520
Yeah.

12:05.520 --> 12:06.520
I'm into cars.

12:06.520 --> 12:10.520
So like, what makes this a million dollars, but like a stock Lamborghini is like

12:10.520 --> 12:11.520
200 grams?

12:11.520 --> 12:14.520
Well, this is like a fully custom.

12:14.520 --> 12:17.520
Like a higher end Ferrari.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.520
Lamborghini only makes like three cars or two cars.

12:20.520 --> 12:21.520
I think so.

12:21.520 --> 12:24.520
And any Lamborghini is the same for Ferrari.

12:24.520 --> 12:25.520
Is that true?

12:25.520 --> 12:27.520
I don't know anything about these things.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.520
You know what I like?

12:28.520 --> 12:30.520
I like the like old Land Rover defenders.

12:30.520 --> 12:31.520
If I had a dream car, I'd be that.

12:31.520 --> 12:32.520
Yeah.

12:32.520 --> 12:33.520
Those are cool cars.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.520
Yeah, but those are like a hundred thousand dollars restored.

12:36.520 --> 12:37.520
Well, yeah.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.520
They aren't out.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.520
So why is this a million dollars?

12:40.520 --> 12:42.520
It's made out of carbon fiber.

12:42.520 --> 12:43.520
Yeah, probably.

12:43.520 --> 12:44.520
I like it.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.520
It's all under the hood, man.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.520
Yeah.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.520
You know what?

12:48.520 --> 12:50.520
I'm going to change my answer for the head comes in.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.520
If I was the head comes in.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.520
I would be pile and then I would quit.

12:54.520 --> 12:57.520
And then I would leave the sim and go back to resuming my life.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.520
That way, pile wouldn't be at the company anymore.

13:00.520 --> 13:02.520
I'm confused.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.520
So yeah, I don't.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.520
You would quit the game.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.520
You would play in the pile and you quit the game.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.520
No, I would play as pile and I would quit the company.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.520
And then I would resume normal life.

13:12.520 --> 13:13.520
In the sim.

13:13.520 --> 13:14.520
Yes.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.520
As my cell.

13:15.520 --> 13:18.520
You're still simulating after he quit the company.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.520
Yeah, because then I can live in that reality for a minute.

13:21.520 --> 13:22.520
Okay.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.520
We've never talked about this.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.520
This is the worst time in my life.

13:25.520 --> 13:26.520
In a way.

13:26.520 --> 13:27.520
I mean, looking on a thing.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.520
Look at the trim in your house.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.520
I mean, the fucking.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.520
The olive toe.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.520
So dark in here.

13:34.520 --> 13:37.520
And you don't even mean just visually.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.520
You mean energetically.

13:39.520 --> 13:40.520
Yes.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.520
Yes.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.520
It's all that.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.520
DRS or repossess.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.520
And who do you think is belongs to?

13:45.520 --> 13:46.520
Kind of you, Lance.

13:46.520 --> 13:47.520
Do you think this is Lance?

13:47.520 --> 13:48.520
Yeah.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.520
Yeah.

13:49.520 --> 13:50.520
I hate to.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.520
I kind of love to break things to you guys.

13:52.520 --> 13:53.520
Oh, she's this fucking car.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.520
Is this Fernando?

13:55.520 --> 13:57.520
Uh, this is Max's.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.520
Wow.

13:58.520 --> 13:59.520
Really?

13:59.520 --> 14:01.520
Because we forget that you don't.

14:01.520 --> 14:02.520
That's right.

14:02.520 --> 14:03.520
Well, that's a bad car.

14:03.520 --> 14:04.520
Yeah.

14:04.520 --> 14:05.520
Maybe funny.

14:05.520 --> 14:07.520
If you drove around in one of those red bull rap for us.

14:07.520 --> 14:11.520
That's going to.

14:11.520 --> 14:14.520
A red bull street team thing.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.520
A red bull fluke talk.

14:17.520 --> 14:20.520
You know, one of those planes that they make that they shoot.

14:20.520 --> 14:21.520
Yeah.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.520
Yeah.

14:22.520 --> 14:24.520
But he just like flies it and lands it and parallel parks.

14:24.520 --> 14:26.520
They were to get coffee.

14:26.520 --> 14:29.520
DRS or repossess.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.520
I don't really.

14:31.520 --> 14:32.520
Really?

14:32.520 --> 14:33.520
Yeah.

14:33.520 --> 14:34.520
Yeah.

14:34.520 --> 14:35.520
I like asked.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.520
But I would.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.520
DRS over the Ferrari.

14:38.520 --> 14:39.520
No.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.520
There's something classier about this.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.520
I think there's something about this photo.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.520
That makes it look like a Craigslist.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.520
Like you car.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.520
I get that.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.520
I get that for sure.

14:51.520 --> 14:52.520
I don't know though.

14:52.520 --> 14:53.520
I think this.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.520
This looks so much faster.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.520
Yeah.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.520
Faster.

14:57.520 --> 14:58.520
You have to.

14:58.520 --> 15:01.520
The only place you can drive this is like onrodeo to get like a shitty lunch.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.520
And this looks fast.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.520
Can I see the other one?

15:04.520 --> 15:05.520
Yeah.

15:05.520 --> 15:11.520
It looks like it's got like leather interior that's that's peeling because it's been in the sun for too long.

15:11.520 --> 15:12.520
Yeah.

15:12.520 --> 15:19.520
Apparently, Max, your staff on the has a road approved version of James Bond's car in the film Spectre.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.520
That's a DB5.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.520
That's also really cool.

15:21.520 --> 15:22.520
DB11.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.520
Actually.

15:23.520 --> 15:24.520
This is the DB11.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.520
Holy shit.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.520
All right.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.520
Here we go.

15:27.520 --> 15:28.520
He has like five.

15:28.520 --> 15:29.520
Yeah.

15:29.520 --> 15:30.520
That is like five.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.520
We've been on.

15:31.520 --> 15:32.520
DRS or repossess.

15:33.520 --> 15:34.520
That's a repossess.

15:34.520 --> 15:35.520
Is that Czechosian?

15:35.520 --> 15:36.520
Yeah.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.520
That's absolutely correct.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.520
He's in the passenger seat, by the way.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.520
But this is his car.

15:41.520 --> 15:42.520
It's he really is.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.520
He's his car.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.520
This, according to the internet, this is Czechos car.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.520
And he doesn't even drive it.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.520
I mean, I've ever civic type R.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.520
Czech.

15:51.520 --> 15:52.520
Can we all agree?

15:52.520 --> 15:53.520
Czechos a bottom.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.520
He's a sub.

15:54.520 --> 15:55.520
Sure.

15:55.520 --> 15:56.520
Yeah.

15:56.520 --> 15:57.520
100% he's never been on.

15:57.520 --> 15:58.520
He's definitely a wife guy.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.520
Big wife guy.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.520
Repossess.

16:04.520 --> 16:05.520
I don't like that.

16:05.520 --> 16:06.520
I don't like that.

16:06.520 --> 16:07.520
I don't like that.

16:07.520 --> 16:08.520
The colors are bad.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.520
Yeah.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.520
I don't really like these boxy kind of cars.

16:11.520 --> 16:12.520
Me either.

16:12.520 --> 16:15.520
But this looks like it could take a corner really well.

16:15.520 --> 16:16.520
That's.

16:16.520 --> 16:17.520
Yeah.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.520
That's that's like you're going to say.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.520
You golf.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.520
It's where it's like car guys.

16:20.520 --> 16:24.520
They're entry levels the golf because it's like technically a good build.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.520
But it's just like the equivalent of like a St.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.520
Go SKX like it ultimately doesn't.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.520
I mean, just you clearly know things about cars.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.520
I don't know it.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.520
Stuff about like this kind of car.

16:36.520 --> 16:37.520
Like I don't.

16:37.520 --> 16:41.520
I've never like looked into the Ferrari or like the McLaren of it all because it's like.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.520
Honestly, me neither because I'm like, I can't afford these things.

16:43.520 --> 16:44.520
Why haven't bothered?

16:44.520 --> 16:46.520
It's beyond my time learning.

16:46.520 --> 16:48.520
Even if I did have that much money.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.520
I wouldn't spend it on this.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.520
But I would spend it on like.

16:52.520 --> 16:53.520
Say it with me now.

16:53.520 --> 16:56.520
In awesome car.

16:56.520 --> 16:57.520
Yeah.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.520
Oh yeah.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.520
DRS or repossess.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.520
Repossess.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.520
Yeah.

17:02.520 --> 17:05.520
And I think you guys know who's car.

17:05.520 --> 17:06.520
This is.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.520
It's got to be really short.

17:08.520 --> 17:09.520
That's.

17:09.520 --> 17:10.520
It goes wrong.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.520
I actually know what Louis drives.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.520
I'm going to wonder if you get this one right.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.520
Well, Louis has a whole fleet.

17:16.520 --> 17:17.520
So I don't know.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.520
He does have multiple cars.

17:18.520 --> 17:19.520
But I'm wondering which one you're going to choose.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.520
It's not the one you think it is.

17:21.520 --> 17:22.520
I don't know.

17:22.520 --> 17:23.520
Claring.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.520
Um.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.520
Yeah, this is a bummer car.

17:27.520 --> 17:31.520
It's like a bad place.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.520
It's not an AMG.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.520
And also it's a coupe with two door.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.520
Uh, sitting in basic.

17:37.520 --> 17:38.520
Oh.

17:38.520 --> 17:39.520
What?

17:39.520 --> 17:43.520
Like why this photo in like a parking structure of this.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.520
No, this.

17:44.520 --> 17:48.520
I think I think this setting is perfect for this car.

17:48.520 --> 17:49.520
Uh.

17:49.520 --> 17:53.520
The environment around it is what I feel like looking at it.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.520
But it could it could like catfish.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.520
Maybe in another location.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.520
I think I think this is an AMG to his credit.

17:59.520 --> 18:02.520
Because I think it's a V8 on the side there.

18:02.520 --> 18:03.520
Yeah.

18:03.520 --> 18:04.520
But it does.

18:04.520 --> 18:05.520
It would say a turbo.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.520
I think it says AMG on the front grill.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.520
Yeah.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.520
Um.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.520
All right.

18:10.520 --> 18:11.520
And it's got the carbon fire.

18:11.520 --> 18:16.520
Oh, do you know both.

18:16.520 --> 18:17.520
Look.

18:17.520 --> 18:18.520
This is a Batman car.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.520
I'll take a Ferrari.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.520
I don't even know all the fries.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.520
Yes.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.520
There's a such a weird hood treatment.

18:26.520 --> 18:27.520
I don't think this is.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.520
That's like not standard is it?

18:29.520 --> 18:30.520
I don't know.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.520
No, this is Batman's car for sure.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.520
This is science is car for sure.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.520
And this car.

18:35.520 --> 18:36.520
Oh, what's the difference?

18:36.520 --> 18:37.520
Yeah.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.520
I like how nobody knows what we're talking about.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.520
Yeah.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.520
First.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.520
It's the shit wall.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.520
All right.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.520
Jesus.

18:46.520 --> 18:47.520
I.

18:48.520 --> 18:49.520
Would D.R.S.

18:49.520 --> 18:54.520
Like, I'm not going to replace us this car because ideally I would be in the passenger seat.

18:54.520 --> 18:55.520
Yeah.

18:55.520 --> 18:56.520
Okay.

18:56.520 --> 18:57.520
Mary decides.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.520
Right.

18:58.520 --> 18:59.520
She got it.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.520
Why are we doing this on the head gun podcast?

19:01.520 --> 19:03.520
This is, this is, we could have done this.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.520
That's just a regular pit wall episode.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.520
This is good.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.520
If it's good, then they will come.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.520
Right.

19:10.520 --> 19:13.520
Basically, I'm trying to do like this is a segment we were doing the pit wall.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.520
But this is expanding the audience to be like, hey, head gun podcast audience.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.520
You listen to the fucking pit wall.

19:18.520 --> 19:19.520
All right.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.520
Can we talk about Carlos signs again for one second?

19:21.520 --> 19:22.520
Yeah.

19:22.520 --> 19:23.520
I love to.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.520
It's an 812 competition A.

19:25.520 --> 19:26.520
Oh.

19:26.520 --> 19:29.520
And you know what it's replacing.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.520
I think Marieka, you know this.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.520
Marieka.

19:32.520 --> 19:33.520
Wait.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.520
He used to drive a goal.

19:34.520 --> 19:37.520
Just like, oh, you're truly.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.520
I know it.

19:39.520 --> 19:40.520
All right.

19:40.520 --> 19:45.520
Do you know what they go around the like drivers briefing and they ask everybody what they drive.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.520
Oh, yeah.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.520
I have.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.520
I drive a car.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.520
Or we possess this.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.520
This is a Clarence or stupid.

19:52.520 --> 19:53.520
Really?

19:53.520 --> 19:58.520
Except for the actual McLaren F1 car, which is the best car I've ever made.

19:58.520 --> 20:02.520
I like I kind of like McLaren's designs more than Ferrari's.

20:02.520 --> 20:03.520
I don't like how.

20:03.520 --> 20:04.520
I like that.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.520
Like this is.

20:06.520 --> 20:07.520
Yeah.

20:07.520 --> 20:08.520
Oh, I agree.

20:08.520 --> 20:11.520
This to me looks like a modern version of like a fucking,

20:11.520 --> 20:13.520
um, what's the back to the future car?

20:13.520 --> 20:14.520
That's a lot more.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.520
Like if that was in steel,

20:17.520 --> 20:20.520
I think this has going doors.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.520
How can be the door?

20:21.520 --> 20:22.520
Yeah.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.520
I like this color.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.520
This is a, this is a, yeah.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.520
It's like a creamy or color them.

20:28.520 --> 20:34.520
It matches your entire energy because it matches like like you have the wood that matches the leather sofa.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.520
You have the waltz hat that kind of matches that.

20:36.520 --> 20:39.520
You have the hair and then you have the car.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.520
I want to like about these cars.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.520
If you ever see them in real life,

20:43.520 --> 20:45.520
they come up to like your hip.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.520
Yeah.

20:46.520 --> 20:47.520
They're so small.

20:47.520 --> 20:49.520
It's so got to feel the road man.

20:49.520 --> 20:50.520
Yeah.

20:50.520 --> 20:51.520
Yeah.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.520
You got to feel the rush to the road.

20:52.520 --> 20:53.520
Gars.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.520
Um, so we're saying,

20:54.520 --> 20:55.520
Repossess.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.520
Yeah.

20:56.520 --> 20:57.520
Mm-hmm.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.520
I would say D RS, but that's fine.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.520
D RS repossess.

20:59.520 --> 21:01.520
It's got to be Lewis Lewis.

21:01.520 --> 21:02.520
Mm-hmm.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.520
This is his daily driver though.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.520
He does have that purple golfing.

21:05.520 --> 21:06.520
Yeah.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.520
For daily driver, I would D RS.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.520
Yeah.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.520
Looks sturdy.

21:10.520 --> 21:11.520
And his GQ interview,

21:11.520 --> 21:13.520
I believe he drove around a smart car.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.520
Is that true?

21:14.520 --> 21:15.520
Yeah.

21:15.520 --> 21:16.520
That's funny.

21:16.520 --> 21:17.520
What?

21:17.520 --> 21:18.520
What?

21:18.520 --> 21:19.520
GQ interview was this?

21:19.520 --> 21:21.520
There's a couple years ago after he lost Max.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.520
These are like a video.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.520
No.

21:24.520 --> 21:25.520
No.

21:25.520 --> 21:26.520
It was not a video.

21:26.520 --> 21:27.520
Oh.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.520
Okay.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.520
I'm going to say repossess.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.520
This is like a soccer mom car.

21:31.520 --> 21:32.520
And I'm not about it.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.520
No.

21:33.520 --> 21:34.520
I like it.

21:34.520 --> 21:35.520
How do you get the G-wagon?

21:35.520 --> 21:36.520
I don't know why you would get.

21:36.520 --> 21:37.520
What about the E-wagon?

21:37.520 --> 21:39.520
E-maker in the parking.

21:40.520 --> 21:41.520
Okay

21:45.520 --> 21:47.520
Pile needs me.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.520
That was a car.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.520
What is this?

21:55.520 --> 21:56.520
D RS.

21:56.520 --> 21:57.520
Grabed.

21:57.520 --> 21:58.520
Graeds.

21:58.520 --> 22:00.520
Villains car?

22:00.520 --> 22:01.520
Oh!

22:03.520 --> 22:05.520
What is this?

22:06.520 --> 22:07.520
This is an S-L, right?

22:07.520 --> 22:16.520
Is this for an Andes?

22:16.520 --> 22:18.520
This is Ocons.

22:18.520 --> 22:19.520
Yeah.

22:19.520 --> 22:20.520
Oh, yeah.

22:20.520 --> 22:21.520
For sure.

22:21.520 --> 22:22.520
Yeah.

22:22.520 --> 22:23.520
This is Ocons card.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.520
It's upsetting.

22:25.520 --> 22:26.520
It's smelling.

22:26.520 --> 22:29.520
Who else is driving a type R Civic?

22:29.520 --> 22:30.520
Stop.

22:30.520 --> 22:31.520
Back for Staten.

22:31.520 --> 22:34.520
It's you King.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.520
Yeah.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.520
Is this you King?

22:36.520 --> 22:37.520
Yeah.

22:37.520 --> 22:38.520
That totally works for me.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.520
Is this?

22:40.520 --> 22:41.520
But yes.

22:41.520 --> 22:42.520
Repossess.

22:42.520 --> 22:43.520
Repossess.

22:43.520 --> 22:44.520
All right.

22:44.520 --> 22:45.520
And last one.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.520
Love it for you, King.

22:47.520 --> 22:48.520
This piles.

22:48.520 --> 22:49.520
Dear.

22:49.520 --> 22:50.520
Repossess.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.520
Well, it's for our colors.

22:52.520 --> 22:55.520
So I imagine the engine must be real nice.

22:55.520 --> 22:57.520
It's good.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.520
I wish I had a tractor so bad.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.520
I'd be really cool.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.520
Are you a millennial who misses what life was like in the 2000s?

23:10.520 --> 23:14.520
Have you had a hard time finding new or curated music?

23:14.520 --> 23:19.520
Are you interested in multiple perspectives on relationships dating and otherwise

23:19.520 --> 23:25.520
and are looking for hosts that offer a non-male bashing perspective.

23:25.520 --> 23:29.520
But also, hold both sex is accountable.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.520
Then you're going to love see the thing is.

23:31.520 --> 23:37.520

23:57.020 --> 24:01.480

Sometimes you don't know what's good for you, right?

24:33.480 --> 24:38.480
Do you ever feel like your brain is getting in the way of really honing in on the things that

24:38.480 --> 24:41.480
are going to feed your spirit and your highest good?

24:41.480 --> 24:46.480
Like, you know what you should do, what's good for you, but you just can't bring yourself

24:46.480 --> 24:47.480
to do it.

24:47.480 --> 24:52.480
Well, therapy helps you figure out what's holding you back so that you can work for yourself

24:52.480 --> 24:53.480
instead of against yourself.

24:53.480 --> 24:58.480
I'm in therapy every week and this specific thing is something that I really try to

24:58.480 --> 24:59.480
hone in on every week.

24:59.480 --> 25:01.480
You know, what is serving my highest good?

25:01.480 --> 25:06.480
What are the things that are like bringing me joy, you know, and getting me wise?

25:06.480 --> 25:09.480

25:30.480 --> 25:35.480
I mean, for the people listening at home, those were a bunch of cars that we just looked

25:35.480 --> 25:36.480
at that that you could just look at.

25:36.480 --> 25:38.480
That we looked at a bunch of cars.

25:38.480 --> 25:39.480
Yeah.

25:39.480 --> 25:45.480
Just luxury cars, looking at photos of luxury cars, like we're like, we're in middle school.

25:45.480 --> 25:49.480
Yeah, talking about a bunch of people you definitely don't care about.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.480
I'm watching qualifying as we work for this.

25:54.480 --> 25:55.480
I haven't watched it yet.

25:55.480 --> 25:56.480
We're into Q2.

25:56.480 --> 25:59.480
So anyway, any guesses on what happened in Q1?

25:59.480 --> 26:05.480
I'm going to go with Logan Sargent is not in a Q2.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.480
Correct.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.480
Yeah.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.480
There were no upsets in Q1.

26:09.480 --> 26:12.480
Everyone who is not in Q2, you would expect to know that.

26:12.480 --> 26:14.480
It's like wonderful.

26:14.480 --> 26:15.480
Yeah.

26:15.480 --> 26:16.480
Does that mean?

26:16.480 --> 26:21.480
It's like I have to do something else when I started putting together my new vacuum.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.480
You went through the trouble of sampling.

26:25.480 --> 26:26.480
Yeah.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.480
You clicked on that.

26:28.480 --> 26:30.480
Yeah.

26:30.480 --> 26:31.480
And then.

26:31.480 --> 26:32.480
Okay.

26:32.480 --> 26:35.480
That is me.

26:35.480 --> 26:39.480
Here is a segment stolen from the pit wall, basically.

26:39.480 --> 26:43.480
But we're going to once again adjust it for the head of the company.

26:43.480 --> 26:49.480
Every week when we're talking about the race, we basically go from bottom to top.

26:49.480 --> 26:50.480
Yeah.

26:50.480 --> 26:51.480
Yeah.

26:51.480 --> 26:52.480
Yeah.

26:52.480 --> 26:53.480
Yeah.

26:53.480 --> 26:54.480
Yeah.

26:54.480 --> 26:55.480
Yeah.

26:55.480 --> 26:56.480
Um.

26:56.480 --> 26:57.480
Yeah.

26:57.480 --> 26:58.480
Um.

26:58.480 --> 26:59.480
Yeah.

26:59.480 --> 27:00.480
Um.

27:00.480 --> 27:01.480
Oh.

27:01.480 --> 27:02.480
I hate that.

27:02.480 --> 27:03.480
I hate that.

27:03.480 --> 27:04.480
I hate that.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.480
I hate that.

27:05.480 --> 27:06.480
I hate that.

27:06.480 --> 27:07.480
I hate that.

27:07.480 --> 27:08.480
I hate that.

27:08.480 --> 27:09.480
Please don't ever do that.

27:09.480 --> 27:10.480
Yeah.

27:10.480 --> 27:11.480
Um.

27:11.480 --> 27:12.480
Oh, God.

27:12.480 --> 27:18.480
The whoever's on the show goes bottom to top in the constructor's championship.

27:18.480 --> 27:21.480
And talks about how that team.

27:21.480 --> 27:22.480
No, we do.

27:22.480 --> 27:23.480
No.

27:23.480 --> 27:24.480
It's per race.

27:24.480 --> 27:25.480
Oh, yeah.

27:25.480 --> 27:26.480
Yeah.

27:26.480 --> 27:27.480
It is per race.

27:27.480 --> 27:31.480
But it is by points that they receive in the championship.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.480
You're both kind of right.

27:32.480 --> 27:33.480
But my team was my part.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.480
Well, my part is definitely right.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.480
Jeff, you're kind of right.

27:37.480 --> 27:38.480
Thank you.

27:38.480 --> 27:46.480
So I thought that we could basically go from bottom to top of who's good at headgum, right?

27:46.480 --> 27:50.480
And this is in chronological order of my personal rankings.

27:50.480 --> 27:54.480
And just say how many points we think they should get this week on the show.

27:54.480 --> 27:55.480
Does that make sense?

27:55.480 --> 27:56.480
Okay.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.480
Okay.

27:57.480 --> 28:00.480
Like the performance this week at the company we're rating right now.

28:00.480 --> 28:01.480
In a way.

28:01.480 --> 28:06.480
Basically, it's yeah, who did the best or who's sorry, who did the worst to best at the company this week?

28:06.480 --> 28:09.480
And is it by teams?

28:09.480 --> 28:10.480
I wanted to do by teams.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.480
I really did.

28:11.480 --> 28:14.480
I don't know the difference between the sales team and the partnership team.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.480
And I don't know who's on it or not.

28:16.480 --> 28:19.480
So basically, I tried to do by team.

28:19.480 --> 28:23.480
We're going to have to do it by drivers or by individuals.

28:23.480 --> 28:24.480
Is that fair?

28:24.480 --> 28:25.480
Yeah.

28:25.480 --> 28:28.480
Let's start at the very bottom with Peter.

28:28.480 --> 28:30.480
Radio silence from Peter in the slacks.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.480
I don't know what he does at the company, right?

28:32.480 --> 28:33.480
So we're going to end with him.

28:33.480 --> 28:35.480
Start with him, rather.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.480
What do we have to say about his performance this week?

28:37.480 --> 28:38.480
Is he on the tech team?

28:38.480 --> 28:39.480
Yes.

28:39.480 --> 28:40.480
Okay.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.480
So file, why don't you speak on it?

28:43.480 --> 28:45.480
He's doing great.

28:47.480 --> 28:49.480
Okay.

28:49.480 --> 28:50.480
Okay.

28:50.480 --> 28:53.480
He also has a fully different time zone than all of us.

28:53.480 --> 28:54.480
Yeah.

28:54.480 --> 28:55.480
I don't know.

28:55.480 --> 28:56.480
He just moved to France.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.480
Why?

28:57.480 --> 28:58.480
Really?

28:58.480 --> 28:59.480
Where?

28:59.480 --> 29:02.480
Some say he brought the bedbugs to Paris.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.480
Is that a known other bedbugs in Paris?

29:05.480 --> 29:06.480
Oh, yeah.

29:06.480 --> 29:08.480
It's a bad situation.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.480
Yeah.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.480
I don't know what Peter does day to day.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.480
And I don't hear from him day to day.

29:13.480 --> 29:16.480
But whatever he's doing, I'm sure it's great.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.480
I've always thought that about that guy.

29:18.480 --> 29:19.480
Yep.

29:19.480 --> 29:20.480
Yes.

29:20.480 --> 29:21.480
All right.

29:21.480 --> 29:23.480
Moving up one run.

29:23.480 --> 29:26.480
We're going to have to hit him with Michelle.

29:26.480 --> 29:31.480
Sales team or partnerships add-offs.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.480
What the fuck is the difference?

29:33.480 --> 29:35.480
She works on gum ball or what?

29:36.480 --> 29:39.480
The mostly I'm talking about people.

29:39.480 --> 29:43.480
I've heard it this fucking said jack shit in the slack.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.480
How am I supposed to do the job?

29:45.480 --> 29:49.480
He's been coming to your head gum show Jeff now.

29:49.480 --> 29:50.480
Yeah.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.480
We've turned the corner for a while.

29:51.480 --> 29:53.480
He was like trying to be a pit wall Jeff.

29:53.480 --> 29:54.480
And that was like becoming.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.480
I just, I didn't hear anything from Michelle this week.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.480
So how am I supposed to know that she did her job?

29:59.480 --> 30:01.480
I saw her in the office.

30:01.480 --> 30:02.480
I saw her in the office.

30:02.480 --> 30:04.480
So I know she did her job.

30:04.480 --> 30:05.480
I was in the office.

30:05.480 --> 30:06.480
I did a job.

30:06.480 --> 30:07.480
Yeah.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.480
What is your job?

30:09.480 --> 30:11.480
We don't know if that's true.

30:11.480 --> 30:12.480
We never know.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.480
I had a podcast came out today.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.480
And I know.

30:16.480 --> 30:19.480
A sketch is being shot today at noon because I wrote it.

30:19.480 --> 30:20.480
I'm script format.

30:20.480 --> 30:21.480
Yeah.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.480
And you just tried a schedule.

30:23.480 --> 30:27.480
You did say that you were available all day to record this podcast.

30:27.480 --> 30:30.480
And I looked at the calendar saw the sketch shoot and was like,

30:30.480 --> 30:32.480
I'm going to suggest the morning.

30:32.480 --> 30:33.480
Yeah.

30:33.480 --> 30:39.480
And also, to be clear, I did have to ping you about loading the video podcast.

30:39.480 --> 30:44.480
And I also had to edit the ad markers on our 19 because he fucked those up.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.480
Sorry, zero points for Jeff.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.480
I don't upload the audio episode.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.480
That was Grace Harper.

30:49.480 --> 30:50.480
So you can't pin that shit on me.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.480
Pin that on Grace.

30:51.480 --> 30:52.480
But you never do.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.480
Nobody ever fucking says the grace does anything wrong.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.480
Shout out Grace by the way.

30:55.480 --> 30:56.480
I could see what she did.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.480
She did a great job because she did.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.480
No, no, no, no, no.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.480
You can't say Grace did a great job.

31:01.480 --> 31:05.480
You can't say Grace did a great job because you know what's Grace.

31:05.480 --> 31:08.480
Because actually, I would have done a great job.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.480
I thought it was near points this week.

31:10.480 --> 31:11.480
Actually, don't DNF.

31:11.480 --> 31:12.480
Zero points.

31:12.480 --> 31:15.480
DNF for Jeff.

31:15.480 --> 31:16.480
Yeah.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.480
But not actually penalty next race.

31:18.480 --> 31:19.480
This sucks.

31:19.480 --> 31:20.480
This sucks.

31:20.480 --> 31:22.480
Little bit harder than the shit wall.

31:22.480 --> 31:23.480
Yeah.

31:23.480 --> 31:24.480
No, we're ending with that shit.

31:24.480 --> 31:25.480
We're ending with that shit.

31:25.480 --> 31:26.480
Okay.

31:26.480 --> 31:27.480
Moving on.

31:27.480 --> 31:30.480
I haven't heard for Ryan in a minute.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.480
I haven't heard for Ryan in a minute.

31:32.480 --> 31:33.480
All the people I talk to.

31:33.480 --> 31:34.480
You're like, what are they doing?

31:34.480 --> 31:37.480
Yeah, you're literally going out of the VPs on the company.

31:37.480 --> 31:38.480
Can I ask you this?

31:38.480 --> 31:40.480
Why are all these people moving to France?

31:40.480 --> 31:41.480
Moving to the Hamptons.

31:41.480 --> 31:43.480
I want to move to those places.

31:43.480 --> 31:44.480
This isn't the Hamptons.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.480
And he is.

31:46.480 --> 31:48.480
He's never.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.480
This sucks.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.480
This sucks.

31:51.480 --> 31:52.480
This sucks.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.480
He was at Vid Summit this week.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.480
What's Vid Summit?

31:56.480 --> 31:57.480
I don't know.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.480
Fuck this.

31:58.480 --> 31:59.480
Let's go rapid fire.

31:59.480 --> 32:00.480
All right.

32:00.480 --> 32:03.480
This is truly my ranking of who I think does a good job at the company this week.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.480
All right.

32:04.480 --> 32:05.480
Moving on.

32:05.480 --> 32:07.480
We'll just say good job or bad job or something or point.

32:07.480 --> 32:08.480
How many points we should afford them?

32:08.480 --> 32:09.480
Gianna.

32:09.480 --> 32:11.480
On vacation this week.

32:11.480 --> 32:12.480
But great job.

32:12.480 --> 32:13.480
Zero points.

32:13.480 --> 32:14.480
Dnf.

32:14.480 --> 32:15.480
Pile.

32:15.480 --> 32:16.480
Dnf.

32:16.480 --> 32:17.480
Dnf.

32:17.480 --> 32:18.480
Dnf.

32:18.480 --> 32:19.480
Narissa.

32:19.480 --> 32:22.480
Great job.

32:22.480 --> 32:24.480
Brett.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.480
Great job.

32:25.480 --> 32:26.480
Awesome.

32:26.480 --> 32:27.480
Awesome.

32:27.480 --> 32:28.480
Awesome.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.480
Great job.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.480
The entire fucking company on vacation.

32:31.480 --> 32:37.480
The podcast principle or the fucking the team principle.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.480
Marty should be fired for that.

32:39.480 --> 32:48.480
I know that we want to have this like hip start-up environment but it's like if you don't stay on people, nothing gets it done.

32:48.480 --> 32:49.480
Stay on people.

32:49.480 --> 32:50.480
What do you want?

32:50.480 --> 32:51.480
Yeah.

32:51.480 --> 32:52.480
What do you want?

32:52.480 --> 32:53.480
What are you asking for right now?

32:53.480 --> 32:54.480
No vacation day.

32:54.480 --> 32:55.480
This is a sad man.

32:55.480 --> 32:56.480
No vacation days.

32:57.480 --> 33:03.480
Let's just go all the way up to like who I consider to be like the red bulls of the fucking company.

33:03.480 --> 33:06.480
Let's go alley and me.

33:06.480 --> 33:07.480
Okay.

33:07.480 --> 33:08.480
Okay.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.480
Well, alley's max for staff and.

33:10.480 --> 33:11.480
Yeah.

33:11.480 --> 33:12.480
And I'm.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.480
Check out.

33:13.480 --> 33:14.480
Nevermind.

33:14.480 --> 33:15.480
I'll be fucking.

33:15.480 --> 33:17.480
Your Alex Alban man.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.480
You were a red bull.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.480
And now you're Williams.

33:22.480 --> 33:25.480
Oh, my god.

33:25.480 --> 33:26.480
I'm.

33:26.480 --> 33:29.480
I'm.

33:29.480 --> 33:30.480
I'm my kid.

33:30.480 --> 33:34.480
Send on my lap and watch like the first lap with me.

33:34.480 --> 33:37.480
Which is always fun because if there's going to be a go crashing is we're going to let.

33:37.480 --> 33:40.480
So, why sample that one?

33:40.480 --> 33:42.480
Oh, my god.

33:42.480 --> 33:46.480
Uh, now we're going to move on to the cool down room.

33:46.480 --> 33:47.480
Which I can.

33:47.480 --> 33:52.020
The staple in the pit wall and it's not this is actually my pitch for a fucking segment

33:52.520 --> 33:59.840
Yeah, we need more segments or sap and podcast. We spend like an hour and 20 minutes talking about the race and then it's like okay

33:59.840 --> 34:01.440
Let's do five way segment

34:01.440 --> 34:07.600
Well, we're about to wrap things up. It's only been 35 minutes almost the pit walls too long. That's way too long

34:08.600 --> 34:10.600
We all know that we all know

34:10.840 --> 34:14.400
But we're passionate about the top every every episode

34:14.400 --> 34:16.400
We say we host to move on

34:17.600 --> 34:26.720
Throughout the episode because we really do and yet there's there's it's always surprising how much there is to talk about for sure for sure

34:27.440 --> 34:29.440
The cooldown room

34:29.440 --> 34:32.160
Wait, sorry, so sorry, so

34:33.200 --> 34:35.200
We just

34:35.200 --> 34:37.200
You just did a ranking of

34:37.200 --> 34:44.380
Co-workers based on the people that you don't talk to and then said you and Alia the top two

34:45.900 --> 34:53.400
And nobody else. This is just based on this week's performance this week's race this week Jeff did record

34:54.480 --> 34:56.160
The pit wall

34:56.160 --> 35:00.480
Misty which is which is a near-impossible task for him to do

35:00.960 --> 35:05.780
That was wasn't that last week. I think that was last week. Okay. That's right for this

35:06.020 --> 35:07.620
Interesting

35:07.620 --> 35:13.780
Yeah, no, I'll take that though because last week we recorded two episodes and Jeff was on both

35:14.980 --> 35:16.980
That's true. Thank you

35:16.980 --> 35:20.900
So I'll give him the points and enjoy the points Jeff. Wonderful to the points

35:23.940 --> 35:25.940
Yeah, I mean I

35:31.220 --> 35:34.700
Well, I mean you guys have anything to add then are you saying you don't want to move on

35:34.700 --> 35:40.780
Has the constructors standing we moved on we did but Murika was like hang on a minute. What just happened?

35:41.420 --> 35:42.620
Erica

35:42.620 --> 35:48.700
Gone she's the fucking what's his name the guy who got shit cannon favorite of Daniel Ricardo because guess who came back to the company

35:48.700 --> 35:50.700
Who we I want back

35:51.740 --> 35:57.500
Let's get Mike back on the fucking you want you want you want Mike to do Erica's job

35:57.900 --> 36:03.780
Mike is my Ricardo right? He's my favorite and I want him back in the game

36:04.020 --> 36:06.020
I don't care if it's in

36:06.500 --> 36:11.380
Casey's shoes because that's kind of who he would replace, but I want to keep Casey I want to keep

36:11.780 --> 36:19.700
Checko let's fucking get Mike comate in the game in Erica's chair in her seat

36:20.820 --> 36:22.340
pile

36:22.340 --> 36:24.340
What

36:26.180 --> 36:28.180
Honestly, I think

36:28.180 --> 36:33.740
I'm nervous and Carlos is in the bottom five right now. I think Erica's got what

36:33.860 --> 36:41.700
One of the worst seats in the office. How so lay out. Yeah, she's closest to the bathroom closest to the kitchen

36:43.060 --> 36:49.860
A lot of fun just two necessities during the day. Yeah, but everybody is is like walking behind her

36:49.860 --> 36:53.860
Yeah, definitely definitely and she could she could choose her seat

36:54.900 --> 37:02.900
Yeah, I mean I think none of the seats in that office are good. I'm gonna be real so every seat in the LA office is like a seat of Williams

37:04.420 --> 37:10.020
I know and then what about and then let's because these are the three main offices if I'm in correct

37:10.020 --> 37:15.460
We've ever gone this is also what I'm like because I feel like the show this show has gotten so far away from what it would be

37:15.460 --> 37:17.060
Again as we talk about that all the time

37:17.380 --> 37:24.260
We do and you're always wrong but continue my whole thing is that I want it to be talking more about the goings on of the network

37:24.260 --> 37:28.420
I want it to be less than half so and I want it to be more like let's hash out

37:29.060 --> 37:36.340
The fucking inner workings, right? I tell you to just sit in the office. Yeah, it's the most

37:37.060 --> 37:40.980
Right, so I don't know what I'm saying the quote-unquote three offices

37:40.980 --> 37:46.180
We have three there's three offices. There's the LA office on Sunset Boulevard

37:46.580 --> 37:51.700
There's the New York office in group sold offices and then there's piles home office

37:51.940 --> 37:54.340
Which is recently changed let's get that address?

37:55.300 --> 37:58.980
You do you don't know it. I think I sent you this listing

37:59.940 --> 38:01.940
Listing

38:01.940 --> 38:09.620
Don't go to house a listing because if you're not gonna make your house a home then your home is the one that I must own

38:10.660 --> 38:12.660
Give it here

38:13.380 --> 38:15.380
Is this the cool down room

38:16.340 --> 38:23.220
Cool down room could be anything we want just like an F1 they talk about whatever they want it's a wax portion exactly right

38:23.300 --> 38:28.180
Cool down, but they're I'm like watching highlights of what they just did yeah

38:29.540 --> 38:31.540
Okay, I have

38:31.540 --> 38:38.900
I have piles address. It's one two four eat a null Rhinebeck, New York one two five seven two. It's not even it

38:41.540 --> 38:43.540
You're right that's Steve voletti

38:44.100 --> 38:52.900
You're just dogs the random per billionaires. Yeah, I don't know that's good. That's good

38:53.700 --> 38:59.700
Steam voletti was a rock a fellow or built to state that's now owned by some tech billionaire

38:59.700 --> 39:01.700
It's like so fucking vast

39:03.540 --> 39:07.540
And the cars on the grid are so fucking

39:08.500 --> 39:10.500
Fast nice

39:10.500 --> 39:14.260
I have to do something else and I start putting together my new vacuum

39:17.140 --> 39:19.140
Why

39:19.140 --> 39:24.180
How do you guys think that the ship all went? I think we should do this again sometime is that fair to say?

39:24.420 --> 39:28.100
What do you guys think I think we might do that? Telling anybody is not like good

39:28.100 --> 39:31.700
I just think we might do it again sometime. Does that make sense what do you guys think

39:32.820 --> 39:34.820
Carlos is out

39:38.020 --> 39:41.220
There's a loudest one I've ever heard I think it was

39:43.060 --> 39:47.700
When you like a podcast you have to take it adapt it to what you can do on your own show

39:48.900 --> 39:54.260
Are you like our podcast? Yes. Wow. That's really nice

39:54.260 --> 39:59.140
It doesn't show by the amount of times that you show up to the recording. Yeah, that's true

40:00.660 --> 40:04.660
And the number of times where you'd pick a time to record and don't show up

40:05.460 --> 40:09.220
I thought this went okay, um, I do

40:10.260 --> 40:17.460
Kind of feel confused by your sudden desire to work on marketing the pit wall

40:19.780 --> 40:22.260
In a way that is not useful at all

40:22.820 --> 40:25.460
I guess I appreciate the effort and

40:25.460 --> 40:27.300
It's not useful at all

40:27.300 --> 40:31.300
You know how many people are gonna start listening to the pit walkers of this it might be

40:31.620 --> 40:35.140
But that's and that's that's something. You know, you know, I started listening at it

40:35.140 --> 40:39.940
What is arguably the most boring part of the most boring season in recent memory so yeah

40:39.940 --> 40:46.740
Because it's already even decided basically no, but hey, hey, hey, whoa, hey, but we're gonna have a bunch of great guests

40:47.140 --> 40:52.820
For the first time ever that's true. Yeah, Riley's gonna be on Tuesday's episode that I think comes out next

40:53.940 --> 41:00.020
Tuesday's Wednesday some shit. Yeah, but no, but this what we're doing right now doesn't come out today, right?

41:00.740 --> 41:03.700
No, this comes out next Friday next week. Okay, so

41:07.700 --> 41:09.700
The most recent

41:09.700 --> 41:17.620
Hot this episode definitely definitely because it's one thing about this show is that everyone loves Riley

41:18.500 --> 41:23.060
So if you love Riley go listen to that episode of the pit wall. Yeah, and if you love me

41:23.060 --> 41:25.620
I'm also on the pit wall. Well, and also

41:25.620 --> 41:32.260
I'm actually with Riley. Yeah, you haven't come for an RSVP. Oh, I'm there

41:34.020 --> 41:36.420
That means nothing. Yeah, I don't think you're

41:38.500 --> 41:45.140
But hey, look if you are like I don't know anything about for me the one I don't know what anyone just talked about for the last

41:45.140 --> 41:51.380
Hour of this show which honestly is nothing new because it's kind of unintelligible on its best day

41:51.620 --> 41:55.940
Uh, you can listen to Riley's episode of the pit wall and

41:56.820 --> 42:00.420
Be in her shoes because she doesn't know anything about formula watching it for the first time

42:03.940 --> 42:05.940
Keep that one delete all the other

42:13.940 --> 42:16.900
Actually, no, sorry before we do that before we do that

42:17.140 --> 42:21.380
Uh, let's wrap out wrap up the

42:23.060 --> 42:28.980
Adaptation of the pit wall and the shit wall. Would you say that this week at headgum was a push push or a box box?

42:29.860 --> 42:31.860
Give it a box box

42:33.460 --> 42:40.260
Okay, well, you usually have to give an explanation. Yeah, I mean, I feel like there are a lot of people out

42:41.220 --> 42:46.740
Yeah, uh, it's kind of just like I've got a lot of dummy males

42:49.300 --> 42:51.300
Stop

42:51.300 --> 42:53.300
That one's so bad

42:53.300 --> 42:56.420
It sounds like we're listening to pile being waterboarded

42:57.060 --> 43:01.140
What that episode sounded like too by the way the whole thing not even just that moment

43:03.300 --> 43:05.940
What a dumbest smell I got yeah

43:06.900 --> 43:11.300
Or a black or a text billing stuff got it

43:13.380 --> 43:17.140
I'll get a push push. I kind of like it's not everyone is here

43:17.700 --> 43:21.780
So I kind of don't have to be in as many zoom calls, which is nice

43:25.220 --> 43:31.380
I'll give it a push push. I can't speak for the whole company. I really don't know

43:31.780 --> 43:33.060
Uh

43:33.060 --> 43:38.500
Really what's happening outside of production all that well and you never need to that's the seamless

43:39.300 --> 43:42.500
Or production never stops. That's the thing that people don't understand about

43:42.500 --> 43:45.940
Yeah, it's never starts you have to keep going

43:46.020 --> 43:48.980
There's a holiday this week guess what the episode still goes out

43:49.460 --> 43:52.500
It's new years guess what the episode still goes out

43:52.900 --> 43:56.020
It never stops and this was a push push this week

43:56.340 --> 44:02.420
Definitely I'm gonna say box box. I don't like the episode of the hedging podcast that came out this week

44:04.500 --> 44:10.900
And heard it yeah, um, and there's just been I don't know it's just been an off week. I feel why don't you like it

44:12.020 --> 44:14.020
It was me

44:14.020 --> 44:19.380
We'll no will second time being on it wasn't bad. There were some laugh out loud moments for sure

44:19.380 --> 44:23.380
But I just didn't like it we just wasn't a great one sometimes we have hits, you know

44:23.620 --> 44:27.780
I feel like every month there's one hit and I feel like that's a good ratio enough

44:28.340 --> 44:33.540
Ideally there'd be two next year maybe next year will go for two per month. Yeah, but yeah, so you

44:34.740 --> 44:40.100
You know what goes into making a good podcast and you choose not to do it? No, the honestly the issue and this is real

44:40.100 --> 44:43.300
And that maybe this just qualifies me from being a host, but I'm like

44:43.860 --> 44:47.140
I don't know what goes into a good episode because some I've said this already

44:47.140 --> 44:52.580
But I'm like sometimes I really prepare and I'm like this is gonna be great and it just isn't and it and then other times

44:52.660 --> 44:58.500
I'm like this is gonna be a fucking disaster and it's a hit. I'll tell you why when you prepare and you think it's gonna be great

44:58.500 --> 45:02.500
And it isn't I'll tell you exactly why it isn't it's because we don't know

45:03.540 --> 45:06.740
If you're gonna like pull a knife or gun on us

45:08.980 --> 45:13.940
We started this episode and I was like is he gonna? I thought it was to be one of the

45:14.500 --> 45:19.300
I thought it's gonna be one of the episodes where we had to listen to the entire podcast and comment on it

45:19.380 --> 45:25.620
I don't think I'm gonna ever do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, here's the thing right that so there's that

45:26.020 --> 45:29.700
This show started out with like no listeners just like any show

45:29.940 --> 45:34.500
But it was like we had the freedom to fuck up and now I feel like there's this pressure to not fuck up

45:34.820 --> 45:40.420
Because we're getting it. We're booking ad packages out the wazoo for stuff like see the thing is

45:41.380 --> 45:44.420
A meninist podcast for the road slash ages

45:45.140 --> 45:50.260
By the way, I get brand vetted requests all the time for things that I'm like why would I say no to that?

45:50.260 --> 45:54.820
And then I have to start reading these podcast ads for see the thing is where it's like

45:55.380 --> 45:58.420
Wanna hear a show that doesn't bash men and

45:58.980 --> 46:02.660
Only hears from the two genders that exist. I'm just like

46:04.660 --> 46:09.620
Copy your reading. Yes, basically. I mean, it's not that bad, but that's the essence of it

46:09.620 --> 46:11.940
And I'm like I this should have been vetted

46:12.420 --> 46:16.660
Anyway, I have a job. Yeah, sales team and then you know what that might have to push

46:17.380 --> 46:21.700
I love Alex, but she might have to be she might have to be the Williams of the week

46:22.260 --> 46:29.380
Anyway, actually know the little I can't say that so you can't say that so here's the end segment of the shfucking thing push push box box

46:29.380 --> 46:31.380
We jog ball just did that now

46:31.540 --> 46:32.740
It's

46:32.740 --> 46:34.100
No, we're not calling

46:34.100 --> 46:36.100
No, no, no, not people

46:36.180 --> 46:38.180
Okay

46:38.180 --> 46:40.180
Well, it can be if you want

46:40.180 --> 46:44.580
Basically we do two we get out two awards to the to racers to drivers

46:44.980 --> 46:48.660
There's how do you the week and then there's a little bit of a day so

46:49.540 --> 46:54.020
I'm a pill wall. We do that. Yeah on the pit wall. So now on the shit wall. Let's do that for the people at the company

46:56.020 --> 47:01.220
How do you the week? I'm gonna have to give to me because I thought this was a fun little crossover episode

47:01.220 --> 47:03.780
It was kind of like that's so sweet life of Hannah Montana

47:04.340 --> 47:06.980
I wish I wish I wish

47:07.700 --> 47:14.820
Off remember do you remember the last time you you asked us all to be on the head gump podcast because you asked

47:15.060 --> 47:20.820
Specifically for the pit wall crew and we hadn't recorded an episode of the pit wall yet and we needed to and I

47:21.540 --> 47:24.500
My plan was to just do the pit wall during the head gump podcast

47:24.900 --> 47:29.300
I remember that for that everyone's a bell for sure. Yeah, and then then you're doing that now today

47:29.620 --> 47:32.420
Correct, I believe that was called worst episode ever volume four

47:34.340 --> 47:38.980
Actually tile you might be my hot-day of the day actually because this is the first time you've been on the show in a while

47:38.980 --> 47:40.980
That it hasn't been worst episode ever

47:40.980 --> 47:42.340
Well

47:42.340 --> 47:44.340
We have a name to yeah

47:44.340 --> 47:48.260
No, this is gonna be the shit wall. I actually have a name. Oh, okay. Great

48:00.020 --> 48:05.620
How do you the week? I'm giving it to me for coming up with this idea y'all go who are your hobbies of the week?

48:06.900 --> 48:10.580
Usually it's because these drivers are like dimes, but let's just fucking figure the shit out

48:13.860 --> 48:15.860
My hot-day of the week is

48:16.100 --> 48:20.100
um

48:22.100 --> 48:24.100
Marty why

48:26.500 --> 48:28.500
He hasn't been at the office all week

48:28.500 --> 48:30.500
uh

48:31.940 --> 48:36.100
His car is really loud and any parts are right next to the studio

48:38.100 --> 48:40.100
That's so cool

48:41.060 --> 48:43.060
Uh

48:43.060 --> 48:45.060
Why does I make him the hot-y?

48:45.060 --> 48:47.060
Because he wasn't here in the

48:47.060 --> 48:54.180
I think it wasn't a case like that as well recording podcasts in the podcast recording studio definitely yeah

48:55.940 --> 48:59.940
My hot-day of the week is going to be

49:01.620 --> 49:02.740
Uh

49:02.740 --> 49:06.820
Probably the snacks that we bought for the New York

49:07.460 --> 49:11.140
Stadium this week. What do you got? We want to try to Joe's

49:12.500 --> 49:15.940
That's like you said that like he went to you. Yeah. Well, what do you have?

49:17.060 --> 49:22.420
Like little peanut butter cup. We got the low-tay dipers. We've got little peanut butter cups for sure

49:22.420 --> 49:26.820
They're in the fridge. That's where we keep them. Oh, yeah. We got spiced apple cider

49:27.140 --> 49:32.180
I really like this energy from Casey of him exhaustedly being like what do you have?

49:32.820 --> 49:34.820
It's like kids

49:34.820 --> 49:40.020
Children with talent in New York office because what we have in the L.A. office is so bad. It's so bad. It's so bad at the L

49:40.020 --> 49:43.540
It's not that you put in your water. Yeah

49:45.140 --> 49:46.740
What

49:46.740 --> 49:49.140
How are you put in your water? Yeah, you're in

49:49.140 --> 49:55.060
I put some straw to my water yesterday. That was water melon flavor. It was like this kind of tastes like watermelon

49:55.060 --> 49:59.380
But it tastes like I'm drinking good glassful of salt water. Yeah, correct all man

49:59.460 --> 50:03.540
It's I like on it. It's an appetite suppressant because we can't afford the snack

50:06.660 --> 50:11.220
We got ships. We got like pirates booty. We got lots of

50:12.740 --> 50:15.140
Like little trail mugs packets

50:16.020 --> 50:21.060
Just right. I wish I had a snack. Yeah, we got this fucking waste man. It's crazy

50:22.100 --> 50:27.860
Like peanut butter jelly dipers that will request did from Trader Joe's what does he do?

50:27.940 --> 50:35.460
He just moved to New York and he's fucking dominating the place. Oh, no, I mean, it was so hot. I really yes really

50:36.340 --> 50:41.140
Yeah, I'm my kid sent on my lap and watched like the first lap with me

50:41.540 --> 50:44.740
Which is always fun because if there's gonna be a good lap

50:46.500 --> 50:51.540
Good lap good lap. That was a wholesome moment. You're turning it into something else. I don't know what

50:51.940 --> 50:53.940
I don't like it

50:53.940 --> 50:57.220
Sexual or anything. It's just that you know here

50:59.220 --> 51:02.020
Was saying that no, but to me. It's funny because it's just

51:03.460 --> 51:08.580
What first love the way how many times I say laughs always fun because if there's going to be a go crashing is we gonna

51:09.460 --> 51:11.460
Sings lap

51:12.100 --> 51:17.060
Right and direct an episode. What do you mean by that? I don't really know yet, but I think it'd be fun

51:17.940 --> 51:19.940
we'll talk

51:20.500 --> 51:22.500
Right

51:23.460 --> 51:28.260
Um, my little bit to the day is gonna be RSS feeds. Why is that?

51:29.300 --> 51:31.860
They're just causing me problems. Oh, yeah, man

51:33.780 --> 51:38.340
Yeah, brother. We got it. We got to find a better way. Hey, man, brother. Thanks

51:40.020 --> 51:42.980
Okay, a little bit to the day. Pile you

51:43.860 --> 51:45.860
What's that

51:46.420 --> 51:48.420
You

51:50.020 --> 51:52.020
Why

51:53.460 --> 51:55.860
We're doing this to us

51:59.300 --> 52:01.620
I'll take it share yeah sure

52:02.740 --> 52:07.540
You'll take any award anyone's willing to give you, huh? Exactly right as long as I'm being thought of

52:08.180 --> 52:10.180
I'm relevant

52:11.940 --> 52:13.940
Mine is gonna be

52:15.860 --> 52:18.340
I had an answer for this. I think it's gonna be

52:19.300 --> 52:21.300
oh

52:21.860 --> 52:23.860
You know who it is

52:23.860 --> 52:25.700
And I hate to do this, but it's gonna be Katie

52:28.020 --> 52:33.780
Yeah, wait for this. We've been I've been trying to force the issue on a headgun podcast live show

52:33.780 --> 52:35.780
No, don't even spin dart

52:35.780 --> 52:37.300
Don't even start once

52:37.300 --> 52:38.980
No, it's been a waiting

52:38.980 --> 52:40.980
No, it's a request for a slap

52:40.980 --> 52:42.580
No, it's going to happen

52:42.580 --> 52:48.260
No, you have an arm you bumped Katie in a private chat and she just

52:48.580 --> 52:55.300
Directed you to the chat that we started with you to approve a bunch of no, no, I approved it

52:55.620 --> 52:57.060
Four weeks ago

52:57.060 --> 53:03.620
Why did you you did not need me to be like these venues are great? I said they were great like weeks ago

53:04.180 --> 53:09.380
I heard a red herring for the fucking reason why nobody's reached out

53:09.620 --> 53:13.380
Nobody needed to wait for me to say yeah these 30 venues are good

53:13.380 --> 53:17.700
I'll I've been saying for months is that I want to do a headgun podcast live show

53:17.700 --> 53:20.260
That's bullshit and also that's such a casual thing

53:20.260 --> 53:22.500
Alley said on Monday, September 25th

53:22.500 --> 53:26.020
Let me know if there any others you like me to add and we can begin reaching out to check-a-vails

53:26.020 --> 53:29.380
I'm like you don't need me to say there's already 40 venues

53:29.380 --> 53:32.740
You don't need to be need me to be like can you add to the eye when someone is like

53:33.380 --> 53:36.020
Let me know they do need you to say something

53:38.020 --> 53:41.460
I'm gonna start reaching out and let me know if there are any that you need me to add

53:41.540 --> 53:47.700
There's no reason you need me to sign off on these 30 venues to start reaching out

53:47.700 --> 53:52.500
So everyone in that slack that goes not on yeah on you's been really trying to make it happen

53:52.900 --> 53:56.420
Ali Kady and Marika are the little bitches of the day

53:58.100 --> 54:02.340
Insane absolutely yeah fuck fuck off

54:03.380 --> 54:09.780
I knelt down on my job being a little bit too bad. Yeah, I'm actually changing my analysis feeds are good in comparison

54:12.420 --> 54:18.820
Honestly the out of context headgun podcast Twitter has been kind of dying out with the death of X

54:19.140 --> 54:24.260
But I feel like that would be a pull quote is RSS feeds are nothing compared to the judge

54:24.980 --> 54:27.620
Anyway, we do have to get the fuck out of here

54:28.340 --> 54:32.420
Got hey, paypile. We're sorry wait. Where do we are?

54:33.060 --> 54:35.060
Where do I find like

54:37.540 --> 54:39.060
Great question pile

54:39.060 --> 54:41.060
Thank you

54:41.460 --> 54:43.460
Just

54:43.460 --> 54:45.460
Read us five stars

54:45.460 --> 54:51.620
Yep, and then sorry before just before everybody else does their plugs. Let's let's listen listen very closely to what Marika says right here

54:51.620 --> 54:53.620
Where do I find like

54:54.340 --> 54:56.340
You find a podcast

54:58.100 --> 54:59.780
Apple

54:59.780 --> 55:01.940
Fudge is not still to anywhere

55:01.940 --> 55:03.940
Apple pod just

55:04.500 --> 55:09.540
Okay, all right. He was saying apple pod cast and then just

55:11.700 --> 55:17.060
And I thought that was kind of interesting you're reaching you are reaching plugs

55:18.500 --> 55:20.100
At Jeffrey jibbs on Instagram

55:20.100 --> 55:28.100
Riley and I have a patreon that I've haven't plugged in like a year, but it's patreon.com for his last Riley and Jeff and I think we're gonna start adding a new perk there

55:28.100 --> 55:30.100
So stay tuned

55:30.100 --> 55:36.580
I don't think I've ever seen a podcast podcast host say plugs and immediately plug their own stuff like

55:37.380 --> 55:39.380
Immediately after saying

55:41.620 --> 55:43.620
You talking about

55:45.220 --> 55:47.220
This is the pit wall

55:47.220 --> 55:54.420
A part of Formula One podcast for casual fans hosted by Casey and kind of me and piles there

55:54.740 --> 56:02.660
No, me and Marika have done every episode. Yes, uh, and these two guys have done a bunch of episodes and Jake has done the least amount of episodes

56:02.660 --> 56:04.660
But he had it kid. Yeah

56:06.900 --> 56:08.900
Follow me at Marika alone

56:09.620 --> 56:12.020
On every possible social media platform

56:12.020 --> 56:14.020
But literally letter boxed

56:15.060 --> 56:19.700
Really want to get to a thousand and I'm like 30 away. Let's go

56:20.740 --> 56:22.740
Tired of begging

56:22.740 --> 56:27.620
It's not that hard to follow someone on letter box. I fall Marika on letter box

56:28.900 --> 56:32.020
Um, yeah, that's true. What happens when you get to it though?

56:33.140 --> 56:35.300
What happens when I get to a thousand then I'll start

56:35.380 --> 56:37.380
Invited to a screening of

56:37.700 --> 56:41.940
Killers of the flower moon. Wow. Well, seriously. Um, no

56:42.820 --> 56:44.820
I just want the fame and I want the glory

56:45.940 --> 56:47.940
Oh, it's

56:47.940 --> 56:49.940
There's I follow the pit wall

56:50.820 --> 56:53.140
On Instagram and Tik Tok

56:53.140 --> 56:56.100
That pit wall pod. Can we do a live streamed

56:56.980 --> 56:58.980
Watch along of a

56:59.700 --> 57:04.100
Race I feel like I've got I've got all sorts of ideas. Yeah

57:05.940 --> 57:07.940
Bye, what do you got?

57:08.420 --> 57:11.220
Uh, I don't need to plug anything. I'm good. You don't want to plug your dress?

57:12.260 --> 57:18.660
Nope. Sure. Yep. His address is gumball.fm tray. I thought it was

57:20.660 --> 57:22.660
Fuck you

57:30.340 --> 57:32.340
Wonderful

57:33.220 --> 57:40.660
And we'll see did everybody get their plugs in? Casey Casey. Uh, yeah follow follow follow me on Instagram atcase.au

57:41.220 --> 57:44.260
I don't really I don't post on x anymore

57:45.060 --> 57:48.420
Threads ain't it. I'll never join blue sky

57:49.620 --> 57:55.220
I'm on letter box, but I I haven't been using it all that much recently. I kind of got overwhelmed with

57:55.220 --> 58:00.980
I I was trying to log every single movie I watch and then I kind of got tired of doing that so

58:01.540 --> 58:07.380
Haven't I only really log the new movies that I go see in the in the theater, but I but I do go

58:08.180 --> 58:10.580
See a lot of like repertory theaters

58:10.980 --> 58:19.220
That there was a lot in that way and I like to go to those screenings and I and I don't really log those on letter box, but I think I might start using it to

58:19.460 --> 58:26.500
Just the day just yeah, well, yeah, I think I might just start logging only things I watch and then we're like what are you talking about?

58:27.140 --> 58:33.780
That's what I started how I started using it. I didn't log things I watched at home, but then during the pandemic I switched and I made a rule

58:33.780 --> 58:41.620
I have to review every movie with a star rating for myself. Oh, I hate doing the stars

58:41.940 --> 58:45.860
It's a personal a personal thing. I don't I don't want to give any movie a star rating

58:47.460 --> 58:50.980
Because I you know I I will give us a movie a star rating and then I'll all

58:51.700 --> 58:57.700
Like look at that rating years later and go like I don't agree it three stars. This is a five star movie. What was I thinking you know

58:59.060 --> 59:01.060
And sometimes I change mine

59:01.860 --> 59:03.860
It's all subjective

59:06.420 --> 59:07.700
A little bit of the day to y'all

59:08.900 --> 59:10.900
That's fine

59:10.900 --> 59:12.900
It's ultimately your overruled

59:13.860 --> 59:15.860
By how many of us chose you

59:21.620 --> 59:23.620
You

59:35.060 --> 59:37.060
That was a hit them original

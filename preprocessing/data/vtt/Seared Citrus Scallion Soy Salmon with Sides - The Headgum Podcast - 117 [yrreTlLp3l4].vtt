00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Amir needs headphones.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
He's not ready.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
13 minutes late is my threshold.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
He was in a waiting room.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
It's your fault.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Wow.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Yeah.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
I wasn't ready.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
This is all too sudden.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
This is all too subtle.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
It's not.

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
I'm going to have to like come back and leave and go and like deal with other shit now because you didn't want to wait.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Do you guys know about a huddle?

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
So we're just straight into it.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
It's like that.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
High school football.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
No, it's like a high school football.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
High light reel for people who aren't ever going to be recruited.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
So my pitch is subtle.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
SUDL.com.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
And it's like highlight reels where like you're not really showing any overt athletic ability.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
But you know, you know, the intangibles are off the charts.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
But you're going to say.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
You're not really showing any ass.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
What was last time Brad showed crack.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Did you think that rhymed?

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Brad Street crack.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
All right.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
We're really into it today.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
I was just telling Brad and Angelina or Symerika that.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
I'm just like I'm living in and the Hollywood Hills now.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Angelina Jolie now.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
It's this is huge.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Angelina Jolie.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
No.

01:41.000 --> 01:49.000
Well, I was going to tell a mirror that I was talking to you guys about how I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
The highest energy I've had in weeks for this show and otherwise.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
If you say that most are least.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
What's that?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
He said the highest.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
So obviously, you should know what that means.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Oh, I was dead.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Yeah.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
He was running into the heat today.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Angelina, bring it back.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
I'm here.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
What was like?

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
What was last night like for you in the in the blue man ash household?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I played online poker with my friends.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
As I've done every Sunday since the pandemic started.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Okay.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Did you are you up?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
I won last night.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
No, not money.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
I mean, like you up.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Like am I awake?

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Sure.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
This is the highest energy you've been in a while.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Um.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah, it was until I started talking to you.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Yeah.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Take it away.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
More specific.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
I need a little help.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
I knew it was.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
You want me to host the show?

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
A little bit, like just chiming and keeping the flow going.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Because I feel like a mirror's already coming with this energy here.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Like was in the waiting room for a while, he said.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I didn't see a notification pop up on Zoom.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
There's no way I could have known.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Marie was also in the waiting room, right?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
No.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
I didn't hear.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Listen to them to talk about listening to them to talk.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Oh my god.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Oh my god.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Oh my god.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
We got to start over tomorrow.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
They were talking about watch.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
That was easy.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
We were talking about watches.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Um.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Brad's a dog.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Um.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Uh, Brad's a hoarder.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
If not a border of dog.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
And she is a colleague.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Border.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Or otherwise.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
A Jacob Colley.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Coolie.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
A Dave Collier.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
See your house.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I didn't do anything.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I should prepared.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
I asked you how your night wasn't the Blumen Ash household.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
You said you did online poker.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
You said you were up.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
And then I asked if you were awake.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
And somehow that's where it went off the rail.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Yeah.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
I'm not going to have this by the way.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
I've been experiencing a lot of career success outside of the podcast.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
That I'm not going to talk about.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
No.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
What does it need hard proof?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Really.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
What have you done well?

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Well, I've been like thinking about a pilot.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Okay.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
That's cool.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
It's cool.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
But I wouldn't say that it's career success, right?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Really.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Because I have to go to like aviation school.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Oh, you're not even actually being a flyer of a plane.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
You mean, or at least a flight attendant.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
That seems from my limited research a little easier.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
The issue would be that you're kind of on the plane for multiple hours a week.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
And I can't take that time with this show.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
Because even when I'm not recording this show, editing this show or outlining the episodes,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
you know, it's all writing.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
It's all material.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
You know, so I'll go to like a diner, right?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I have breakfast for dinner.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
And that's me working on the show.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
That's billable.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I'll put those hours on my fucking time card.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I wouldn't.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Yeah.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
We're definitely not paying for you to go to a diner.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
That's true.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
But let's take it one step further.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
All right.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Ken Keesie style.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
I'm at the diner.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
I'm talking to somebody about the show.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
And I just put that on to my time card as a company expense.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
That gets taken off to access at you.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
No.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Really.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Yeah.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Travel for the show, maybe, but you have never done that.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
But if I go to like a fucking Juno, right?

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
If I go to a Tempy, that's all material.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
The show doesn't happen with.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Where's Juno?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Oh, ask.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
You think you'd go to there for the show?

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
I mean, Maggie Rogers did a nose trip and it kind of got a hit record.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
I wonder if I do a nose trip and I get a hit record.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Oh, my god.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
That was really fucking good.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Damn it.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Speaking of Omega.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I think I'll go leave pace.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Yeah, I know.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
I know.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Just thinking outside the bun for a minute.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
I would go pace.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
How's it?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Yeah.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Mariko who you got.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Yeah.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
What?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Can you unpack that a little bit while you pass?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Yeah.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
It just feels like he's in the ether slash zeitgeist.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
And it does seem to be the summer of Lee.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Yeah.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
I'm using like old Wranglers with a wee logo.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
It's a summer of Lee.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
I forgot.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
That was an asling brand.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
The Bruce Springsteen as shot.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
No, I saw body's body's body's recently.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
And I'll be tall loved Lee pace.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
And she's like, I've always had a huge crush on this guy.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
And now he's back in this.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
I guess she liked him and pushing up daisies.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
And I'm like.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Oh, yeah, pushing daisies.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
I'm never really heard of this guy.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
And then all of a sudden, Marika makes him.

07:29.000 --> 07:36.000
His, no, Marika made Lee pace's photo or slack biopic profile.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
And so like, maybe this is the summer of Lee.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
He's always I'm always changing out my slack photos for various men in photo shoots.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
And I've never known who they are until this one.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
I, uh, I think we all need to pace ourselves with Lee.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Uh, because, you know, he was on a game of thrones.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
He was on body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
And I feel like that's a little bit.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
He was on a game of thrones.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
He was on a game of thrones.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
He was on a game of thrones.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
He was on a game of thrones.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
He was on a game of thrones.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Did you see bodies, bodies, bodies?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Marika?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Did you like it?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
I haven't seen it yet.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
Now he was in, um, scared of horror movies.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
So I'm a little worried.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
I'm going to be scared.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
But my friend said that it's not that scary, so.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Yeah, it's more like a comedy.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
Pete Davidson style cool young kids doing funny drug stuff.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
What are you?

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
They're having, like, it's like, shows.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Who do you?

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
About fucking, yeah.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Who?

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
Sorry, what'd you say Angelina?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
What was, what did you?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
You thought he was on Game of Thrones.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
But who were you thinking of?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
He was him.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
But he was in, uh, the Hobbit.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Yes, he was.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
And, fun fact.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
In McEllen, outed him in Richard Armageddon.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
They were on the Hobbit.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
As in Lion's Gate.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
I'm sorry.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
I haven't told anyone that yet.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah, they, they like hadn't.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Come out and.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Is it like a run like Retributive Act?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Hmm.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Is that a word?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Retributive?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
No way.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I was just going to like that.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
One to two more extra syllables for sure.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
It's a Retributive Retributive.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Yeah.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Retributive?

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Yeah.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Retributive?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Retributive?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Retributive?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Retributive?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Thumbs up.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
But, too.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
That's good.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
That's good.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
That's good.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
That's good.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
What?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
It was kind of good.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Anyway.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
No, it was.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
You allow it.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
No, Ian McEllen, like, was doing an interview.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
And just casually mentioned that they were like young, he was like,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
and the young gay man working on this film.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
It's great.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
And they hadn't come back.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Okay.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
So it wasn't Retributive.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Retributive?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Retributive?

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
Is it possible for there to be a gas leak in a zoom call?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Because now I'm getting it.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Yeah.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Yeah.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
It's a key to violence.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Yeah.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Well, I was trying to lean.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Well, I was trying to lean.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Very good.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Asked me if I had any symptoms lingering

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
from my third bout with COVID.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
And I was like, I think I have a little bit of brain fog.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
But also I haven't been like sleeping that much.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
And I've moved.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
And, you know, so I'm all turned around.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I wake up in a room that I'm not used to.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I'm, you know, last night I got four hours of sleep.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
And then last night, also before that,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I was, I cooked dinner.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
And then I was like painting in my living room.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Shout out art.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
And George walks in.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
He gets home.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
He walks into the kitchen.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
And he walks into the living room.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
He's like, hey, just so you know, like,

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
there was a burner on in here for like a minute.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
So I was right.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Yeah.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
So he's like, just in case you feel a little gassy.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
And I was like, well, it'd be gassy and more than two ways then.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
That's good.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
What you're making for this?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
It's for dinner.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Really?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
That was asking you.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
I made, uh, oh my god.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I made, uh, do you guys have nothing fancy?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
The Alison Roman cookbook that everybody has?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Just say we know.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Fuck you.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Just do.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Just do.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
No.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
She has this citrus soy scallion salmon.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
And.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
And.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Sitchy soy scallion.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
It's not available.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
You can make it in 20 minutes, Brad.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
And it's, uh, of it.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
What are you talking about?

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Sate on the, on the stovetop with the.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Are you bakes?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Okay.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
You, you make the, the sauce on the skillet.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Yeah.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
And you make the sauce with the citrus soy salmon.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
And you make the sauce.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Same as in the stove.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Or on the salmon on the stove with the skin.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Sitchy soy sauce.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
The salmon's on the oven.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
And then you're glazing at every five to ten minutes.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
What's on the stove?

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
Just with the citrus soy salmon with the scallions on the skin.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
All right.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
The salmon.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
We have sauce on the skin.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Already for salmon.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
The salmon.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Switches the skin size.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
On parchment paper.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
On parchment paper.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
On parchment paper.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
On saran rat.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
All right.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
And melted plastic.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Yeah.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Also not good for you.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
It's unbelievably good.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
You can make it in 20 minutes.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Highly recommend.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
You don't need the cookbook to get it.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Just look up.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Uh, citrus.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Good boy.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Salad.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Salad.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Just.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I pulled down the letter S on your keyboard.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
It's a little steak emerges from your fucking laptop.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Any sides?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I did.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Salad.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Thanks.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Salad.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Salad.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Salad.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Salad.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Salad.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Yeah.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
This is the funniest bit that's ever occurred on this show.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
It's basically meant for three year olds.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
This is a fucking children's cookbook and we're dying.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Yeah.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Like a baby would be like.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
Because all the sounds are same as similar sounds with a soy salmon skin.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
The sauce on the side and a salad.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Um, I, I had a good tweet the other day.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
I'm just going to blow up my own spot here for a spell.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Oh, I'm going to have these.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Did you say buy?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Yeah, I say it's going to head out.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
You got hungry.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
It's just a plug.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
I'm, I'm 200 away from 10,000 followers.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
Uh, babies really only eat sides until they're like four.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Yeah.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Are we still doing bond of the week?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Yes.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
What's your bond of the week?

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Oh, you.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Me.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Jeff is Jeffrey James.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Oh, nice diversity higher.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Oh, you said you've been having a lot of wind's career.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Why is I figured.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Sorry.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I'm throwing you a mountain.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
It's time for a clumsy dumbass.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Bye.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Uh, thanks for loving me up.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
I guess I'll be on a veils and then come second to my pick, which is Margo Robby.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
It's time for a James blonde.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Hmm.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
Um,

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
I'm going to go with my pick.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
Uh, it's going to Matt Smith because I'm looking at a photo of him right now.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Who?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I think he's not handsome enough.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
The old doctor who.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
I don't know if you can be doctor who and James Bond that feels like you've done too much.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
And you're paying playing Princess Diana's or not Princess Diana.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
Fucking the queen of England's old husband.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Darius.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
That's that's your last straw.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Darius.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
You're on the crown as is every other British version.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Darius King.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Darius Rucker.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Um, low fish.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
Oh, Matt Smith was in American psych of the musical playing Patrick Bateman.

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
I feel like that's sort of in line with James Bond.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Like cool.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Kind of weird guy.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Yeah.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Uh, let's move on for sure.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
Uh, what do you guys have any style swirves that you want to like incorporate into your

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
steas on the reg slash rag?

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
I just bought a pair of red pants.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Perfect.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
I like the side man.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Red pants crimson.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I want me to get them.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Yeah.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Jo and tell.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
I also just got some new pants that are printed.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
They have a print.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Daniel Johnston.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Is that a brand?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
No.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
It's a musician here.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
I'll go get mine too.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Everyone just leave.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Okay.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I can go get my actually.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Yeah, I do have one.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
Oh, boy.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
This is kind of American takes the reins.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Um.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Oh, no.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Jeff is back.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
And I don't really have anything to say.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
This is the perfect segment for a mirror to miss because you would just bring back some like

16:12.000 --> 16:18.000
linen shorts.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
Those are very fun.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Oh, check the pants man.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Where do you get those from?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Vans.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Like vans the shoe company or.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Uh huh.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Yeah.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
You're fun.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Thanks.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
These are these are my red pants.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
These are.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
They're work pants.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Got a little flare to them.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
A nice deep pocket.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Big bud press.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Big bud press.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
That's an LA brand.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
My friend works there.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Yeah.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
They just opened a storefront in New York.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
So I was trying a bunch of stuff for once.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Green point.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Oh, it's a.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Lowery side.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
That makes 90 something orchard street.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Oh, shit.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
He's back.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Hmm.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
It's kind of like um.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Jesus.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Yeah.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Uh, I was going more for like a.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
God.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
What's his name from almost famous.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Patrick fugit.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
There's no way.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
I've returned to say that.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Jvaki was right.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
It's not the actor.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
I was thinking of, but it was Patrick fugit.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Uh, I'm going to head out for another 15.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
All right.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Yeah.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
God sense.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
Coming back for one more fugit based joke.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
You know, why don't we just say fugit and move on to the next thing.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Uh, what about this?

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Patrick fugitive for a game.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
A segment for next week.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Sorry.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Is it called the Amir podcast?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
No.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Is it called the Jeffrey podcast?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
It's called the head gum podcast.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Great.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
And I want head gum is it.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Let's all work together.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Three.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Yeah.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Oh shit.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Oh shit.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Uh.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
What about investing in art?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Did I miss anything?

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
Or was that also a proposal of nothing to you, too?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
No, we showed each other a pants.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Yeah.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Well, there's my question.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
There's my fucking question.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
Why would anyone ever buy the original of something?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Right?

18:28.000 --> 18:37.000
Like a print of a Jasper Johns is the same thing you're seeing with your gaping eyes.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Not really, right?

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Really?

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
Well, Jasper Johns, like, I mean, I don't know.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
You probably get the original because you want to see up close.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
The artistry of it.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Yeah.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
But I was painting last night and I basically ripped off Jasper Johns.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Because I want to see.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Is this the same paint as the living room paint?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Yeah.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
And I'm painting like art.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
You were just coding your walls.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
No, I was painting art on the wall.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
How can it?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Nobody ever said anything about the wall.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
It was a painting in your living room.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And we know you just moved.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
So that's why we all, at least both of them here.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
And I assumed you were painting your house.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
I was with you.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Okay, great.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
So yeah, we're all fine.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Look, this isn't the same.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Were you painting the dinner?

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
Or is that also a weird thing that we misunderstood?

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
I was sculled.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
I was saying from a wall.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I was getting a talk about.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Are you still painting?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Forgetting.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
No, it's too earnest.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I'd like to see it.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
It's not like saying anything.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I just did stream of consciousness art.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Yeah.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
So this isn't so funny.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
It's right.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
It's right.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
What do you guys think he did it with?

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
I wonder if he's like seeing someone, you know?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
The painting?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Yeah.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
I mean, I don't know.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I feel like art should be for yourself.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
First and foremost.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
But I can't imagine he did it by himself.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
It feels like a date night thing.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
And like, yeah.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
And the salmon?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Yeah.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Yes, exactly.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
He's not just having it.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
He's not dating himself.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
They're right.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Yeah.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Although we all should.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
We all should.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
But he doesn't love himself that much.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
That's so fucked.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Why?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Who did you?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Am I doing this?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Oh, you're sort of muted.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
I can't hear you anymore.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Mm-hmm.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
We can't hear you.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Sort of weird.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Time.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
To lose you.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Should we do a crit of this?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
What about now?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Yeah.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
I can't hear you.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
See, like direct Jasper Johns and Matt McCormick rip off.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Further.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
I already made one.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
It's interesting.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Very interesting.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
So I've got this episode too.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
So I might have to cut that out.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
So it doesn't seem like a moment reading one book, which is true.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Jasper Johns, are you saying that?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Because it's like the lines, the primary colors.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Yeah.

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
And then Matt McCormick, because of the sort of beige, red, and black of it all.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
Who did you do art with?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
That's a little personal.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Yeah.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
So is the artwork we've actually got it out of you.

21:29.000 --> 21:39.360
out of you. A close friend. Okay. Say more. No. Did they take their peace home? No,

21:39.360 --> 21:50.160
and I'm not showing theirs. It's a new day. It's a new dawn. It's a new day. And I'm

21:50.160 --> 21:57.080
feeling new. John. What about it? Okay, we forget investing in art. What about investing

21:57.080 --> 22:07.040
cash? So like parking your assets in honestly liquidity that didn't make sense. No, it's

22:07.040 --> 22:20.400
like people always talk about assets. Oh, we do have to take a break, actually. People are

22:20.400 --> 22:24.240
always talking about parking their cash in investments and assets that might appreciate

22:24.240 --> 22:29.760
value. But the strength of the US dollar increases every year with inflation. So I wonder if

22:29.760 --> 22:35.240
you just park your cash in other cash. The rent of the dollar increases with inflation.

22:35.240 --> 22:43.960
Or is it these? Stop. Well, theoretically, if you have $7,000 today and then next year,

22:43.960 --> 22:49.320
that's worth less. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that's increasing.

22:50.280 --> 22:56.320
What's talking about vial vials?

23:01.320 --> 23:07.320
V-I-L-E space V-I-A-L-S. Research.

23:07.320 --> 23:25.960
Oh, yeah. I wonder how many listeners got that, probably under 4%. Okay, so what about a vial

23:25.960 --> 23:35.480
vial of ALS for research? Vial vial. Andrew vial. Just try to put that in the

23:35.480 --> 23:40.800
way. Just try to focus. Man, you're all over the place. All right, this is the last part

23:40.800 --> 23:47.000
of the wax segment. Did you guys have a good summer? Yeah. Summer's not up yet.

23:47.000 --> 23:53.080
Feels over. I'm haggzing at the moment, though. We have summer Fridays for at least two

23:53.080 --> 23:59.120
more Fridays. Do you guys, do you guys stick by the, don't wear white after Labor Day

23:59.120 --> 24:10.320
thing? Or you know, but I also don't wear white bottoms that often. I would say

24:10.320 --> 24:17.400
I have for bottoms. Yeah. Basically, you're like, you know, like full, full body

24:17.400 --> 24:22.800
outfits. It's not really about t-shirts. So you can wear a white t-shirt in November.

24:22.800 --> 24:29.360
So that's fine. I'm totally fine. Oh, it's like Brad's pants. That would be a, that'd

24:29.360 --> 24:38.520
be a bold choice. Andrew, sort of September. Mm-hmm. I haven't done it. I feel like we didn't

24:38.520 --> 24:46.860
spend enough time on vial vials. How else could we have? It was nothing. Really? It was

24:46.900 --> 24:54.820
nothing burger. Instead of a 50 burger. I thought, I mean, we've been doing this show

24:54.820 --> 24:57.660
a couple of weeks where we haven't even talked about anything going on with the network.

24:57.660 --> 25:01.500
And I feel like there's a lot going on. So I thought that we could have sort of a, not necessarily

25:01.500 --> 25:07.100
a state of the gum, because that's for the fall. But, you know, what's going on? What a

25:07.100 --> 25:12.060
y'all specifically working on that you can talk about that you're excited. The start of

25:12.060 --> 25:22.460
America. I mean, I feel like, oh, yeah. All right, whatever. Um, I feel like if I talk,

25:22.460 --> 25:26.940
it's going to like, all of it's going to be over. It's just going to be neat. Like, let's

25:26.940 --> 25:34.300
just let that unfold. We don't have to like start. Yeah. Um, corked just released. Yeah.

25:34.300 --> 25:41.340
Really excited about the second episode will be out when this episode comes out. So you

25:41.420 --> 25:47.420
should listen to it if you haven't already. We also did our first like in studio live stream last week,

25:47.420 --> 25:54.060
which was pretty cool. And hopefully we can do more of those down the line. Um, the New York

25:54.060 --> 26:00.620
studio is almost finished. So it looks great near future. We'll have some recordings in there.

26:01.340 --> 26:07.100
We thought maybe we were going to have one in their last week, but then Jeff canceled on all of us

26:07.100 --> 26:13.980
and then recruited Brad and Casey to record the podcast, but didn't tell any of us until

26:15.260 --> 26:17.820
hours after we were set to record.

26:20.060 --> 26:28.460
Naturally. So on the slide that dig in there. Um, what else are we doing? What else the

26:28.700 --> 26:38.700
depth mess up on? Um, keep your eyes peeled on various feeds because there might be a bonus pilot

26:38.700 --> 26:45.980
episode of a podcast. Oh, coming. Is it the one on the floor? Here I say mirror days after this

26:45.980 --> 26:52.300
comes out. Yeah. So it is the one you're thinking of. Um, and hopefully we can continue making that one

26:52.380 --> 26:59.820
because I think it'll be fun. Hopefully. Yeah. Um, and we're doing sketches,

26:59.820 --> 27:03.980
had them sketches. Hopefully going to start doing some of those on the east coast,

27:05.020 --> 27:12.460
which is really exciting. Yeah. Um, we're also going to be doing a live show in the backyard

27:13.340 --> 27:19.980
on a September 22nd. There's no ticket link yet, but stay tuned for that. Great life.

27:19.980 --> 27:25.500
Hopefully there will be more info. Who's doing that, though? I don't want to say it. I'd rather not

27:25.500 --> 27:31.500
say it. But it's confirmed, but we are going out to some interesting people. Yeah. I think there

27:31.500 --> 27:37.740
are a few confirmations, but we're still finalizing. Yeah. But some of these people's fees are,

27:37.740 --> 27:44.540
you know, unbelievable. Yeah. Yeah. Yours especially. I mean, I got to afford these watches somehow.

27:44.780 --> 27:48.300
Yeah. It's the only thing I care about. Um, um,

27:48.300 --> 27:54.220
Rick, are you going to be in that life for that? Yeah. Marty gave me the okay to fly out. So

27:54.220 --> 28:01.340
wow. See, and that's going to be an expense. Yeah. And a one that one that's allowed for sure.

28:01.340 --> 28:08.460
I'm fucking believable with Marty. I'm sorry. What do you mean? He just never, you know,

28:09.340 --> 28:15.260
he never okay. He's your expenses. He never, okay. He's my expenses. He never, okay. He's my, you know,

28:15.260 --> 28:25.580
extravagant purchases that I, you know, yeah. I guess just expenses, huh? Yeah. All right. We got to move on.

28:26.380 --> 28:26.780
Here we go.

28:27.740 --> 28:43.580
Welcome to Fauci's next chapter. Yubi. Didn't mean that for sure.

28:43.580 --> 28:46.540
Okay. Didn't mean that. Do you want to start over?

28:57.580 --> 29:03.820
Welcome to Fauci's next chapter. Oh, you're going to like this one.

29:06.940 --> 29:12.940
Somehow works. So fucked. Yeah. This is not how it's supposed to be going already.

29:17.580 --> 29:21.180
Welcome to Fauci's next chapter. Come on.

29:21.180 --> 29:30.460
Atcha. Let's keep it moving. Fauci. Dr Anthony Fauci says he will step down and

29:30.460 --> 29:42.060
December to pursue his next chapter acting. I mean, I missed 81. So I don't know what other

29:42.060 --> 29:48.220
next chapters he's planning on, but it does feel like he should maybe just chill. Maybe move to

29:48.220 --> 29:56.140
the main, uh, but I thought that we could maybe kind of like pitch some ideas to Anthony of what his

29:56.140 --> 30:04.940
next chapter could possibly have. Um, I have one. Okay. Yeah. Start us off. Thank you. Should take, um,

30:04.940 --> 30:11.900
improv 101 at ECB. And Marika, that was my first pitch. I want to see Fauci at Cage,

30:11.900 --> 30:22.460
Ratch. Bouchy on a mod team. I honestly mess all or whatever that whole down to your podcast.

30:26.540 --> 30:30.940
You never shut up about podcast. It's like, oh, this person should do this as a podcast. This

30:30.940 --> 30:35.660
person should do that as a podcast. And it's always like a half as a joke. Like it's fucking played out a little bit.

30:36.540 --> 30:41.740
I think, um, Fauci, you get ready with me videos on TikTok.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.820
Oh, wow. Yeah.

30:46.300 --> 30:52.380
Putting makeup on in front of a ringlight, but talking about a fucking date he had last night.

30:52.380 --> 30:54.860
Covering up cigarette burns on his forearms.

30:59.580 --> 31:01.980
You know, my father didn't get too much for me.

31:02.940 --> 31:10.380
Um, who is that? That was my Fauci. You always call me out on my fucking impressions.

31:10.380 --> 31:15.740
I'm not an impressions guy. I'm never going to be. I'm never going to be. So don't go for it.

31:17.020 --> 31:24.780
Um, what about Fauci as like a gap jeans advocate brand ambassador, you know, instead of like

31:24.780 --> 31:32.380
slouchy fit. It's Fauci. God. We're like a dead inch break instead of slouchy fit. It's Fauci.

31:36.380 --> 31:39.900
That's I feel like Dr. Fauci has an Adam and Eve ambassador.

31:43.180 --> 31:47.900
This likes to write company. Yeah. He's sort of latex clad at the stock room.

31:48.460 --> 31:57.900
That's zipper on the crotch and on the stock floor. He's ringing the bell.

31:58.780 --> 32:02.780
Dressed head to toe and plver. We're in the Gordon Deco watch.

32:05.340 --> 32:12.300
Brad, what do you think could be good for Fauci's next chapter? I don't know, children's television.

32:12.300 --> 32:20.300
Sesame Street Oscar the Fouch. Wow. That's good. Oh, there we go. Oscar the Fouchy. I'd love to see Tony and a garbage can

32:21.740 --> 32:25.020
That helps that's supposed to me. I mean is that a threat

32:26.540 --> 32:31.420
Spreading lies as much as I spread legs. We're gonna get another CD. Not that off from this

32:34.140 --> 32:36.940
Okay, yeah, what what about a CDC warning, but it's like

32:37.740 --> 32:39.740
Um

32:40.140 --> 32:42.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah

32:44.780 --> 32:46.780
I was gonna be too blue and not funny

32:47.820 --> 32:51.260
What about Fouchy has a flight attendant just in terms of like how hard could it be?

32:52.460 --> 32:54.940
What's the second time you've brought up being a flight attendant?

32:56.460 --> 33:00.700
Really? Yeah, have you looked into it? Are you intrigued?

33:01.500 --> 33:03.500
Think about some exchange?

33:03.660 --> 33:05.660
Attendant hours

33:06.860 --> 33:14.140
What about salary? Did they get paid hourly or do they just get paid us a lump sum her year and they have to hit them in a moment?

33:14.140 --> 33:19.580
I'm on glass door right now. It looks like they're not salaried, but they're celery. So you can basically eat all the catering you want

33:24.540 --> 33:26.540
Fuck you guys

33:30.220 --> 33:32.700
You think this is easy to do on a weekly basis?

33:34.460 --> 33:42.460
Yeah, we're pitching new jobs for Anthony Fauci and you're yelling at us that we're not doing enough?

33:42.460 --> 33:45.180
No, he's yelling because we didn't laugh at his celery joke

33:50.460 --> 33:55.340
Rocky horror picture show actor. Let's see Fauci in fishnets

33:58.540 --> 34:00.540
Okay, okay

34:03.580 --> 34:06.220
I think he could I just don't know if he has because I'm pretty sure he has goat

34:08.140 --> 34:10.140
Gauji doubt

34:10.940 --> 34:12.940
Bouch

34:15.580 --> 34:17.580
Any other pitches in here?

34:19.580 --> 34:21.580
Fauci as a

34:22.220 --> 34:26.860
Bucking devutant so he's 16 years old in the south

34:27.260 --> 34:32.620
He goes to a katilian he's wearing the fucking gloves. He's debuting and oh my god

34:32.700 --> 34:38.220
Look at this. It's the bell of the ball. It's Anthony freaking Fauci. Yeah, it's sort of it's coming fouch party

34:39.660 --> 34:42.540
Exactly, he's ready to enter the world

34:43.660 --> 34:47.260
As a southern charm stress, but he's not a Brad

34:51.740 --> 34:57.100
I don't know devutant. I'm kind of stuck on that picturing those those thighs in that dress

34:57.900 --> 34:59.900
Vio artist so it's

34:59.980 --> 35:03.980
E a sports in the game, but it's Anthony Fauci, so it's like

35:07.980 --> 35:14.220
It's the new EA sports pickle ball game. Yeah, that's good and Fauci is doing commentary

35:14.220 --> 35:16.220
Actually, you can just do sportscaster

35:17.020 --> 35:23.900
I assume he's a metz fan or something like that. He strikes me as a metz fan. It's a Jewish Anthony Fauci or does he just give off?

35:24.460 --> 35:29.820
Jewish grade uncle vibes. I think he could give off color commentary on like the metz

35:29.900 --> 35:34.060
So he's like calling first of all to call in card, but he's also calling game and he's like

35:34.780 --> 35:36.780
Spitting game really at

35:37.580 --> 35:44.380
You know the players the crowd hitting on everyone hit the end of their I think he could be a

35:45.340 --> 35:47.340
gallery curator

35:47.820 --> 35:52.220
Just imagine Anthony Fauci wheeling a dealing in the art world

35:53.580 --> 35:59.660
And that is the first piece and dare I say that's the center piece of his first gallery exhibit

35:59.980 --> 36:01.980
So it's an instant fail

36:03.580 --> 36:04.780
How about he's a

36:05.820 --> 36:07.820
Jesuit

36:07.980 --> 36:09.980
What yeah

36:11.100 --> 36:16.300
What about the verge editor? So he's recommended social distancing. He's recommended vaccine

36:17.100 --> 36:19.260
Now he's recommending portable speakers

36:22.380 --> 36:24.380
Yeah

36:25.340 --> 36:26.540
I

36:26.540 --> 36:29.500
Garen to you he does not know how to pair a blue to you

36:33.180 --> 36:37.900
I come to you with a new recommendation for the wire cutter

36:39.500 --> 36:45.180
There's an impression. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

36:46.060 --> 36:52.380
No, but it's really important that you find a pill headset that pairs

36:52.700 --> 36:58.540
wirelessly with your phone. Okay, and then like fucking I wasn't done

37:00.380 --> 37:04.380
I was gonna say Rand Paul keeps talking about like wired connections and he's like oh again

37:04.380 --> 37:08.380
And again with this guy with the wired connections. Maybe but maybe it wouldn't have gone that way

37:09.100 --> 37:11.100
Definitely maybe

37:13.180 --> 37:18.060
What about jigalo or rather jigoldo, right? Because what if Fauci was a straight-up or

37:18.380 --> 37:24.380
a lot of people would say that he is not me. Oh

37:28.220 --> 37:30.220
Jigoldo

37:30.940 --> 37:32.940
Finally Vegas your problem

37:33.820 --> 37:39.340
Vegas residency all right Brittany, Elton, J. Lo, Anthony

37:40.940 --> 37:44.780
Elvis it's him doing like the the greatest hits of like the pandemic

37:45.580 --> 37:50.300
years after the fact so it's like you know people want him to play the hits they don't want the new stuff so the new

37:50.300 --> 37:52.940
recommendations about like other you know pandemics

37:54.380 --> 37:56.380
It's him being like

37:56.380 --> 37:59.180
six feet apart and then everybody's like yeah

37:59.180 --> 38:01.180
This is like 2027

38:01.180 --> 38:05.340
I know email he was gonna be singing the greatest hits of the pandemic

38:06.300 --> 38:11.100
So like TikTok songs or like we are the world or whatever they did

38:12.060 --> 38:14.780
Oh, I just looked into that song. Do you know who wrote that song?

38:15.900 --> 38:17.420
No

38:17.420 --> 38:21.980
So I just went into some sort of a rabbit hole about the we are the world song well

38:24.300 --> 38:29.580
There was a music producer's idea and he asked Michael Jackson to participate in Jackson's like oh

38:29.580 --> 38:35.020
I want to write the entire song and so he did it with Lionel Richie in his house and in

38:35.020 --> 38:38.460
See no not too far from where I grew up in 1985

38:39.420 --> 38:46.060
And then he asked all of his famous friends recording artists actors to be in it and they all said yes

38:46.060 --> 38:48.460
Except for a few notable exceptions

38:49.340 --> 38:57.100
Eddie Murphy for one who was singing making a music video for party all the time decline the offer and most notably

38:57.500 --> 39:03.100
Prince couldn't make it on the day instead they got about

39:03.820 --> 39:09.820
50 other of the top recording acts in the world to sing this song for

39:10.380 --> 39:20.460
USAID in Africa to aid an Ethiopian famine that was going on in the early 80s and it raised close to

39:20.460 --> 39:22.460
70 million dollars for the efforts

39:23.580 --> 39:25.020
That's

39:25.020 --> 39:29.180
Pretty cool for a song you're talking about making a difference that's

39:30.140 --> 39:39.180
As quickly and efficiently as it gets from writing it to Jen in January recording it later that month and releasing it in March of 85

39:40.060 --> 39:41.820
a two-year-old

39:41.820 --> 39:44.300
Me moved to the states

39:44.300 --> 39:46.300
Not two months after that

39:47.100 --> 39:53.660
From Israel to not very far from that house where we are the world was

39:53.980 --> 40:01.180
scribed and recorded in in see no a house off of Havenhurst

40:02.060 --> 40:04.060
Avenue

40:04.460 --> 40:06.460
Just south of Ventura

40:06.460 --> 40:08.460
So that's sort of the

40:10.060 --> 40:13.740
30,000 feet view of the entire what went on that

40:14.540 --> 40:18.540
What was going on in the zeitgeist of that time but in relation to your life which sucks

40:19.900 --> 40:21.260
But

40:21.260 --> 40:23.260
Take not put

40:23.500 --> 40:25.500
You know

40:25.500 --> 40:27.500
Ten gently

40:27.900 --> 40:29.900
Also in gentle

40:29.900 --> 40:34.540
And I thought it really centered the story for me. Yeah, so I think it's fun or you guys

40:36.700 --> 40:38.700
It made it more related to me

40:38.700 --> 40:41.900
Yeah, because you guys know that Eddie Murphy wasn't there

40:44.300 --> 40:48.860
And then I was yeah and Bob Dylan right yet Bob Dylan was there

40:49.420 --> 40:55.020

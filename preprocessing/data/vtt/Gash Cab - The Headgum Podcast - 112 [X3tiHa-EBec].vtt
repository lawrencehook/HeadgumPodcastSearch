00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
And it's only because I couldn't do that before.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
How do you guys define art?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
We're in person.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Because this obviously isn't it?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Yeah.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
The pillow thing was weird.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
But I feel like this is a bad energy for an in-person record, which is rare.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
This is fun.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
And it's supposed to be exciting.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
No, I'm having a good time.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
They are not.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
How do you define art?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Yeah.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
No, I'm saying how do you get...

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
How do you define art?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
To me art is, I guess, any creative expression.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
So it could be video, it could be audio, it could be painting, it could be spoken word, it could be podcast.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
It feels like you had magenta.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
Like, a mirror was answering the question and you were like, on his fucking heels.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
You wanted to interrupt.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
The agenda was the means.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Like, I have no end that I'm trying to get to.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Okay.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
I'm trying to like lead you guys to sing.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
This is art.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Okay.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
You're...

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
You don't want us to say that this podcast is art.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
You're not curious about art opinions about anything.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
You just need to hear that your podcast is art.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
I'd also like to hear your opinions before we get to that conclusion.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Art can be bad, so this could be bad art.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Art is subjective.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I think is that gum on your laptop?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Well, I didn't have time to toss it.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Just loosely on the side of the trackpad.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
If you're watching on YouTube, comment below if you think this is art.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
I have 48 minutes of silence.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
You're in LA.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Yeah.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
You got to hear a cut.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Yeah.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
What else is that?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
I have a wrist brace.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Okay.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
What happened?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
You're always injured.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
This is not the time to notice that I was talking to you guys about.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
You really would think a mirror would be the one who's like physically fragile.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Yeah.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
But also you take less risks.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
That's right.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Jake does more.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
So he's more prone to being hurt.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Yeah.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
I think I'm actually pretty sturdy for the amount that I do.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
And I have all I have is tendonitis.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I mean, that's pretty.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Well, you also have tendonitis.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yes, I have tendonitis.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Bringing in the ears.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Yeah.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
And I have a slip disc.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
That's kind of unrelated to anything you do.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
You just slip weird lears.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Yeah.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
I still have no idea what caused it.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
That's really frustrating.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Yeah.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
But it's feeling better already.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
I took a blood test last week.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
I have a high billion rubin.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
That's not good.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Yeah.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
It's really dangerous.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Liver deliver.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Imminent.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Not the liver disease part.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
I hope.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
But it's.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
It was one of the results that were like.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Flag it for being too high.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
How did you know about that?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Did you get that?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
No, my my mom.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Oh, really?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Yeah.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Health issues.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I feel bad now because I sort of like have been experimenting with black magic.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
I went down to New Orleans.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
The dark arts.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Yeah.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Wish you ill.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
And make it though.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Did you have a voodoo doll?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I'm making like I forgot about that.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
It was like I meant to make like a puppet.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Yeah.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Because there was like some episode.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
You couldn't make it on.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
I was going to like, you know, be like.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
You know, like I would have nailed it.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
But what ended up happening was I realized that I kind of prick it.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
And then you texted me.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
You're like.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I believe.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Where did you hit it in the liver?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
So instant.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Yeah.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
I guess it's.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Could be not a big deal or it could be like an indication of a bigger deal.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
So I guess if I should pass away in the not too distant future.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Just let it know that early on in my tenure of being 39 plus.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I had high Billy Rubin.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
So maybe that's something you can look into if it's a mysterious.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Right.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
And the autopsy.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Okay.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
I.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Do you think how many people do you think comes here for you?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Oh.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I don't want it to be a big deal.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Right.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Are you saying you're not really a charge?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Once you're dead.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
I would fucking blow it up.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Because I need to do something.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Excuse me if this is a little one.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Cooth.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
I need something.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
I need something.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Yeah.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I need my income to go up from that.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Do you know what I mean?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
I want to like visualize it.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Amir's death absolutely drives patreon subscribers.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
I turn the whole thing into like an in memoriam of him.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
I need to monitor.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
I need to monitor.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Right.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Yeah.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
I'd monetize your death.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
So in that way, the funeral would be a part day.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Yeah.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I have to be.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
You have to be a subscriber to 10 to 10.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Yeah.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
That's cool.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
There'd be different tiers.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
What do you mean?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
There'd be different tiers.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Tears for the funeral.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
If you want to fit in tears.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Yeah.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
You have to exercise the tears.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Right.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
You want to cry.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
You have to be on the master level.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
You ligize the bitch for a hundred dollars a month.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Starting now.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Yeah.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
That's awesome.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
That's really smart.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
We should fake my own death actually.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Yeah.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
But then I would have to split the money with you.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
That's fraud.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Mmm.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
That's the other way.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
That's fraud.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
And you're a fraud.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
That's my other fear.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Is that how do you get people to pay?

05:18.000 --> 05:21.480
Because I feel like people would want to pay just to be like, oh, Jake's putting

05:21.480 --> 05:22.480
on this funeral.

05:22.480 --> 05:23.480
Right.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.480
That's awesome.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.480
Yeah.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.480
That's pretty choice.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.480
Right.

05:27.480 --> 05:29.480
The issue being the subject is still the biggest.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.480
I think it's that's interesting.

05:31.480 --> 05:32.480
Not really.

05:32.480 --> 05:39.280
You guys are making really vague small talk.

05:39.280 --> 05:40.280
No, it was an interesting.

05:40.280 --> 05:43.280
I don't even remember what he said before at to you.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.280
There's junk here.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.280
No.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.280
She.

05:47.280 --> 05:51.280
Or whatever the fuck out of now.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.280
Yeah.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.280
You're in charge of the thing.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.280
Up.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.280
Up.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.280
Up.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.280
Good.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.280
That's easy.

05:58.280 --> 05:59.280
Yeah.

05:59.280 --> 06:00.280
Let's see what we have prepared.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.280
We do have.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.280
We do have something that.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.280
You said uncouth.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.280
Yeah.

06:07.280 --> 06:13.280
Because I think I've prepared what might be the most uncouth bit ever on the show.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.280
Jesus.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.280
Really?

06:15.280 --> 06:16.280
It's you're late.

06:16.280 --> 06:17.280
Prepare.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.280
It's a very uncouth bit.

06:18.280 --> 06:19.280
Absolutely.

06:19.280 --> 06:21.280
What's we're talking about like our fetishes.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.280
Yeah.

06:22.280 --> 06:23.280
Yeah.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.280
So that's how many people we slept with.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.280
How much money we have.

06:26.280 --> 06:27.280
How many people had cash?

06:27.280 --> 06:28.280
You dox a lot of people.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.280
He slept with 17.

06:30.280 --> 06:31.280
Is that true?

06:31.280 --> 06:33.280
Probably not.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.280
I don't know if it's higher alert.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.280
Lots of it.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.280
Nailing it like that.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.280
It's our one in as well.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.280
And we'll blow blow blow blow blow.

06:42.280 --> 06:43.280
Yes.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.280
Let's go into our bond of the week.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.280
This is always forget about this dumbass.

06:48.280 --> 06:49.280
Segment.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.280
I'll go ahead and do a self bond.

06:58.280 --> 06:59.280
Me.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.280
Why?

07:00.280 --> 07:02.280
I think I have what it takes.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.280
I like fast cars and fast women.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.280
I'm sorry.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.280
I love cars.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.280
I was fast.

07:09.280 --> 07:12.280
I think I know a British accent that might.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.280
You drive an SUV in your married.

07:14.280 --> 07:15.280
Yeah.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.280
But I have my proclivities.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.280
Is every bond bond British?

07:19.280 --> 07:20.280
Yeah.

07:20.280 --> 07:21.280
I don't have to be.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.280
But it goes out.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.280
Do at least be able to do the accent.

07:24.280 --> 07:25.280
Yeah.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.280
Yeah.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.280
There was a Scottish bond.

07:28.280 --> 07:29.280
Yeah.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.280
Roger Morris.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.280
But I think it's time they had a bond from Connecticut.

07:33.280 --> 07:34.280
Yeah.

07:34.280 --> 07:35.280
That's cool.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.280
Yeah.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.280
What's my wrist heals?

07:37.280 --> 07:38.280
Then I think I could.

07:38.280 --> 07:39.280
Right.

07:39.280 --> 07:40.280
That's my district fund.

07:40.280 --> 07:41.280
Because it has to work.

07:41.280 --> 07:42.280
I did a lot of his own stunts.

07:42.280 --> 07:43.280
And I'm more used to wear a watch.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.280
Because if you get a sprained wrist.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.280
Yeah.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.280
That halts production totally.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.280
$200 million.

07:48.280 --> 07:50.280
He can't even shake someone's hand without feeling.

07:50.280 --> 07:51.280
I can shake right hands.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.280
Yeah.

07:52.280 --> 07:53.280
Yeah.

07:53.280 --> 07:54.280
Yeah.

07:54.280 --> 07:57.280
And actually I could do the whole movie with just my left arm off screen.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.280
That's pretty good.

07:59.280 --> 08:00.280
Anyway.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.280
Me is my bond to the week.

08:02.280 --> 08:03.280
Would you want to be the villain?

08:03.280 --> 08:05.280
And then maybe that's I would watch that.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.280
Oh, that's funny.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.280
Sort of like a bond comedy of sorts.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.280
You have a cat on your lapid bites you.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.280
That's cute.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.280
Yeah.

08:12.280 --> 08:13.280
One inspector gadget, style reboot.

08:13.280 --> 08:14.280
Yeah.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.280
I would probably go.

08:16.280 --> 08:17.280
Matthew Broderick.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.280
If we're saying in the inspector gadget.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.280
That's cool.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.280
That's cool.

08:20.280 --> 08:21.280
Matthew Broderick.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.280
That's good.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.280
Yeah.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.280
Something like.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.280
Yeah.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.280
So it's like skyfall.

08:26.280 --> 08:27.280
No time to die or whatever.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.280
And then Matthew Broderick.

08:29.280 --> 08:30.280
So that would be the name.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.280
Yeah.

08:31.280 --> 08:37.280
So it would be a gadget slash bond, which inspector gadget is kind of a James Bond style.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.280
Yeah.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.280
Also he has killed somebody.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.280
Yes.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.280
We're trying to in real life.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.280
Yeah.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.280
So I feel like he has a killer man slaughter.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.280
Yeah.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.280
Yeah.

08:45.280 --> 08:46.280
Other bond.

08:46.280 --> 08:47.280
I don't think bond kills anybody.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.280
Does he does?

08:48.280 --> 08:49.280
Yes.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.280
All the time.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.280
That man doesn't kill anyone.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.280
So that is.

08:52.280 --> 08:53.280
Yeah.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.280
I think that's one of the week.

08:55.280 --> 08:58.280
Let's get one of the stranger things kids in there.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.280
Yeah.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.280
That's cool.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.280
A 14 year old bond.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.280
Maybe he's young.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.280
He could do a bunch of mom, you know.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.280
He could do 60.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.280
That's smart.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.280
That's smart.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.280
They really shouldn't be hiring like another.

09:10.280 --> 09:11.280
What?

09:11.280 --> 09:12.280
How old was Daniel Craig when they hired him?

09:12.280 --> 09:13.280
He was kind of older, right?

09:13.280 --> 09:14.280
I think he was like 40.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.280
Yeah.

09:15.280 --> 09:16.280
40.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.280
Yeah.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.280
He's got to be older than me when he first did James Bond.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.280
No.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.280
Skyfall.

09:21.280 --> 09:22.280
Or fucking casino royale.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.280
I'm just old.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.280
Is that a stream on the ground?

09:24.280 --> 09:26.280
It doesn't feel right.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.280
I'll say 46.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.280
Do you think James Bond ever has like high bill of Ruben?

09:31.280 --> 09:32.280
No way.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.280
Or like fucking he takes medicine for that.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.280
Yeah.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.280
He's on a statin for sure.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.280
Right.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.280
Lowering his clue.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.280
What if Bond has a ill bear syndrome?

09:41.280 --> 09:43.280
That's what it's called.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.280
Yeah.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.280
Elevated Billy Ruben.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.280
Deal bears syndrome?

09:47.280 --> 09:49.280
I'm actually due for a physical.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.280
I wonder how my Billy Ruben is.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.280
Probably good.

09:52.280 --> 09:54.280
It's cool because it just sounds like a friend of yours.

09:54.280 --> 09:56.280
Like give him a Billy Ruben.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.280
Yeah.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.280
Exactly.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.280
When you Ruben.

10:03.280 --> 10:04.280
Looking for the applause.

10:04.280 --> 10:05.280
Take your time.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.280
Yeah.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.280
Careful of the gum.

10:08.280 --> 10:09.280
Scrolling.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.280
Scrolling.

10:10.280 --> 10:13.280
It's funny to see how the sausage is made.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.280
I have access.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.280
Nice.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.280
That shouldn't be easier for you to find.

10:18.280 --> 10:19.280
No.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.280
I know where that one was.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.280
But I was wondering if I might hit him with him.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.280
Up.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.280
Very good.

10:24.280 --> 10:28.280
I feel like you there's so many on this board that I never used.

10:28.280 --> 10:29.280
Right.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.280
You have to only need that bottom two rows.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.280
Right.

10:32.280 --> 10:33.280
That's almost exactly right.

10:33.280 --> 10:36.280
I mean, I haven't even used this one and so long.

10:36.280 --> 10:37.280
You're not that guy.

10:37.280 --> 10:38.280
Tell trust me.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.280
You're not that guy.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.280
Let's have some news of the day.

10:41.280 --> 10:45.280
Is there a nutritional difference between canalope and watermelon?

10:45.280 --> 10:47.280
What do you guys think?

10:47.280 --> 10:49.280
That's the news of the day.

10:49.280 --> 10:50.280
Yeah.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.280
Oh, I didn't even say my bond of the week.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.280
Father's son.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.280
Huh?

10:53.280 --> 10:54.280
Who?

10:54.280 --> 11:00.280
There's no better choice for bond than the bond of father and sons.

11:00.280 --> 11:01.280
God.

11:01.280 --> 11:05.280
So it's like James and Tabin.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.280
He's Tabin.

11:06.280 --> 11:09.280
He's like his daughter.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.280
So not a son.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.280
Yeah.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.280
Yeah.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.280
Yeah.

11:14.280 --> 11:16.280
Do you want example didn't fit?

11:16.280 --> 11:20.280
James wants his kid to be able to figure out their own journey.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.280
It's funny because this is dumb and boring.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.280
But the next thing that we're going to go into is water.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.280
It's actually it's watermelon and cantaloupe.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.280
I see.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.280
And then it's the uncouth thing.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.280
Yeah.

11:31.280 --> 11:34.280
He's actually no reason to drive the show forward either.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.280
Channel up as more carbs.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.280
Okay.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.280
For 100 grams.

11:39.280 --> 11:42.280
Is this about a point six difference of carbs?

11:42.280 --> 11:44.280
For 100 grams.

11:44.280 --> 11:47.280
So for 100 grams of the fruit, there's point six more carbs.

11:48.280 --> 11:49.280
In cantaloupe.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.280
That's why it's a little more juicy.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.280
Yeah.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.280
All right.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.280
I don't think it's more juicy actually.

11:55.280 --> 11:58.280
Because I won't even give you that small amount.

11:58.280 --> 11:59.280
Yeah.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.280
It's more fibrous.

12:00.280 --> 12:06.280
Army, hammer, resurfaces in Los Angeles after his lawyer debunks the claims that he's working

12:06.280 --> 12:07.280
out of Cayman Islands hotel.

12:07.280 --> 12:08.280
He he was though.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.280
That's been proven.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.280
Okay.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.280
Are you sure that was actually proven?

12:11.280 --> 12:14.280
Well he he didn't work there but he was there.

12:14.280 --> 12:17.280
And then he was friends with the staff and then the staff were like,

12:17.280 --> 12:19.280
Oh, this would be funny if we put army on like a pamphlet.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.280
Okay.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.280
So he did work a day doing that.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.280
Yeah.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.280
But there.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.280
I think the narrative was like.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.280
He felt so canceled.

12:27.280 --> 12:30.280
So so poor now that he's selling time shares.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.280
But that was he like came from.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.280
He's he's an old money rich.

12:33.280 --> 12:34.280
Yeah.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.280
He's not.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.280
He's going to be fine no matter what.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.280
Yeah.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.280
And now he's back in LA.

12:38.280 --> 12:39.280
Yeah.

12:39.280 --> 12:42.280
So let me know if you spot hammer.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.280
Brett Goldstein didn't even tell his mom.

12:44.280 --> 12:46.280
He was in four love and thunder.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.280
That's fine.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.280
Really?

12:48.280 --> 12:51.280
He put he's on Ted Lasso.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.280
He's like the guy is a room.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.280
Yeah.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.280
Yeah.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.280
Luke Bryan celebrates birthday with family.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.280
Doesn't matter.

12:58.280 --> 13:01.280
He just copy and pasting like a Google newsletter.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.280
It's sponsored links at the bottom of an ESPN homepage.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.280
There's a lot of news of the day.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.280
And I'm trying to parse through.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.280
It's not news of the day.

13:09.280 --> 13:12.280
And then it's just that a country star hung out with his dad.

13:12.280 --> 13:16.280
This is like really bad targeted shit like clickbait towards you.

13:16.280 --> 13:17.280
I'm trying to say.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.280
There's so much news.

13:19.280 --> 13:20.280
Yeah.

13:20.280 --> 13:23.280
And I'm trying to distill it down to what I think everyone needs to know.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.280
Okay.

13:24.280 --> 13:28.280
Jimmy Fallon makes a summer salad and his amazing daughters.

13:28.280 --> 13:29.280
That's nothing.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.280
Then he made a salad.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.280
Summer salad.

13:32.280 --> 13:33.280
Who cares?

13:33.280 --> 13:35.280
He said this is the best thing I've ever tasted.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.280
That's amazing daughter said this is the best thing I ever tasted.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.280
It's a re-capitalist.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.280
He said talk or something.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.280
Wait.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.280
It's what?

13:42.280 --> 13:43.280
What do you want happy birthday?

13:43.280 --> 13:44.280
No.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.280
I do.

13:45.280 --> 13:46.280
Tell me that headline.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.280
Because it didn't make it a lot of time.

13:47.280 --> 13:51.280
Jimmy Fallon makes a summer salad with his amazing daughters.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.280
Best thing I've ever tasted.

13:52.280 --> 13:53.280
I see.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.280
Okay.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.280
The late 90s.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.280
It's a little too abusive.

13:56.280 --> 13:59.280
Because the summer salad is the best thing he ever had.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.280
And his daughters are amazing.

14:01.280 --> 14:02.280
It's like choose one.

14:02.280 --> 14:04.280
Well, he's throwing a fruit salad.

14:04.280 --> 14:05.280
You're fine daughters.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.280
Yeah.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.280
So he was with Winnie Rose in Francis Cole.

14:09.280 --> 14:10.280
Doesn't matter.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.280
Doesn't matter.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.280
It doesn't matter.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.280
It doesn't matter.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.280
You have to just enjoy the second.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.280
You have to enjoy the second.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.280
No, because then he goes deeper into it.

14:18.280 --> 14:19.280
We want to know.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.280
We want to know.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.280
Then we don't have.

14:21.280 --> 14:26.280
We're going to end up talking about like our coxizes at some point in the uncouth second.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.280
How big are you guys?

14:27.280 --> 14:28.280
This cox.

14:28.280 --> 14:29.280
Have you measured?

14:29.280 --> 14:30.280
Yeah.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.280
I guess let's talk about Jimmy Fallon's strawberries.

14:31.280 --> 14:36.280
He made a recipe from French chef, Jacques Petbon.

14:36.280 --> 14:38.280
Six and a half?

14:38.280 --> 14:39.280
My dick?

14:39.280 --> 14:40.280
Yeah.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.280
Do they have not sure?

14:41.280 --> 14:43.280
Do they have a list of the ingredients?

14:43.280 --> 14:48.280
I'm curious if we can bring a full circle with the watermelon and the cantaloupe.

14:48.280 --> 14:49.280
Yeah.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.280
I don't want to get this.

14:50.280 --> 14:54.280
But when you think of a summer salad as that strictly fruit or you think it's like one of those

14:54.280 --> 14:55.280
salads that has blueberries in it.

14:55.280 --> 14:56.280
I'm going to guess.

14:56.280 --> 14:57.280
What is five?

14:57.280 --> 14:58.280
You that grades me.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.280
Like five hard.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.280
Yeah.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.280
Five hard.

15:02.280 --> 15:03.280
Five inches hard.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.280
Seven soft.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.280
Seven soft.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.280
That's what I was saying.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.280
Yeah.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.280
He's not a show or a grower.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.280
He's a hood.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.280
I guess it's a shrivel.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.280
Yeah.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.280
Shriveler.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.280
Yeah.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.280
Yeah.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.280
So I wonder if there's blackberries in it.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.280
My cock.

15:18.280 --> 15:22.280
Great.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.280
Some lemon.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.280
He doesn't even use a measuring cup.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.280
I'm going to find out.

15:27.280 --> 15:28.280
How is it a recipe?

15:29.280 --> 15:31.280
Well, you know, it's sort of like the French way of cooking.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.280
You don't have a recipe.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.280
He sort of handfuls of.

15:34.280 --> 15:35.280
Yeah.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.280
Sorry.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.280
Exactly.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.280
Sort of handfuls of stuff.

15:38.280 --> 15:39.280
Sorry.

15:39.280 --> 15:41.280
There was what a zest of a lemon.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.280
Great of the lemon.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.280
He did end up zesting a lemon.

15:44.280 --> 15:45.280
Yeah.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.280
Yeah.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.280
Okay.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.280
Look to was there any other.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.280
What was the zest of it on that lemon, too?

15:50.280 --> 15:51.280
Because prices are growing up, right?

15:51.280 --> 15:53.280
What was the roughage in that salad?

15:53.280 --> 15:54.280
Was a cabbage kale?

15:54.280 --> 15:55.280
Yeah.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.280
What's the base?

15:56.280 --> 15:57.280
Or is it strictly fruit?

15:57.280 --> 16:00.280
We've exhausted my knowledge of this article and the article itself.

16:00.280 --> 16:01.280
That was all it said.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.280
And you want to tell why Luke Bryan's birthday.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.280
We can get into that.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.280
I don't know who brought it.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.280
I don't know where it happened.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.280
He's a country sorry.

16:07.280 --> 16:08.280
He's 46.

16:08.280 --> 16:09.280
That's your age.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.280
No.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.280
And no.

16:11.280 --> 16:12.280
He was gooffully dancing around the house.

16:12.280 --> 16:13.280
That's fine.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.280
That's fine.

16:14.280 --> 16:15.280
That's it.

16:15.280 --> 16:16.280
It's fine.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.280
So they just report on people's.

16:18.280 --> 16:21.280
Instagrams and Twitters and TikToks.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.280
That's basically it, right?

16:22.280 --> 16:23.280
Yeah.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.280
So it's like, this is viral series.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.280
Right.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.280
They looked viral.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.280
Yeah.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.280
Yeah.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.280
We're all going to hell.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.280
I guess faster.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.280
In a hand basket.

16:31.280 --> 16:32.280
Yeah.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.280
That's really good.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.280
We're going to hell in a bucket.

16:34.280 --> 16:35.280
It's really good.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.280
All right.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.280
Well, we should take a break.

16:37.280 --> 16:40.280
Because I do want to get to this segment that might take a little bit longer

16:40.280 --> 16:42.280
and put you guys on even more of the edge of your.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.280
Okay.

16:43.280 --> 16:45.280
I can't talk it up enough.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.280
We'll be right back.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.280
Oh.

16:48.280 --> 16:49.280
Yeah.

16:49.280 --> 16:50.280
Oh.

16:50.280 --> 16:53.280
This one.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.280
What song is this?

16:54.280 --> 16:55.280
I don't know.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.280
Oh.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.280
Yeah.

16:58.280 --> 17:02.280
Now a word from our sponsor better help.

17:02.280 --> 17:11.280
Guys, how well would you take care of your car if you had to keep the same one for your entire life?

17:11.280 --> 17:13.280
Well, that's how our brain works.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.280
So why don't we treat him that way?

17:15.280 --> 17:19.280
How we care for our minds affects how we experience life.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.280
So it's important to invest time and care into keeping them healthy.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.280
There are plenty of ways to support a healthy brain.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.280
Like learning a new language or taking power naps.

17:26.280 --> 17:28.280
And there's also a better help online therapy.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.280
Now I do therapy every week makes me better version of myself.

17:31.280 --> 17:36.280
Helps me deal with things in my life that come up because shit happens.

17:36.280 --> 17:37.280
All right.

17:37.280 --> 17:42.280
In your interpersonal relationships, family, friendships, working relationships, etc.

17:42.280 --> 17:45.280
You gotta have an objective source.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.280
It's incredibly helpful.

17:47.280 --> 17:51.280
Better help is online therapy that offers video, phone, and even live chat sessions with your therapist.

17:51.280 --> 17:54.280
So you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.280
It's also much more affordable than in person therapy.

17:56.280 --> 17:59.280
And you can be matched with a therapist in under 48 hours.

17:59.280 --> 18:06.280
I truly believe everyone who has access should go to therapy and better help makes it more affordable and easier to find.

18:06.280 --> 18:09.280
Our listeners get 10% off their first month at betterhelp.com slash.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.280

18:10.280 --> 18:11.280
Again, that's better help.

18:11.280 --> 18:12.280
H-E-L-P dot com slash.

18:12.280 --> 18:13.280
What's that?

18:13.280 --> 18:14.280
Thanks, better help.

18:15.280 --> 18:18.280
Welcome to the gash cab.

18:18.280 --> 18:21.280
Welcome to the gash cab.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.280
I'll tear him out.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.280
Welcome to the gash cab.

18:26.280 --> 18:30.280
This is fucking title card alone is illegal.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.280
Your cancel.

18:31.280 --> 18:34.280
The three of us are canceled for being in this fucking thumbnail.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.280
Here's how things are going to go.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.280
I'm going to ask you general knowledge questions about gashes.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.280
They start off easy.

18:40.280 --> 18:45.280
And get harder as you go.

18:45.280 --> 18:51.280
As long as you answer them correctly, you will win this picture that I drew of a gash.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.280
Oh my god.

18:53.280 --> 18:56.280
Did you make that logo?

18:56.280 --> 18:57.280
I made that.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.280
Well, it's I took the original one and I just like Photoshopped it.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.280
It's pretty good.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.280
And so you turn the scene to a G.

19:03.280 --> 19:04.280
Yes.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.280
How is that?

19:05.280 --> 19:07.280
Do you see how it's not just like a straight line.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.280
It's got like a little serif to it.

19:10.280 --> 19:14.280
That's actually why it's actually not good because it's a it's a sand serif.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.280
It doesn't match the font.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.280
No.

19:17.280 --> 19:18.280
Yes.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.280
So they will start off easier and then get harder as you go.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.280
As long as you answer them correctly, you will win this picture.

19:22.280 --> 19:25.280
But three strikes in your out and I'll kick you out of the studio.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.280
Okay.

19:26.280 --> 19:31.280
You can also use one 15 second on the show on the real show.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.280
It's shout out.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.280
But this is going to be eat out.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.280
So you can call somebody.

19:35.280 --> 19:38.280
And if the call exceeds 15 seconds, that's a strike.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.280
But it's basically you can phone a friend.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.280
Who on earth would I want a call?

19:42.280 --> 19:43.280
Yeah.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.280
Yeah.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.280
Would I.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.280
I would play.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.280
Cash.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.280
So this will never believe it.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.280
I'm on cash cab.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.280
Honey.

19:52.280 --> 19:53.280
Okay.

19:53.280 --> 19:56.280
No more questions about it because we really have 10 seconds.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.280
Strike.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.280
First of all, it was the first to use.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.280
All right.

20:00.280 --> 20:03.280
You think these are questions about vaginas or just general gashes.

20:03.280 --> 20:04.280
Yeah.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.280
We don't use that word in the scheme.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.280
Why are you displaying the fucking.

20:09.280 --> 20:12.280
Because I'm the game on the on the real show.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.280
It's like showing how much money they made.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.280
Yeah.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.280
There's no cash involved.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.280
This is that is crude in two ways.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.280
Yeah.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.280
It's just leaned against the wall.

20:20.280 --> 20:24.280
Piece of printer paper with a ballpoint pen.

20:24.280 --> 20:25.280
It's so.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.280
It's a little effort.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.280
And two way.

20:28.280 --> 20:29.280
All right.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.280
Here we go.

20:30.280 --> 20:33.280
Starting up with some multiple choice questions.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.280
Um.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.280
The word gash.

20:38.280 --> 20:41.280
Technically refers to a.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.280
The entirety of the vaginal anatomy.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.280
B.

20:44.280 --> 20:46.280
The exterior of the vaginal anatomy.

20:46.280 --> 20:47.280
C.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.280
The canal that connects the uterus to the labia menorah.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.280
Or D.

20:51.280 --> 20:55.280
The tube that urine flows out of freely in my dad.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.280
Fuck.

20:58.280 --> 21:02.280
I think it's.

21:02.280 --> 21:05.280
I got it narrowed down to the first two.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.280
It's.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.280
The first two is the whole entire thing.

21:08.280 --> 21:09.280
Yeah.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.280
And the second one is just the outside.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.280
Yeah.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.280
I would think it has to.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.280
You know, it's.

21:14.280 --> 21:18.280
You would think it's the whole thing because it's more about the inside.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.280
I think the gash.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.280
Yeah.

21:21.280 --> 21:26.280
But I'll just go ahead and say outside because it the inside includes the like.

21:26.280 --> 21:29.280
The, you know, too much.

21:29.280 --> 21:32.280
Too much.

21:32.280 --> 21:35.280
Anatomy for it to be encompassed in such a crude word.

21:35.280 --> 21:38.280
So I'll say the outside.

21:38.280 --> 21:42.280
Let's hear if we was right.

21:42.280 --> 21:45.280
The correct answer is the canal that connects the uterus to the labia menorah.

21:45.280 --> 21:46.280
But canal.

21:46.280 --> 21:48.280
That's the vagina is the canal.

21:48.280 --> 21:49.280
But the gash.

21:49.280 --> 21:52.280
The whole part is the entire exterior.

21:52.280 --> 21:53.280
Um.

21:53.280 --> 21:54.280
Here we go.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.280
The gash.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.280
I'm annoyed that I'm a little ashamed that I.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.280
That's why this is too cold.

22:00.280 --> 22:02.280
Because some of these are kind of hard.

22:02.280 --> 22:05.280
Uh, how should the gash be cleaned?

22:05.280 --> 22:08.280
Uh, I should also say that they're supposed to be a timer on these.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.280
So here we go.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.280
Yeah.

22:10.280 --> 22:11.280
Um.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.280
So what I was saying, this is a low, low, brow, low concept.

22:13.280 --> 22:14.280
And you did.

22:14.280 --> 22:17.280
And this is kind of a low effort.

22:17.280 --> 22:21.280
For, you know, kind of like, for going after it.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.280
So I could have done more.

22:23.280 --> 22:24.280
I would say this is guy.

22:24.280 --> 22:25.280
High concept.

22:25.280 --> 22:26.280
Yeah.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.280
Here you go.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.280
This is high concept.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.280
Low, brow.

22:29.280 --> 22:30.280
Low, brow.

22:30.280 --> 22:31.280
How should the gash be cleaned?

22:31.280 --> 22:32.280
A.

22:32.280 --> 22:35.280
You should use soap and water that in.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.280
In the side.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.280
Looking at the answer.

22:38.280 --> 22:41.280
You should use soap and water inside your gash.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.280
B.

22:42.280 --> 22:45.280
You should use douche's regularly.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.280
Uh, do you guys know regularly?

22:47.280 --> 22:49.280
He was like a stand up in the.

22:50.280 --> 22:52.280
Stanley's normal cousin.

22:52.280 --> 22:56.280
See, the vagina's self cleaning and does not require you to clean it.

22:56.280 --> 22:57.280
Clean it.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.280
D.

22:58.280 --> 23:01.280
You should rinse it once a day.

23:01.280 --> 23:04.280
You're the last one to tell too casual.

23:04.280 --> 23:09.280
I'll go do Schregularly.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.280
I agree with him here, but I'm just going to guess.

23:11.280 --> 23:12.280
Rinse.

23:12.280 --> 23:14.280
So I can leave.

23:14.280 --> 23:17.280
It is self cleaning.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.280
Well, it's funny about that.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.280
One's crying.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.280
Whatever.

23:22.280 --> 23:24.280
Uh, you both have two strides.

23:24.280 --> 23:25.280
Is it really self cleaning?

23:25.280 --> 23:26.280
Yeah.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.280
What do you actually have?

23:27.280 --> 23:28.280
You're douche too regularly.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.280
I think you can actually injure yourself.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.280
It's your regular injure.

23:31.280 --> 23:34.280
But it can like upset the bacterial, the pH balance.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.280
It's okay.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.280
Also, don't take anything.

23:36.280 --> 23:37.280
I've taken everything we're saying.

23:37.280 --> 23:38.280
The gross.

23:38.280 --> 23:39.280
Yeah.

23:39.280 --> 23:41.280
It's just the energy of like, oh, you don't need to wear deodorant.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.280
Or you don't need to wash your hair to me.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.280
You don't need to do those things.

23:44.280 --> 23:45.280
Yeah.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.280
I think you do.

23:47.280 --> 23:48.280
You do.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.280
You especially do action.

23:50.280 --> 23:51.280
All right.

23:51.280 --> 23:57.280
How long is the average menstrual cycle with specific regards to gashes?

23:57.280 --> 23:58.280
Sorry.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.280
A, five days.

24:04.280 --> 24:07.280
B, 14 days.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.280
C, 21 days.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.280
Or D, 28 days.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.280
It's 28.

24:15.280 --> 24:19.280
You're, I just realized that your brother is a gynecologist.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.280
Yeah.

24:20.280 --> 24:22.280
We, we should get calling it.

24:22.280 --> 24:24.280
That could be your, you call doctor.

24:24.280 --> 24:26.280
You eat out doctor.

24:26.280 --> 24:27.280
What is his name?

24:27.280 --> 24:28.280
I.

24:28.280 --> 24:29.280
I already know the answer.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.280
Yeah.

24:30.280 --> 24:31.280
The answer is D.

24:31.280 --> 24:32.280
It's 28.

24:32.280 --> 24:33.280
Correct.

24:33.280 --> 24:34.280
All right.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.280
This is bringing us to our first challenge.

24:36.280 --> 24:37.280
On the normal show.

24:37.280 --> 24:38.280
It's the red light challenge.

24:38.280 --> 24:41.280
But this one's going to be the red brief challenge.

24:41.280 --> 24:46.280
So, and.

24:46.280 --> 24:47.280
Got it.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.280
You're embarrassed.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.280
I'm, I'm having a great time.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.280
All right.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.280
In 30 seconds.

24:54.280 --> 24:57.280
Uh, you have to name.

24:57.280 --> 25:02.280
Uh, nine synonyms for gash.

25:02.280 --> 25:05.280
No.

25:05.280 --> 25:07.280
Here we go.

25:07.280 --> 25:08.280
30 seconds on the board.

25:08.280 --> 25:11.280
And we are starting.

25:11.280 --> 25:12.280
Now.

25:12.280 --> 25:13.280
The gyna.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.280
Correct.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.280
Plussy.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.280
Got it.

25:16.280 --> 25:17.280
No.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.280
Slit.

25:18.280 --> 25:19.280
Got it.

25:19.280 --> 25:20.280
Uh.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.280
Yes.

25:21.280 --> 25:22.280
Uh.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.280
Koochi.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.280
Yes.

25:24.280 --> 25:25.280
Um.

25:25.280 --> 25:26.280
God.

25:26.280 --> 25:27.280
Twatt.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.280
Yes.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.280
Three more.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.280
Do you have any that I'm missing?

25:31.280 --> 25:33.280
I have one.

25:33.280 --> 25:34.280
Sit.

25:34.280 --> 25:35.280
Box.

25:35.280 --> 25:36.280
Got it.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.280
Two more, two more, two more.

25:38.280 --> 25:39.280
Casey.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.280
Give me out of this.

25:41.280 --> 25:42.280
That's you.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.280
Oh.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.280
I wish I didn't say mine.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.280
You didn't win a pair of red briefs.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.280
I forgot that.

25:49.280 --> 25:50.280
That was the.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.280
Yes.

25:51.280 --> 25:52.280
I guess that's fine.

25:52.280 --> 25:54.280
What did we miss any famous ones?

25:54.280 --> 25:55.280
Uh, you missed.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.280
And this is a snatch.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.280
Yeah.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.280
We're a gumbo pot.

25:59.280 --> 26:00.280
Not enough.

26:00.280 --> 26:01.280
Never.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.280
Two's.

26:02.280 --> 26:04.280
And, uh, muff.

26:04.280 --> 26:05.280
You said muff.

26:05.280 --> 26:06.280
Really.

26:06.280 --> 26:07.280
Yeah.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.280
You would've accepted it twice.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.280
I would've taken it twice.

26:09.280 --> 26:10.280
Um.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.280
Once with three F's.

26:12.280 --> 26:15.280
Back to our regular scheduled program here.

26:15.280 --> 26:16.280
Um.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.280
Oh, again.

26:17.280 --> 26:20.280
I thought for a second to segment was over, but it's just back to the, yeah.

26:20.280 --> 26:23.280
Back to the original gash cab.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.280
You both have two strikes.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.280
I really want you to make it to the end.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.280
So you can win this.

26:27.280 --> 26:28.280
Uh.

26:28.280 --> 26:29.280
I don't know.

26:29.280 --> 26:30.280
Yeah.

26:30.280 --> 26:31.280
No interest.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.280
True false.

26:32.280 --> 26:33.280
Yeah.

26:33.280 --> 26:36.280
The average menstrual cycle is of a gash is 21 days.

26:36.280 --> 26:37.280
False.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.280
We just saw that.

26:38.280 --> 26:39.280
Did that one.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.280
Obviously.

26:40.280 --> 26:43.280
I forgot to take that one out.

26:43.280 --> 26:44.280
Yeah.

26:44.280 --> 26:46.280
But you didn't have to read it.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.280
True or false.

26:47.280 --> 26:53.800
On average, the average gash loses six to eight tablespoons of liquid volume during

26:53.800 --> 26:55.280
a period.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.280
The keep mine is pretty specific.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.280
Yeah.

26:59.280 --> 27:00.280
True.

27:00.280 --> 27:02.280
Correct.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.280
All right.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.280
Last one.

27:04.280 --> 27:05.280
True or false.

27:05.280 --> 27:10.280
PMS stands for pre menstrual syndrome.

27:10.280 --> 27:13.280
I believe that's true.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.280
Jake.

27:14.280 --> 27:16.280
I think it's true also.

27:16.280 --> 27:18.280
Correct.

27:18.280 --> 27:19.280
All right.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.280
Uh, you guys have one.

27:21.280 --> 27:22.280
This.

27:22.280 --> 27:25.280
Uh, keep drawing of a gash.

27:25.280 --> 27:27.280
But before we go,

27:28.280 --> 27:32.280
there, you can either take this or you can double or nothing.

27:32.280 --> 27:37.280
Get two photos that I drew of a, what did you say slip?

27:37.280 --> 27:39.280
I didn't say that.

27:39.280 --> 27:44.280
Again, you can go home with this or you can double down with our video bonus round,

27:44.280 --> 27:46.280
where I'm going to play a very short clip.

27:46.280 --> 27:49.280
And you just answer one question about it.

27:49.280 --> 27:53.280
I'll just take from memory or did you look at a vagina when you did that?

27:53.280 --> 27:54.280
From memory.

27:54.280 --> 27:55.280
That's awesome.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.280
From memory.

27:56.280 --> 27:57.280
Nice.

27:57.280 --> 27:59.280
That's a homeintosh, and actually.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.280
Yeah.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.280
These are boobs.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.280
I want to see the video.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.280
Yeah, that's true.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.280
All right.

28:04.280 --> 28:05.280
They're doubling down.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.280
Just because this doesn't matter.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.280
Jesus.

28:10.280 --> 28:11.280
Like.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.280
What?

28:12.280 --> 28:13.280
What?

28:13.280 --> 28:15.280
That's just right.

28:15.280 --> 28:18.280
This body part, shown on camera.

28:22.280 --> 28:23.280
Oh my god.

28:25.280 --> 28:26.280
What body.

28:26.280 --> 28:27.280
What word.

28:27.280 --> 28:29.280
You describe this body part.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.280
Did you do this?

28:30.280 --> 28:31.280
Did you do this?

28:31.280 --> 28:32.280
Did you do this segment?

28:32.280 --> 28:34.280
Because there was no women on this show?

28:34.280 --> 28:35.280
We know.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.280
You would have done it.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.280
If Maria showed up.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.280
Or what?

28:38.280 --> 28:39.280
What if a fuck?

28:39.280 --> 28:40.280
Jesus Christ.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.280
There's people.

28:41.280 --> 28:42.280
There's not, but he has to watch it.

28:42.280 --> 28:43.280
Whereas he's walking out.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.280
Obviously.

28:44.280 --> 28:45.280
She quit.

28:45.280 --> 28:49.280
What word best to describe such a body part.

28:49.280 --> 28:51.280
Do shown on camera.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.280
I actually didn't see it.

28:52.280 --> 28:53.280
Can you see?

28:53.280 --> 28:54.280
Show it again.

28:54.280 --> 28:55.280
Can you do it now?

28:55.280 --> 28:56.280
I don't want to.

28:56.280 --> 28:58.280
You shouldn't have wanted to be a fart.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.280
I didn't.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.280
I just had to push the envelope.

29:01.280 --> 29:03.280
It's a dash cab.

29:03.280 --> 29:04.280
Show.

29:04.280 --> 29:09.280
The thumbnail was over what you want us to see.

29:09.280 --> 29:12.280
This is such a simple question.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.280
What word best describes this body part.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.280
Do you want it?

29:15.280 --> 29:16.280
Do you want it?

29:16.280 --> 29:17.280
A gash.

29:17.280 --> 29:20.280
Grag.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.280
You guys are going home.

29:22.280 --> 29:23.280
With both pictures.

29:23.280 --> 29:27.280
A gash.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.280
One each.

29:30.280 --> 29:32.280
One each.

29:32.280 --> 29:34.280
And one each.

29:34.280 --> 29:35.280
What is it at?

29:35.280 --> 29:36.280
A thousand.

29:36.280 --> 29:38.280
More or fifteen hundred actually.

29:38.280 --> 29:39.280
Not bad.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.280
Where do we go from there?

29:46.280 --> 29:49.280
I'm very sorry.

29:49.280 --> 29:50.280
Yeah.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.280
The fruit salad recipe was more offensive.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.280
I think Jack Pebble.

29:54.280 --> 29:55.280
Yeah.

29:55.280 --> 29:56.280
Exactly right.

29:56.280 --> 30:00.280
I thought that that was going to take 20 minutes.

30:00.280 --> 30:01.280
And how long?

30:01.280 --> 30:02.280
Like 13.

30:02.280 --> 30:04.280
So we're a little short.

30:04.280 --> 30:07.280
We're 15 minutes short of the day.

30:07.280 --> 30:08.280
Yeah.

30:08.280 --> 30:09.280
And you look at out of segments.

30:09.280 --> 30:10.280
There's nothing else.

30:10.280 --> 30:12.280
This becomes a wax episode.

30:12.280 --> 30:13.280
Yeah.

30:13.280 --> 30:14.280
Why do we just wax?

30:14.280 --> 30:15.280
Yeah.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.280
Because we did that a little bit at the top.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.280
I feel like that broke the ice.

30:20.280 --> 30:21.280
Well, here's something about the show.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.280
I wanted to bring up.

30:22.280 --> 30:26.280
People have been complaining that the levels of the audio are off ever since fairs left.

30:26.280 --> 30:28.280
Have you heard that complaint?

30:28.280 --> 30:30.280
And would you agree with it?

30:30.280 --> 30:31.280
I've read that complaint.

30:31.280 --> 30:34.280
I haven't heard an episode.

30:34.280 --> 30:37.280
Since I don't listen to the show after it gets put out.

30:37.280 --> 30:38.280
Got it.

30:38.280 --> 30:40.280
Do you think there's a lack of quality control there?

30:40.280 --> 30:41.280
Because you don't listen to the show.

30:41.280 --> 30:46.280
And then what happens is it kind of slips a little bit of the fairs leaves.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.280
Well, it's hard.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.280
It's like a trust grace in my life.

30:50.280 --> 30:51.280
All right.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.280
But did you tell them that note that people had?

30:53.280 --> 30:56.280
Because I guess some of the like the insurance audio.

30:56.280 --> 30:59.280
Insurance audio or a little louder than the rest of the episode.

30:59.280 --> 31:00.280
Really?

31:00.280 --> 31:02.280
Maybe fairs equalized normalize the audio.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.280
And grace hasn't been doing that.

31:04.280 --> 31:07.280
This feels like something that should be discussed over slack.

31:07.280 --> 31:13.280
Could be a interesting peer behind the curtain to see what it has to be reviewed.

31:13.280 --> 31:14.280
Yeah.

31:14.280 --> 31:16.280
Well, I mean, Grace is going to be editing this.

31:16.280 --> 31:20.280
So I guess he'll, uh, it'll hurt his feelings and then we'll get past it.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.280
It's not hurt your feelings or not thing.

31:22.280 --> 31:26.280
It's just like, uh, is there something that fairs did that we're not doing anymore?

31:26.280 --> 31:28.280
Um, I don't know.

31:28.280 --> 31:29.280
I don't know what he did.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.280
I used to assemble the tracks.

31:31.280 --> 31:33.280
So I would cut out anything I wanted to cut out.

31:33.280 --> 31:34.280
Time it.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.280
It's sink it, et cetera.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.280
Then I would send him all the tracks.

31:36.280 --> 31:37.280
And he would just work it.

31:37.280 --> 31:38.280
Don't ask a follow-up question.

31:38.280 --> 31:39.280
I'm quite bored.

31:39.280 --> 31:40.280
The fairs cut this out.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.280
Do you ever actually cut those out?

31:42.280 --> 31:45.280
Or is those jokes that are to be left in?

31:45.280 --> 31:50.280
If I say it historically back then, if I said fairs cut this out, I didn't want him to cut it out.

31:50.280 --> 31:53.280
And then there would be things that I would just flag of like that can't be in the episode.

31:53.280 --> 31:54.280
And I would just add it that out.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.280
I see.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.280
Yeah.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.280
Anything from this episode do you think?

31:58.280 --> 31:59.280
It's not.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.280
Well, I'm going to blur that.

32:00.280 --> 32:01.280
Yeah.

32:01.280 --> 32:02.280
Probably more than a blur.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.280
Black bar, probably.

32:04.280 --> 32:05.280
Yeah.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.280
Black bar sitting on top of a guy.

32:07.280 --> 32:09.280
She'll all over the entire thing.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.280
Really?

32:10.280 --> 32:11.280
Yeah.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.280
The entire black dot.

32:12.280 --> 32:13.280
Yeah.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.280
It'll show as no legs.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.280
Of course.

32:15.280 --> 32:16.280
Um.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.280
Sexual bucket list.

32:17.280 --> 32:20.280
2021 to 2022.

32:20.280 --> 32:21.280
Sorry.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.280
2022 to 2023.

32:22.280 --> 32:23.280
Okay.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.280
I like your next.

32:24.280 --> 32:28.280
Casey, do you ever think about sex in terms of like a sports season?

32:28.280 --> 32:29.280
No.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.280
I have never have.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.280
Really?

32:31.280 --> 32:32.280
I also have never.

32:32.280 --> 32:33.280
Sports season.

32:33.280 --> 32:34.280
Yeah.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.280
I think that's quite unhealthy, Jeff.

32:36.280 --> 32:37.280
Hmm.

32:37.280 --> 32:40.280
Because I like to be like, oh, like, how do you win the chip?

32:40.280 --> 32:41.280
Right.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.280
You keep stats and stuff like that.

32:43.280 --> 32:44.280
Yeah.

32:44.280 --> 32:46.280
But what's, what's the off season?

32:46.280 --> 32:47.280
The off season.

32:47.280 --> 32:50.280
Jeff's been in the off season since high school.

32:50.280 --> 32:52.280
Jeff's on strike.

32:52.280 --> 32:53.280
The league folded.

32:53.280 --> 32:55.280
It's a fucking lockout.

32:55.280 --> 32:56.280
He's been relegated.

32:56.280 --> 32:57.280
Yeah.

32:57.280 --> 32:59.280
And this all takes place over the dating app, the league.

32:59.280 --> 33:00.280
Hmm.

33:00.280 --> 33:01.280
It's just like.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.280
Um.

33:02.280 --> 33:06.280
Now the off season is like those probably six weeks a year where you don't get any

33:06.280 --> 33:07.280
bi-accid.

33:08.280 --> 33:10.280
Slash purpose.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.280
Um.

33:11.280 --> 33:13.280
And you can make trades.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.280
Really?

33:14.280 --> 33:15.280
Yeah.

33:15.280 --> 33:19.280
So what's an example of a trade you can make in your sexual season?

33:19.280 --> 33:20.280
Or off season?

33:20.280 --> 33:25.280
Uh, you know, swinging for the fences.

33:25.280 --> 33:26.280
Um.

33:26.280 --> 33:28.280
What about you?

33:30.280 --> 33:32.280
Sexual goals for the year?

33:32.280 --> 33:33.280
Yeah.

33:33.280 --> 33:34.280
Um.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.280
Um.

33:36.280 --> 33:37.280
I don't know.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.280
I mean, they're private.

33:38.280 --> 33:39.280
They're private.

33:39.280 --> 33:40.280
Why do you think this?

33:43.280 --> 33:44.280
What?

33:44.280 --> 33:45.280
Wait.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.280
What's happening?

33:46.280 --> 33:47.280
Hmm.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.280
I'm here put on sunglasses.

33:48.280 --> 33:53.280
Like he's about to reveal something he's trying to do with that five inch cock.

33:53.280 --> 33:56.280
Let's talk about it, man.

33:57.280 --> 33:58.280
Uh.

33:58.280 --> 33:59.280
Uh.

33:59.280 --> 34:00.280
Uh.

34:00.280 --> 34:01.280
Uh.

34:01.280 --> 34:02.280
Uh.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.280
Uh.

34:03.280 --> 34:04.280
Uh.

34:04.280 --> 34:05.280
For my what?

34:05.280 --> 34:06.280
For what?

34:06.280 --> 34:07.280
For what?

34:07.280 --> 34:08.280
For what you're about to share?

34:08.280 --> 34:11.280
You put on your popped on sunglasses?

34:11.280 --> 34:12.280
I'm just-

34:12.280 --> 34:13.280
You got fucking penis plans.

34:13.280 --> 34:14.280
I'm trying to-

34:14.280 --> 34:15.280
And we're down to hear them.

34:15.280 --> 34:18.280
I'm just trying to be sort of like in a cool zone right now.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.280
Yeah.

34:19.280 --> 34:23.280
Like a poker player like put on sunglasses so you can't read his expression.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.280
What are your sexual goals?

34:26.280 --> 34:28.280
Goals for 22, 23.

34:28.280 --> 34:29.280
Yeah, the season.

34:29.280 --> 34:30.280
Yeah.

34:30.280 --> 34:31.280
She's shibari.

34:31.280 --> 34:32.280
What's that?

34:32.280 --> 34:34.280
Like rope-ondage.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.280
Army Hammer-style.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.280
Shibari?

34:37.280 --> 34:38.280
Yeah.

34:38.280 --> 34:40.280
Whatever that word.

34:40.280 --> 34:42.280
How do you spell it?

34:42.280 --> 34:45.280
That's H-I-B-A-R-I.

34:45.280 --> 34:46.280
Is it like Japanese?

34:46.280 --> 34:48.280
I think in nature, yeah.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.280
But not logically.

34:50.280 --> 34:51.280
Not in nature.

34:51.280 --> 34:53.280
I don't want to know.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.280
You're freaking out over the other one.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.280
I think the sushi thing is kind of interesting.

34:57.280 --> 34:59.280
You eat sushi if someone's asked?

34:59.280 --> 35:01.280
I was saying, uh...

35:01.280 --> 35:02.280
Hold on.

35:02.280 --> 35:04.280
I've always wanted to do that.

35:04.280 --> 35:05.280
Yeah.

35:05.280 --> 35:08.280
You see that at like, if there's like a sex party and like a movie or TV show,

35:08.280 --> 35:11.280
there's like a naked person and then they're sushi on that.

35:11.280 --> 35:12.280
Right.

35:12.280 --> 35:13.280
Go and McCasa.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.280
I really trust them.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.280
Yes.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.280
If we were at-

35:17.280 --> 35:19.280
When we're in hotter than having raw fish,

35:19.280 --> 35:21.280
off someone's leg.

35:21.280 --> 35:22.280
Yeah.

35:22.280 --> 35:24.280
I'll eat the fish off your body.

35:24.280 --> 35:25.280
Oh, yeah.

35:25.280 --> 35:30.280
I had an egg cake to Mago sushi off of someone's cake.

35:30.280 --> 35:34.280
I had a pot sticker off someone's teeth.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.280
How's that?

35:36.280 --> 35:37.280
Sponsored.

35:37.280 --> 35:38.280
Sponsored.

35:38.280 --> 35:39.280
And I'm a hot liquor.

35:39.280 --> 35:40.280
That's right.

35:40.280 --> 35:41.280
That's right.

35:41.280 --> 35:42.280
That's right.

35:42.280 --> 35:43.280
That's right.

35:43.280 --> 35:44.280
That's right.

35:44.280 --> 35:45.280
That's right.

35:45.280 --> 35:47.280
You guys have teriyaki chicken.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.280
Shut up!

35:48.280 --> 35:50.280
Shut up, man.

35:50.280 --> 35:51.280
Whoa.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.280
Oh, whoa.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.280
112 episodes.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.280
I've been so patient with him.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.280
Not really.

35:57.280 --> 36:01.280
Everything you've done has been chipping away at the ice.

36:01.280 --> 36:04.280
It's already fucking done in the ice culture.

36:04.280 --> 36:05.280
Okay.

36:05.280 --> 36:10.280
I finally, like, was on board with the whole gash of it all.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.280
I was joking around with it.

36:12.280 --> 36:13.280
He was having it.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.280
I brought up the sushi thing.

36:15.280 --> 36:17.280
And then I sort of.

36:17.280 --> 36:19.280
Yes, and did it.

36:20.280 --> 36:21.280
Right.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.280
I thought we were having fun.

36:23.280 --> 36:24.280
Yeah.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.280
No, I was.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.280
I was having fun.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.280
I just sometimes it gets too much.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.280
What's going on?

36:29.280 --> 36:30.280
No, nothing.

36:30.280 --> 36:31.280
I just like.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.280
Yeah.

36:32.280 --> 36:33.280
On the offseason.

36:33.280 --> 36:35.280
What offseason?

36:35.280 --> 36:36.280
Sex.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.280
Oh, you're in your six week.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.280
What was going to say?

36:40.280 --> 36:42.280
In Arizona, things got kind of wild.

36:42.280 --> 36:43.280
People got drunk.

36:43.280 --> 36:44.280
Our company retreat.

36:44.280 --> 36:45.280
Yeah.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.280
I wonder if.

36:46.280 --> 36:49.280
I think I'm, do you think, would have lobbed up to be the sushi platter?

36:49.280 --> 36:51.280
We obviously can't answer that.

36:51.280 --> 36:52.280
Okay.

36:52.280 --> 36:54.280
Because I think it would have been Peter.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.280
My car's there.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.280
Hmm.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.280
Oh.

36:57.280 --> 36:58.280
There's no way.

36:58.280 --> 36:59.280
Yeah.

36:59.280 --> 37:00.280
I could see it.

37:00.280 --> 37:02.280
If someone's going to do it, Peter.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.280
He's a freak.

37:03.280 --> 37:04.280
Yeah.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.280
Yeah.

37:05.280 --> 37:06.280
He sort of has a platter.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.280
Nabs.

37:07.280 --> 37:08.280
Oh, yeah.

37:08.280 --> 37:09.280
Yeah.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.280
And that, that body sushi thing is it over rice.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.280
Or is it usually just the sashines over rice?

37:13.280 --> 37:15.280
It's over rated over.

37:16.280 --> 37:19.280
It's a pokeball, actually.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.280
It's spam musubi.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.280
Why sushi?

37:23.280 --> 37:25.280
Just because it's like single piece.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.280
Yeah.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.280
I do think sushi is very about hygiene.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.280
Yeah.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.280
Exactly.

37:30.280 --> 37:31.280
Here's the thing.

37:31.280 --> 37:34.280
When you eat sushi, your stomach acid cooks the fish.

37:34.280 --> 37:35.280
Wow.

37:35.280 --> 37:36.280
Wow.

37:36.280 --> 37:37.280
You digest it.

37:37.280 --> 37:38.280
Okay.

37:38.280 --> 37:40.280
And so that sounds very answered to me.

37:40.280 --> 37:41.280
Not sexual.

37:41.280 --> 37:43.280
But I do think sushi is clean.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.280
There's no, well, other than soy.

37:44.280 --> 37:45.280
There's no sauce, but soy.

37:45.280 --> 37:47.280
I mean, how much are sauce is that?

37:47.280 --> 37:49.280
Uh, I don't know.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.280
Most.

37:50.280 --> 37:52.280
How much of a sauce is soy?

37:52.280 --> 37:55.280
The most sauce on a scale.

37:55.280 --> 37:57.280
I would say hoisin is like the sauce.

37:57.280 --> 37:59.280
It just gets either hoisin or barbecue.

37:59.280 --> 38:00.280
barbecue.

38:00.280 --> 38:01.280
I think there's nothing sauce.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.280
So you're the barbecue.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.280
Yeah.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.280
barbecue sauce has so many calories in it.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.280
I also think it tastes foul.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.280
Foul?

38:08.280 --> 38:09.280
Yeah.

38:09.280 --> 38:10.280
And I would put it on the foul.

38:10.280 --> 38:11.280
No, I would put it on the foul.

38:11.280 --> 38:12.280
Really?

38:12.280 --> 38:12.780
Yeah.

38:13.280 --> 38:16.280
I think you could probably do like a peasant.

38:16.280 --> 38:17.280
Like a roast.

38:17.280 --> 38:18.280
Yeah.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.280
Yeah.

38:19.280 --> 38:21.280
You probably get sex for a second.

38:21.280 --> 38:24.280
What about like a fucking hair?

38:24.280 --> 38:25.280
Yeah.

38:25.280 --> 38:28.280
Rabbit to eat with hoisin?

38:28.280 --> 38:29.280
That would be good.

38:29.280 --> 38:30.280
What about you?

38:30.280 --> 38:31.280
Yeah.

38:31.280 --> 38:32.280
I do really want to do.

38:32.280 --> 38:34.280
First of all, let's start with an L.A. show of the show.

38:34.280 --> 38:35.280
Yeah.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.280
But I do want to do a full tour.

38:37.280 --> 38:40.280
With the fucking good giant image.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.280
Well, he would be that you played for us.

38:42.280 --> 38:45.280
I think that during the low point of this show's history,

38:45.280 --> 38:47.280
or we're just talking about sauces.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.280
That's what makes you come up with the idea.

38:49.280 --> 38:50.280
Did I ever show you guys this?

38:50.280 --> 38:51.280
No.

38:51.280 --> 38:53.280
I listen or made this.

38:53.280 --> 38:54.280
And I really want to do.

38:54.280 --> 38:55.280
I would have them.

38:55.280 --> 38:56.280
I have one note.

38:56.280 --> 38:58.280
I want to do the joys in tour.

38:58.280 --> 39:00.280
Which is joy hoisin in poison.

39:00.280 --> 39:01.280
Oh.

39:01.280 --> 39:02.280
But somebody made this.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.280
Where did you get?

39:03.280 --> 39:06.280
Where did they get this high res headshot of you?

39:06.280 --> 39:07.280
That's not even a headshot.

39:07.280 --> 39:11.280
That was a photo that somebody took of me when I stepped on the beach.

39:11.280 --> 39:13.280
And you're wearing a pink cowboy hat?

39:13.280 --> 39:14.280
Yeah.

39:14.280 --> 39:15.280
It was Halloween.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.280
And a pink sweatshirt?

39:16.280 --> 39:17.280
Red, actually.

39:17.280 --> 39:19.280
So they just took everything.

39:19.280 --> 39:20.280
Isn't it?

39:20.280 --> 39:21.280
Yeah.

39:21.280 --> 39:22.280
They took that from Instagram.

39:22.280 --> 39:23.280
Uh.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.280
It's funny.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.280
It's kind of Harry Styles ask.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.280
I think we could do.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.280
I say we do L.A.

39:27.280 --> 39:30.280
SF Portland Seattle.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.280
Yeah.

39:31.280 --> 39:34.280
Or the opposite order.

39:34.280 --> 39:36.280
Or just a west coast run.

39:36.280 --> 39:37.280
Or just Portland.

39:37.280 --> 39:38.280
SF L.A.

39:38.280 --> 39:39.280
Yeah.

39:40.280 --> 39:42.280
The show's not going well.

39:42.280 --> 39:45.280
So it's weird that you have the confidence.

39:45.280 --> 39:46.280
You shouldn't now feel.

39:46.280 --> 39:48.280
Is this isn't like coming off a high?

39:48.280 --> 39:49.280
Yeah.

39:49.280 --> 39:50.280
It's like we're struggling to get to the beach.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.280
Get to the beach.

39:51.280 --> 39:52.280
Yeah.

39:52.280 --> 39:56.280
After they caught your boss, it's a play of a joint-a-based game show.

39:56.280 --> 39:58.280
The ones who never yell.

39:58.280 --> 39:59.280
The one who never yell.

39:59.280 --> 40:02.280
A photographic video in the studio for all to see.

40:02.280 --> 40:03.280
I wouldn't do that at the show.

40:03.280 --> 40:04.280
You might.

40:04.280 --> 40:05.280
Really?

40:05.280 --> 40:06.280
Yeah.

40:06.280 --> 40:07.280
I could see you doing that at the show.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.280
Yeah.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.280
Action.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.280
From the crowd.

40:10.280 --> 40:11.280
I like to solicit.

40:11.280 --> 40:12.280
Right.

40:12.280 --> 40:13.280
Action.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.280
We did a live show once.

40:14.280 --> 40:16.280
That one went really well because I put weeks into it.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.280
If we did a tour, you put weeks into that.

40:18.280 --> 40:20.280
I'll put like three days.

40:20.280 --> 40:22.280
That's right.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.280
But half a week into it.

40:24.280 --> 40:25.280
Yeah.

40:25.280 --> 40:27.280
And there was some technical difficulties.

40:27.280 --> 40:29.280
There were many technical difficulties.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.280
Yeah.

40:30.280 --> 40:31.280
Not turning the show.

40:31.280 --> 40:32.280
Definitely show.

40:32.280 --> 40:33.280
No.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.280
The jeopardy thing.

40:34.280 --> 40:36.280
There were technical difficulties.

40:36.280 --> 40:38.280
I can't get like the answer choices to like.

40:38.280 --> 40:42.280
I didn't realize on stage that the like the price is right.

40:42.280 --> 40:43.280
Or the yeah.

40:43.280 --> 40:44.280
Yeah.

40:44.280 --> 40:45.280
The rules of the family.

40:45.280 --> 40:46.280
The rules of the family.

40:46.280 --> 40:47.280
We couldn't.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.280
You didn't know what was behind.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.280
Each.

40:50.280 --> 40:51.280
Each thing.

40:51.280 --> 40:53.280
So we would make a guess and you have to say yes or no.

40:53.280 --> 40:56.280
But you didn't know what each one said until you clicked it and saw it.

40:56.280 --> 40:57.280
The answer.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.280
Right.

40:58.280 --> 40:59.280
So we would make a guess.

40:59.280 --> 41:00.280
And you would say yes.

41:00.280 --> 41:01.280
And then click it.

41:01.280 --> 41:02.280
No.

41:02.280 --> 41:03.280
It would be something else.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.280
Or vice versa.

41:04.280 --> 41:08.280
And then know this was your guys is coloring of the memory.

41:08.280 --> 41:10.280
I thought I went pretty damn well.

41:10.280 --> 41:11.280
Yeah.

41:11.280 --> 41:12.280
We're like sold people on stage.

41:12.280 --> 41:14.280
And we had five mics.

41:14.280 --> 41:16.280
So that's a venue issue.

41:16.280 --> 41:17.280
We're a little quipped.

41:17.280 --> 41:19.280
We're a little higher on the road on the road.

41:19.280 --> 41:21.280
It would be us two and a me.

41:21.280 --> 41:22.280
And Eika.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.280
And Eika.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.280
Eika.

41:24.280 --> 41:25.280
Eika.

41:25.280 --> 41:26.280
Eika.

41:26.280 --> 41:27.280
Eika.

41:27.280 --> 41:28.280
Eika.

41:28.280 --> 41:29.280
Eika.

41:29.280 --> 41:30.280
Eika.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.280
Eika.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.280
Eika.

41:32.280 --> 41:33.280
Eika.

41:34.280 --> 41:35.280
Mark.

41:35.280 --> 41:36.280
I like the art.

41:36.280 --> 41:39.280
I think if we did smaller venues than we do 150 seed theaters.

41:39.280 --> 41:40.280
Yeah.

41:40.280 --> 41:41.280
We could sell out at all three.

41:41.280 --> 41:44.280
I think we can cash.

41:44.280 --> 41:46.280
Yeah, but not enough to cover the run of the tour.

41:46.280 --> 41:47.280
Yeah, that's super good.

41:47.280 --> 41:49.280
400 tickets.

41:49.280 --> 41:51.280
150 seats, but you have to travel the entire time.

41:51.280 --> 41:54.280
We have to stand hotels if you before people.

41:54.280 --> 41:57.280
You're definitely going to have to pay my fee.

41:57.280 --> 41:58.280
Murphy.

41:58.280 --> 41:59.280
Eka's fly NATO.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.280
And I don't travel anything less than delta cucumber plus.

42:01.280 --> 42:05.760
the comfort plus and I won't stay in anything less than a hawks than her

42:05.760 --> 42:11.120
and tell what you. So at the end of the day, we'd probably lose 5k to 10k minus my

42:11.120 --> 42:16.560
fee, which is 10k per show. So the entire tour would have cost us close to $50,000.

42:16.560 --> 42:21.280
That's before you count. And this is just to sell like 98 seats in a 150 person

42:21.280 --> 42:25.040
venue and Seattle. That's if we sell out which we probably want. That's what I'm saying.

42:26.000 --> 42:31.840
But yeah, I like the poster. We should actually whoever made this poster.

42:31.840 --> 42:36.240
Yeah, I'd include this. I'm saying if you could introduce them because they could do like

42:36.240 --> 42:41.600
other very much for us or yeah. Like if any other podcast go on a live tour.

42:41.600 --> 42:45.440
Yeah. Oh, there's like so many good podcasts that could do a live tour.

42:45.440 --> 42:46.800
Yeah. Right. Can you think of any?

42:47.360 --> 42:49.680
Well, it's just going to say hi and might be used to touring.

42:49.680 --> 42:51.760
We have this exactly. Yeah, hi and might do it.

42:51.760 --> 42:55.840
We might as well. Because Gabriel is a TV star now. Yeah. Well, now. But in fact,

42:56.640 --> 43:01.840
newcomers would be dope. That'd be sick obviously. Yeah. Just two incredibly funny

43:01.840 --> 43:09.520
hosts with a sick following savage. You could probably sell that. Yeah, we can be right

43:09.520 --> 43:12.960
as a dining room. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Keeping my eye out for sure.

43:12.960 --> 43:19.520
Come to random tour. Sponsored by boss. What? I'm saying there's ways or by what?

43:19.600 --> 43:24.960
Voss. You think Voss would sponsor the gash. The words in more.

43:26.320 --> 43:29.120
Finally, we could do Kiko man.

43:30.960 --> 43:35.760
Kiko man. What is that? The soy sauce company. They make a poison. They do.

43:38.000 --> 43:43.280
I'm engaging with you. I was like, oh, really? No, I'm genuinely concerned that you and Jill

43:43.280 --> 43:47.360
aren't cooking with Kiko man. Don't look at me when you talk to him. I'm weak.

43:48.320 --> 43:52.560
I use ways and every once in a while. Yeah. And I use soy and yeah. Well, at least that's

43:52.560 --> 43:58.960
me. Can we at least do the L.A. Show? That's free. Lodging wise. Yeah. Yeah. Well, not if you want

43:58.960 --> 44:02.960
me on it. Because then I'd have to stand a five star. Tell it. Yeah. But that's why I want to write

44:02.960 --> 44:08.000
off. Yeah. Plus the fee. The fee. Yeah. But no, I definitely. I'm down to do it. I think we should do

44:08.000 --> 44:12.560
all of these shows. I don't know if you need to host or if we just do like a joys and tour,

44:12.560 --> 44:16.720
but you're the host. And we have like Gabriel or anybody else from the network because that would be

44:16.800 --> 44:20.560
it wouldn't have to be Jeff Jeff would be on the register, but that's it. Yeah. So if I'm on the

44:20.560 --> 44:24.080
poster, people think that I'm going to be there when I show up, not that everybody's that excited for

44:24.080 --> 44:27.760
that, but I'm just like I put me on the post. But then you don't you're not at the show. It would be a really

44:27.760 --> 44:34.960
funny bit. I think to do this tour and not bring you and to have all of the audience in on the

44:34.960 --> 44:41.280
joke to make it so like go so well and be so much fun without you. That's good. It's like yeah. It's

44:41.280 --> 44:46.240
kind of it's almost like a go fund me, but it's like a go fund. Yeah. It's a go fuck you.

44:46.880 --> 44:51.200
That's awesome. That feels like a different tour, that's the go fuck you tour. Yeah sponsor,

44:51.200 --> 44:55.440
by go fund me. Yeah sponsor. Yeah sponsor. My go song. We had boss.

44:57.760 --> 45:05.120
Moroccan lounge. What about it? 150 seats? Square. Downtown. Never heard of it. You remember

45:05.120 --> 45:11.520
me the Moroccan? No. Yeah, or we could do uh dynasty. This feels like an email.

45:11.520 --> 45:17.120
Yeah, this was an email for sure and to have the email about it before we have

45:17.120 --> 45:20.160
Yeah, and then I sort of didn't follow up because there was a lot going on

45:20.160 --> 45:23.720
We're in the midst of talking about a headgum another headgum live event

45:23.720 --> 45:27.760
Where in October we're looking block it. I'll believe this out, but yeah

45:27.760 --> 45:30.960
Yeah, you don't have to. I mean we don't we're trying to do it in October and November

45:30.960 --> 45:37.280
We haven't chosen a city yet. What are the what's the short list? Portland, Seattle, Chicago, New York

45:37.280 --> 45:43.600
Don't do Chicago. We just did Chicago. We did Chicago in 2018. So it's four years ago

45:44.720 --> 45:51.160
Nothing goes my way. Yeah, you don't like Chicago. That's fine. I think Chicago is great

45:51.160 --> 45:54.160
You're all great. Yeah, yeah

45:54.160 --> 45:58.040
Well, if you want I'm in Portland, Seattle, both on the list. That would be really fun

45:58.280 --> 46:02.400
Why don't we York as long? We just did. Hello, because here's not fucking exciting for any

46:02.400 --> 46:05.840
That's sure New York is way more excited. Let's do it all together. Nobody buys tickets in LA

46:06.360 --> 46:09.920
Because that's yeah, there's too much going on the hard to get around or spoiled here

46:10.640 --> 46:14.960
You gotta go to Denver. That's where you as we go. Do I love it Denver a lot of people?

46:14.960 --> 46:19.120
We've never done anything in Canada. It's a good one Vancouver Toronto

46:19.120 --> 46:23.120
Yeah, just literally that's tough because you're dealing with like in a year-to-year-old

46:23.120 --> 46:26.920
Why do you actually get into Canada? Yeah, yeah, and then how do you get the yay?

46:27.120 --> 46:29.280
What's that border? What's that?

46:29.280 --> 46:32.320
Why do you buy up north?

46:33.280 --> 46:38.960
Ontario. Yes, yes. I can get yippin in Canada. That won't be the issue

46:39.680 --> 46:45.680
That won't be the issue. Yeah, no, I think we should do the Bay Area. Yeah, you don't like the Bay Area

46:46.240 --> 46:53.600
I do one part of America. You dislike. You honestly don't have Boston interesting. Yeah, but you still not like San Francisco

46:53.600 --> 46:58.240
Well, I hated the warriors enough to hate the city, but now I've read enough books about

46:58.880 --> 47:00.880
You know the married pranksters

47:00.880 --> 47:06.400
You know the great. Yeah, Denver's an airplane. San Francisco is a great city, but I don't think that's a great show

47:06.400 --> 47:11.760
I think San Francisco is a great scene. Yeah, it's not a great city, but not a great place to perform

47:11.760 --> 47:16.720
Okay Boston bad city, but good place because everybody's boisterous. Yeah

47:16.720 --> 47:20.720
Everybody in San Francisco is a little too cool for school. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, they are too rich

47:20.720 --> 47:24.960
They're going to Marine County on the weekend. They're not coming to show. Well, that's what I was saying. We could do it sweet water

47:25.200 --> 47:27.200
Where's that? Mill Valley

47:27.920 --> 47:31.360
What is that? It's Bob Wier's music venue

47:32.000 --> 47:38.240
Who is that? He's in the great full bed. Don't look at me. You're talking to him. I have nothing to do with this

47:38.240 --> 47:41.680
Amazing. I feel like if I engage with Jake verbally and look at you

47:42.560 --> 47:44.560
Optically

47:44.560 --> 47:52.240
We'll come up to some kind of a race. What what do you have going on? You guys have a show next week. Yeah, Montreal come to our

48:24.080 --> 48:30.880
Yeah, oh, I saw Olivia actually. She's good. She's um, she was at Jill's premiere for Fire Island. That's fun. Yeah.

48:35.360 --> 48:41.200
That's it. That's our plugs. Um, no more questions about vagina's no more

48:41.280 --> 48:53.600

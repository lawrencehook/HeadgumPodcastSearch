00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Spread love. It's the Brooklyn way.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Nice. Wow.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Actually, I messed that up. It was supposed to be spread legs. It's the Brooklyn way.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
We're doing back-to-back episodes for the first time I would do it.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
You didn't have to say that.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Obviously.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Did you bring a costume change?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
I did.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Joel and I did.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
I brought several.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Just in case.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Oh wow.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
I like this outfit.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
I wanted to be on two different episodes.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I didn't bring enough outfits to have an outfit change today.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
And then have enough for tomorrow and Sunday.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Okay.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Repeat that.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Because you're wearing it for one an hour.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
That's not a dirty outfit.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
You don't know.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
We're in a clean studio.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah, you have my body.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Mm-hmm.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
It's secretions.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
That's an extra central.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
The gym.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
What are we 30 seconds in?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
And we're going to...

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Are you from M.I.?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Um...

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Murdy, you were just kind of fiddling with nonsense.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Yeah.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
That's a good start to the day.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Yeah.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Fiddling with nonsense.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Always.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Great.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
The mic stand was weird.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
And I made it worse.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Have you guys all been like me?

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Uh, toying with the idea of joy?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Always.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Sort of.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Circling it, but never really finding it.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Yeah.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Yeah.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Definitely.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
We were talking about signal rings.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Joel would jump about them.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Yeah.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
And I think my family crest is going to be the serpent eating its own tail.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Is it?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Yes.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Okay.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
You can choose your family crest.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
You can make a family crest today.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Is this our family crest?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Oh, no.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
This is me starting my little James Klan.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
It's going to be unbelievable, Patrick.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
I mean, four little Tykes running around, rolling in the dirt and fucking

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Ulster County eating their own tails.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Yeah.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Wow.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
I mean, the public school system of theirs unbelievable.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Great.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Let me tell you the most fucked up part of American politics.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Mm-hmm.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Is that public education funded by income tax?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Mm-hmm.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Nicola Named.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Right that book?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Oh, no.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
How you were just saying that phrase?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Yeah.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Um, no.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Probably should.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
I should.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
If I want to speak on this at all.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Intelligently.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Anyway.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Yeah.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
I'm fine without it.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm fine not having had.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
You ordered bone broth for lunch.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Yeah, I did.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
A lot of us did.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Mm-hmm.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Oh, everybody did it.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
I didn't.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
I wouldn't.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Because I was fine without the brodo.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Same.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
You delivered that as if it were a pun.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
And it's not.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
You're just saying you're you're fine without bone broth.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
That's absurd.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Yes.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
That's a big brand of bone broth.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Wait, are we ordering it?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Because you're sort of recovering from illness?

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Yes.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
So what happened?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
It sounded like you were ravaged.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I was completely ravaged for three days.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Did you get food poisoning from like a birthday dinner?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I don't know if it was food poisoning.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
I don't know what it was.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
But I couldn't eat or drink.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
I was just very dehydrated and tired.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Yeah.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
And then yesterday I slept about 16 straight hours.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
It was awesome.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
That's good.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
I don't like when food goes to waste.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
And Johnny and our friends went to dinner when I landed on Wednesday.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
And we went to Winson.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Nice.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
And we got the big chicken bun.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Obviously.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
And we cut it six ways.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
And one of the tops of one of the six pieces fell on the ground.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
We're eating outside.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
And I almost had it.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Five second row.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Yeah.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
But then yesterday I was on a walk near here and saw a dog sort of

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
relieving itself on the sidewalk.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
And I was like, that is why I'm proud that I didn't.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
I'm proud of you, too.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Open-faced.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Would you have done it in LA?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
No.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
There's just something magical about New York City.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
That made you want to do it.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
That made me want to, yeah.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
Sort of, you know, kiss the ground that of, you know,

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
the heroes that have roamed these hallowed holes.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Yeah.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Cool.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Cool.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
You know what?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Yeah.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Cool.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
What is this?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I don't know.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
I don't know if it's Joe.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
I don't know if it's Maria being pissed at me already.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
What did I do for you today?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I don't know if it's Maria.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
All right.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
I ain't mad at you.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
I guess, yeah, let's keep it going with this dumb ass.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Alright.

05:08.000 --> 05:17.000
Uh, my bond of the week is Anna Darmus from Blonde to Bond.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Nice.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Wow. She was already in a Bond movie. Are you okay with that?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
She doesn't know time to die.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Really?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Yeah.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
What did she do in no time to die?

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
She had like a fun little moment.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
She acted or a great dress.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
And then she's gonna piece out.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Huh.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
That's too big of an act to be an Easter egg.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Yeah.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
It wasn't an Easter egg.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
It was just a full roll.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
One of the leads on a poster for sure.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
This is so fucked up.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
I saw that movie.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
I think I just didn't know who she was until Blonde.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
How?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
You didn't see that nice out?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
I saw a nice out.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
I saw a nice out.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Okay.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Also, I'm seeing this for the first time ever.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Didn't we build out this room or this room is here?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
This room is here.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Also, we as generous.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
I wasn't.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Yeah.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
There you were not.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Vintage door handle.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
What is it?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Hardware.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yeah.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
That would have most likely been a Jake decision.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
And I doubt it's vintage.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
It woke up.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
It was just foe vintage.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
That's even worse.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
That doesn't fit the vibe of the room.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
No.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Everything's like this kind of forest heel.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Right.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
For the audio.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Does it give me like which undertones?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Honestly.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
The green on my yellow skin.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Oh, no.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
That's what you're saying.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
You have jaundice?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
No.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Under the right circumstances, I might look that way.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Under the right lighting.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Yeah.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
I'm concerned.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I haven't recorded in here yet.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Does it bring on my eyes?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Yes, Joel.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Actually, yeah.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
People say that when I wear a green.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Oh, I see it.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I see it.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Are you okay?

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
It's like peak Joel.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
This is peak Joel.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Before I started recording, you said that you peaked early.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Yeah.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Yeah.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
We haven't done enough improv warm ups for you.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Yeah.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Do you want to do the five, six, seven, eight times?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
I don't even know how to do it.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Why do you want to do it?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Why do you want to do it?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
You want to do it.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
You want to do it.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
You just shake your limbs out.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
We'll do that later.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Trust me.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Shake your limbs out.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
So, Joel, you were introduced to me by pile.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
Or either by pile or Johnny as like a tech prodigy.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Would you describe yourself that way?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
No.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I think this is also the second episode.

07:35.000 --> 07:43.000
I've been on where it's the day after we took down the site for an extended period of time.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
What happened this time was partially me.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
And last time was entirely.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Does anybody else have any bonds of the week?

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
We've gone to the week.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
Let's go with Emma Darcy.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
They are in house with the dragon.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
Recently going viral for the signature drink in a groany spagliato.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Oh, yeah.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Stunning.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Stunning.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Yeah.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
I love the TikTok memes.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
The ones I'm getting are all about.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Yeah.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Go on.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Yeah.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
No, yeah.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
No.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
It's like sexual positions.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
What TikTok for the family wins?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I don't really show me.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
I'm on like kink talk and fashion talk.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
All right.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Interesting.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Yeah.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
But yeah.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
I think they'd be great.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Yeah.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Joel.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
You don't need to.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Kinta Branson.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
That would be amazing.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
I think she would nail it.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
As she does everything that she.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
She is great.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
It's time for a green bond.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
I guess she just won an Emmy.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
It's not like that.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
She does.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Yeah.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
But she's doing a bond with green eyes.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Hmm.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Is that you?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
It could be.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
He.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
He just wants people to call out his eyes.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
It's what I'm picking up.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Anyways, mine is Jamie Lee Curtis.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Yes.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Did you see Halloween on?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
No, yet.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Did you see her New York Times shoot?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Yes.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
No.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
What a babe.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
She's so hot.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I know.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
She's accomplished.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Talented.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Beautiful.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Love's activity a yogurt.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
No.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
What an era.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Hmm.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
What an era.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Hmm.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
She got hundreds of thousands of dollars for that.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
From activity.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
She's swimming in yogurt money.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Was it yogurt?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Activia.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Yeah.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
The stomach bang.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Oh.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Did I get a reaction from activity a yogurt?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
No.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
No.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Because Marie can notice.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I've been crushing gogurts lately.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Honestly.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Maybe.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
It's just like bad ice cream.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
There's no way there's like culture in that.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Well, are you freezing?

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Well, I mean, there's plenty of culture around gogurts.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Do you guys remember those old fruit by the foot commercials?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Where like someone has it in their mouth and they're like,

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Oh, yeah.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Yeah.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
That's how I eat gogurts.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
That was the shit.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
That was like, you know.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Because then I was like, we go to giant eagle.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Shout out.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Pittsburgh and Cleveland.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Great.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
I would just get the fruit by the foot to do the thing.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Sure.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Well.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
Our patients are not dead.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Says cryogenic freezing facility.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
Housing a hundred and ninety nine humans on ice.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Where is it?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I didn't click on the link.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
It was on the headline.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
And I wanted to kind of post this question to you guys.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Would you ever freeze yourself to stay alive?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Keeping in mind, there's no science behind that.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Right.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Future on the style.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Yeah.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Yeah, why not?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Do we have to?

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
Like, when are you going to get the frosted?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
There you go.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
And it's Sam.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
So I'm like, bro.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Frosted.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Typing in the weight.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Other than sixty four pound.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Fifty seven pound.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Um.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
You would do it.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
I mean, I'd like to know how long I'm going to be frozen for.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
I feel like that's an unanswerable question.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
So like, so it's up to someone else's discretion.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Yeah.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Yeah.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
It's like, Austin Powers.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
They had to wait till it was time to bring it back.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Right.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
I think there's a world in which I would.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
Like see what the world is like 250 years now.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Yeah.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
Would you go like as you are now or would you age until you're like,

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
I think I might die.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Let's freeze myself.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I would probably change outfits first.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Okay.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
So not right now.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
So you have enough outfits to change.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
I mean.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Um.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
I could do right now.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
I feel like you want to be in your physical peak to withstand the cryogenic

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
chamber, which is probably right around where I'm at.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
What's going to happen is you're going to freeze to death.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
And then you're never going to come back.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
You're going to be 27.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Yeah.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
I guess I would.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
27.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I would love to like know.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
If these people left any like video messages before they were frozen.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
I just any sort of like correspondence like I've made this decision to do this.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Yeah.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I think that would be really interesting.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
I think you should have host clean house.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Me.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Yeah.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Why?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
So let me do my best.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
American.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
My name's Marika Brownlee and this is Clean House.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Can we get Marika to do a take?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Oh yeah.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
I'm going to.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Uh.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
My name is Marika Brownlee and this is Clean House.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Very good.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Never mind.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Audition wasn't good enough.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Do you need notes for her?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Yeah.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
I love it.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Beyond the scope of repair.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Ouch.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
MLB signs historic CBD deal with Charlotte's web, the CBD company.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Saw that.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
We've got two baseball heads behind the boards.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
How does this change the future of America's past time?

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
It will be slightly buzzed.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Well, they've been easing for years.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
That's true.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Mike Judge has, yeah.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Chape stick galore.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
I've never heard of drugs and baseball.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
That's true.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
It is the peer sport.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Yeah.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Um.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
What else is pine tarry even used for?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Oh, I did look into tar and feathering.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Like the history of tar and feathering.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Because I was like, that's barbaric.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
It really makes me sad.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
But they didn't like cover them in, like,

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
asphalt.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
It was pine tar and they were just rubbed on their chest.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
And then feathers.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
And most of the time.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
So really, you just would lose some chest there.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Right.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
You weren't like boiled to death.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Yeah.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
Do you ever see the John Adam series with Paul Jumonti?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Of course.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Also read the book by David McCullough.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
And I went to his house on Martha's Vineyard.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
That was a field trip.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Wow.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Holy shit.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Okay.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
I thought you were like invited as a dinner guest.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
He's dead now.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
No.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
By the estate.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Right.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
He invited.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
He invited.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
No.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Not dead.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
He's frozen in a cry.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
That's probably true.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Um.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Also, what does this mean for the future of hemp?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Um.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
A lot more of it will be incorporated into the outfits that they play.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
The costumes that baseball players play.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
What's it called?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah.

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
I believe the only sport where the manager is also where the uniform.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
The costume.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
The costume.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
All wrong.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Um.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
That was a wash.

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
A recent daily male article argues that nobody in 2022 should be using the thumbs-up emoji.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Um.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Saying that it points to being old and out of touch.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Um.

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
So I guess I wanted to know what emoji are you.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
I like the one that's kind of the like not the yon.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
There's kind of a little smoke coming out of their mouth.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Yeah.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
The like.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Yeah.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Yeah.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Like that.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
I mean, yon and then.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Yeah.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Yeah.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Yeah.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Yeah.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
I have a emoji related question because this has been a point of contention

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
and some of my group chats.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Um.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
The upside down smiling face emoji.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Mm-hmm.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
What connotation does that hold to you?

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
Like if someone were to send you that, what would your first thought be?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Like if it was.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I'm having a great day upside down smiley face.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
It's sarcasm.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Okay.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Yeah.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
If someone if you said something and someone just replied with an upside

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
down smiley face.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Uh.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
They don't love it.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
They don't like it.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Yeah.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Yeah.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Yeah.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I think it's a little flirty.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
What?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Yeah.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Skipping drills.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Yeah.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Yeah.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
You flirt with the upside down smiling?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Maybe.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
But I definitely have received it.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Oh.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Oh.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
flirtatious.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Okay.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Um.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Unless it was sarcasm, I guess.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Yeah.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
I.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
One of my friends uses it.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
As.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Almost like a commiseration type of.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Respond.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Collaborate.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Of course.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Like.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
I don't know.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
I was.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
I agree.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
No.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
In this most recent conversation.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I said that.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I didn't know when I was going to.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
We were like planning.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
When we were going to watch a movie.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
And I was like, I don't know.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
I'm going to be home.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
And the response was an upside down smiley face.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
They're post.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
That's what I thought.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Correct.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
I wasn't that.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
It was like.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
I'm.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
I'm commiserating about.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Me.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Not knowing what I was going to be home.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
It's like that does not read.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
The same way to me.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
But I thought of this because similarly.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
The thumbs up.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Response.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Yeah.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
On.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
I message.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
I know.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Sometimes is grading for people as well.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
I think it's fine.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
But I know some people think that's sarcastic too.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Oh, I use it.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
That's sarcasticly.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
I only thumbs up things that I'm like.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
That's crazy.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
I use it.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
What is like.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
I use it for knowledge.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
I mean, I will use it for acknowledgement.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
But it's like acknowledgement.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
But also like.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Fuck you, dude.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Just like.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Yeah.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
I updated this.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Yeah.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
That's sort of thing.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Just mostly.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I mean, regards to talking to Marty for being on.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Happy birthday.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Happy birthday.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Happy birthday.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Five zero.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Yeah.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
He did just buy it now.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
He went into Porsche.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Yeah.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
But he still doesn't.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Tesla.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
You can't have both.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I think if you get the vintage Porsche,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
you got to like swap the Tesla.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
He's trying to.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
I believe.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Okay.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
If anyone wants to buy Marty's Tesla.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Why?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Yeah.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
I don't know.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Wait, somebody did.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Alex Berkman's Bay wanted to buy the Tesla.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Really?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Oh, really?

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
It's like the fourth yon.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Well, we were saying John a lot earlier.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
Like the Philly John and then you said,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
John, that set me off.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Now it's just, I think in the air.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
This is fucked up.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
The way it's going so far.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
That's fine.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
I'm just going to get my drink.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
It does match your outfit.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Yeah.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Thanks.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
I think I'm the like realistic,

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
arterial heart emoji.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Mm-hmm.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Oh, I understand.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Like a human heart.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
I know why.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Why is that?

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
Oh, because I'm full of love, but I keep it real.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Mm-hmm.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Actually, I keep it real.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Wow.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Nice plug with the young wind.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Yeah.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I auditioned for Rails pilot and got a callback

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
and then didn't get the part.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
So I've been meeting to take that up with the realm itself.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Yeah, you should.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Him Ralph.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
Maybe just like bust into their recording.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Mm-hmm.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
I did fully interrupt a nad pod recording once

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
because I needed files for a sketch.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Very good.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Anyway.

19:21.000 --> 19:28.000
I think that I'm the thinking emoji,

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
the one that has the little hand.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
What does the energy behind that?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Because to me, it's like, hmm,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
is that what you're going for?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
No.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
I think I only use it when I genuinely,

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
I'm conveying that I'm pondering something.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
I see.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Wow.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
Well, I think the main takeaway here is 60% of all

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
communication is lost when it's not verbal.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Yeah.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
So.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
I think 60% of communication is lost when it's not violent.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Mm-hmm.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Interesting.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
It's a violent image.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Like yelling at someone.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Oh, that explains so much about who you are.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Mm-hmm.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Oh, yeah.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
I guess, you know, non-violent, non-verbal communication.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Yeah.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Mm-hmm.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Mm-hmm.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
Would you guys spend $450 on shoes that look like casts?

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
No.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
No.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Okay.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
No.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Did you?

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
No.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Great.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
I've got my staples.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Things that you can wear with basically anything.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Mm-hmm.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Boots.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Also, how much does a cast cost?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Probably less than that.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Well, if you don't have insurance.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Yeah.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
It's the cast or the only shoes or boots that cost more.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Yeah.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Yeah.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Yeah.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Yeah.

20:46.000 --> 20:54.000
The show either keeps me going or makes me want to just quit it all.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Where are we this week?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
The latter, of course.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Okay.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Um.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
Per popular science, the key to tasty or beer might be mutant yeast.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
With notes of banana.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Yeah.

21:07.000 --> 21:14.000
And I don't know what it's dependent on.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
What?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
What's dependent on?

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
You know, we got to figure this shit out.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
All right.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Let's do the fucking improv one.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
What did you do?

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Do some non verbal communication.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Advertising.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Except.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Uh.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
The fucking, you know, one, two, three, four.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
I don't know how to do it.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
You teach me.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
And I had to do it.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
One, two, three, four.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Yeah.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
One, two.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
You have to take a break.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
This is fucked up.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Wow.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Uh.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
The only people not fucking up were Emma and Patrick.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
Oh, yeah.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
This show is sponsored by Better Help.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
Guys, ever wish life came with a user manual.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
You know, sometimes you're really stressed or you're burnt out or you're facing a problem

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
in any of your relationships with your family, with a partner with friends at work.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
And you kind of wish that you had some tips, some tricks, some tools, ways to deal with

22:06.000 --> 22:13.000
it, whether practically or emotionally, well, that's where therapy can come in.

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
And Better Help online therapy is there to help you access therapy.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
Now, unfortunately, life doesn't come with a user manual, so when it's not working for you,

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
it's normal to feel stuck and navigating any of life's challenges can make you feel unsure,

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
whether it's a career change, a new relationship, becoming a parent, et cetera.

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
And therapists are trained to help you figure out the cause of challenging emotions and learn productive coping skills,

22:37.000 --> 22:44.000
whether which makes therapy the closest thing to a guided tour of the complex engine called you.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
I go to therapy every week.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
It really does help me out.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
It's definitely, as I've always said on this show, doing ads for Better Help.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
It helps me show up for those around me as the best version of myself.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
It can be.

22:56.000 --> 23:03.000
And not that I was a horrible person before, but I do think that I can handle myself in all of my relationships better,

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
and also just feel more comfortable in my emotional self.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
And just the weeks go by easier when I have therapy.

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
More Round.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
I was picturing like more of a DJ booth set up.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Would that be cooler?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Yes.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Damn it.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Um...

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Yeah.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
Oh.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Wow.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
I don't mean to do this.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
I don't mean to do this.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
I've only gone dancing with Maria.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
True.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I think we might have gone dancing.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
We were all dancing.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Yeah.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
That's true.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
Well, it was more like everyone was really fucked up.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
And we were all just moving.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Is it dancing?

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
This was on the company off site.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
We're talking about it.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
I was pretty sober.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
I was really drunk.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I was with you.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I went to the bathroom because I needed a minute.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
And that was when I realized there was like about to brown out.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
And somebody was rude to me in the line to the bathroom.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
And I was like, kind of come on man.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
This woman at that bar.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
What was it called?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Dirk.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Dirk.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Diggler.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
No, that's um.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Dirk Hansen.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Dirk Hansen.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Dirk Hansen.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Yeah.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Dear Evan Hansen.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
I was walking back from the bathroom.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
So drunk.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
And this woman goes, oh my god.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
I love your lipstick.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
And I'm like really come here.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
And then I just go over to her.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
And I put my lipstick on.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
But you applied it as eyeliner.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Yeah.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Big heart interface.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
And then I'm on her by kissing her.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Yeah.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
I made out with this woman.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
And then we went back to this area.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Everyone was dancing.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
And I just never dancing.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
And like falling over repeatedly.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Yeah.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
It was a good time.

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
I did my classic mixed race goodbye.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
What does that mean?

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
Well, you know, I'm half a Lithuanian half Indian Portuguese Malaysian.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Which is a lot of half.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Yeah.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
I was a lot of halves.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I'm a 250% man.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
But um, basically, if I'm really drunk, I'll just leave.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
And that's everybody.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Went back to the hotel.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
And then you were around a fire.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Yeah.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
And then yeah.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
That was a good way to sober up.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Seeing you around fire.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
Was was talking to Adam Boyd.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Were you there with a pizza in Taco Bell?

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Yeah.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
You ordered a Taco Bell.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
I put it in order for Taco Bell.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
But that's when my nose started bleeding.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Yeah.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
I.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Wow.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
I went back with Casey and on.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Casey and I.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
A pizza and I went to sleep.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
And I didn't experience any of this.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
You guys are you're so much smarter than I am.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Yeah.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
You're able to go viral off of a necklace.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
And then as a nose started bleeding.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
No.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
I just have a sensitive nose.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Oh.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Yeah.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
I can pop that all.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Pop.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Someone popped you in the nose.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Don't get that.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
I was pop, baby.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
I actually get out of.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Vandro.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
I actually think that was a laughing induced.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Oh, yeah.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
You started cracking up.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
And then your nose started bleeding.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
That was so funny to me.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Right.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Right.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Right.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Which only makes start bleeding more.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Sort of a.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Right.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Before I let.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
What he said.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Party.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Which was.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
We should say on a like platform in the middle of a street.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
I was on the street.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
One of the worst city blocks I've ever experienced.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I was a purely terrible.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
God's Taylor zone.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
Dane leaned over and yelled at me.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
You're like Neo from the matrix.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
It's like I have to get out of here.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Wow.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
And what way?

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
I don't know.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I'll never forget it.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
It was wild.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
It's like gotta go.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
We do have to learn the gritty though.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Oh, sorry.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
What if you already know how?

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Do you know how?

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Yeah.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
It was gritty.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
They're spacing here.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
No.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
That's why I came up with a segment.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Because they're.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Because of how cramped it is in here.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
And we all have to gritty.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
You know how to do it.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
So why don't you go.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
I you tube that exact same thing.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
That's on the screen.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
About three weekends ago.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Wait.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Didn't we talk about this in LA that you had been?

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
Yeah.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Because you did it.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
After you got that.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
I'm done.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Yeah.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
I don't know.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
What is it backwards?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Three point.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
That's the one.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
And then yeah, I hit the gritty on video.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Though it got cut off too soon.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Yeah.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
I'm going to hear.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Let's give it like eight seconds.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
I'm going to put that video right here.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
No one is Joel making a backwards three pointer.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
But I can't stress enough.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
They cut it off too soon.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Did they really see you did the gritty afterwards?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Like you see like.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
In point five.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Second of a great.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Yeah.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Um.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
We can still see it.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Yeah.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
I'm wearing.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Where do I go right here?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
On the table.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
No.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Yeah.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
If I have like a.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
If there's a really good moment.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Then I could like get up and do it.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
But I don't feel like we have to do it right now.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
And that's.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
You got to create.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
That's right.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Can you do it in your seat?

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
I mean, the the trick is sort of tap the heels.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
So in the seat.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I mean, I could do it in the seat.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Yeah.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Can you do it in your sleep?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Can you do it?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
That's okay.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
You're.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Yeah.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
I'll start it off.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Yeah.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
I'll start it off.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
There's a lot of.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
It's way too much stuff.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Okay.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
It's like.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
It's my shoes.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Here's it remotely.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
No.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
It's hard.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
You're not moving.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Please don't step on those remotes.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
No.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
I won't be doing.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
I won't be doing.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
I won't be doing.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Sorry.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
I think we should do like maybe like a cross stream gritty.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
No way.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
What's the idea.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Like neutral annihilation.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
What's the word for that?

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Mutually sure destruction.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Yeah.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Um.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
Between all of us because I just probably humiliated myself.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Not even just in front of Emma.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
But in front of millions.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Thousands.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Hmm.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
If it was millions, I wouldn't be here.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Oh, yes.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Unless this is my role from that.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
If this goes viral from that,

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
I think the Marty's birthday should be officially my day.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Yeah.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
I mean, it can be.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Yeah.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
So you can come up to for sure.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Um.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Marie, get your out.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
I won't be standing up.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
We're doing that.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
I'm back.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
That's everything.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
It's like it's everything.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
It's everything.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
It's everything.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
No, I won't be jumping today.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
The show doesn't go on until you do it.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
That's fine.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
I'll sit here.

30:17.000 --> 30:24.000
I also have never actually seen someone do it until you just did it.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
So.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I thought we were all taking phone breaks.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Spring and be spring bones almost here.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Oh, it's good.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
I think I just saw movement.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Maybe Johnny went to grab it.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
I hope he did.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
I don't have my phones like the left out.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
I don't know.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
I don't know.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
It's fair.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I'm willing to talk.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I just refuse to jump.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
It's not jumping.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
It's a gritty.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
It involves jumping, which I won't be doing today.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
Can you show the video of how it's done?

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
There wasn't a video.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
I was going to walk you guys through it.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Step by step.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Well, can you do that?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Don't compromise.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
It's what families do.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
And business partners.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Yeah.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
So you go like this.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Okay.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
I think you got to start down low.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Yeah, you start down low.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
And then you just kind of bring it up.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
Please also compromise role.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
And you kind of have it to give it to the sons.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Right.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Right.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Great.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Great.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Okay.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
And you can make like a goofy mug.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
You kind of got to be tapping your heels.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
Yeah.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Joel.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
You want to demonstrate just because I feel like they forgot?

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Yeah.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Yeah.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
You're like.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Your heels are really different.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Did I do it wrong?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
I mean, you didn't move and you were on one foot.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
So I'm going to go with yes.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Yeah.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
I feel like I need to see what is the origin of this.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
It's not related to the cost of a man.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
Jersey.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
The state.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Okay.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Will you do the gritty?

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Not now.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
This is.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
We're not buying in.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
You know what I mean?

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Yeah.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
This is like the.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
My bold vision included this.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Did it.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Yeah.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I was like, I'm going to get Kayla and Marie get a gritty in the New York studio.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Hmm.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Did you have a deadline on me out?

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Halloween.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
I knew you would do it without me.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
It's not the first time.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
Well, this was ruined.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
Usually these episodes sour because of me.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
So I actually feel happy that it's because of y'all.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
Yeah, but I think inside your sad because you didn't get what you wanted.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
I really wanted.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
The reason it's fun is because people want to see you do the gritty.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I refuse to jump on camera.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
It's not jumping.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
It's just moving your legs.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Yeah.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
No thank you.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
I agree.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I think people would want to see Marie could do it.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Just if I do it.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
I think it's better than Joel doing it.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
Not that you were just that people expected to have done it.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
I don't really.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
He's been banished from Philadelphia.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
It's so hot in here.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
It is really hot.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
I feel fine.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
This is such a warm.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Yeah.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
I'm wearing a sweater based outfit.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
It's all sweater.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Yeah, I wish I'd brought a fucking change of clothes.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
I almost broke.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
You can use my other one.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
It's not.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
What do you mean?

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Medium small.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
What are you?

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
I'm a large.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Medium large.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Do you have a large t-shirt?

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Maybe.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
We'll talk.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Wow.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
All right.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
I have a white t-shirt in my.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Can I wear it?

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Yeah.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Just look at that.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
Compromise.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Wow.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
The show lost steam when you said you wouldn't do the gritty.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
I know.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
This is so fucked up.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
We're learning and growing.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
That's nice.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
I'm going to go over the top.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Welcome to Philistine Halloween.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I love Halloween.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
I do.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
I don't care for it.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I like the holiday.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I'm just doing just like up and costume.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
I thought you hated it through a guru.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
No.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Okay.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Because I was going to plan your perfect Halloween.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Oh.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
I mean, you can still do it.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Okay.

34:33.000 --> 34:39.600
Um, let's think about some things that would be Marieka's perfect Halloween.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.240
First of all, we need to spooky venue.

34:41.240 --> 34:43.040
We need tons of decorations.

34:43.040 --> 34:46.640
We need lighting, appetizers and treats, Halloween cocktails and music.

34:46.640 --> 34:47.640
Great.

34:47.640 --> 34:50.880
That's from a list of how to plan a Halloween party.

34:50.880 --> 34:51.880
Comprehensive?

34:51.880 --> 34:53.480
Yeah, for my think, food 52.

34:53.480 --> 34:54.480
Okay.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.280
A reliable source.

34:56.280 --> 34:59.960
Spooky venue, I'm thinking, your spare bedroom, your apartment.

34:59.960 --> 35:00.960
That spooky?

35:00.960 --> 35:01.960
Yeah.

35:02.200 --> 35:06.040
Dead cockroach in there the other day, so I didn't like that.

35:06.040 --> 35:08.040
You see, wonder who killed it?

35:08.040 --> 35:10.040
Probably the spray that I sprayed.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.040
Oh yeah.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.040
I loved it.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.040
I loved it.

35:13.040 --> 35:16.400
Because I feel like nobody really goes in there.

35:16.400 --> 35:21.800
I'd say I'd go in there on a regular basis, but it could be a scary venue

35:21.800 --> 35:23.440
if we tried hard.

35:23.440 --> 35:24.920
And I'm willing to try that.

35:24.920 --> 35:30.480
It's easy, affordable, which for someone who I thought hated Halloween.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.800
Perfect.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.920
This episode's going really well.

35:34.920 --> 35:35.920
It was.

35:35.920 --> 35:44.040
I think it's just you not understanding me as a person, which is a little bit sad

35:44.040 --> 35:45.680
for how long I've known you.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.280
It's one specific thing.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.280
Well, it's two things.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.800
What's the second one that you wouldn't do the grid?

35:49.800 --> 35:50.800
Yeah.

35:50.800 --> 35:54.200
I think that you could potentially make me do that on camera.

35:54.200 --> 35:55.200
I was nervous.

35:55.200 --> 35:57.640
I wouldn't want to do it.

35:57.640 --> 35:59.640
I just thought you would.

35:59.720 --> 36:01.920
No.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.720
Tons of decorations.

36:03.720 --> 36:06.280
But you don't want to put that much effort into it.

36:06.280 --> 36:08.760
OK.

36:08.760 --> 36:13.040
I think a sheet over a floor lamp, the ghost.

36:13.040 --> 36:17.880
Do you have any, like, swemitod related programs?

36:17.880 --> 36:19.440
There's something you could put a little shop

36:19.440 --> 36:20.880
a horse or anything or do your place.

36:20.880 --> 36:23.360
And there's like a weird amount of bar beside.

36:23.360 --> 36:24.880
Oh.

36:24.880 --> 36:25.880
OK.

36:25.880 --> 36:28.560
You could make it a bar beside ghost.

36:28.560 --> 36:30.000
Yeah.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.520
It's blue.

36:31.520 --> 36:32.360
It would be blue.

36:32.360 --> 36:33.600
Yeah, right.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.360
Yeah, I could do that.

36:36.360 --> 36:41.960
I don't know, maybe, like, some cheesecloth as spider webs.

36:41.960 --> 36:43.920
Yeah, you got a lot of cheesecloth at home.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.080
Yeah.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.440
You know, for straining various things.

36:47.440 --> 36:50.600
You're a cheesemonger and a barber.

36:50.600 --> 36:51.800
It's just a salmon and a chocolate.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.320
We could pitch, by the way.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.080
Yeah, I thought you were.

36:57.080 --> 36:58.080
It's perfect.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.080
Philistine Halloween.

36:59.080 --> 37:01.080
You'll see now in from America.

37:01.080 --> 37:08.520
Well, it would involve some sort of cookie.

37:08.520 --> 37:09.680
I do like cookies.

37:09.680 --> 37:13.640
Maybe from that cookie place in the theater district.

37:13.640 --> 37:14.640
Yeah.

37:14.640 --> 37:15.640
It was a good cookie monster.

37:15.640 --> 37:17.320
I think I could kill it on Sesame Street.

37:17.320 --> 37:18.640
I think it was pretty good.

37:18.640 --> 37:21.320
Maybe you could come dressed up as cookie monster.

37:21.320 --> 37:22.320
Oh, yeah.

37:22.320 --> 37:23.320
Giving cookies.

37:23.320 --> 37:24.320
I, yeah.

37:24.320 --> 37:25.320
I would enjoy that.

37:25.560 --> 37:27.320
Physically, you're like, giving cookie.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.320
Gritty onion.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.320
Oh, yeah.

37:29.320 --> 37:30.320
Gritty monster.

37:30.320 --> 37:31.320
Mm-hmm.

37:31.320 --> 37:32.320
Um, yeah.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.320
Schmackeries.

37:33.320 --> 37:34.320
Schmackeries.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.320
What is that?

37:35.320 --> 37:37.320
That's like a key place, slightly like.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.320
What's that?

37:38.320 --> 37:40.320
Like, core, you both love Amaro?

37:40.320 --> 37:41.320
Yeah.

37:41.320 --> 37:44.320
You would have, floor to ceiling Amaro.

37:44.320 --> 37:46.320
Maybe dripping from the wall.

37:46.320 --> 37:47.320
Oh, like, blood.

37:47.320 --> 37:48.320
That's cool.

37:48.320 --> 37:49.320
It's expensive.

37:49.320 --> 37:50.320
Yeah.

37:50.320 --> 37:51.320
I don't know.

37:51.320 --> 37:52.320
Water it down.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.320
Amaro, I slush.

37:53.320 --> 37:54.320
I don't know.

37:54.320 --> 37:55.320
I don't know.

37:55.320 --> 37:56.320
That's cool.

37:56.320 --> 37:57.320
Let's go.

37:57.320 --> 37:58.320
But that might be too much effort.

37:58.320 --> 37:59.320
Oh, yeah.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.320
Someone brought the Ice Luge.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.320
That was okay.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.320
It was like delivered.

38:02.320 --> 38:04.320
You didn't have to think about it.

38:04.320 --> 38:05.320
Um.

38:05.320 --> 38:06.320
Joel brought it.

38:06.320 --> 38:08.320
Well, thank you, Joel.

38:08.320 --> 38:10.320
Yeah.

38:10.320 --> 38:13.320
The Ice Luge is just Joel freezing cold.

38:13.320 --> 38:14.320
He's cryogenic.

38:14.320 --> 38:18.320
Before the reason to normal temperature sliding Amaro down his back.

38:18.320 --> 38:21.320
You can use it for the next 120 years based on the temperature.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.320
But remember, he's not dead.

38:24.320 --> 38:25.320
Yeah.

38:25.320 --> 38:26.320
Lighting.

38:26.320 --> 38:27.320
Right?

38:27.320 --> 38:28.320
Mm-hmm.

38:28.320 --> 38:31.320
I'm thinking you replace all the bulbs in your place with Philips Hugh.

38:31.320 --> 38:33.320
Then it's not just for Halloween.

38:33.320 --> 38:34.320
Yeah.

38:34.320 --> 38:35.320
It might take some effort.

38:35.320 --> 38:41.320
But then you can sort of curate the vibe just so you're around.

38:41.320 --> 38:42.320
Mm-hmm.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.320
I do like that idea.

38:44.320 --> 38:47.320
I love a smart bulb.

38:47.320 --> 38:52.320
I also have a lot of string lights that are like purple and pink.

38:52.320 --> 38:59.320
Um, so that could be running a dollar store.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.320
Okay.

39:00.320 --> 39:02.320
Um.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.320
I'm trying to think.

39:04.320 --> 39:05.320
Yeah.

39:05.320 --> 39:06.320
I don't know.

39:06.320 --> 39:07.320
String lights.

39:07.320 --> 39:11.320
I'll put some like crate paper over a lamp.

39:11.320 --> 39:12.320
Sort of what we're doing the shadows.

39:12.320 --> 39:13.320
Mm-hmm.

39:13.320 --> 39:14.320
That's spooky.

39:14.320 --> 39:15.320
Yeah.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.320
That's easy.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.320
Yeah.

39:17.320 --> 39:20.320
This Philips Dean Halloween is coming together.

39:21.320 --> 39:24.320
Um, appetizers and treats.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.320
Candy galore.

39:26.320 --> 39:27.320
Yep.

39:27.320 --> 39:29.320
And you said that you don't mind candy.

39:29.320 --> 39:36.320
Well, you asked me yesterday, say, like you asked me if I like candy yesterday, but you said it as you hate candy, right?

39:36.320 --> 39:39.320
And candies may be one of my favorite things in this entire world.

39:39.320 --> 39:41.320
I love candy so much.

39:41.320 --> 39:42.320
I said an emphatic.

39:42.320 --> 39:44.320
I love candy.

39:44.320 --> 39:46.320
Um, I'm very passionate about it.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.320
So any type of candy.

39:49.320 --> 39:50.320
What's your favorite?

39:50.320 --> 39:55.320
Uh, I'd have to break that into category of candy.

39:55.320 --> 39:58.320
They were stuck in this favorite sweet favorite and then flex spot.

39:58.320 --> 39:59.320
Favorite chocolate.

39:59.320 --> 40:04.320
It's going to have to be a Hershey's cookies and cream.

40:04.320 --> 40:05.320
Or.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.320
Can't get my nuts.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.320
Yeah.

40:07.320 --> 40:08.320
I do.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.320
Hi.

40:09.320 --> 40:10.320
It's like the sour cream and onion chip.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.320
I hate dark chocolate.

40:12.320 --> 40:14.320
Um, I guess we're in other favorite candies.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.320
Yeah.

40:15.320 --> 40:16.320
Yeah, sure.

40:17.320 --> 40:18.320
Um, those.

40:18.320 --> 40:22.320
I would say that I like gummy bears more.

40:22.320 --> 40:26.320
I did go through my can egg phase for a really long time.

40:26.320 --> 40:28.320
I just like would house my can eggs.

40:28.320 --> 40:31.320
Um, you know, my can I cut it falling out?

40:31.320 --> 40:32.320
That's.

40:32.320 --> 40:33.320
Really.

40:33.320 --> 40:34.320
Oh, what?

40:34.320 --> 40:35.320
The candy.

40:35.320 --> 40:38.320
Like one of just the pink ones.

40:38.320 --> 40:39.320
Yeah.

40:39.320 --> 40:40.320
Yeah.

40:40.320 --> 40:41.320
Those are the best ones.

40:41.320 --> 40:42.320
They're good.

40:42.320 --> 40:43.320
Um, I do like sour patch.

40:43.320 --> 40:45.320
I think gummy bears rank a little higher for me.

40:45.320 --> 40:46.320
Haribo or.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.320
Yeah.

40:47.320 --> 40:50.320
Just the classic care about the sour ones are good.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.320
Just how much watermelons.

40:51.320 --> 40:52.320
Good.

40:52.320 --> 40:54.320
Um.

40:54.320 --> 40:59.320
The air heads extreme bites are great.

40:59.320 --> 41:01.320
Sour gummy worms.

41:01.320 --> 41:03.320
A trolley gummy worm delicious.

41:03.320 --> 41:04.320
Trotty gummy.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.320
Uh, they'll get us the belts.

41:06.320 --> 41:07.320
Yeah.

41:07.320 --> 41:08.320
The sour belts are great.

41:08.320 --> 41:09.320
Belts are great.

41:09.320 --> 41:10.320
I love the sour.

41:10.320 --> 41:11.320
Um, I do.

41:11.320 --> 41:14.320
I like most chocolate bars.

41:14.320 --> 41:18.320
Like in moderation, but I'm not a huge, like I don't.

41:18.320 --> 41:21.320
Like I'm not like a I love chocolate person.

41:21.320 --> 41:24.320
And I do like white chalk of the best.

41:24.320 --> 41:26.320
Um, caramel's are great.

41:26.320 --> 41:28.320
I love a caramel.

41:28.320 --> 41:30.320
Uh, baby Ruth.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.320
Payday.

41:31.320 --> 41:34.320
Sounds like the candy's covered.

41:34.320 --> 41:35.320
I would say.

41:35.320 --> 41:36.320
Yeah.

41:36.320 --> 41:37.320
She loves candy.

41:37.320 --> 41:38.320
Yeah.

41:38.320 --> 41:39.320
You brought this next Saturday, right?

41:39.320 --> 41:40.320
Yeah.

41:40.320 --> 41:41.320
I know what to get you.

41:41.320 --> 41:42.320
Yeah.

41:42.320 --> 41:44.320
Um.

41:44.320 --> 41:46.320
I also think devil eggs.

41:46.320 --> 41:47.320
No, love devil eggs.

41:47.320 --> 41:49.320
That's a hard pass for me.

41:49.320 --> 41:50.320
I hate it.

41:50.320 --> 41:51.320
I hate it.

41:51.320 --> 41:52.320
Devil eggs.

41:52.320 --> 41:53.320
Oh, I love them.

41:53.320 --> 41:54.320
But devil, you know.

41:54.320 --> 41:55.320
Oh, God.

41:55.320 --> 41:56.320
I'm here.

41:56.320 --> 41:58.320
That actually just ruined my day.

41:58.320 --> 42:01.320
I was seeing this face through this little slit.

42:01.320 --> 42:02.320
You've seen it so long.

42:02.320 --> 42:03.320
It's really sad.

42:03.320 --> 42:05.320
I feel like you should hop in on the second episode.

42:05.320 --> 42:07.320
You probably asked to go.

42:07.320 --> 42:08.320
Why did he?

42:08.320 --> 42:09.320
Why would he be here?

42:09.320 --> 42:10.320
He lives two hours away.

42:10.320 --> 42:13.320
He went to lunch with a friend that's not any of us.

42:13.320 --> 42:16.320
Yeah.

42:16.320 --> 42:17.320
I did once I asked him.

42:17.320 --> 42:18.320
How's living up state?

42:18.320 --> 42:20.320
And he said it honestly kind of lonely.

42:20.320 --> 42:24.320
Even just something as simple as getting lunch with a friend isn't possible.

42:24.320 --> 42:25.320
That's the same thing.

42:25.320 --> 42:26.320
Yeah.

42:26.320 --> 42:27.320
Not so.

42:27.320 --> 42:28.320
Yeah.

42:28.320 --> 42:29.320
Um.

42:29.320 --> 42:30.320
No devil.

42:30.320 --> 42:31.320
No devil eggs.

42:31.320 --> 42:32.320
I party.

42:32.320 --> 42:33.320
Sorry.

42:33.320 --> 42:34.320
Part pass.

42:34.320 --> 42:38.320
Let's round out this Philistine Halloween with cocktails and music.

42:38.320 --> 42:39.320
For cocktails, I say, why bother?

42:39.320 --> 42:43.320
But I guess we can make a group in a groany bowl and add purple food coloring.

42:43.320 --> 42:46.320
Because I bet America has that for cakes or some shit.

42:46.320 --> 42:47.320
Uh, purple food coloring.

42:47.320 --> 42:48.320
I don't have it.

42:48.320 --> 42:49.320
I definitely have a regular.

42:49.320 --> 42:51.320
The regular standard colors.

42:51.320 --> 42:52.320
I can mix to the purple.

42:52.320 --> 42:53.320
Yeah.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.320
I have a red.

42:54.320 --> 42:57.320
I have a blue red food going in a groany.

42:57.320 --> 42:58.320
Yeah.

42:58.320 --> 43:02.320
You know, I got.

43:02.320 --> 43:06.320
I got a little bar cart that usually behind me and my zoom.

43:06.320 --> 43:07.320
Yeah.

43:07.320 --> 43:12.320
I'm not sure this fits into the right category, but how about when you like skin a bunch

43:12.320 --> 43:15.320
of grapes and put them in a bowl.

43:15.320 --> 43:17.320
It's like a bowl of eyeballs.

43:17.320 --> 43:19.320
A lot of effort.

43:19.320 --> 43:23.320
But if someone did it for me, I'd appreciate it.

43:23.320 --> 43:27.320
I guess I would it be for just touching or for eating.

43:27.320 --> 43:28.320
You should not eat them.

43:28.320 --> 43:29.320
I don't.

43:29.320 --> 43:32.320
If someone skins them and everyone's putting their hands on it.

43:32.320 --> 43:33.320
I was thinking.

43:33.320 --> 43:35.320
I'm not really a germaphob, so I'd be fine eating them.

43:35.320 --> 43:38.320
But I'd understand like the group decision to not eat them.

43:38.320 --> 43:40.320
And then you would feel the pressure.

43:40.320 --> 43:41.320
Yeah.

43:41.320 --> 43:42.320
That's.

43:42.320 --> 43:45.320
I think why I ended up getting so sick is because I just how

43:45.320 --> 43:48.320
was a bowl of fake eyeballs after a party.

43:48.320 --> 43:49.320
Just kidding.

43:49.320 --> 43:50.320
It's good.

43:50.320 --> 43:53.320
Troll got excited.

43:53.320 --> 43:54.320
Um.

43:54.320 --> 43:56.320
I'm really picky about grapes.

43:56.320 --> 43:57.320
I don't.

43:57.320 --> 44:02.320
Or like to eat them when they're soft.

44:02.320 --> 44:04.320
That's for what you said.

44:04.320 --> 44:05.320
Thanks.

44:05.320 --> 44:09.320
What was your thoughts for what I said?

44:09.320 --> 44:12.320
Concured.

44:12.320 --> 44:13.320
I don't.

44:13.320 --> 44:15.320
Two people eat conquered grapes.

44:15.320 --> 44:16.320
I'd love to drink it.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.320
Yeah.

44:17.320 --> 44:18.320
I don't know.

44:18.320 --> 44:20.320
I love drinking a conquered grape juice.

44:20.320 --> 44:23.320
Somebody once fed me a conquered grape.

44:23.320 --> 44:26.320
That what I thought was just a platonic lunch.

44:26.320 --> 44:27.320
Oh.

44:27.320 --> 44:32.320
Did you have to spit out seeds?

44:33.320 --> 44:37.320
That's wallet.

44:37.320 --> 44:40.320
I like a scupper not my mom.

44:40.320 --> 44:43.320
What are you doing, man?

44:43.320 --> 44:45.320
We have another one who needs to do it.

44:45.320 --> 44:48.320
Take it easy.

44:48.320 --> 44:51.320
Trying to fill woods and silence.

44:51.320 --> 44:54.320
Um.

44:54.320 --> 44:56.320
Music.

44:56.320 --> 44:57.320
Pre-made Halloween.

44:57.320 --> 44:58.320
Play those.

44:58.320 --> 44:59.320
Sure.

44:59.320 --> 45:00.320
I can go through the effort to book them.

45:00.320 --> 45:01.320
Probably would.

45:01.320 --> 45:04.320
That's probably the one thing I'd spend time with.

45:04.320 --> 45:05.320
Wow.

45:05.320 --> 45:06.320
Wow.

45:06.320 --> 45:10.320
We have to move on.

45:10.320 --> 45:15.320
Is the John Carpenter who did the Halloween theme song that's related to the Sabrina Carpenter?

45:15.320 --> 45:20.320
I don't think so.

45:20.320 --> 45:21.320
Good question.

45:21.320 --> 45:22.320
Yeah.

45:22.320 --> 45:26.320
Carpenter is related to the Carpenter or John Carpenter is related.

45:26.320 --> 45:29.320
I don't think they are related at all.

45:29.320 --> 45:32.320
Um.

45:32.320 --> 45:37.320
That was the extent of any Halloween segment I had because Halloween's on Monday from this Friday.

45:37.320 --> 45:38.320
Yeah.

45:38.320 --> 45:39.320
This comes out.

45:39.320 --> 45:40.320
Um.

45:40.320 --> 45:41.320
Plug.

45:41.320 --> 45:42.320
What do you guys have going on?

45:42.320 --> 45:43.320
We want to point the people to.

45:43.320 --> 45:44.320
This is over already.

45:44.320 --> 45:46.320
And I mean, finally.

45:46.320 --> 45:47.320
That's 40 minutes.

45:47.320 --> 45:48.320
I thought it was good.

45:48.320 --> 45:49.320
Yeah.

45:49.320 --> 45:50.320
If I'll pretty short to me.

45:50.320 --> 45:52.320
I mean, I'm really mad at you.

45:52.320 --> 45:54.320
But everything else was great.

45:54.320 --> 45:55.320
Yeah.

45:55.320 --> 45:57.320
Joel had some great lines in there.

45:57.320 --> 45:58.320
Caleb too.

45:58.320 --> 45:59.320
Maria.

45:59.320 --> 46:00.320
What was the grape you said?

46:00.320 --> 46:01.320
Scupernon.

46:01.320 --> 46:03.320
I do.

46:03.320 --> 46:04.320
I do.

46:04.320 --> 46:07.320
I do feel like I need to finish that thought.

46:07.320 --> 46:10.320
Which is just that my mom asked me if she wanted.

46:10.320 --> 46:12.320
If I wanted her to male.

46:12.320 --> 46:14.320
Me grapes.

46:14.320 --> 46:15.320
And.

46:15.320 --> 46:16.320
I said no.

46:16.320 --> 46:18.320
Is that what a scupper not is.

46:18.320 --> 46:20.320
The grape that gets mailed to you.

46:20.320 --> 46:21.320
No.

46:21.320 --> 46:23.320
Spell it and describe it.

46:23.320 --> 46:24.320
Yes.

46:24.320 --> 46:28.320
C U P E R N O N.

46:28.320 --> 46:30.320
Maybe something like that.

46:30.320 --> 46:33.320
It's a grape that has a really thick shell.

46:33.320 --> 46:34.320
So you like.

46:34.320 --> 46:36.320
You bite it.

46:36.320 --> 46:38.320
Take the flesh from the inside of it.

46:38.320 --> 46:44.320
And then spit out seeds and like throw away this.

46:44.320 --> 46:45.320
Like outside.

46:45.320 --> 46:47.320
Sounds like a peanut.

46:47.320 --> 46:48.320
Kind of.

46:48.320 --> 46:51.320
I mean, it's not crunchy.

46:51.320 --> 46:55.320
Like it's a, you know, like a soft.

46:55.320 --> 46:58.320
Rind of sorts.

46:58.320 --> 47:01.320
And then gets a southern thing.

47:01.320 --> 47:02.320
Other.

47:02.320 --> 47:03.320
Good.

I can't stress this another.

47:14.320 --> 47:16.320
She's the box in the mail.

47:16.320 --> 47:17.320
That was empty.

47:17.320 --> 47:22.320
And it looked like a card or jewelry box.

47:22.320 --> 47:23.320
And I opened it.

I've tried just about every supplement on the market and this is by far the most effective.

I fall asleep quickly and sleep deeper and longer.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.520
Thank you, Beam.

I'm a gym rat who just turned 50 and has sleep issues.

01:42.360 --> 01:46.960
I take this at 10 p.m. and I sleep from 11 to 6 a.m. and the best part is that I've wake up

01:46.960 --> 01:49.720
feeling refreshed and ready to hit the gym.

Wow.

Headgum, podcast or back at it again, I'm in such a good mood today.

02:59.400 --> 03:03.720
I mean, it would take so much to sour me so you guys can come out with everything that

03:03.720 --> 03:08.520
you have and it's still going to be fun to me because this show is a blast to do.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.520
Especially with this.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.520
Is that a tattoo?

03:10.520 --> 03:12.520
What do you have on your arm there?

03:12.520 --> 03:13.520
Is that a tattoo?

03:13.520 --> 03:14.520
Yeah, I got it.

03:14.520 --> 03:15.520
It's a lemon.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.520
Is that new?

03:17.520 --> 03:18.520
It's new.

03:18.680 --> 03:22.960
I asked for like a dancing bear, but they gave me a, they sold me a lemon.

03:22.960 --> 03:23.960
Nice.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.680
Wait, what, what is that?

03:25.680 --> 03:26.920
Why would you get that?

03:26.920 --> 03:29.400
It's such a prominent location, too.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.760
It's for my dead dog.

03:32.760 --> 03:33.760
Yeah.

03:33.760 --> 03:34.760
Um.

03:34.760 --> 03:40.080
Jesus, I'm, that's really cool.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.840
But that's your first, like, visible.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.840
How does it connect to your dead dog?

03:45.840 --> 03:51.560
So my dog, who's dead, um, you should never want to play with any toys, but, uh, if you

03:51.560 --> 03:55.200
would throw a lemon across the room, he would play fetch with me.

03:55.200 --> 03:58.560
So I kind of was missing him.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.560
Johnny, let's see your chest piece.

04:00.560 --> 04:01.560
Absolutely not.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.560
Not on the video.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.200
Why not?

04:05.200 --> 04:08.600
Because that's reserved for very special eyes.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.360
You have a tattoo on your chest.

04:10.360 --> 04:14.480
Yeah, it's an angel, a guardian angel, holy shit.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.400
And that's the only tattoo you have is his huge thing.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.400
I have another tattoo.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.400
It's smaller.

04:19.400 --> 04:20.400
It's, uh, it's a fidget spinner.

04:20.400 --> 04:21.400
It's a fidget spinner.

04:21.400 --> 04:22.400
No.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.400
All right.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.400
Well, I all explained it in a second.

04:25.400 --> 04:32.320
This is a sound of Johnny taking off.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.320
I mean, he's absolutely achieved lift up.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.800
Also, we should say that it's, it, we've zacked done on the show today.

04:37.800 --> 04:43.280
Uh, you're in the third time I talk before I talk before being introduced, I'm really sorry.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.680
But I'm really excited to be here.

04:44.680 --> 04:48.040
I feel I guess because I'm in the three time or school, but I feel so comfortable that

04:48.040 --> 04:52.120
I feel like I could just not even wait for stuff like that.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.640
And also, I was on that one episode where you called me.

04:55.640 --> 05:00.480
So I don't know if that, you know, we're going to have time or club maybe.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.560
If you want to call it the three and a half timers club, then yeah, welcome to the

05:03.560 --> 05:04.960
toilet deal.

05:04.960 --> 05:05.960
Thank you.

05:05.960 --> 05:11.360
We can't play copyright areas like anymore because we, um, we're doing these video

05:11.360 --> 05:12.360
episodes.

05:12.360 --> 05:15.080
I was going to say is that you should know that you're on video now on YouTube.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.080
Okay.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.080
Okay.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.840
That's the thing that you decided to wait to tell me until we started.

05:19.840 --> 05:20.840
That's good.

05:20.840 --> 05:21.840
I mean, I don't know.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.480
I don't think I'd like do anything weird visually.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.480
So it's fine.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.480
It's all like you got me.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.480
Well, you did.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.480
You didn't.

05:27.480 --> 05:28.480
You told me your hair back.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.480
You said.

05:29.480 --> 05:30.480
No, I said it.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.880
This is, this is, my hair is just, this is just normal.

05:33.880 --> 05:34.880
How it is.

05:34.880 --> 05:38.640
You look like insight put together Zach.

05:38.640 --> 05:42.720
So I could have been able to tell that you didn't know this was a video episode.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.720
Yeah.

05:43.720 --> 05:44.720
Thank you so much.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.720
You know, I guess I still want my friends to think I look nice.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.720
You know what I mean?

05:47.720 --> 05:52.760
Even the audiences and looking at me, I value you guys all European and Johnny were new

05:52.760 --> 05:56.360
friends, you know, but I still know that I don't get this cool chest tattoo like

05:56.360 --> 05:57.360
you're I want you.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.360
Look.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.360
Good.

05:59.360 --> 06:06.000
So already getting into some good stuff, but let's get our head in the game.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.640
Jesus Christ in the game.

06:09.640 --> 06:12.560
Amir, I haven't talked to you for like two weeks.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.840
And what a respite it's been.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.040
Yeah.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.040
Okay.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.040
Yep.

06:19.040 --> 06:25.680
You have, but I don't know, are you at going to ask me a question?

06:25.680 --> 06:26.680
We do text.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.880
We've spoken like over text over the last two weeks.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.560
I wasn't on last week's episode of That's what you mean.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.160
That's, I guess what I mean.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.160
Yeah.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.160
Anything new?

06:36.160 --> 06:38.600
I was in Florida last week.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.600
Yeah.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.320
You had a funny Instagram story where you were just kind of pointing out the, not even

06:43.320 --> 06:49.680
an idiot of synchrysis, just kind of detritus that comes with the state itself.

06:49.680 --> 06:50.680
The what?

06:50.680 --> 06:55.720
The detritus, the garbage, the, the things that should be disposed of in terms of culture

06:55.720 --> 06:56.720
and joy.

06:56.720 --> 06:57.720
Oh.

06:57.720 --> 07:00.160
I've never heard that word.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.160
Yeah.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.440
But Florida's different to be sure.

07:03.440 --> 07:11.680
That's nice to see how the other half live, you know, they, you know, they act like

07:11.680 --> 07:12.680
there's no pandemic.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.200
So it was nice to take a little COVID vacation of sorts.

07:16.200 --> 07:23.080
So you're walking around malls in indoor dining, outdoor dining, not a mask in sight.

07:23.080 --> 07:28.800
They really leave it up to the people to decide whether or not they're going to mask

07:29.120 --> 07:36.320
up and Florida is filled with people that have decided not to really California should

07:36.320 --> 07:38.320
be the one that leaves it up to their citizens.

07:38.320 --> 07:42.200
It's kind of ironic in that way, because we would probably mask up regardless, it should

07:42.200 --> 07:48.640
be stricter there and looser here, but I guess if you flip it around everybody would

07:48.640 --> 07:54.560
just move states, so like it's kind of like a game theory in that regard, like there's

07:54.560 --> 08:03.000
no way to achieve an ideal equilibrium, like people sort of gravitate towards like-minded

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
communities.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.120
So yeah, sorry, you were telling me to vamp, and then you told me to stop, stop, that's

08:10.120 --> 08:11.120
enough stop.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.920
So I guess I'm done.

08:12.920 --> 08:17.320
Well, hey, that was really interesting, Amir, thank you for sharing all that.

08:17.320 --> 08:21.480
Yeah, I mean, I have an amateur sociologist of sorts, so it's kind of cool to bring up

08:21.480 --> 08:27.480
these like kind of fun, interesting population-related hypotheticals, I guess.

08:27.480 --> 08:32.400
Anyone who travels as an amateur sociologist, then by your logic?

08:32.400 --> 08:34.400
Major Kielert.

08:34.400 --> 08:39.600
Oh, that was it.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.480
Anybody, yeah, anybody who travels as a amateur.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.760
So yeah, of course.

08:44.760 --> 08:47.960
Did you live as the Romans do in Florida?

08:48.040 --> 08:54.560
So you weren't wearing masks, I was outdoors, no mask indoors, like I went to a Walmart

08:54.560 --> 08:55.560
for the first time.

08:55.560 --> 09:01.240
I've never been near a Walmart, because there's not really any L.A. or New York, or at least

09:01.240 --> 09:03.400
not in places that I've ever been to.

09:03.400 --> 09:09.480
So it was fun to like go inside one of these classic American institutions, you know, Walmart

09:09.480 --> 09:13.440
and employees, almost two million Americans, and I've never been inside one, so it's

09:13.440 --> 09:17.560
cool to be like, oh, this is where you can buy chicken and an assault rifle, and there's

09:17.560 --> 09:20.760
also like shoes and toys.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.640
All in one magical place, it's kind of cool.

09:23.640 --> 09:24.640
Yeah.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.640
Did you buy all those things just to kind of have the full experience?

09:27.640 --> 09:32.240
Yeah, so I got a moths of all soup and a BB rifle.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.280
Checked out at the same place.

09:34.280 --> 09:45.960
I got Van looking to get somebody told me that Walmart has 150, 150,000 products versus

09:45.960 --> 09:47.960
like Costco, which has like 5,000.

09:47.960 --> 09:51.960
I don't say there's so many stats about Walmart.

09:51.960 --> 09:52.960
I'm telling you aren't it.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.960
I'm an amateur sociologist.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.960
It's not so spicy.

09:56.960 --> 09:57.960
I like this.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.960
You're a statistician.

09:59.960 --> 10:00.960
Is that what it is?

10:00.960 --> 10:01.960
Statistition.

10:01.960 --> 10:02.960
Yeah.

10:02.960 --> 10:03.960
Statistition.

10:03.960 --> 10:04.960
You guys been to Walmart?

10:04.960 --> 10:05.960
Of course.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.960
I live right by Walmart back at home.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.960
It is a classic there.

10:10.960 --> 10:14.960
No, Walmart is like the lesser version of Target.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.960
So we go to Target instead to do our groceries.

10:16.960 --> 10:21.960
Where we don't have to live in fear, turning every corner at a Walmart.

10:21.960 --> 10:22.960
Yeah.

10:22.960 --> 10:23.960
Yeah.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.960
Where do they like a New Jersey?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.960
There's a lot of eyes on you all the time.

10:29.960 --> 10:33.960
It feels like people are looking at you not to steal things at Walmart.

10:33.960 --> 10:34.960
That's what it's for.

10:34.960 --> 10:35.960
Yeah.

10:35.960 --> 10:39.960
Target is like a bed in breakfast, whereas Walmart is a hostel.

10:39.960 --> 10:40.960
From the movie.

10:40.960 --> 10:41.960
Yeah.

10:41.960 --> 10:42.960
Yeah.

10:42.960 --> 10:43.960
It's funny at Walmart.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.960
You feel like there's a Target on you.

10:45.960 --> 10:46.960
And at Target.

10:46.960 --> 10:47.960
I don't know.

10:47.960 --> 10:49.960
Maybe like a Walmart.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.960
Well, it doesn't work both ways, but like it was pretty interesting.

10:52.960 --> 10:53.960
It was still working.

10:53.960 --> 10:54.960
It's like crazy.

10:54.960 --> 10:55.960
Yeah.

10:55.960 --> 10:56.960
What's that?

10:56.960 --> 10:57.960
It's so close.

10:57.960 --> 10:58.960
I can't get good.

10:58.960 --> 10:59.960
Yeah.

10:59.960 --> 11:00.960
It is.

11:00.960 --> 11:01.960
I like the readers.

11:01.960 --> 11:02.960
The readers.

11:02.960 --> 11:03.960
Sorry.

11:03.960 --> 11:04.960
I'm trying to figure it out.

11:04.960 --> 11:05.960
I'm trying to figure it out.

11:05.960 --> 11:06.960
No.

11:06.960 --> 11:07.960
Yeah.

11:07.960 --> 11:08.960
Yeah.

11:08.960 --> 11:09.960
Use the radio thing.

11:09.960 --> 11:10.960
That's like an additive thing.

11:10.960 --> 11:11.960
Yeah.

11:12.960 --> 11:13.960
Yeah.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.960
It just feels like it's hard to guess.

11:15.960 --> 11:16.960
Sort of it.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.960
I feel like if anything, I should kind of get to speak.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.960
You're getting cut off, basically.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.960
I was trying to get off a mirror, but there's like a delay.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.960
Look, I'm going to, I just hit it right there.

11:25.960 --> 11:27.960
Game over.

11:27.960 --> 11:28.960
Because I got so flat.

11:28.960 --> 11:29.960
I was trying to puncture it.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.960
I was trying to add not to the fact.

11:31.960 --> 11:32.960
Yeah.

11:32.960 --> 11:33.960
Sorry that it didn't go the way.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.960
If you don't fall flat, you don't like repeat it all the time.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.960
Next time, I'll do that.

11:39.960 --> 11:40.960
That's good.

11:40.960 --> 11:41.960
Fast.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.960
I can see how fast that played after me.

11:43.960 --> 11:44.960
So that's good.

11:44.960 --> 11:45.960
I hope I don't get that.

11:45.960 --> 11:46.960
You know what I mean?

11:46.960 --> 11:47.960
Oh my god.

11:47.960 --> 11:48.960
That's like getting gone.

11:48.960 --> 11:49.960
Yeah.

11:49.960 --> 11:50.960
Yeah.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.960
Please, please don't get me that.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.960
But I was just going to say I like the readers at Walmart.

11:54.960 --> 11:58.960
And I think that is something that Target doesn't have.

11:58.960 --> 12:02.960
And that's just basically what I want to act.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.960
I'm so glad to be back on the podcast.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.960
I'm bringing so much to the table.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.960
It's just like electric, the kind of vibes I pray.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.960
And you welcome everybody.

12:13.960 --> 12:14.960
Well, we do.

12:14.960 --> 12:15.960
I want to get all your guys.

12:15.960 --> 12:16.960
It's thoughts on this.

12:16.960 --> 12:17.960
This is a weekly segment.

12:17.960 --> 12:18.960
We've been doing Zach.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.960
This is something new since the last time you were on.

12:20.960 --> 12:21.960
Great.

12:26.960 --> 12:27.960
Bond.

12:27.960 --> 12:28.960
Come on.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.960
James Bond of the week.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.960
So Daniel Craig is out.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.960
And we don't know who's in.

12:36.960 --> 12:37.960
And we don't know how long it's going to take.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.960
So every week until the next Bond is cast.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.960
We're lobbying up ideas for who we would love to see as James.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.960
Do you have a bond of the week?

12:46.960 --> 12:47.960
Yeah.

12:47.960 --> 12:49.960
That's a really good question.

12:49.960 --> 12:50.960
Yeah.

12:50.960 --> 12:51.960
I wasn't prepared.

12:51.960 --> 12:52.960
I was at all for this, you know.

12:52.960 --> 12:55.960
But I have improv training as you know.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.960
So it's easy for me to come up with an actor who I think would be good.

12:59.960 --> 13:00.960
Yeah.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.960
We've settled the fact that he doesn't have to be from the UK.

13:03.960 --> 13:05.960
That's really good.

13:05.960 --> 13:06.960
Yeah.

13:06.960 --> 13:07.960
That really helps.

13:07.960 --> 13:14.960
I think you should go with someone's funny like maybe Mike Myers because he's kind of done

13:14.960 --> 13:17.960
Austin Powers, which is so close.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.960
And then I think you get him doing Bond.

13:20.960 --> 13:23.960
And it's like he's he's wearing old pair of shoes.

13:23.960 --> 13:24.960
You know what I mean?

13:24.960 --> 13:27.960
And he can be funny if we want or he would be really serious.

13:27.960 --> 13:28.960
If we want.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.960
Because maybe the character from Austin Powers could be in the movie too.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.960
That's a little bit of a reductive way of viewing it.

13:34.960 --> 13:39.960
But I think it would have Austin Powers type energy combined with that James Bond type

13:39.960 --> 13:43.960
Swagger in a way that would be box office Benanza.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.960
That's cool.

13:45.960 --> 13:46.960
Yeah.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.960
And I'd write the dance.

13:48.960 --> 13:53.960
I think it would have Austin Powers type energy combined with that James Bond type Swagger

13:53.960 --> 13:56.960
in a way that would be box office Benanza.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.960
That's cool.

13:58.960 --> 13:59.960
Yeah.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.960
And I'd write the dance thing if they'd love me.

14:02.960 --> 14:03.960
I think it'd be fun.

14:03.960 --> 14:04.960
I don't know.

14:04.960 --> 14:05.960
That's a part of the game.

14:05.960 --> 14:06.960
But I'd love to crack it that.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.960
I need the money for something like that.

14:08.960 --> 14:09.960
Oh my god.

14:09.960 --> 14:10.960
Yeah.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.960
Even if it's going to be using your script.

14:12.960 --> 14:13.960
Yeah.

14:13.960 --> 14:14.960
You finish this by the way.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.960
So it is your idea and your IP.

14:16.960 --> 14:19.960
But you're not even excited about it to write it more the idea.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.960
You were excited about the paycheck.

14:22.960 --> 14:23.960
No.

14:23.960 --> 14:24.960
I mean, I'm obviously excited about the idea.

14:24.960 --> 14:25.960
I came up with the idea.

14:25.960 --> 14:26.960
I'm just mentioning the paycheck.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.960
I'm not one of these guys who's like.

14:28.960 --> 14:32.960
Not going to touch my James Bond starring Mike Myers buddy.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.960
Like money matters.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.960
I live in a capitalist world.

14:36.960 --> 14:37.960
I can't ignore that.

14:37.960 --> 14:38.960
So.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.960
You guys can only say what he doesn't have it.

14:41.960 --> 14:42.960
Yeah.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.960
I love cash too.

14:44.960 --> 14:45.960
Yeah.

14:45.960 --> 14:48.960
I'd love to like have it some writing credits on that as well.

14:48.960 --> 14:49.960
You okay.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.960
You want multiple.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.960
What would you do?

14:53.960 --> 14:54.960
Johnny.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.960
I'm going to give you a ghost story.

14:56.960 --> 14:57.960
I was me.

14:57.960 --> 14:58.960
Well.

14:58.960 --> 14:59.960
Co-scree.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.960
Ghost play.

15:01.960 --> 15:02.960
Thank you.

15:02.960 --> 15:03.960
Actually, the WGA just.

15:03.960 --> 15:08.960
There's a new rule where you can get additional writing material credit on a live action

15:08.960 --> 15:09.960
features.

15:09.960 --> 15:10.960
So I'm going to give that to a mirror.

15:10.960 --> 15:14.960
So what is that until additional writing credit?

15:14.960 --> 15:18.960
You know, it's basically just like people who did a pass on a movie or worked on it.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.960
You used to not get any credit for that.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.960
That's the thing that the Gilm's voted on and lobbied for.

15:23.960 --> 15:27.960
For people like you and me are who brought a lot to the idea.

15:27.960 --> 15:28.960
It's a fun movie.

15:28.960 --> 15:32.960
But like I feel like he brought it as much as I did.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.960
And that's next to nothing.

15:34.960 --> 15:35.960
Yeah.

15:35.960 --> 15:36.960
No.

15:36.960 --> 15:37.960
No.

15:37.960 --> 15:38.960
You'll be in the next two, Jeffrey.

15:38.960 --> 15:39.960
Don't worry.

15:39.960 --> 15:40.960
You were not going to have to say it.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.960
He weren't even going to have the idea that I introduced the segment.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.960
And then you said, I've been prop training.

15:45.960 --> 15:46.960
I can come up with something.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.960
Now you're suddenly like striking gold theoretically.

15:49.960 --> 15:52.960
You can't even tell me how an idea happens.

15:52.960 --> 15:54.960
It's just about the idea.

15:54.960 --> 15:55.960
You know, it's not.

15:55.960 --> 15:56.960
I'm not going to.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.960
I'm going to do a key said she said for like what got.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.960
Oh, my parents give birth to me.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.960
They deserve partial credit.

16:02.960 --> 16:03.960
You know what?

16:03.960 --> 16:04.960
I wouldn't give them partial credit.

16:04.960 --> 16:05.960
You give them credit for that.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.960
You brought up the next answer.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.960
They could code direct.

16:09.960 --> 16:10.960
Have they ever directed?

16:10.960 --> 16:18.960
I'm my dad's been in kind of managerial positions in his life.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.960
So he could be sort of a directing directing.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.960
Directing is the easiest part, right?

16:22.960 --> 16:24.960
Because you're just sort of like, you're in the middle.

16:24.960 --> 16:25.960
Everyone sort of telling you what to do.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.960
The DP's like, I want the frame to look like this.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.960
And the actor's like, I know it words to read and where to stand.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.960
And then the director's like, all right.

16:32.960 --> 16:33.960
Action.

16:33.960 --> 16:34.960
You can almost get it.

16:34.960 --> 16:35.960
Totally.

16:35.960 --> 16:36.960
Totally.

16:36.960 --> 16:37.960
Not really.

16:37.960 --> 16:38.960
They're at the helm of the entire ship.

16:38.960 --> 16:39.960
They're the captain.

16:39.960 --> 16:40.960
You can almost get like an MP3 player.

16:40.960 --> 16:46.960
That's his action every 42 minutes and get like 70% of what a director does.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.960
Yeah, how do we add and maybe we get so it's press for doing that.

16:50.960 --> 16:51.960
Pretty easy.

16:51.960 --> 16:52.960
MP3 player.

16:52.960 --> 16:53.960
Yeah.

16:53.960 --> 16:54.960
Yeah.

16:54.960 --> 16:55.960
MP3 by the way.

16:55.960 --> 16:56.960
Not a file.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.960
I was kneeling back for my James Bond movies.

16:58.960 --> 16:59.960
That's really funny.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.960
That'd be really funny.

17:01.960 --> 17:02.960
So who gets the directing credit?

17:02.960 --> 17:07.960
A mirror for the idea or an actual iPod Nano.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.960
I think it would be like director.

17:11.960 --> 17:12.960
MP3.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.960
That's cool.

17:14.960 --> 17:15.960
Yeah.

17:16.960 --> 17:17.960
Yeah.

17:19.960 --> 17:24.960
So this title looks directed by director dot MP3.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.960
Or is it just a title card that says director MP3?

17:27.960 --> 17:29.960
No, the first thing you said.

17:29.960 --> 17:30.960
Okay.

17:30.960 --> 17:31.960
Are you crazy?

17:31.960 --> 17:32.960
Yeah.

17:32.960 --> 17:33.960
It was cool.

17:33.960 --> 17:34.960
It's cool.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.960
It wouldn't say just director MP3.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.960
That doesn't mean anything.

17:40.960 --> 17:41.960
Yeah.

17:41.960 --> 17:42.960
Yes, right.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.960
It doesn't mean anything.

17:44.960 --> 17:48.960
It's just saying like it would he say just like Steve Spielberg at the middle of a movie.

17:48.960 --> 17:52.960
It would be like directed by Steven Spielberg.

17:52.960 --> 17:53.960
That's the credit.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.960
Yeah, but Steven Spielberg's a human director.

17:55.960 --> 17:59.960
You're talking about a you said it was a file, which a movie's just a file.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.960
So it's like is the file attached to the movie?

18:02.960 --> 18:03.960
Oh, that's not about idea.

18:03.960 --> 18:07.960
If we can zip the two files that way.

18:07.960 --> 18:11.960
People can just sort of uncompress it at their own leisure.

18:11.960 --> 18:12.960
Oh, yes.

18:12.960 --> 18:13.960
The two files will be the DCP.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.960
It would be the digital cinema package that has the movie.

18:16.960 --> 18:22.960
And then it would be just the audio waveform of someone saying action every 42 minutes.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.960
And you're going to watch that back to back.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.960
Is that the way you're doing this?

18:28.960 --> 18:29.960
Yeah.

18:29.960 --> 18:31.960
That's two different things.

18:31.960 --> 18:32.960
Yeah.

18:32.960 --> 18:33.960
Waves and MP3s.

18:33.960 --> 18:35.960
You should probably like brush.

18:35.960 --> 18:36.960
What?

18:36.960 --> 18:39.960
Aren't you actually a podcast?

18:39.960 --> 18:40.960
Yes.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.960
That you should know the difference between a wave.

18:43.960 --> 18:44.960
Yeah.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.960
MP3s have waveforms.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.960
It's just not dot wave.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.960
You're going to get this.

18:50.960 --> 18:51.960
Okay.

18:51.960 --> 18:52.960
It's good.

18:52.960 --> 18:53.960
Nice.

18:53.960 --> 18:54.960
So before.

18:54.960 --> 18:55.960
I'm a nerd.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.960
Like, I thought you're going to talk about nerd shit.

18:57.960 --> 18:58.960
I don't know what.

18:58.960 --> 18:59.960
Like, yeah.

18:59.960 --> 19:00.960
That's crazy.

19:00.960 --> 19:01.960
I'm talking about.

19:01.960 --> 19:02.960
Just bond.

19:02.960 --> 19:03.960
Yeah.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.960
We're talking about a high budget.

19:05.960 --> 19:06.960
Yeah.

19:06.960 --> 19:07.960
Yeah.

19:07.960 --> 19:08.960
Yeah.

19:08.960 --> 19:09.960
Yeah.

19:09.960 --> 19:10.960
Yeah.

19:10.960 --> 19:11.960
Yeah.

19:11.960 --> 19:12.960
Yeah.

19:12.960 --> 19:13.960
Yeah.

19:13.960 --> 19:14.960
Yeah.

19:14.960 --> 19:15.960
Yeah.

19:15.960 --> 19:16.960
Yeah.

19:16.960 --> 19:17.960
Yeah.

19:17.960 --> 19:18.960
Yeah.

19:18.960 --> 19:19.960
Yeah.

19:19.960 --> 19:20.960
Yeah.

19:20.960 --> 19:21.960
Yeah.

19:21.960 --> 19:22.960
Yeah.

19:22.960 --> 19:23.960
Yeah.

19:23.960 --> 19:24.960
Yeah.

19:24.960 --> 19:25.960
Yeah.

19:25.960 --> 19:26.960
Yeah.

19:26.960 --> 19:27.960
Yeah.

19:27.960 --> 19:28.960
Yeah.

19:28.960 --> 19:29.960
Yeah.

19:29.960 --> 19:30.960
Yeah.

19:30.960 --> 19:31.960
Yeah.

19:31.960 --> 19:32.960
Yeah.

19:32.960 --> 19:33.960
Yeah.

19:33.960 --> 19:34.960
Yeah.

19:34.960 --> 19:35.960
Exactly.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.960
But you're saying all these things for sure about how the movies can be like, yeah.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.960
I actually think Ray finds is going to be in the movie.

19:39.960 --> 19:43.960
And he is going to be playing Dr. Evil.

19:43.960 --> 19:44.960
Sorry.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.960
So he's not even going to be playing a character.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.960
He has played in the franchise.

19:48.960 --> 19:51.960
He's going to play Dr. Evil from Austin Powers in James Bond.

19:51.960 --> 19:53.960
Think about it this way.

19:53.960 --> 19:54.960
Of course.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.960
Two of the most evil characters ever.

19:57.960 --> 19:58.960
Dr. Evil.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.960
To know a way that's number one for LVU.

20:00.960 --> 20:01.960
Two.

20:01.960 --> 20:02.960
Two.

20:02.960 --> 20:03.960
Okay.

20:03.960 --> 20:04.960
Who played Voldemort?

20:04.960 --> 20:05.960
Ray finds.

20:05.960 --> 20:06.960
Ray finds.

20:06.960 --> 20:07.960
Wow.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.960
You're accessing that kind of evil power for him.

20:09.960 --> 20:10.960
Yeah.

20:10.960 --> 20:11.960
But Dr. Evil.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.960
In fact, at the end of the movie, it's revealed that Dr. Evil has been Voldemort the whole

20:14.960 --> 20:15.960
talk.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.960
So Voldemort's also in this James Bond movie.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.960
I wonder if that's public domain by now.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.960
We can sort of miss Mixie Machie sort of.

20:21.960 --> 20:23.960
Because it's 99, right?

20:23.960 --> 20:24.960
I think it is.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.960
And because of how mad everyone is at JK Rowling.

20:27.960 --> 20:28.960
Exactly.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.960
Like who's going to hear that trial in court?

20:30.960 --> 20:31.960
You know what?

20:31.960 --> 20:32.960
You're going to win.

20:32.960 --> 20:33.960
She's trans.

20:33.960 --> 20:34.960
I'm going to win.

20:34.960 --> 20:35.960
Yeah.

20:35.960 --> 20:36.960
Yeah.

20:36.960 --> 20:37.960
I'm awesome.

20:37.960 --> 20:38.960
Like progressive.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.960
Like no one would do that to me.

20:40.960 --> 20:41.960
Yeah.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.960
I'm awesome in life progressive.

20:44.960 --> 20:45.960
Where is the lie?

20:45.960 --> 20:47.960
We do have to take a quick break.

20:47.960 --> 20:59.960
And then we'll come back with another segment or something.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.960

I have used Hello, Fresh.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.960
I've also used other meal kit delivery systems, subscriptions.

21:39.960 --> 21:42.960
It is by far the tastiest, by far the easiest.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.960
A lot of other ones say that you can make their things in less than 30 minutes.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.960
Not necessarily true with Hello, Fresh.

21:47.960 --> 21:48.960

22:10.960 --> 22:11.960
What's that?

22:11.960 --> 22:14.960
Guys, life is full of stressors, right?

22:14.960 --> 22:18.960
It doesn't matter who you are or what you do or what you have.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.960
Your life's probably stressful.

22:20.960 --> 22:24.960
And you may not be feeling totally down and out and depressed or like you're at a total loss.

22:24.960 --> 22:28.960
But if your stress is high, your temporary short of unusual or even if you're starting to feel strain

22:28.960 --> 22:31.960
in any of your relationships, you could probably use a chance to unload.

22:31.960 --> 22:35.960
So unload the stress and get it out by talking to somebody who's completely unbiased about

22:35.960 --> 22:36.960
your life.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.960
Someone who's not going to judge you or take sides on anything.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.960
Especially when there's things that you feel like you can't tell anyone in your life,

22:41.960 --> 22:44.960
or you feel like you can't unload to family and friends, but you need to unload it.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.960
That's what therapy can be.

22:46.960 --> 22:51.960

23:01.960 --> 23:04.960
You know, we're seeing family, things come up.

23:04.960 --> 23:07.960

And we're back.

23:29.960 --> 23:30.960
We're absolutely back.

23:30.960 --> 23:38.960
Monday afternoon for all of us trying to come back from getting so angry because I was really starting to grip my teeth there for a second.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.960
But I think we should move on.

23:40.960 --> 23:43.960
Let's just say great idea even though I don't feel that way.

23:43.960 --> 23:44.960
Let's just say great idea.

23:44.960 --> 23:45.960
I'll take it.

23:45.960 --> 23:47.960
I'll take any praise even if it's false.

23:47.960 --> 23:48.960
I'll take it.

23:48.960 --> 23:49.960
Okay.

23:49.960 --> 23:55.960
I wrote this segment in mind because I knew that Zach was coming on the show with that in mind, I should say.

23:55.960 --> 23:57.960
And Zach, you're right, or for what we do in the shadows.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.960
I mean, nominated show.

23:59.960 --> 24:02.960
You're kind of a mid-level writer now, right?

24:02.960 --> 24:09.960
Yeah, I mean, is that really interesting to like your listenership, the like specifics of my title on this show?

24:09.960 --> 24:10.960
Story editor.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.960
Executive story editor.

24:12.960 --> 24:18.960
Do you really, I get, yeah, I guess that was an exact story editor of the most recent season of this show.

24:18.960 --> 24:19.960
Cool.

24:19.960 --> 24:20.960
Cool.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.960
I mean, well, I wrote no so that means it really cares about it.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.960
And basically means that you're making a little bit more money.

24:26.960 --> 24:27.960
Yes.

24:27.960 --> 24:28.960
Yes.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.960
Well, as I've stated, money is important to me.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.960
So that is, that is huge for me.

24:33.960 --> 24:37.960
I think that anybody who writes wants to get better.

24:37.960 --> 24:43.960
And the only way to do that is to show you writing to other people and get feedback.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.960
Okay.

24:46.960 --> 24:50.960
So I wrote a couple scenes.

24:50.960 --> 24:55.960
This was just like, sometimes you just need to like, journal, sometimes you need to dream journal,

24:55.960 --> 25:00.960
sometimes you just need to get dialogue out that stuck in your head and then figure out what it's for later on.

25:00.960 --> 25:05.960
So I was wondering if we could kind of, in fact, we could do a little table read of a couple scenes that I wrote.

25:05.960 --> 25:15.960
And then Zach, I could get your opinions on it, your notes, but also pull the room to see what kind of show or movie that these scenes could go into.

25:15.960 --> 25:18.960
Does that make sense?

25:18.960 --> 25:22.960
I mean, not really, but I think I understand what's going to happen.

25:22.960 --> 25:23.960
You know, great.

25:23.960 --> 25:24.960
That's all we need.

25:24.960 --> 25:27.960
I think it makes sense, but I understand it.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.960
This is the first scene.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.960
Let's get Johnny.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.960
Why don't you be Johnny?

25:33.960 --> 25:40.960
And a mere, you'll be untitled character.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.960
That's never happened.

25:44.960 --> 25:57.960
There's no, there's never such, there's like, give me like my occupation or like worker or guy, but I've never seen untitled character.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.960
Zach, you work in television.

25:59.960 --> 26:00.960
Is that yeah.

26:00.960 --> 26:01.960
Press it out.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.960
That would be a big, big, no, no.

26:03.960 --> 26:04.960
Intelligent.

26:04.960 --> 26:06.960
It would just be confusing.

26:06.960 --> 26:07.960
Yeah.

26:07.960 --> 26:10.960
And I'm just saying, Jeffrey, you're not up to a good start.

26:10.960 --> 26:11.960
That's fine.

26:11.960 --> 26:16.960
And maybe all I need for that, that's a quick fix is just, okay, let's name him like Tyler or something.

26:16.960 --> 26:18.960
But let's just, let's read it and we'll get into it.

26:18.960 --> 26:23.960
I actually think that the name that I ended up putting in, it is a placeholder will make sense after we read the scene.

26:23.960 --> 26:24.960
So, I'm here.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.960
Your untitled character, Johnny, your Donnie.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.960
Let's, and then Zach, you can go action or whatever you want to do.

26:29.960 --> 26:30.960
All right.

26:30.960 --> 26:31.960
Sounds good.

26:31.960 --> 26:33.960
We can bring in that MP3 file.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.960
Oh, that's funny.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.960
I want to read that movie right now.

26:39.960 --> 26:40.960
I don't need to.

26:40.960 --> 26:41.960
Yeah, different segments.

26:41.960 --> 26:42.960
Yeah.

26:42.960 --> 26:43.960
Yeah, but this is going to be boring.

26:43.960 --> 26:44.960
All right.

26:44.960 --> 26:45.960
Yeah.

26:45.960 --> 26:46.960
Here's some.

26:46.960 --> 26:47.960
Okay.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.960
And action.

26:49.960 --> 26:52.960
The vaccine doesn't make your blood boil.

26:52.960 --> 26:53.960
It's not what I said.

26:53.960 --> 26:57.960
I said the fact that we have to even take the vaccine makes my blood boil.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.960
So your anti-vax?

26:59.960 --> 27:01.960
I'm not anti, sorry.

27:01.960 --> 27:02.960
I'm anti-COVID.

27:02.960 --> 27:03.960
This shit sucks.

27:03.960 --> 27:04.960
Sorry.

27:04.960 --> 27:05.960
Can we start over?

27:05.960 --> 27:06.960
It's just like, yeah.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.960
Because it is so much about rhythm and flow.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.960
Because it is, this one's supposed to be comedy.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.960
So let's do it again.

27:12.960 --> 27:16.960
This is just for a table read, but yeah.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.960
I thought I was the director.

27:18.960 --> 27:19.960
Also, I'm sorry.

27:19.960 --> 27:22.960
I'm just talking to the one who's like sort of calling cut.

27:22.960 --> 27:23.960
Yeah.

27:23.960 --> 27:24.960
Giving actors notes.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.960
Run the room as you want.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.960
But like, if I hear anything, even the little listening

27:28.960 --> 27:30.960
that buns be on my left to stop the old thing.

27:30.960 --> 27:31.960
Okay.

27:31.960 --> 27:32.960
Seeding it to you.

27:32.960 --> 27:33.960
All right.

27:33.960 --> 27:34.960
Here's Donnie.

27:35.960 --> 27:36.960
That's good.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.960
Can we get that in the street?

27:38.960 --> 27:42.960
We can add it, but just like, it was my idea, then.

27:42.960 --> 27:43.960
Not really.

27:43.960 --> 27:44.960
I said, you guys don't.

27:44.960 --> 27:45.960
And here we go.

27:45.960 --> 27:46.960
I'll give an action.

27:46.960 --> 27:47.960
Okay.

27:47.960 --> 27:48.960
All right.

27:48.960 --> 27:49.960
Okay.

27:49.960 --> 27:50.960
Action.

27:54.960 --> 27:55.960
Here's Donnie.

27:55.960 --> 27:57.960
The vaccine doesn't make your blood boil.

27:57.960 --> 27:58.960
That's not what I said.

27:58.960 --> 28:01.960
I said the fact that we have to even take the vaccine

28:01.960 --> 28:02.960
makes my blood boil.

28:03.960 --> 28:05.960
So you're anti-vax?

28:05.960 --> 28:06.960
I'm anti-COVID.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.960
This shit sucks.

28:08.960 --> 28:09.960
Right.

28:09.960 --> 28:12.960
But I can't seem to nail down your actual opinion.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.960
Do you hate the virus because it's killed millions?

28:15.960 --> 28:16.960
Yes.

28:16.960 --> 28:17.960
Obviously.

28:17.960 --> 28:18.960
Okay.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.960
But you also hate the vaccines.

28:20.960 --> 28:21.960
I hate.

28:21.960 --> 28:24.960
You're really not getting it.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.960
I hate the virus, obviously.

28:27.960 --> 28:31.960
And I hate the fact that we have to even take the vaccines.

28:32.960 --> 28:33.960
Okay.

28:33.960 --> 28:34.960
Got it.

28:34.960 --> 28:35.960
So you're pro-vax.

28:35.960 --> 28:36.960
It's just a hassle to you.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.960
I never said that.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.960
You're not pro-vax?

28:40.960 --> 28:41.960
No.

28:41.960 --> 28:42.960
I took the vaccine.

28:42.960 --> 28:43.960
I'm saying.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.960
Lower your voice, please.

28:45.960 --> 28:46.960
Sorry.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.960
Lower your voice.

28:48.960 --> 28:49.960
Yeah.

28:49.960 --> 28:50.960
I'm sorry.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.960
It's fine.

28:52.960 --> 28:53.960
Just.

28:53.960 --> 28:54.960
Yeah.

28:54.960 --> 29:00.960
I'm saying I didn't say that exact sentence that you just said is all.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.960
This isn't how conversations were.

29:03.960 --> 29:04.960
And what do we have to say?

29:04.960 --> 29:06.960
That's the end of the scene.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.960
Check the gate.

29:09.960 --> 29:10.960
So, okay.

29:10.960 --> 29:11.960
Wow.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.960
First of all, I just want to say great job to about the actors.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.960
You brought a lot to the performance.

29:15.960 --> 29:16.960
Maybe.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.960
And the situation we're not allowed much was on the page.

29:18.960 --> 29:19.960
Thank you.

29:19.960 --> 29:20.960
Yeah.

29:20.960 --> 29:21.960
And I would have made them longer.

29:21.960 --> 29:22.960
But I didn't, you know.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.960
Or just ideas.

29:24.960 --> 29:25.960
Yeah.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.960
I don't mean like not that much quality-wise.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.960
I mean more quality-wise.

29:29.960 --> 29:32.960
I would say in terms of the script.

29:32.960 --> 29:35.960
I think it's, it's interesting.

29:35.960 --> 29:37.960
It's definitely eye-catching.

29:37.960 --> 29:38.960
And great.

29:38.960 --> 29:41.960
And sort of gets you, and gets you thinking a little bit.

29:41.960 --> 29:42.960
It's a little confusing.

29:42.960 --> 29:45.960
Which I think is really the thing you don't want in the script.

29:45.960 --> 29:47.960
Whenever I'm writing my scripts,

29:47.960 --> 29:50.960
I really want to be clear what's going on in it.

29:50.960 --> 29:54.960
And this is not really hitting me on that dog.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.960
I'm kind of like ready, Jackson.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.960
On the American Idol with my judging.

29:58.960 --> 29:59.960
You're being like Simon Cowell.

29:59.960 --> 30:00.960
But yeah.

30:00.960 --> 30:01.960
Yeah.

30:01.960 --> 30:02.960
But he said dog.

30:02.960 --> 30:03.960
He said dog.

30:03.960 --> 30:04.960
He said dog.

30:04.960 --> 30:05.960
He said dog.

30:05.960 --> 30:06.960
Yeah.

30:06.960 --> 30:07.960
Simon Cowell would never say anything like that.

30:07.960 --> 30:08.960
So you're kind of being stupid.

30:08.960 --> 30:09.960
Yeah.

30:09.960 --> 30:10.960
The opinion of it though.

30:10.960 --> 30:11.960
It's always Simon.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.960
Just like, let's echo.

30:13.960 --> 30:14.960
Yeah.

30:14.960 --> 30:17.960
So basically, all this to say, dog.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.960
This is not very simple.

30:20.960 --> 30:23.960
And, you know, but keep at it.

30:23.960 --> 30:26.960
And I'm curious to see what other writing you'll do.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.960
Maybe hone in on making a list confusing.

30:28.960 --> 30:29.960
Okay.

30:29.960 --> 30:30.960
So be clear.

30:30.960 --> 30:31.960
That's a good note.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.960
I thought this was, but, you know,

30:34.960 --> 30:39.960
you think it's clear when the character's name is untitled character.

30:39.960 --> 30:43.960
Even a name can put like some sort of backstory to a character.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.960
That would help them mirror a lot for sure.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.960
Or just whoever's going to act in this.

30:47.960 --> 30:48.960
Yeah.

30:48.960 --> 30:51.960
I mean, I could also say a bunch of stuff about the performances.

30:51.960 --> 30:53.960
Like the cadence of it, the rhythm.

30:53.960 --> 30:54.960
It was all off.

30:54.960 --> 30:55.960
And the scene.

30:55.960 --> 30:56.960
So like, I'm trying to like hold that.

30:56.960 --> 30:57.960
Right.

30:57.960 --> 30:58.960
You weren't directing the scene.

30:58.960 --> 30:59.960
Where are you?

30:59.960 --> 31:04.960
Now, another thing is that you said before the scene that it would become clear why the character was not named.

31:04.960 --> 31:05.960
And I'm having great idea.

31:05.960 --> 31:06.960
It's not clear to me.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.960
Why that is.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.960
It's not clear at the end.

31:10.960 --> 31:11.960
Yeah.

31:11.960 --> 31:12.960
Yeah.

31:12.960 --> 31:13.960
No, because it's untitled character.

31:13.960 --> 31:19.960
Because like, Donnie can't understand untitled character's stance.

31:19.960 --> 31:20.960
You wrote another scene.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.960
You just sent us another scene.

31:22.960 --> 31:23.960
Oh, good.

31:23.960 --> 31:24.960
Yeah.

31:24.960 --> 31:25.960
We have more.

31:25.960 --> 31:26.960
It was called SC1.

31:26.960 --> 31:27.960
I was scared.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.960
There was going to be more.

31:29.960 --> 31:30.960
And this.

31:30.960 --> 31:31.960
I mean, you guys didn't like that one.

31:31.960 --> 31:32.960
That's fine.

31:32.960 --> 31:33.960
Let's just move on to the next one.

31:33.960 --> 31:34.960
Okay.

31:34.960 --> 31:35.960
This one.

31:35.960 --> 31:36.960
Amir.

31:36.960 --> 31:38.960
Why don't you be any power?

31:38.960 --> 31:42.960
And Johnny, why don't you be phase on?

31:42.960 --> 31:43.960
Phase on.

31:43.960 --> 31:44.960
Okay.

31:44.960 --> 31:45.960
These are good names.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.960
The same way I was negative right at the top.

31:47.960 --> 31:48.960
The last one.

31:48.960 --> 31:49.960
I'm going to be positive.

31:49.960 --> 31:50.960
These are good names.

31:50.960 --> 31:51.960
That's like half the battle.

31:51.960 --> 31:52.960
Okay.

31:52.960 --> 31:55.960
I'm already feeling more confident about that one.

31:55.960 --> 31:57.960
Are we allowed to improper?

31:57.960 --> 31:58.960
Let's do one pass without.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.960
And then that'll be the only pass we do.

32:00.960 --> 32:01.960
Okay.

32:01.960 --> 32:02.960
Cool.

32:02.960 --> 32:03.960
All right.

32:03.960 --> 32:04.960
And places.

32:04.960 --> 32:05.960
And action.

32:05.960 --> 32:07.960
Should we move houses?

32:07.960 --> 32:10.960
Phase on.

32:10.960 --> 32:13.960
The last thing I said to you was that.

32:13.960 --> 32:15.960
The last thing I said.

32:15.960 --> 32:16.960
Sorry.

32:16.960 --> 32:25.960
Let's take it from the top.

32:25.960 --> 32:27.960
I'm feeling as if I did.

32:27.960 --> 32:28.960
You're straight.

32:28.960 --> 32:31.960
And this is like, I'm trying not to get angry at everybody because I'm just so insecure.

32:31.960 --> 32:32.960
But wait.

32:32.960 --> 32:33.960
Yeah.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.960
That's an instant sack where you could call cut and then go from the top.

32:36.960 --> 32:37.960
Like you're having your actors.

32:37.960 --> 32:38.960
I'm trying to use everything.

32:38.960 --> 32:40.960
That's how that's my school of directors.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.960
You're just like some of the greatest SLL skits ever had a lot of breaking.

32:44.960 --> 32:45.960
You know.

32:45.960 --> 32:48.960
So that's a lot of serious about them.

32:48.960 --> 32:49.960
Okay.

32:49.960 --> 32:50.960
Okay.

32:50.960 --> 32:51.960
Okay.

32:51.960 --> 32:52.960
We figured out that your scripts.

32:52.960 --> 32:53.960
We don't know what they're for.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.960
So they could be for some sort of live special.

32:55.960 --> 32:56.960
We also didn't.

32:56.960 --> 32:57.960
On the first scene.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.960
We didn't say what that could be a part of.

32:59.960 --> 33:03.960
I think it could be a part of like a CDCPSA.

33:03.960 --> 33:04.960
No way.

33:04.960 --> 33:05.960
Yeah.

33:05.960 --> 33:06.960
No.

33:06.960 --> 33:07.960
Absolutely.

33:07.960 --> 33:08.960
I can't read there.

33:08.960 --> 33:09.960
Can't be using messaging.

33:09.960 --> 33:10.960
Yeah.

33:10.960 --> 33:11.960
All right.

33:11.960 --> 33:12.960
Let's get back to scene two.

33:13.960 --> 33:17.960
Ready actors and action.

33:17.960 --> 33:20.960
Should we move houses?

33:20.960 --> 33:25.960
Based on the last thing I said to you was that I cheated on you with your boss.

33:25.960 --> 33:26.960
It could.

33:26.960 --> 33:27.960
It just could be huge.

33:27.960 --> 33:28.960
Moving and all.

33:28.960 --> 33:30.960
And that nothing phased on.

33:30.960 --> 33:31.960
Really.

33:31.960 --> 33:35.960
It's just he's so much richer and buffer than you are.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.960
We could move to a place with a gym in the building.

33:38.960 --> 33:39.960
Yeah.

33:39.960 --> 33:40.960
Good call.

33:40.960 --> 33:41.960
Are you hearing me?

33:41.960 --> 33:42.960
He phased on.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.960
You don't seem heard at all.

33:44.960 --> 33:45.960
No.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.960
I don't get me wrong.

33:47.960 --> 33:48.960
I'm devastated.

33:48.960 --> 33:56.960
But I just can't stop thinking about a duplex.

33:56.960 --> 33:57.960
And.

33:57.960 --> 33:58.960
Cut.

33:58.960 --> 33:59.960
Did.

33:59.960 --> 34:00.960
There's so much more to the scene.

34:00.960 --> 34:01.960
Yes.

34:01.960 --> 34:02.960
Did I.

34:02.960 --> 34:03.960
Did my.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.960
I just wanted to give a note.

34:05.960 --> 34:06.960
Okay.

34:06.960 --> 34:07.960
We'll pick it up.

34:07.960 --> 34:08.960
You guys are doing great.

34:08.960 --> 34:09.960
Okay.

34:10.960 --> 34:11.960
And just sort of keep up.

34:11.960 --> 34:13.960
Keep it up and have keep having fun with it.

34:13.960 --> 34:14.960
All right.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.960
So that's keep it up from where we cut and everybody ready.

34:17.960 --> 34:18.960
Yeah.

34:18.960 --> 34:19.960
Yeah.

34:19.960 --> 34:20.960
Yeah.

34:20.960 --> 34:21.960
And action.

34:21.960 --> 34:22.960
Okay.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.960
Do you have anything you want to express phase on?

34:25.960 --> 34:26.960
Honestly.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.960
And I know this is going to be hard to hear.

34:28.960 --> 34:29.960
But.

34:29.960 --> 34:34.960
I truly think we need a place with a two car garage.

34:34.960 --> 34:35.960
Faith.

34:36.960 --> 34:37.960
I fucked your boss.

34:37.960 --> 34:39.960
I fucked him like twice.

34:39.960 --> 34:42.960
I mean, because we're going to probably have to get.

34:42.960 --> 34:45.960
We're probably going to have to get an EV in a few years.

34:45.960 --> 34:48.960
And it'd be nice to be able to charge it in the.

34:48.960 --> 34:49.960
Oh, yeah.

34:49.960 --> 34:50.960
The garage.

34:50.960 --> 34:54.960
Honestly, phase on.

34:54.960 --> 34:58.960
This is part of why I think I felt compelled to cheat.

34:58.960 --> 34:59.960
You never listen.

34:59.960 --> 35:01.960
Well, do you know what?

35:01.960 --> 35:04.960
I'm sorry, but I don't think that's a reason to cheat on your husband.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.960
I really don't.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.960
And excuse me for not listening to you right now.

35:08.960 --> 35:12.960
But you're breaking my freaking heart.

35:12.960 --> 35:14.960
I'm sorry.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.960
It's on.

35:16.960 --> 35:18.960
Okay.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.960
And then we should say there's a cut.

35:20.960 --> 35:22.960
And you say there's a thing on that last line.

35:22.960 --> 35:23.960
Yeah.

35:23.960 --> 35:24.960
Where did he have power?

35:24.960 --> 35:25.960
Who's a mirror?

35:25.960 --> 35:26.960
There's no way.

35:26.960 --> 35:27.960
There's a beat.

35:27.960 --> 35:28.960
But the beat says beat.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.960
Not of silence of drums.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.960
So how could I have done that?

35:32.960 --> 35:33.960
You could just air drum.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.960
You could have, um, I don't know.

35:36.960 --> 35:37.960
Drum roll, please.

35:37.960 --> 35:38.960
On your lap.

35:38.960 --> 35:39.960
Any.

35:39.960 --> 35:41.960
My character, any power says phase on literally.

35:41.960 --> 35:42.960
Every line.

35:42.960 --> 35:43.960
Every line.

35:43.960 --> 35:44.960
But there's only two people.

35:44.960 --> 35:46.960
I don't want to.

35:46.960 --> 35:47.960
People in the scene.

35:47.960 --> 35:49.960
You say it once at most.

35:49.960 --> 35:51.960
To like, I guess get across his name.

35:51.960 --> 35:52.960
Yeah.

35:52.960 --> 35:53.960
But there's no need.

35:53.960 --> 35:54.960
Are you hearing me phase on?

35:54.960 --> 35:55.960
Do you have anything?

35:55.960 --> 35:56.960
Yeah.

35:56.960 --> 35:57.960
Press phase on.

35:57.960 --> 35:58.960
These are all.

35:58.960 --> 35:59.960
We all listen.

35:59.960 --> 36:00.960
Yeah.

36:00.960 --> 36:01.960
Because phase on.

36:01.960 --> 36:02.960
Never calls.

36:02.960 --> 36:03.960
Never calls her 80 power.

36:03.960 --> 36:04.960
What?

36:04.960 --> 36:05.960
Yeah.

36:05.960 --> 36:06.960
And that was good.

36:06.960 --> 36:08.960
When I was reading the character.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.960
I felt like that was missing.

36:10.960 --> 36:11.960
That's what.

36:11.960 --> 36:13.960
That's the issue that you had performance was.

36:13.960 --> 36:14.960
Yeah.

36:14.960 --> 36:15.960
Build the character.

36:15.960 --> 36:18.960
Because your, because phase on didn't say the words any power.

36:18.960 --> 36:19.960
Yeah.

36:19.960 --> 36:23.960
Because like, I mean, first off, we're doing a table read through a screen, which

36:23.960 --> 36:25.960
already is so impersonal.

36:25.960 --> 36:28.960
If I had the name any power come out my tongue, then I think that would have

36:28.960 --> 36:30.960
been a lot more personal for me.

36:30.960 --> 36:31.960
Okay.

36:31.960 --> 36:32.960
Just as an actor.

36:32.960 --> 36:36.960
But like, you're obviously trying to be a director or writer, whatever the fuck.

36:36.960 --> 36:41.960
So like, I know it doesn't perform or how it's going to be supposed to feel.

36:41.960 --> 36:42.960
Yeah.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.960
And then so let's, let's get your thoughts on the, the quantity and the quality.

36:45.960 --> 36:49.960
And then let's let's all of us kind of figure out what scene this could, what kind of thing

36:49.960 --> 36:50.960
this could be seen in.

36:50.960 --> 36:51.960
Quality wise.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.960
I think there was a pretty good amount of it.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.960
And then terms of quality.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.960
I'd say it was a bit better than the first one.

36:58.960 --> 37:01.960
Which I think is you always want to be going up.

37:01.960 --> 37:02.960
Yeah.

37:02.960 --> 37:06.960
How are you still unsure about what thing this could be a scene in?

37:06.960 --> 37:08.960
Like, that's the first thing you figure out.

37:08.960 --> 37:12.960
You wrote a scene and you still don't know what thing that scene could be in.

37:12.960 --> 37:13.960
Right.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.960
That's such a backwards way to do it.

37:15.960 --> 37:17.960
No, because I have these ideas in my head.

37:17.960 --> 37:18.960
So I have to get them out.

37:18.960 --> 37:21.960
It's like how, you know, a songwriter will just like record three chords.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.960
No, like, oh, that's a progression.

37:23.960 --> 37:24.960
I'll work with it later.

37:24.960 --> 37:31.960
It's okay to kind of take stock when inspiration hits or moves you brightly.

37:31.960 --> 37:32.960
Yeah.

37:32.960 --> 37:41.960
I guess I would say I don't, I don't really get the set.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.960
This is part of the larger thing.

37:43.960 --> 37:46.960
You know, it feels kind of self-good day.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.960
Like, maybe a sketch or something.

37:48.960 --> 37:51.960
I mean, I'd say for part of it, it has a bit of a game to it.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.960
You know, not to go all UCB on you guys.

37:53.960 --> 37:56.960
But a game is sort of the kernel of the sketches.

37:56.960 --> 37:59.960
The funny thing is the engine.

37:59.960 --> 38:04.960
And in this piece, there's a simple game that I'll describe to you right now.

38:04.960 --> 38:08.960
It just means like the monster from it follows.

38:08.960 --> 38:14.960
Sorry, just spirits of the UCB four were sort of taking over me.

38:14.960 --> 38:15.960
Yeah.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.960
I really said to one of the episodes that you're on last,

38:18.960 --> 38:22.960
and you didn't remember Ian McRobberts or whatever the fuck his name is name.

38:22.960 --> 38:26.960
So I don't say the spirit of the UCB four ran through your veins.

38:26.960 --> 38:27.960
Yeah.

38:27.960 --> 38:29.960
I mean, it's like you're so close to people.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.960
You don't have to like know their name.

38:31.960 --> 38:32.960
It's more than names.

38:32.960 --> 38:36.960
It's a feeling before the way the guide be every single day.

38:36.960 --> 38:37.960
Never mind.

38:37.960 --> 38:39.960
I was going to compliment the game of this sketch.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.960
And because you were so rude, I'm not going to do it.

38:41.960 --> 38:43.960
The scene is bad.

38:43.960 --> 38:50.960
And I think it would could you could put it in a weird commercial, maybe.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.960
I'm like a weird commercial, but it's like, it's like berries and cream skittles.

38:54.960 --> 38:55.960
So like it ends up being a favorite.

38:55.960 --> 38:56.960
Yes.

38:56.960 --> 38:59.960
It's like random humor commercial for like tide.

38:59.960 --> 39:02.960
And then at the end, they're like, oh, sure could have used some tide.

39:02.960 --> 39:05.960
I might have helped out this crazy situation where it.

39:05.960 --> 39:06.960
Yeah.

39:06.960 --> 39:08.960
And that's a good song for any commercials.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.960
I mean, commercials are good, good, good solid money.

39:11.960 --> 39:12.960
Which you care about.

39:12.960 --> 39:13.960
Yeah.

39:13.960 --> 39:14.960
Yeah.

39:14.960 --> 39:15.960
I mean, everyone does.

39:15.960 --> 39:16.960
So.

39:16.960 --> 39:17.960
All right.

39:17.960 --> 39:18.960
I'm just a normal guy.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.960
You can't believe there's a third one.

39:21.960 --> 39:22.960
Let's do this.

39:22.960 --> 39:23.960
It's this one's a little shorter.

39:23.960 --> 39:24.960
So why don't we give?

39:24.960 --> 39:27.960
Let's give a mirror a break from acting.

39:27.960 --> 39:28.960
So I'm here.

39:28.960 --> 39:29.960
You direct this one.

39:29.960 --> 39:30.960
And then Zach.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.960
I'd love to see you be a sign filled.

39:33.960 --> 39:36.960
And Johnny, you could be lawyer.

39:38.960 --> 39:42.960
Can I ask a question before we start of the director?

39:42.960 --> 39:43.960
Yeah.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.960
And I'm here.

39:45.960 --> 39:46.960
Do you.

39:46.960 --> 39:47.960
The carrier's name is sign filled.

39:47.960 --> 39:49.960
I don't know if it's meant to be similar to.

39:49.960 --> 39:55.960
Jerry's sign filled, but you want me to do an impression of Jerry's sign filled or just sort of do my own take on it.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.960
Interesting.

39:57.960 --> 40:01.960
Let's do it as Jerry because this is not just glancing over.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.960
This is a short-ish scene.

40:03.960 --> 40:04.960
It's pretty short.

40:04.960 --> 40:05.960
Yeah.

40:05.960 --> 40:06.960
Yeah.

40:06.960 --> 40:07.960
Awesome.

40:07.960 --> 40:08.960
Yeah.

40:08.960 --> 40:09.960
And it's hard because like, yeah.

40:09.960 --> 40:10.960
And action.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.960
All right.

40:12.960 --> 40:14.960
I think you have a case.

40:14.960 --> 40:16.960
I do, too.

40:16.960 --> 40:17.960
But aren't you worried?

40:17.960 --> 40:21.960
Everyone's just going to laugh through my testimony because of my name.

40:21.960 --> 40:22.960
Your name?

40:22.960 --> 40:23.960
Yeah.

40:23.960 --> 40:24.960
Fuck.

40:24.960 --> 40:26.960
I didn't think about that.

40:26.960 --> 40:27.960
And that's it.

40:27.960 --> 40:28.960
Yeah.

40:28.960 --> 40:32.960
So that's why he's a bad note to give because it's the whole point is that it's his last name.

40:32.960 --> 40:35.960
His name is Jerry's sign filled, but he's not that Jerry's sign filled.

40:35.960 --> 40:36.960
So that's it.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.960
I mean, you didn't even mention that.

40:38.960 --> 40:40.960
Multiple people can talk like that.

40:40.960 --> 40:41.960
Yeah.

40:41.960 --> 40:42.960
It may be that would even complicate the case.

40:42.960 --> 40:46.960
The odds are so low that his name is Jerry's actually like him.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.960
Like my impression does.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.960
It would be an interesting regal.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.960
I think to the situation here.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.960
And you look, I'm not that I'm an expert.

40:54.960 --> 40:55.960
You know what I need.

40:55.960 --> 40:56.960
Sure.

40:56.960 --> 40:57.960
I'm a writer.

40:57.960 --> 40:58.960
But like, I'm not saying I know better than you.

40:58.960 --> 40:59.960
But this is what I would do personally.

40:59.960 --> 41:00.960
Okay.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.960
I mean, I did ask for your specific advice.

41:02.960 --> 41:06.960
So I guess I'll make him borderline a sign filled in person.

41:06.960 --> 41:07.960
But not sign filled.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.960
But his name is Jerry's sign filled.

41:09.960 --> 41:12.960
And then this is an example of when you would want to use the name.

41:12.960 --> 41:13.960
But you don't use it.

41:13.960 --> 41:14.960
It'll last name at all.

41:14.960 --> 41:17.960
And the last thing you said face on every line.

41:17.960 --> 41:19.960
And this is when you would want to use it.

41:19.960 --> 41:21.960
I think you have a case sign filled.

41:21.960 --> 41:22.960
Yeah.

41:22.960 --> 41:23.960
I do.

41:23.960 --> 41:24.960
The sign filled.

41:24.960 --> 41:25.960
Yeah.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.960
But if you have a situation where the actors perform it is so clear and good.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.960
It sounds so much like Jerry's sign filled.

41:30.960 --> 41:31.960
You don't really need to say it.

41:31.960 --> 41:37.960
Well, two things to just rebutton respond to that is one in context.

41:37.960 --> 41:42.960
And we'll again figure out what this could be a part of scene wise.

41:42.960 --> 41:44.960
You would know that his name is sign filled.

41:44.960 --> 41:46.960
Jerry's sign filled.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.960
You know, maybe he has a place or something.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.960
Maybe he was an episode of side fell.

41:50.960 --> 41:51.960
There's something.

41:51.960 --> 41:52.960
Yeah.

41:52.960 --> 41:53.960
Yeah.

41:53.960 --> 41:54.960
No context.

41:54.960 --> 41:57.960
Again, the entire point is that it's not Jerry.

41:57.960 --> 41:59.960
It's just stuff.

41:59.960 --> 42:00.960
That's my one.

42:00.960 --> 42:01.960
Shit.

42:01.960 --> 42:02.960
This is tough.

42:02.960 --> 42:03.960
God.

42:03.960 --> 42:04.960
Right.

42:04.960 --> 42:05.960
It could be so hard.

42:05.960 --> 42:07.960
Well, I thought it would forget that.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.960
It's supposed to be fun.

42:09.960 --> 42:11.960
And then like, look at you guys expressions.

42:11.960 --> 42:14.960
Like, Johnny's never been angry or mirrors checking his email.

42:14.960 --> 42:18.960
And it's like smiling, but it's more a grin of shagrin.

42:18.960 --> 42:20.960
What a pain smile for you.

42:20.960 --> 42:23.960
A grin of shagrin.

42:23.960 --> 42:26.960
It's already dark there.

42:26.960 --> 42:29.960
It's 140 here.

42:29.960 --> 42:34.960
And L.A. and it's straight up cold and dark in New York or you are already.

42:35.960 --> 42:38.960
It actually was a nice day today.

42:38.960 --> 42:40.960
Do we have any ideas of what that.

42:40.960 --> 42:42.960
So you want that to be an episode of side fell.

42:42.960 --> 42:46.960
And then the only note that you had was to add names, which was the kind of goes back on the note that you gave for

42:46.960 --> 42:47.960
Seen two here we go.

42:47.960 --> 42:48.960
Seen four.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.960
I would just say in terms of quantity.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.960
This one is lacking a bit.

42:52.960 --> 42:53.960
It's so it's so short.

42:53.960 --> 42:54.960
It's only three lines.

42:54.960 --> 42:55.960
Okay.

42:55.960 --> 42:58.960
So this is one native analysis qualitative analysis.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.960
And then what the scene should be a part of.

43:00.960 --> 43:01.960
Contextual.

43:01.960 --> 43:02.960
Yeah.

43:03.960 --> 43:04.960
You send another one.

43:04.960 --> 43:06.960
Just so I can mentally prepare.

43:06.960 --> 43:07.960
Yeah.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.960
How many scenes did you really good question?

43:09.960 --> 43:10.960
Yeah.

43:10.960 --> 43:11.960
Five.

43:11.960 --> 43:12.960
This is seen for.

43:12.960 --> 43:13.960
My god.

43:13.960 --> 43:14.960
Okay.

43:14.960 --> 43:15.960
Cool.

43:15.960 --> 43:16.960
All right.

43:16.960 --> 43:17.960
This was supposed to be fun.

43:17.960 --> 43:18.960
Yeah.

43:18.960 --> 43:19.960
Um.

43:19.960 --> 43:20.960
Amir.

43:20.960 --> 43:22.960
Why don't you be Russell and Johnny.

43:22.960 --> 43:23.960
You'll be lady.

43:23.960 --> 43:24.960
And then.

43:24.960 --> 43:25.960
Yeah.

43:25.960 --> 43:26.960
Zack.

43:26.960 --> 43:27.960
You're sort of in that director's chair again.

43:27.960 --> 43:30.960
How did you switch this out for the one short.

43:31.960 --> 43:32.960
Yeah.

43:32.960 --> 43:33.960
Yeah.

43:33.960 --> 43:34.960
Yeah.

43:34.960 --> 43:35.960
You want to see me.

43:35.960 --> 43:36.960
It's hard to direct.

43:36.960 --> 43:37.960
It's a lot.

43:37.960 --> 43:38.960
So I wanted to give him a break.

43:38.960 --> 43:41.960
A lot of people act in direct and write even.

43:41.960 --> 43:42.960
A tours.

43:42.960 --> 43:44.960
You want to be a multi-hifin it.

43:44.960 --> 43:45.960
Isn't that true?

43:45.960 --> 43:46.960
Like in Hollywood?

43:46.960 --> 43:48.960
It's important to be able to do all three.

43:48.960 --> 43:51.960
And I guess in terms of order.

43:51.960 --> 43:55.960
Writing is the hardest because you have to like make shit up from nothing.

43:55.960 --> 43:59.960
Acting is the second hardest because you just have to say the words in an interesting way.

43:59.960 --> 44:05.960
And then again, directing could be replaced by a mechanical bull of sorts that accidentally

44:05.960 --> 44:07.960
says action once every half an hour.

44:07.960 --> 44:08.960
So that would be the easiest.

44:08.960 --> 44:09.960
Yeah.

44:09.960 --> 44:10.960
Definitely.

44:10.960 --> 44:11.960
Yeah.

44:11.960 --> 44:14.960
So I'd like to see the MP3 try writing in acting too.

44:14.960 --> 44:15.960
Just to see if it has a problem.

44:15.960 --> 44:16.960
We act.

44:16.960 --> 44:20.960
Also like if the line is literally just that word action or you can report whatever.

44:20.960 --> 44:22.960
That makes it easy.

44:22.960 --> 44:26.960
Writing there's no way because it's like literally like I have a blank page and I have to

44:26.960 --> 44:28.960
create an entire universe.

44:28.960 --> 44:29.960
That's true.

44:29.960 --> 44:32.960
But with some of the advances in science, it's difficult to say what will become possible

44:32.960 --> 44:33.960
in the next few years.

44:33.960 --> 44:34.960
Yeah.

44:34.960 --> 44:35.960
Agreed.

44:35.960 --> 44:38.960
Imagine the director.mp3 getting an e-got.

44:38.960 --> 44:40.960
That would be pretty sick.

44:40.960 --> 44:42.960
A Tony.

44:42.960 --> 44:43.960
E-got.

44:43.960 --> 44:44.960
All of them.

44:44.960 --> 44:47.960
No, just that the Tony seems like the least likely.

44:47.960 --> 44:53.960
Or even a we got, which is a webby and then the other four.

44:53.960 --> 44:55.960
Webby seems like it'd be the easiest.

44:55.960 --> 44:56.960
That's kind of its turf.

44:56.960 --> 44:57.960
Yeah.

44:58.960 --> 44:59.960
All right.

44:59.960 --> 45:00.960
Let's get into this scene.

45:00.960 --> 45:01.960
Okay.

45:01.960 --> 45:03.960
This is maybe my favorite.

45:03.960 --> 45:04.960
Okay.

45:04.960 --> 45:05.960
Cool.

45:05.960 --> 45:07.960
And action.

45:09.960 --> 45:11.960
Sorry you Italian.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.960
I'm Korean.

45:13.960 --> 45:18.960
Oh, nice.

45:18.960 --> 45:21.960
How could you think I was Italian?

45:21.960 --> 45:22.960
Listen.

45:22.960 --> 45:25.960
I love to be upfront with what I'm looking for.

45:25.960 --> 45:27.960
So I'm just going to put it out there.

45:27.960 --> 45:28.960
I want to date you.

45:28.960 --> 45:29.960
I really do.

45:29.960 --> 45:31.960
I think you're wonderful.

45:31.960 --> 45:32.960
Flash Italian.

45:32.960 --> 45:34.960
There it is again, right?

45:34.960 --> 45:42.960
My family is from Busan.

45:42.960 --> 45:43.960
Milan?

45:43.960 --> 45:44.960
No.

45:44.960 --> 45:47.960
I haven't thought.

45:47.960 --> 45:49.960
I've built this deep.

45:50.960 --> 45:56.960
Keep it all in.

45:56.960 --> 45:57.960
I'm not cutting.

45:57.960 --> 46:02.960
This is all in there.

46:02.960 --> 46:11.960
I haven't felt it.

46:12.960 --> 46:18.960
I haven't felt this deep connection in a while.

46:18.960 --> 46:23.960
What's funny?

46:23.960 --> 46:24.960
Huh?

46:24.960 --> 46:25.960
You can't go.

46:25.960 --> 46:28.960
What's funny?

46:28.960 --> 46:40.960
This is racist.

46:40.960 --> 46:42.960
That best.

46:42.960 --> 46:43.960
Oh, sorry.

46:43.960 --> 46:50.960
I was just thinking about you.

46:50.960 --> 46:51.960
Sorry.

46:51.960 --> 47:00.960
I was just thinking about you showing me around Sicily.

47:00.960 --> 47:03.960
Sicily.

47:03.960 --> 47:04.960
I wouldn't be able to.

47:04.960 --> 47:07.960
And that's not funny.

47:07.960 --> 47:09.960
It's been hard life for me actually.

47:09.960 --> 47:16.960
Doesn't your dad on TV.

47:16.960 --> 47:18.960
That's true.

47:18.960 --> 47:19.960
Ha.

47:19.960 --> 47:22.960
You know, I actually feel it kind of better now that you mentioned that.

47:22.960 --> 47:24.960
You forgot.

47:24.960 --> 47:28.960
I'm going to grab a couple canolees you on in.

47:28.960 --> 47:30.960
No, thank you.

47:30.960 --> 47:33.960
Name's Russell, by the way.

47:33.960 --> 47:34.960
I know.

47:34.960 --> 47:36.960
This is our second date.

47:36.960 --> 47:38.960
That's true.

47:38.960 --> 47:41.960
Later.

47:41.960 --> 47:44.960
Cut.

47:44.960 --> 47:45.960
Wow.

47:45.960 --> 47:46.960
Wow.

47:46.960 --> 47:48.960
I mean, I think you might have something here.

47:48.960 --> 47:50.960
I mean, it definitely is racist as.

47:50.960 --> 47:51.960
Oh, yeah.

47:51.960 --> 47:53.960
Sort of all got to experience.

47:53.960 --> 47:55.960
But I think if we're able to maybe work around that.

47:55.960 --> 47:59.960
You definitely hit on something pretty interesting with this piece.

47:59.960 --> 48:01.960
I disagree.

48:01.960 --> 48:02.960
Because it disagree.

48:02.960 --> 48:05.960
This was supposed to be a hard drama.

48:06.960 --> 48:07.960
And no way.

48:07.960 --> 48:09.960
I'm here with laughing hard.

48:09.960 --> 48:10.960
So that's.

48:10.960 --> 48:12.960
There's no way to be drama.

48:12.960 --> 48:16.960
He's basically talking to an Asian woman insisting that she's Italian.

48:16.960 --> 48:19.960
And then demands that she's show him around Sicily.

48:19.960 --> 48:23.960
And then at a certain point says we should go get canolees.

48:23.960 --> 48:24.960
It's all really weird.

48:24.960 --> 48:27.960
Really a comedic piece.

48:27.960 --> 48:28.960
Okay.

48:28.960 --> 48:34.960
If not hard drama, like a once style romance movie where there's maybe like moments of light

48:34.960 --> 48:37.960
hardedness, but it's mostly about connection.

48:37.960 --> 48:38.960
Yeah.

48:38.960 --> 48:42.960
I'd say this brings me to another one of my big writing tips for you and everyone listening,

48:42.960 --> 48:45.960
which is you have to know yourself as a writer.

48:45.960 --> 48:46.960
So okay.

48:46.960 --> 48:47.960
Someone like Jeffrey.

48:47.960 --> 48:48.960
You might want to write a hard job.

48:48.960 --> 48:51.960
He might want to write a one style beautiful romance.

48:51.960 --> 48:53.960
But that's not who he is.

48:53.960 --> 48:55.960
You know, he's he's a funny guy.

48:55.960 --> 48:58.960
And he's just got right things that are more sort of comedic,

48:58.960 --> 49:00.960
ish and tone.

49:00.960 --> 49:03.960
And you have to know yourself just like every writer must.

49:03.960 --> 49:05.960
Must know, uh, themselves.

49:05.960 --> 49:06.960
Thank you.

49:06.960 --> 49:07.960
Oh, I don't think so.

49:07.960 --> 49:09.960
Great insights, Zach.

49:09.960 --> 49:10.960
Yeah.

49:10.960 --> 49:11.960
Thank you, Johnny.

49:11.960 --> 49:13.960
Um, I really appreciate that.

49:13.960 --> 49:15.960
And I know, I know myself.

49:15.960 --> 49:17.960
I know that I'm a pretty damn good writing teacher.

49:17.960 --> 49:18.960
So yeah.

49:18.960 --> 49:19.960
But no seriousness.

49:19.960 --> 49:20.960
Thank you.

49:20.960 --> 49:21.960
Yeah.

49:21.960 --> 49:22.960
Not even 10 minutes ago.

49:22.960 --> 49:23.960
You said I'm not an expert.

49:23.960 --> 49:24.960
I'm not claiming to be an expert.

49:24.960 --> 49:25.960
But here we go.

49:25.960 --> 49:26.960
Scene five.

49:26.960 --> 49:27.960
Hey.

49:27.960 --> 49:28.960
Hey.

49:28.960 --> 49:31.960
You know, you could be a great teacher and not an expert.

49:31.960 --> 49:32.960
Always be humble.

49:32.960 --> 49:34.960
Always be learning writing.

49:34.960 --> 49:35.960
Get number eight.

49:35.960 --> 49:36.960
Oh.

49:36.960 --> 49:37.960
Um.

49:37.960 --> 49:38.960
All right.

49:38.960 --> 49:39.960
This is the last scene.

49:39.960 --> 49:40.960
Here we go.

49:40.960 --> 49:41.960
Let's do a mirror.

49:41.960 --> 49:43.960
Why don't you be funny?

49:43.960 --> 49:47.960
And Johnny, you could be Ikea manager.

49:47.960 --> 49:49.960
It's not completely dark out, right?

49:49.960 --> 49:50.960
Yeah.

49:50.960 --> 49:51.960
Like night has be following you.

49:51.960 --> 49:52.960
Correct.

49:52.960 --> 49:53.960
451 p.m.

49:53.960 --> 49:54.960
Okay.

49:54.960 --> 49:55.960
Back to directing.

49:55.960 --> 49:57.960
No more no part for me.

49:57.960 --> 50:00.960
You know, maybe they can be like a hitchcock style.

50:01.960 --> 50:02.960
Cameo on this one.

50:02.960 --> 50:03.960
That would be a lot.

50:03.960 --> 50:04.960
I want to do that.

50:04.960 --> 50:05.960
I want to do that.

50:05.960 --> 50:06.960
Okay.

50:06.960 --> 50:09.960
I'm going to sort of find the perfect place to insert myself.

50:09.960 --> 50:10.960
All right.

50:10.960 --> 50:11.960
Yeah.

50:11.960 --> 50:12.960
And just like no need to tell us where that is.

50:12.960 --> 50:15.960
I think I trust that you can feel it out as the director.

50:15.960 --> 50:16.960
Yeah.

50:16.960 --> 50:17.960
Yeah.

50:17.960 --> 50:18.960
I agree.

50:18.960 --> 50:19.960
All right.

50:19.960 --> 50:20.960
And actors ready.

50:20.960 --> 50:21.960
Okay.

50:21.960 --> 50:22.960
Action.

50:22.960 --> 50:23.960
All right.

50:23.960 --> 50:24.960
What seems to be the problem.

50:24.960 --> 50:25.960
You guys don't have the.

50:25.960 --> 50:26.960
Yeah.

50:26.960 --> 50:28.960
What does he have to be the problem?

50:28.960 --> 50:29.960
So now you're at.

50:29.960 --> 50:30.960
Sorry.

50:30.960 --> 50:33.960
Can I cut because now you're in the entire scene because that's like.

50:33.960 --> 50:34.960
What's up?

50:34.960 --> 50:35.960
No.

50:35.960 --> 50:39.960
Because now you're in the entire scene because you basically asked the same question as the

50:39.960 --> 50:42.960
IKEA manager, which means you're going to be standing there for the whole scene.

50:42.960 --> 50:44.960
And it's weird if you don't say something.

50:44.960 --> 50:46.960
It's weird if you do.

50:46.960 --> 50:48.960
I don't even remember what happened, man.

50:48.960 --> 50:50.960
I was just so feeling in the scene.

50:50.960 --> 50:51.960
I wouldn't do it.

50:51.960 --> 50:52.960
I wouldn't do it.

50:52.960 --> 50:53.960
I usually hit.

50:53.960 --> 50:54.960
It's lost through.

50:54.960 --> 50:56.960
It's kind of cool that you like.

50:56.960 --> 51:01.960
He's not only just there, but he's also sort of backing up the IKEA manager.

51:01.960 --> 51:02.960
Yeah.

51:02.960 --> 51:04.960
You're pushing the art forward in terms of cameos.

51:04.960 --> 51:05.960
I don't think so.

51:05.960 --> 51:06.960
I really don't.

51:06.960 --> 51:08.960
I like trying to be like sort of modern.

51:08.960 --> 51:09.960
Better.

51:09.960 --> 51:10.960
Hitchcock.

51:10.960 --> 51:12.960
And so those are my.

51:12.960 --> 51:14.960
The things I bring in the table.

51:14.960 --> 51:15.960
All right.

51:15.960 --> 51:16.960
This time this time I'll do more of a visual.

51:16.960 --> 51:17.960
I'll try to more of a visual.

51:17.960 --> 51:18.960
Can't be only for the video.

51:18.960 --> 51:19.960
Okay.

51:19.960 --> 51:20.960
Great.

51:22.960 --> 51:23.960
Action.

51:23.960 --> 51:24.960
Okay.

51:24.960 --> 51:25.960
Okay.

51:25.960 --> 51:27.960
It seems to be the problem.

51:27.960 --> 51:30.960
You guys don't have the.

51:30.960 --> 51:31.960
Sorry.

51:31.960 --> 51:32.960
It's kind of distracting.

51:32.960 --> 51:35.960
I can see like the top half of your head.

51:35.960 --> 51:37.960
You're not fully out of frame.

51:37.960 --> 51:39.960
You're bent down the way that it's hard to raise.

51:39.960 --> 51:40.960
I literally say you're kind of shaking.

51:40.960 --> 51:42.960
You can visual appearance.

51:42.960 --> 51:45.960
Can you move this dream or not move yourself?

51:45.960 --> 51:46.960
Yeah.

51:46.960 --> 51:47.960
I'll try that.

51:47.960 --> 51:48.960
All right.

51:48.960 --> 51:49.960
Let's go to the top.

51:49.960 --> 51:50.960
To the top.

51:50.960 --> 51:51.960
And action.

51:52.960 --> 51:56.960
What seems to be the problem.

51:56.960 --> 51:59.960
You guys don't have the actor sectional.

51:59.960 --> 52:02.960
Unfortunately, not in store at the moment.

52:02.960 --> 52:04.960
But we can order it to the store.

52:04.960 --> 52:11.960
Why would I want you to order it to the store when I could just order it to my house?

52:11.960 --> 52:13.960
Would you like to do that?

52:13.960 --> 52:20.960
Why would I order it in store to my house when I could just do it online from my house?

52:21.960 --> 52:24.960
You definitely can do that if you like.

52:24.960 --> 52:26.960
This sucks.

52:26.960 --> 52:28.960
So.

52:28.960 --> 52:30.960
Zach is starting to sort of.

52:30.960 --> 52:31.960
Is this on purpose?

52:31.960 --> 52:33.960
You're peeking into the frame.

52:33.960 --> 52:34.960
I don't know.

52:34.960 --> 52:35.960
Yeah.

52:35.960 --> 52:36.960
We don't know if the screen is like slipping.

52:36.960 --> 52:37.960
That's the.

52:37.960 --> 52:38.960
That's the talk.

52:38.960 --> 52:39.960
Keep to see it going.

52:39.960 --> 52:40.960
Okay.

52:40.960 --> 52:41.960
Okay.

52:41.960 --> 52:42.960
It was a thumbs up.

52:42.960 --> 52:45.960
This sucks so much balls.

52:45.960 --> 52:47.960
Um.

52:48.960 --> 52:49.960
Say it was me.

52:49.960 --> 52:50.960
Wait.

52:50.960 --> 52:51.960
He's.

52:51.960 --> 52:52.960
Yeah.

52:52.960 --> 52:53.960
He went back.

52:53.960 --> 52:54.960
He's sliding up.

52:54.960 --> 52:55.960
Okay.

52:55.960 --> 52:56.960
But not even fully.

52:56.960 --> 52:57.960
Like you can still see the crown of a set.

52:57.960 --> 52:58.960
There he is.

52:58.960 --> 52:59.960
Say it with me.

52:59.960 --> 53:05.960
You want me to say this sucks so much balls right now.

53:05.960 --> 53:07.960
Okay.

53:07.960 --> 53:10.960
This sucks so much balls right now.

53:10.960 --> 53:11.960
No.

53:11.960 --> 53:12.960
Not right now.

53:12.960 --> 53:14.960
That's not what I said.

53:14.960 --> 53:15.960
Let's say it the first time.

53:15.960 --> 53:19.960
But you added right now when I specifically asked you what you wanted me to say.

53:19.960 --> 53:22.960
I key a sucks.

53:22.960 --> 53:25.960
Is there anything else I can help you with today?

53:25.960 --> 53:28.960
The littlest portion of Zach's hair in the frame.

53:28.960 --> 53:29.960
Still in it.

53:29.960 --> 53:30.960
Yeah.

53:30.960 --> 53:31.960
He's still in it.

53:31.960 --> 53:32.960
It's just.

53:32.960 --> 53:33.960
You didn't say it the first time.

53:33.960 --> 53:34.960
Uh, all right.

53:34.960 --> 53:35.960
A kiss sucks.

53:35.960 --> 53:36.960
Oh, yeah.

53:36.960 --> 53:37.960
Hands the phone to the manager.

53:37.960 --> 53:41.960
Can you route me to the nearest restoration hardware?

53:41.960 --> 53:43.960
Restoration.

53:43.960 --> 53:47.960
That place is like 600 times more expensive than Ikea, right?

53:47.960 --> 53:48.960
Damn it.

53:48.960 --> 53:49.960
Today sucks.

53:49.960 --> 53:51.960
It's sucking so much balls right now.

53:51.960 --> 53:52.960
I swear to God.

53:52.960 --> 53:54.960
Can you please stop saying that?

53:54.960 --> 53:56.960
This is a family establishment.

53:56.960 --> 53:57.960
Sure.

53:57.960 --> 53:58.960
You said it earlier.

53:58.960 --> 53:59.960
Yeah.

53:59.960 --> 54:00.960
Sure.

54:00.960 --> 54:01.960
Okay.

54:01.960 --> 54:03.960
And cameo.

54:03.960 --> 54:04.960
Cut.

54:04.960 --> 54:06.960
All right.

54:06.960 --> 54:08.960
I got to be honest.

54:08.960 --> 54:10.960
I wasn't paying much attention.

54:10.960 --> 54:11.960
I couldn't.

54:11.960 --> 54:12.960
Yeah.

54:12.960 --> 54:13.960
Yeah.

54:13.960 --> 54:15.960
You can't do both.

54:15.960 --> 54:16.960
Yeah.

54:16.960 --> 54:17.960
I guess not.

54:17.960 --> 54:18.960
That's also the least amount.

54:18.960 --> 54:19.960
It would be in it.

54:19.960 --> 54:20.960
Something today.

54:20.960 --> 54:21.960
Yeah.

54:21.960 --> 54:22.960
Yeah.

54:22.960 --> 54:23.960
Yeah.

54:23.960 --> 54:24.960
See you're always learning.

54:24.960 --> 54:25.960
Like you said.

54:25.960 --> 54:26.960
That's why it's so hard to do people.

54:26.960 --> 54:27.960
Be the multi-hifin it.

54:27.960 --> 54:28.960
Like a lot of people can't do both.

54:28.960 --> 54:30.960
Let alone at the same time.

54:30.960 --> 54:31.960
It's so hard.

54:31.960 --> 54:32.960
I think the scene was.

54:32.960 --> 54:34.960
The scene was really good.

54:34.960 --> 54:35.960
The part I paid attention to.

54:35.960 --> 54:38.960
I thought all three performances were amazing.

54:38.960 --> 54:42.960
And so I just honestly had to up to all the actors.

54:42.960 --> 54:44.960
And this was an interesting piece, Jeffrey.

54:44.960 --> 54:47.960
Where wherever is your head out when you were putting this one together?

54:47.960 --> 54:52.960
This one was just like, I was trying to get the actor up.

54:52.960 --> 54:54.960
And they didn't have it.

54:54.960 --> 54:56.960
And so it was just kind of tough.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.960
Are you from from life?

54:58.960 --> 54:59.960
It's a housing swap.

54:59.960 --> 55:01.960
Wait, you're ordering a couch there?

55:01.960 --> 55:02.960
Yeah.

55:02.960 --> 55:03.960
You're ordering?

55:03.960 --> 55:04.960
Yeah.

55:04.960 --> 55:06.960
Their couch just wasn't cutting it for my ass.

55:06.960 --> 55:07.960
So I had to kind of go get another.

55:07.960 --> 55:10.960
Sectional.

55:10.960 --> 55:13.960
You're swapping apartments for a month or two.

55:13.960 --> 55:14.960
Yeah.

55:14.960 --> 55:16.960
They have a couch in there.

55:16.960 --> 55:18.960
You bought a storage.

55:18.960 --> 55:20.960
You got storage unit.

55:20.960 --> 55:22.960
Just to put their couch away.

55:22.960 --> 55:23.960
Yeah.

55:23.960 --> 55:25.960
Because it wasn't cutting it.

55:25.960 --> 55:26.960
What was wrong with their couch?

55:26.960 --> 55:27.960
By the way, you got in that key account.

55:27.960 --> 55:28.960
It's not like you splurged.

55:28.960 --> 55:29.960
What was their couch?

55:29.960 --> 55:30.960
Yeah.

55:30.960 --> 55:32.960
Their couch was like pottery bar and teen or something.

55:32.960 --> 55:34.960
Pottery bar and adult.

55:35.960 --> 55:38.960
That's so fancy, so expensive.

55:38.960 --> 55:39.960
Yeah.

55:39.960 --> 55:42.960
It just wasn't cutting it for my ass.

55:42.960 --> 55:43.960
Yeah.

55:43.960 --> 55:44.960
You said how do you, yeah, you said that.

55:44.960 --> 55:45.960
Where's the storage?

55:45.960 --> 55:46.960
It's in Bushwick.

55:46.960 --> 55:49.960
Why are we grilling me about this right now?

55:49.960 --> 55:50.960
I don't think you're out here.

55:50.960 --> 55:51.960
You like to get a you all or something?

55:51.960 --> 55:52.960
Yeah.

55:52.960 --> 55:54.960
Well, there's like a moving service here called,

55:54.960 --> 55:55.960
What the hell is it called?

55:55.960 --> 55:57.960
Clutter.

55:57.960 --> 55:58.960
Yeah.

55:58.960 --> 56:00.960
So that was a lot of places actually.

56:00.960 --> 56:01.960
That was.

56:01.960 --> 56:03.960
How long are you even there?

56:03.960 --> 56:05.960
Are you going back to Cleveland soon for the holidays?

56:05.960 --> 56:10.960
I'm going back to Cleveland on the 20th and then from there right before

56:10.960 --> 56:12.960
New Year's I go back to LA.

56:12.960 --> 56:14.960
You're not even staying in New York.

56:14.960 --> 56:17.960
No, I was only here for a month and a half.

56:17.960 --> 56:21.960
So how long are you going to use in this couch?

56:21.960 --> 56:25.960
You got it'll have been because I moved into this apartment on Saturday,

56:25.960 --> 56:28.960
which is the fourth and then I leave for Cleveland on the 20th.

56:28.960 --> 56:30.960
So it's been six, it'll be 16 days.

56:30.960 --> 56:32.960
That's your New Yorker.

56:32.960 --> 56:35.960
It's two weeks and two days.

56:35.960 --> 56:37.960
And then by the way, most of that time,

56:37.960 --> 56:40.960
you'll have been in Cleveland.

56:40.960 --> 56:43.960
Because we went to Cleveland for Thanksgiving for about a week.

56:43.960 --> 56:45.960
And then you're going for 11 more days.

56:45.960 --> 56:48.960
It's more times in Cleveland than in New York.

56:48.960 --> 56:51.960
I never said that I was going to be here for.

56:51.960 --> 56:54.960
I never promoted it as like I'm moving here permanently.

56:54.960 --> 56:55.960
So I don't know why you're upset.

56:55.960 --> 56:58.960
And then you're going to swap the couches back.

56:58.960 --> 57:01.960
What I'll have to end up doing is do clutter or

57:01.960 --> 57:03.960
another moving equivalent.

57:03.960 --> 57:07.960
I saw something on the building out here that said two men in a truck or three men in a truck

57:07.960 --> 57:09.960
in different cheaper prices.

57:09.960 --> 57:13.960
Take this sofa to the storage unit or somewhere that I could sell it or

57:13.960 --> 57:17.960
can sign it and then get the other one that they had pottery bond.

57:17.960 --> 57:20.960
So I'm not going for a fucking steak.

57:20.960 --> 57:22.960
Because it wasn't cutting fit.

57:22.960 --> 57:24.960
It wasn't cutting it with my ass.

57:24.960 --> 57:26.960
That means nothing.

57:26.960 --> 57:29.960
But obviously means nothing.

57:30.960 --> 57:32.960
Amir, I love the Dutch angle.

57:32.960 --> 57:35.960
That's going on under video speed right now.

57:35.960 --> 57:37.960
Speaking of hitchcock.

57:37.960 --> 57:38.960
Yeah.

57:38.960 --> 57:39.960
Yeah.

57:39.960 --> 57:41.960
As a director, I love to see stuff like that.

57:41.960 --> 57:43.960
That's how you do it.

57:43.960 --> 57:45.960
Yeah.

57:45.960 --> 57:49.960
Well, listen, I appreciate you guys taking the time for this table read.

57:49.960 --> 57:51.960
I appreciate the notes that you guys gave, especially Zack.

57:51.960 --> 57:54.960
And I do think that once I implement these,

57:54.960 --> 57:56.960
it could make me a stronger writer or not.

57:56.960 --> 57:57.960
We'll see.

57:57.960 --> 57:59.960
And I'll get probably get back to you.

57:59.960 --> 58:00.960
Maybe the next time we're on the show.

58:00.960 --> 58:01.960
But either way.

58:01.960 --> 58:02.960
Thank you.

58:02.960 --> 58:05.960
I can barely remember a single concrete note I gave you.

58:05.960 --> 58:08.960
So it's hard to think about really how it's going to help you.

58:08.960 --> 58:09.960
No.

58:09.960 --> 58:13.960
You said be clear and make sure that people know what's happening even in a scene.

58:13.960 --> 58:14.960
Okay.

58:14.960 --> 58:15.960
You're right.

58:15.960 --> 58:19.960
He said name your characters instead of leaving placeholders like untied.

58:19.960 --> 58:20.960
I think next time.

58:20.960 --> 58:24.960
Here's another piece of advice is the side what what it is before you write it.

58:24.960 --> 58:25.960
Yes.

58:25.960 --> 58:26.960
It's like a TV show.

58:26.960 --> 58:29.960
That's high-liter movie.

58:29.960 --> 58:30.960
You know.

58:30.960 --> 58:31.960
That's well.

58:31.960 --> 58:33.960
But when you're off to a great start.

58:33.960 --> 58:38.960
And yeah, I mean, you really are showing something really interesting as a writer.

58:38.960 --> 58:39.960
And that's what I want to do.

58:39.960 --> 58:42.960
And I wasn't sure if I should be discouraged by this.

58:42.960 --> 58:43.960
Yeah.

58:43.960 --> 58:49.960
I mean, look, we all like arrive at like the realization that it's not going to work out at our own pace.

58:49.960 --> 58:50.960
You know what I mean?

58:50.960 --> 58:52.960
So I'm not trying to rush you there.

58:52.960 --> 58:53.960
I'm just saying.

58:53.960 --> 58:56.960
But you do want going at the pace or on.

58:56.960 --> 58:57.960
And you think that path.

58:57.960 --> 59:00.960
Whenever you wait, whenever you get there, it doesn't matter to me.

59:00.960 --> 59:01.960
Wait, is that you feel okay?

59:01.960 --> 59:04.960
Not if, ever.

59:04.960 --> 59:08.960
It's awesome being on the podcast.

59:08.960 --> 59:13.960
Um.

59:13.960 --> 59:14.960
Plugs.

59:14.960 --> 59:15.960
Zach, what do you have going on?

59:15.960 --> 59:18.960
What do you want to point to people to for years?

59:18.960 --> 59:20.960
You can just follow me on Twitter.

59:20.960 --> 59:22.960
I mean, Zach, don't type that in.

59:22.960 --> 59:25.960
And you're going to find me and enjoy the ride.

59:25.960 --> 59:26.960
Yeah.

59:26.960 --> 59:29.960
It gets a little bit raggy at times.

59:29.960 --> 59:33.960
But you're going to be happy you're there and buckle up.

59:33.960 --> 59:35.960
Nice.

59:35.960 --> 59:36.960
Yeah.

59:36.960 --> 59:37.960
And I have fun, everybody.

59:37.960 --> 59:39.960
Have a really good happy holidays.

59:39.960 --> 59:43.960
You know, a lot of guests don't think about that kind of stuff.

59:43.960 --> 59:47.960
But I just hope that he would go through any other times in their life that you get through it.

59:47.960 --> 59:48.960
Okay.

59:48.960 --> 59:49.960
And I'm here for you.

59:49.960 --> 59:53.960
It's a little, it's kind of self-congratulations to be like a lot of guests.

59:53.960 --> 59:55.960
So do this thing that I think is positive.

59:55.960 --> 59:57.960
But I'm going to do it.

59:57.960 --> 59:58.960
He's right.

59:58.960 --> 01:00:03.960
I'm laying the groundwork sort of for the what the world we're in and the way I differ from it.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.960
You know, but I'm just trying to be nice.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.960
So if that's a that's a crime lock me up.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:08.960
Oh, okay.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.960
That's funny actually.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.960
Thanks.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.960
Johnny.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.960
Uh, I just want to congratulate Zach on such a nice little plug.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.960
A nice little plug at the end there about wishing everyone a happy holidays.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:22.960
Um, really.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.960
That was a really good job.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:25.960
Great thing.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:26.960
Really nice.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.960
And stuff like that inspires me to keep going and keeps spreading kindness to everybody.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.960
So really you're the biggest hero ever.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:32.960
Oh, I see.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.960
Thanks.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.960
Thank you for congratulating me in return.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.960
No, because it's this weird snake eating its own tip.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:38.960
You're welcome.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:39.960
It's all you.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:40.960
Yeah.

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:41.960
Congrats on that.

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:42.960
Thanks.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.960
All right.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.960
So in terms of my plugs, you can follow me on Instagram at Johnny V.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.960
Jail H and NYVI.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:50.960
Instagram.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:59.960
It's great.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.960
Is that it?

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.960
Yeah.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.960
That'll be it.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.960
Come here.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.960
You were saying that you might join the meta version.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:08.960
Yeah.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:09.960
I'm not quite there yet.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.960
So you can't follow me on the metaverse.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:15.960
But we're all sort of trending slowly marching towards there.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.960
Living in a completely virtual reality.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:21.960
But for now, you can follow me on TikTok.

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:22.960
Okay.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:23.960
Blu-mer.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.960
Is the name of the game?

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:26.960
Yeah.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:27.960
Go 90.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.960
Get bent.

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.960
Hell yeah.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.960
F. Yes.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:42.960
And you can follow me on Twitter at Jeff Boyardy on Instagram at Jeffrey James.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:49.960
And you can follow my writing on a sub stack that I'll probably set up between now and when this.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:50.960
So it comes out.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.960
Oh, what a sub stack.

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:53.960
You're going to do that.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:54.960
For real.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.960
Maybe.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.960
It's hard because it's like.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:01:59.960
I like word it, man.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:00.960
No, it has to be a constant practice.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.960
You have to put, you know, theoretical,

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.960
like notes that and put it into practice.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.960
You have to implement.

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.960
And I want to watch.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:11.960
Morning pages.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.960
Morning pages.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.960
And and warning pages.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.960
You know, sending people threatening notes here and there.

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:18.960
That's all right.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:19.960
So exactly.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:20.960
We know where I'm.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:21.960
You live.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.960
And we'll figure it up.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:23.960
Okay.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:24.960
That is.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:25.960
Great.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:26.960
All right.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:27.960
We need to have the button.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:47.960
That was a hit them original.

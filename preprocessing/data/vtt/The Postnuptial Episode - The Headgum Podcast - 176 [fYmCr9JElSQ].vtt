00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Last week with the debunker.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
We'll talk about it on the show, but I was not happy with that.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Not happy with the recording video.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
It was just a person.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
He didn't record the video.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
That's right.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
That's right.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Yeah.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Like and sort of here.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Thank you.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
So it's good.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Right?

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
There goes that monetization.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Who needs monetization when you have matters of the heart.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
So I'm sitting next to you and I can't really see it.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
What is this song?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
You guys don't remember this song?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
I remember this song.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Any think half Ellie Golding maybe?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Ellie Golding.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Anything could and did happen.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Because we never thought you would die the night.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Last week.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
You played that song just to say that.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
I love this song.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Right?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Yeah.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Here's the thing, right?

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
I mean, I don't know how y'all feel, but I knew Jake would do it.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I knew he would get hitched.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I knew that he would find his mate.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Hmm.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
What I didn't know was that at some point.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Blue and fell would follow suit.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Sorry.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Did you?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Did you not think a mirror would get married?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Or you didn't think it would find somebody.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
What was that?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
I can't hear you.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
So you've interrupted me with the music.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
So it's actually definitely fucking matters.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
It's harder than the heart.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
There you go.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
It's hard here myself.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
You have to stop playing.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
We literally just, definitely this episode will not play.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Certain regions, if you play that song.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
So you need to stop.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Last week.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Last week.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
That was unacceptable.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Also, so we talked with you for the entire hour.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
And then Jeff just said that we didn't record video at the end.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
The video was gone.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
It was gone, girl.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Who's ultimately someone's calling you now?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
He's calling you.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
See.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Did you know California?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Should we start this episode over?

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Are you kidding me? It's been good.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I forgot it.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Nine songs in the call.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
You're just married.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Oh, man.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Had no visuals.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah, congrats man.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Last week.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
We did the pre enough show episode.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
We drafted an agreement between you and obviously tall.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Was it legally binding?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
It.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
I got it.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
No surprise.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
We're in a fucking idea.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
You guys have questions about our financials or assets.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
How we plan to divide the wealth.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Casey was on that episode.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Do you want to speak to anyone?

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Actually, it's important to have those conversations.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
But I'm not on top.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
But did you have them before?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
I had, yes.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Of course, I had them before without Jeffrey in the room.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
So the guiding.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
The conversation.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Was it not arrived?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
We didn't.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
We didn't have to do anything.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
No to rise.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
No.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
We just had.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
So thank God that Jeff went to a notary.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Forced the signatures.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Got it.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Notarized.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Wow.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
You know an odory.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
I know an odory.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
And I know an odory.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Private.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Wow.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
So it's like flying private.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
But forget it.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
No to rise.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
I was thinking about becoming an odory.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
It's like a mobile that.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Yeah.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Getting the stamp.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Yeah.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
But I do think you could make a decent amount of money for becoming an odory.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
But I do think you could make a decent amount of money.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
No.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
You guys.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
You're hungry.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Because sounds after the wedding.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Sounded.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
You hung over, man.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
It's been days.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
So yeah.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Yeah.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
That's cool.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
And you think it happened.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
And you think it happened.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
People like to say that headgums are just friendly.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
But then you have Marie-Colette.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Like chastising me, slapped me on the wrist with a ruler.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Anytime I use what?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Copyrighted music.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Yeah.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Yeah.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
When was the last time?

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
All of us were in a room to pod together.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I don't know if we have ever had never.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Never.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
This.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
That's right.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Because it was on Zoom.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
We had you guys zooming in.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
The last time it was everybody.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
This is the core six.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
The core.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
No, you're not.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
You don't.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Don't say I'm sorry.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Because I know you're not.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
So I'd rather you just interrupt and just fucking talk about it.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Rather than me.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Sorry.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
I'm sorry.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
You don't.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
You don't mean it.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
You don't mean it.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Don't.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
I get back.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
I don't want you to say.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
I don't want you to say I'm sorry.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I want you to go back.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
You're not.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
No.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
You're not.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
Because that could hard for you.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
You're not nice.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
You love being a blooles flying over dine.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
You lied.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
I'm not stupid.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
That's what I did.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Sorry, nothing to do.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
You don't mean it.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Kindly worse it that I take a chance.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I thought we all had a good time at the wedding.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
I feel like, a mirror is having regrets.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I think that's what's happening right now.

05:12.000 --> 05:12.840
I don't know about the weather.

05:12.840 --> 05:13.680
I don't know about the weather.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.320
But in episode end, the weathering and the

05:15.320 --> 05:17.440
up patrols, like there's a lot of moving pieces,

05:17.440 --> 05:19.160
but this is somehow gun worse.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.160
And it's just like we let the hell.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.640
Yeah.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.760
Can you imagine Jeff as a wedding planner?

05:25.760 --> 05:28.200
Well, no, because you were a tank top to amuse with it.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.040
Yeah.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.040
Yeah.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.360
Oh, it was a moment.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.800
So all the heck of people were at one table, except Jake.

05:34.800 --> 05:38.600
And, um, they were at a separate New York table.

05:38.600 --> 05:39.720
That's whatever.

05:39.720 --> 05:40.080
Yeah.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.440
These pieces pile with the table.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.800
He's from New York.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.800
My shirt isn't fitting me, right?

05:45.800 --> 05:46.800
I don't know.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.480
I feel like I would underdress for this.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.800
And then Marty was wearing a polo.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.720
And I said, oh, at least you didn't wear a fucking polo,

05:51.720 --> 05:53.360
like Marty and Marty all the time.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.600
He goes, Jeff, we're a fucking tank top.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.960
Why are you nobody talking about that?

05:58.960 --> 06:00.120
What do you mean, I wore a polo?

06:00.120 --> 06:04.160
Jeff is in a fucking white and he was sitting on his shit.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.040
He got a first three and a half hours.

06:06.040 --> 06:07.040
He was doing.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.680
He was waiting for the opportunity to be called out.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.000
What was that?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.320
Are you wearing that tank top for me?

06:12.320 --> 06:13.440
You said the word of the day.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.240
I think you said opportunity maybe, different tank.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.600
Yeah, you can hit the E.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.320
Also, Jake, you've been on the show for like a minute,

06:20.320 --> 06:21.520
because of the paternity thing.

06:21.520 --> 06:22.520
That wasn't the only reason.

06:22.520 --> 06:23.840
But yeah.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.400
Back me up, man.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.760
I, I, I, I.

06:28.760 --> 06:30.000
Going to be behind the desk.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.040
I feel honestly traps.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.000
You know what I mean?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.400
Need to be honest.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.400
Um, we've already gotten into it a little bit,

06:37.400 --> 06:37.840
but let's talk.

06:37.840 --> 06:38.800
We were all at the wedding.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.600
That's why we're all here.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.480
And this is the post-nupcial episode.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.000
We're going to get to all everything

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
that happens with the wedding.

06:46.000 --> 06:46.520
That's absolutely not cool.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.560
This one's like after the Riley, I think it was exactly right.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.720
When you were like, oh, being married doesn't give you authority.

06:51.720 --> 06:52.080
Right.

06:52.080 --> 06:52.960
Gases back in the desk.

06:52.960 --> 06:55.560
I'm about to take on his headgum, right?

06:55.560 --> 06:57.200
Single handedly.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.360
Yeah.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.160
I own a little bit more than a mirror.

07:00.160 --> 07:05.920
I've been able to, by back, stock from, oh, this is not square.

07:06.000 --> 07:06.920
USV.

07:06.920 --> 07:07.920
Gray, Mark Redfield.

07:07.920 --> 07:08.920
Yeah.

07:08.920 --> 07:09.920
Yeah.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.920
It was docked up private and dust.

07:12.920 --> 07:16.920
You're almost, you're always almost doxing.

07:16.920 --> 07:17.920
Yeah.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.920
That's true.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.920
Is that fair to say?

07:21.920 --> 07:24.920
Please believe me.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.920
Time might not even kidding.

07:26.920 --> 07:27.920
Please take that.

07:27.920 --> 07:28.920
No, you've been in.

07:28.920 --> 07:29.920
You might.

07:29.920 --> 07:30.920
You might.

07:30.920 --> 07:31.920
You do.

07:31.920 --> 07:32.920
You do.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.920
Like, I'm, I'm being your deadly serious.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.920
Now you're just scared for a week, basically.

07:37.920 --> 07:38.920
I'm 100%.

07:38.920 --> 07:39.920
Yeah.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.920
This is how, this is how **** shouldn't react.

07:41.920 --> 07:42.920
Yeah.

07:42.920 --> 07:43.920
That's a nice way to be like that.

07:43.920 --> 07:44.920
But seriously.

07:44.920 --> 07:45.920
I didn't cut that point.

07:45.920 --> 07:46.920
You could have shut down.

07:46.920 --> 07:47.920
Yeah, you have to cut that out.

07:47.920 --> 07:48.920
Please.

07:48.920 --> 07:53.920
I'm surprised that having, I'm surprised that having people get IRL mad at you a few times

07:53.920 --> 07:55.920
hasn't stopped the bit.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.920
I think it encourages it to carry on.

08:01.920 --> 08:02.920
I'm here.

08:02.920 --> 08:03.920
We've already touched on it a little bit.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.920
Let's hear a little bit more from you.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.920
The wedding.

08:07.920 --> 08:08.920
Right.

08:08.920 --> 08:09.920
If you remember.

08:09.920 --> 08:10.920
You got.

08:10.920 --> 08:11.920
You got.

08:11.920 --> 08:12.920
Turned.

08:12.920 --> 08:13.920
I've never.

08:13.920 --> 08:14.920
I've never seen you on a show.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.920
You were asking me if I wanted a bump of coke.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.920
It was during the ceremony.

08:18.920 --> 08:19.920
Yeah.

08:19.920 --> 08:20.920
I was like, three, thirteen pieces.

08:20.920 --> 08:21.920
Really.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.920
I think you were also like a good amount of rows ahead of us.

08:24.920 --> 08:25.920
So it's like, Marie could got up.

08:25.920 --> 08:26.920
Went down the aisle.

08:26.920 --> 08:27.920
We hold her to you.

08:27.920 --> 08:28.920
Yeah.

08:28.920 --> 08:29.920
Why would she want it?

08:29.920 --> 08:31.920
Down the aisle with the flower girl.

08:31.920 --> 08:32.920
Swat in the basket.

08:32.920 --> 08:33.420
Yeah.

08:33.420 --> 08:36.420
Turned to me the window over a mirror's great.

08:36.420 --> 08:37.420
It was like, do you want a bump?

08:37.420 --> 08:38.420
Yes.

08:38.420 --> 08:39.420
It's great.

08:39.420 --> 08:42.420
We sat on my dad and we didn't see it.

08:42.420 --> 08:44.420
It was insane.

08:44.420 --> 08:45.420
Yeah.

08:45.420 --> 08:47.420
Well, you know, I thought it'd spice it up.

08:47.420 --> 08:48.420
And you did it.

08:48.420 --> 08:50.420
Oh, well, you know.

08:50.420 --> 08:53.420
I appreciate the.

08:53.420 --> 08:54.420
Joccularity.

08:54.420 --> 08:58.420
But let's really let this be sort of a documentarian.

08:58.420 --> 09:00.420
Everyone was having a good shot.

09:00.420 --> 09:01.420
I know.

09:01.420 --> 09:03.420
It's not really well made of child.

09:03.420 --> 09:04.420
I should.

09:04.420 --> 09:05.420
We should.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.420
Yeah.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.420
I like that.

09:07.420 --> 09:09.420
We would have been waiting to talk about for days.

09:09.420 --> 09:12.420
I say before, but that make it through your old.

09:12.420 --> 09:13.420
Yeah.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.420
How?

09:14.420 --> 09:15.420
Why?

09:15.420 --> 09:16.420
Let's go in sequence.

09:16.420 --> 09:17.420
Yeah.

09:17.420 --> 09:19.420
It was sort of a welcome dinner at Edenville.

09:19.420 --> 09:20.420
Let's go to say it now.

09:20.420 --> 09:22.420
We can say everything that happened because it's in the past.

09:22.420 --> 09:24.420
Yeah, but also you have been saying where the wedding was.

09:24.420 --> 09:26.420
So if you want to talk about high stakes doxing,

09:26.420 --> 09:29.420
you'll have to have a chance to the wedding venue.

09:29.420 --> 09:30.420
Yeah.

09:30.420 --> 09:31.420
That was a big deal.

09:31.420 --> 09:32.420
Yeah.

09:32.420 --> 09:33.420
That was a big deal.

09:33.420 --> 09:34.420
Yeah.

09:34.420 --> 09:35.420
That was a big deal.

09:35.420 --> 09:36.420
Yeah.

09:36.420 --> 09:38.420
What was your blood work like last year?

09:38.420 --> 09:39.420
What?

09:39.420 --> 09:41.420
You didn't deal.

09:41.420 --> 09:43.420
We showed up.

09:43.420 --> 09:45.420
I would say Riley's hair looks the best.

09:45.420 --> 09:47.420
I would say Jix looks.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.420
You know her today.

09:48.420 --> 09:50.420
Oh, I didn't know.

09:50.420 --> 09:51.420
Yeah.

09:51.420 --> 09:53.420
Riley's hair was a fake topic.

09:53.420 --> 09:54.420
You have to think that was good.

09:54.420 --> 09:55.420
Really?

09:55.420 --> 09:56.420
That was.

09:56.420 --> 09:58.420
It really was like Riley's hair.

09:58.420 --> 09:59.420
I heard her.

09:59.420 --> 10:01.420
I felt her hair is wedding.

10:01.420 --> 10:02.420
Marjade's baby.

10:02.420 --> 10:03.420
Marjade's birthday.

10:03.420 --> 10:04.420
Right.

10:04.420 --> 10:07.420
I'm happy to be with her.

10:07.420 --> 10:09.420
We were in a circle.

10:09.420 --> 10:10.420
We were hanging out catching up.

10:10.420 --> 10:14.420
And then there's a little three-year-old child who I believe is the daughter of

10:14.420 --> 10:15.420
of a mayor and obitel's friends.

10:15.420 --> 10:18.420
She was running around and she was like going up to the group and just being like,

10:18.420 --> 10:19.420
Boo!

10:19.420 --> 10:20.420
Oh yeah.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.420
She was trying to scare.

10:21.420 --> 10:22.420
She was just kind of screaming and pulling.

10:22.420 --> 10:23.420
It was very sweet.

10:23.420 --> 10:24.420
We were all pretending to be scared.

10:24.420 --> 10:25.420
Yeah.

10:25.420 --> 10:26.420
I think that's the trick.

10:26.420 --> 10:27.420
She did a lot.

10:27.420 --> 10:29.420
And then Pile was screaming.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.420
She was like, ah!

10:30.420 --> 10:31.420
And Pile like leaned down.

10:31.420 --> 10:32.420
And he was like, ah!

10:32.420 --> 10:33.420
And they were kind of going out for a bit.

10:33.420 --> 10:36.420
And then I guess Pile took it up one notch too far.

10:36.420 --> 10:38.420
And it zeroed his 60's.

10:38.420 --> 10:39.420
She was just like, ah!

10:39.420 --> 10:41.420
She was like, run away.

10:41.420 --> 10:43.420
That first we're like, is she laughing?

10:43.420 --> 10:45.420
And then you just hear muffled.

10:45.420 --> 10:47.420
Oh my God.

10:47.420 --> 10:49.420
I'm like, Pile, you made that girl cry.

10:49.420 --> 10:51.420
And he's like, no, I didn't.

10:51.420 --> 10:55.420
I didn't see this within you.

10:55.420 --> 10:57.420
From across the bar.

10:57.420 --> 11:00.420
I just look up and I see this girl in her parents' arms.

11:00.420 --> 11:03.420
And she's like, where are we going?

11:03.420 --> 11:04.420
She's pointing it up.

11:04.420 --> 11:05.420
I'm like, that's it.

11:05.420 --> 11:06.420
That's it.

11:06.420 --> 11:07.420
That's it.

11:07.420 --> 11:08.420
That's it.

11:08.420 --> 11:09.420
That's it.

11:09.420 --> 11:14.420
It was crazy though because I would say they were pretty evenly matched in terms of height.

11:14.420 --> 11:15.420
No.

11:15.420 --> 11:16.420
Oh my God.

11:16.420 --> 11:17.420
Oh my God.

11:17.420 --> 11:18.420
Oh my God.

11:18.420 --> 11:19.420
Oh my God.

11:19.420 --> 11:20.420
No.

11:20.420 --> 11:21.420
They're pretty.

11:21.420 --> 11:22.420
They're pretty.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.420
They're pretty.

11:23.420 --> 11:24.420
That's what we did in the episode, by the way.

11:24.420 --> 11:25.420
Headphones next to you.

11:25.420 --> 11:26.420
Yeah.

11:26.420 --> 11:27.420
I can hear everything.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.420
Yeah.

11:28.420 --> 11:29.420
Yeah.

11:29.420 --> 11:31.420
Still too loud somehow.

11:31.420 --> 11:32.420
Yeah.

11:32.420 --> 11:35.420
Evenly matched in terms of like the energy they were putting forth.

11:35.420 --> 11:36.420
Yeah.

11:36.420 --> 11:38.420
Like it was very much like the screams.

11:38.420 --> 11:39.420
They were emitting were the same.

11:39.420 --> 11:40.420
Right.

11:40.420 --> 11:41.420
And she was crying.

11:41.420 --> 11:43.420
She had the last scream.

11:43.420 --> 11:44.420
Yeah.

11:44.420 --> 11:46.420
And then ultimately ran away to turn sobbing.

11:46.420 --> 11:47.420
Yeah.

11:47.420 --> 11:50.420
But Pile maybe should have been the bigger man because he's 40 and she was three.

11:50.420 --> 11:51.420
Totally.

11:51.420 --> 11:52.420
Yeah.

11:53.420 --> 11:54.420
He didn't do anything differently.

11:54.420 --> 11:55.420
No.

11:55.420 --> 11:56.420
But you have to.

11:56.420 --> 11:59.420
You do have to think that that girl was doing the boo screaming thing at everyone.

11:59.420 --> 12:00.420
Yeah.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.420
Everyone gave it back.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.420
And she was laughing with everyone.

12:03.420 --> 12:04.420
Yeah.

12:04.420 --> 12:05.420
One guy took it too far.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.420
This is what I want to talk about.

12:06.420 --> 12:07.420
No.

12:07.420 --> 12:08.420
I think she wanted to come in.

12:08.420 --> 12:09.420
I'm on his side.

12:09.420 --> 12:10.420
Wow.

12:10.420 --> 12:12.420
She needed to know and to stop the bit.

12:12.420 --> 12:14.420
And it was like five minutes before.

12:14.420 --> 12:16.420
Maybe that was maybe like Pile screaming at her.

12:16.420 --> 12:19.420
Made her kind of going to her own head and be like.

12:19.420 --> 12:20.420
Holy shit.

12:20.420 --> 12:21.420
Is this like my thing at the party?

12:22.420 --> 12:24.420
He's just so embarrassed.

12:24.420 --> 12:25.420
Yeah.

12:25.420 --> 12:26.420
She was screaming at everyone.

12:26.420 --> 12:28.420
That was just to have a shepherd spine.

12:28.420 --> 12:29.420
She'll out for now.

12:29.420 --> 12:30.420
Yeah.

12:30.420 --> 12:31.420
That was like Pile.

12:31.420 --> 12:32.420
Like we're looking for him.

12:32.420 --> 12:33.420
He's like, no, she's here.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.420
I see her.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.420
Yeah.

12:35.420 --> 12:36.420
Like it doesn't have to be weird.

12:36.420 --> 12:37.420
Yeah.

12:37.420 --> 12:39.420
I mean, they were kind of enemies for the night.

12:39.420 --> 12:40.420
Yeah.

12:40.420 --> 12:41.420
At the reception.

12:41.420 --> 12:42.420
I think she was walking past him.

12:42.420 --> 12:44.420
And she had a bump into a shoulder of purpose.

12:44.420 --> 12:45.420
And she was like.

12:45.420 --> 12:47.420
She can't walk by the way.

12:47.420 --> 12:48.420
Walk.

12:48.420 --> 12:49.420
What?

12:49.420 --> 12:50.420
How?

12:51.420 --> 12:54.420
Let's talk about the flat for your own joke.

12:54.420 --> 12:56.420
That's just transition music.

12:56.420 --> 12:57.420
Is it?

12:57.420 --> 12:59.420
It sounds of silence.

12:59.420 --> 13:01.420
Claps are music to your ears.

13:01.420 --> 13:02.420
People are plotting.

13:02.420 --> 13:04.420
Is it a music of your life?

13:04.420 --> 13:07.420
My favorite song is a staying out.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.420
Well, I'm having it out.

13:09.420 --> 13:13.420
We'll continue to talk about the wedding and sequence throughout the episode.

13:13.420 --> 13:17.420
But let's talk about how everyone has been feeling post-nubsuals.

13:17.420 --> 13:18.420
Let's start with Casey.

13:18.420 --> 13:20.420
We're going to continue talking about the wedding.

13:20.420 --> 13:21.420
Don't worry.

13:21.420 --> 13:22.420
We'll circle back to the wedding.

13:22.420 --> 13:25.420
Also, how is everyone feeling about the wedding?

13:25.420 --> 13:26.420
We had a talk about the wedding.

13:26.420 --> 13:28.420
Most of the talk about files.

13:28.420 --> 13:29.420
Yeah.

13:29.420 --> 13:31.420
Actually, we talked about the welcome dinner.

13:31.420 --> 13:32.420
That's over.

13:32.420 --> 13:33.420
Let's skip Sunday.

13:33.420 --> 13:34.420
We'll come back to it.

13:34.420 --> 13:35.420
Casey.

13:35.420 --> 13:36.420
Thank you.

13:36.420 --> 13:37.420
I feel pretty good.

13:37.420 --> 13:39.420
I shot the wedding on a VHS camera.

13:39.420 --> 13:42.420
And then I had to carry a battery pack in a pack pack.

13:42.420 --> 13:43.420
The entire day.

13:43.420 --> 13:45.420
You're back for yesterday.

13:45.420 --> 13:46.420
Yeah.

13:46.420 --> 13:49.420
I've been pretty stiff for a few days, but...

13:49.420 --> 13:50.420
You can't say that.

13:50.420 --> 13:51.420
You can't say that.

13:51.420 --> 13:54.420
You can't say that.

13:54.420 --> 13:55.420
Sorry.

13:55.420 --> 13:56.420
I'm dancing myself.

13:56.420 --> 13:57.420
Yeah.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.420
I've had a heart on for a week.

13:59.420 --> 14:00.420
You can't say that.

14:00.420 --> 14:03.420
The foot is all that tape.

14:03.420 --> 14:05.420
Yeah.

14:05.420 --> 14:07.420
It turned out really well.

14:07.420 --> 14:08.420
Yeah.

14:08.420 --> 14:10.420
We did say it looks like a real old school wedding video.

14:10.420 --> 14:11.420
What is it?

14:11.420 --> 14:13.420
A real old school.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.420
I love that you were getting interviews of people.

14:15.420 --> 14:16.420
Like...

14:16.420 --> 14:17.420
Like...

14:17.420 --> 14:19.420
Fuck you guys.

14:19.420 --> 14:20.420
Why are we quiet?

14:20.420 --> 14:21.420
I was just gonna be...

14:21.420 --> 14:22.420
I was talking.

14:22.420 --> 14:23.420
Yeah.

14:23.420 --> 14:25.420
I guess I'm just being interested in it.

14:25.420 --> 14:26.420
I used to...

14:26.420 --> 14:27.420
Yeah.

14:27.420 --> 14:28.420
Yeah.

14:28.420 --> 14:29.420
No.

14:29.420 --> 14:30.420
I love how you got like wedding confessionals.

14:30.420 --> 14:31.420
Testimonial.

14:31.420 --> 14:32.420
It ultimately Geoff multiple times.

14:32.420 --> 14:35.420
It was like my name is Geoff and I think Marie, because going to get the case.

14:35.420 --> 14:36.420
No.

14:36.420 --> 14:38.420
A little bit of a history of your wedding.

14:38.420 --> 14:39.420
Yeah.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.420
Just awesome.

14:40.420 --> 14:41.420
Casey, you crushed it.

14:41.420 --> 14:42.420
Yeah.

14:42.420 --> 14:43.420
Thank you.

14:43.420 --> 14:44.420
Well, you know, it's beautiful.

14:44.420 --> 14:47.420
I couldn't have done it without the talent of the people at the wedding.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.420
I think you could have because even your...

14:49.420 --> 14:52.420
You know, your landscape shots are incredible.

14:52.420 --> 14:53.420
Yeah.

14:53.420 --> 14:54.420
You didn't need us at all.

14:54.420 --> 15:00.420
And we should also say that multiple times during the night, all of us would look up from like...

15:00.420 --> 15:01.420
Yeah.

15:01.420 --> 15:02.420
The tables are whatever.

15:02.420 --> 15:05.420
And just see Casey in the distance through some bushes.

15:05.420 --> 15:06.420
Camerand hair.

15:06.420 --> 15:07.420
Yeah.

15:07.420 --> 15:10.420
I think it was obviously mom who planned the entire thing.

15:10.420 --> 15:13.420
And then you in terms of who worked the hardest for me.

15:13.420 --> 15:16.420
It did look like like if you didn't know...

15:16.420 --> 15:19.420
We had a running narrative that it's like you were just some guy who like...

15:19.420 --> 15:20.420
I felt like that.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.420
I felt like that because most of the people there didn't know who I was.

15:23.420 --> 15:26.420
Unscramble the beef on the headgun podcast.

15:26.420 --> 15:28.420
You figured out where it was.

15:28.420 --> 15:34.420
Anyway, that footage is now all behind our patreon patreon.com slash J.A.

15:34.420 --> 15:35.420
Check out the secrets.

15:35.420 --> 15:37.420
Check out the secrets.

15:37.420 --> 15:40.420
And you can go back to watch your speech at Jinks wedding.

15:40.420 --> 15:41.420
That's right.

15:41.420 --> 15:42.420
That is actually there.

15:42.420 --> 15:43.420
I don't get to Jinks wedding.

15:43.420 --> 15:44.420
Why?

15:44.420 --> 15:45.420
Why?

15:45.420 --> 15:46.420
This doesn't happen.

15:46.420 --> 15:54.420
I don't think we will because we're still at the rehearsal dinner and how we felt the day after.

15:54.420 --> 15:55.420
So you haven't even touched it.

15:55.420 --> 15:56.420
Here's what it.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.420
We're circling the wagon.

15:58.420 --> 15:59.420
All right.

15:59.420 --> 16:01.420
So let's say...

16:01.420 --> 16:02.420
Let's just...

16:02.420 --> 16:03.420
Let's just take Jinks wedding.

16:03.420 --> 16:06.420
Let's just go all the way back to beacon.

16:06.420 --> 16:07.420
Okay.

16:07.420 --> 16:09.420
How was everyone's laurel canyon?

16:09.420 --> 16:11.420
I mean, this is what he would say before the wedding.

16:12.420 --> 16:13.420
I thought the venue was amazing.

16:13.420 --> 16:14.420
The venue was cool.

16:14.420 --> 16:15.420
It was cool.

16:15.420 --> 16:17.420
It was cool venue.

16:17.420 --> 16:18.420
And we went to a wedding there.

16:18.420 --> 16:20.420
And so we experienced a wedding there.

16:20.420 --> 16:22.420
And much like you guys were like, this place is great.

16:22.420 --> 16:23.420
Sign us up.

16:23.420 --> 16:24.420
Yeah.

16:24.420 --> 16:25.420
And that's how we found our venue.

16:25.420 --> 16:26.420
Actually, that little girl.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.420
We've got about nine months.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.420
Wow.

16:29.420 --> 16:34.420
That little girl is the her parents are the wedding that we saw.

16:34.420 --> 16:35.420
Who do you mean?

16:35.420 --> 16:36.420
Who do you mean?

16:36.420 --> 16:38.420
She is who Dini's great, great, great piece.

16:38.420 --> 16:39.420
That's right.

16:39.420 --> 16:41.420
That's why she was like walking around punching people.

16:41.420 --> 16:42.420
Who will need something?

16:42.420 --> 16:43.420
Yeah.

16:43.420 --> 16:44.420
And that's why.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.420
Yes.

16:45.420 --> 16:47.420
That's why she was doing it.

16:47.420 --> 16:49.420
How was your laurel canyon?

16:49.420 --> 16:51.420
I mean, I've experienced it many times.

16:51.420 --> 16:53.420
So I just really want to hear from you guys.

16:53.420 --> 16:54.420
How did you love that street, right?

16:54.420 --> 16:57.420
Or like that whole area that was going to be free, right?

16:57.420 --> 16:58.420
I mean, you're going to take a first.

16:58.420 --> 16:59.420
It's the boulevard.

16:59.420 --> 17:01.420
You don't much traffic's on the bush.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.420
You know what street I like in Laurel Canyon?

17:03.420 --> 17:05.420
I like oak court.

17:05.420 --> 17:06.420
That's nice.

17:06.420 --> 17:08.420
That's still off Laurel Canyon, isn't it?

17:09.420 --> 17:12.420
Rightly left her phone.

17:12.420 --> 17:13.420
And...

17:13.420 --> 17:14.420
Or Uber.

17:14.420 --> 17:15.420
Yeah.

17:15.420 --> 17:17.420
Ultimately, when we arrived.

17:17.420 --> 17:18.420
I did.

17:18.420 --> 17:21.420
So I am recap, I took an Uber.

17:21.420 --> 17:23.420
We get to the venue.

17:23.420 --> 17:24.420
Where we get there.

17:24.420 --> 17:25.420
We see our friends.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.420
We go to the bar.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.420
We have a drink.

17:27.420 --> 17:29.420
We have a Bruce Sketta.

17:29.420 --> 17:30.420
And then I think, wow.

17:30.420 --> 17:31.420
How are the apps?

17:31.420 --> 17:32.420
I didn't get to experience that.

17:32.420 --> 17:33.420
You didn't have the ham challenge.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.420
You didn't have anything from the supermarket.

17:35.420 --> 17:37.420
The music was great.

17:37.420 --> 17:38.420
The light was gold.

17:38.420 --> 17:39.420
It was...

17:39.420 --> 17:40.420
It was Mary Archie Band.

17:40.420 --> 17:41.420
And then I think, wow.

17:41.420 --> 17:42.420
This is so beautiful.

17:42.420 --> 17:45.420
I want to take a photo on my phone or take a video.

17:45.420 --> 17:46.420
Like all my friends.

17:46.420 --> 17:48.420
And then I reach into my purse.

17:48.420 --> 17:49.420
Phone's nowhere to be found.

17:49.420 --> 17:50.420
Oh wow.

17:50.420 --> 17:52.420
So that's pretty far after the Uber has.

17:52.420 --> 17:53.420
Yes.

17:53.420 --> 17:54.420
We've been there for about 30 minutes.

17:54.420 --> 17:55.420
Yeah.

17:55.420 --> 17:56.420
Wow.

17:56.420 --> 17:57.420
Good.

17:57.420 --> 17:58.420
You're not even looking at your phone for 30 minutes.

17:58.420 --> 17:59.420
Yeah.

17:59.420 --> 18:00.420
I was like, wait a minute.

18:00.420 --> 18:02.420
I had tweeted four times by that.

18:02.420 --> 18:04.420
And then I'm like, fuck, fuck, fuck.

18:04.420 --> 18:06.420
So I'm looking at, like, I'm looking at all the tables where it might be.

18:06.420 --> 18:08.420
I look at the bar and nothing, nothing, nothing.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.420
And then Jeff was like, I asked Jeff, I'm like,

18:10.420 --> 18:14.420
Jeff was like, this is why I wish that we were sharing our locations with each other

18:14.420 --> 18:15.420
because then I could see your phone.

18:15.420 --> 18:18.420
And I'm like, okay, well, can I text Daniel from your phone?

18:18.420 --> 18:19.420
So he knows that.

18:19.420 --> 18:21.420
And I just, but I don't like the way that you,

18:21.420 --> 18:23.420
that's not the tone that I took.

18:23.420 --> 18:24.420
That is really what I did.

18:24.420 --> 18:25.420
I really wish.

18:25.420 --> 18:27.420
And like, and you're the barrier to entry.

18:27.420 --> 18:28.420
We just don't.

18:28.420 --> 18:29.420
We used to.

18:29.420 --> 18:31.420
And then you stopped it.

18:31.420 --> 18:32.420
Because I'm off the grid.

18:32.420 --> 18:33.420
That's right.

18:33.420 --> 18:34.420
So.

18:35.420 --> 18:38.420
So then I text Daniel into the page.

18:38.420 --> 18:45.420
And then I'm like, can you, because Daniel and I share each other's locations,

18:45.420 --> 18:47.420
like, can you look and see where my phone is?

18:47.420 --> 18:48.420
And in the meantime,

18:48.420 --> 18:50.420
Jeff and I, well, Jeff's like,

18:50.420 --> 18:52.420
you should have Daniel call your phone.

18:52.420 --> 18:55.420
So it's ringing in the live and we do that.

18:55.420 --> 18:57.420
And then it takes us maybe two times of day.

18:57.420 --> 18:59.420
You're calling it for me to be like, you know, Jeff,

18:59.420 --> 19:01.420
you could also call my phone.

19:02.420 --> 19:04.420
You also have my number.

19:04.420 --> 19:05.420
But then Daniel's screen shop.

19:05.420 --> 19:07.420
The phone says it's at the Houdini estate.

19:07.420 --> 19:08.420
Oh.

19:08.420 --> 19:09.420
And so we're like interesting.

19:09.420 --> 19:10.420
How did that happen?

19:10.420 --> 19:11.420
Uber driver dropped it off.

19:11.420 --> 19:12.420
Uber driver dropped it off.

19:12.420 --> 19:13.420
At security.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.420
And so multiple people.

19:15.420 --> 19:16.420
Multiple people.

19:16.420 --> 19:18.420
I've been like anyone lose their phone.

19:18.420 --> 19:19.420
And we just had it though.

19:19.420 --> 19:20.420
I hadn't seen it.

19:20.420 --> 19:21.420
So I went.

19:21.420 --> 19:22.420
I finally.

19:22.420 --> 19:23.420
I grabbed it.

19:23.420 --> 19:24.420
And then later.

19:24.420 --> 19:25.420
At the reception.

19:25.420 --> 19:28.420
We're chatting up with Billy Scuffiery.

19:28.420 --> 19:30.420
And I think like I had my phone.

19:30.420 --> 19:31.420
I was going to show him a picture of something.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.420
And then he sees my background.

19:32.420 --> 19:34.420
And he just like, he starts dying laughing.

19:34.420 --> 19:36.420
And he's like, that's your phone.

19:36.420 --> 19:37.420
Really?

19:37.420 --> 19:38.420
Yeah.

19:38.420 --> 19:41.420
And he's like, I've seen that phone a lot today.

19:41.420 --> 19:44.420
Everyone's coming up to him asking if he had lost him.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.420
I think it's just like he has to move on.

19:46.420 --> 19:47.420
We have to move on.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.420
We have to move on.

19:49.420 --> 19:50.420
We have to move on.

19:50.420 --> 19:52.420
I can have commercial burger.

19:52.420 --> 19:55.420
This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.

19:55.420 --> 19:58.420
Guys, sometimes you don't know what's good for you.

19:58.420 --> 20:02.420
You don't know what's going to feed your highest good kind of make you feel joy

20:02.420 --> 20:03.420
for like a better turn.

20:03.420 --> 20:05.420
Let alone getting wise.

20:05.420 --> 20:07.420
But you know, your brain is getting in the way.

20:07.420 --> 20:09.420
Like you know what you're supposed to do.

20:09.420 --> 20:11.420
But you just can't bring yourself to do it.

20:11.420 --> 20:14.420
And therapy helps you figure out what's holding you back.

20:14.420 --> 20:17.420
So that you can work for yourself instead of against yourself.

20:17.420 --> 20:18.420
Right?

20:18.420 --> 20:19.420
I'm in therapy every single week.

20:19.420 --> 20:20.420
Not this week.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.420
I've had to reschedule.

20:21.420 --> 20:26.420
But it really does help support my personal journey of getting to know myself better.

20:26.420 --> 20:27.420
Right?

20:27.420 --> 20:29.420
You know, what does feed me?

20:29.420 --> 20:31.420
What does support me?

20:31.420 --> 20:33.420
You know, maybe I should say no to one thing this weekend.

20:33.420 --> 20:35.420
So I can have some time to rest.

20:35.420 --> 20:39.420
Maybe I can do the opposite of that and make an effort to go see people that I've seen

20:39.420 --> 20:42.420
in a while or like, you know, hang out with people that I haven't seen in a while.

20:42.420 --> 20:43.420
Because that's going to feed me.

20:43.420 --> 20:47.420
That's going to re-reaffirm my identity of myself,

20:47.420 --> 20:48.420
etc.

20:48.420 --> 20:50.420
And I only know that about myself through therapy.

20:50.420 --> 20:54.420
Because I've been in it every week for the last four years,

20:54.420 --> 20:55.420
almost five.

20:56.420 --> 20:58.420
And I really can't recommend it enough.

20:58.420 --> 20:59.420
So if you're thinking of starting therapy,

20:59.420 --> 21:00.420
give better help a try.

21:00.420 --> 21:03.420

21:03.420 --> 21:04.420

21:07.420 --> 21:10.420

We just moved on.

22:42.420 --> 22:45.420
Jeff told Casey to say that.

22:45.420 --> 22:48.420
For how much money, like why did he do it so willing?

22:48.420 --> 22:52.420
Because he's a free plug for the F1 podcast.

22:52.420 --> 22:55.420
Or to the name of the podcast.

22:55.420 --> 22:57.420
Yeah, of course.

22:57.420 --> 23:01.420
But I didn't know it right until I said it.

23:01.420 --> 23:04.420
I was stalling right up until that point.

23:04.420 --> 23:05.420
Like a car.

23:05.420 --> 23:06.420
Yeah.

23:06.420 --> 23:07.420
That was a leap of faith.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.420
Turkey just kept going.

23:09.420 --> 23:13.420
Oh man, it feels like when you don't know someone's name is like,

23:13.420 --> 23:14.420
and we're back.

23:14.420 --> 23:16.420
We were on break.

23:16.420 --> 23:18.420
So we had, we, you brought us back.

23:18.420 --> 23:22.420
We're on break since we talked about pile making that kid cry.

23:22.420 --> 23:23.420
Cut everything.

23:23.420 --> 23:24.420
Yes.

23:24.420 --> 23:26.420
I mean, I just have some post-squiding questions.

23:26.420 --> 23:28.420
Then we'll get back into what we were just talking about.

23:28.420 --> 23:29.420
Right.

23:29.420 --> 23:31.420
We'll be talking, will you be taking,

23:31.420 --> 23:32.420
I'd be told last name.

23:32.420 --> 23:33.420
Maybe is that any more about that?

23:33.420 --> 23:35.420
Yeah, I won't be taking your last name.

23:35.420 --> 23:36.420
You don't want to be in my name.

23:36.420 --> 23:37.420
Honeymoon or no?

23:37.420 --> 23:38.420
If we do.

23:38.420 --> 23:39.420
It's my next question.

23:39.420 --> 23:40.420
A few months.

23:40.420 --> 23:41.420
Not any time soon.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.420
And where will you go?

23:42.420 --> 23:43.420
I don't know.

23:43.420 --> 23:44.420
Maybe a couple more.

23:44.420 --> 23:45.420
Maybe a couple more.

23:45.420 --> 23:46.420
Or maybe.

23:46.420 --> 23:47.420
What did you say?

23:47.420 --> 23:49.420
I said Lake Comon and Italian accent.

23:49.420 --> 23:50.420
I think you said something crazy.

23:50.420 --> 23:51.420
No, I didn't say anything.

23:51.420 --> 23:52.420
Really?

23:52.420 --> 23:53.420
Yep.

23:53.420 --> 23:54.420
So that'd be nice.

23:54.420 --> 23:55.420
Yeah.

23:55.420 --> 23:56.420
I couldn't really have been to before.

23:56.420 --> 23:58.420
You're still looking the summer.

23:58.420 --> 23:59.420
I'd be cool.

23:59.420 --> 24:00.420
Global warming though.

24:00.420 --> 24:03.420
So you might not want to go somewhere that's like super hot.

24:03.420 --> 24:05.420
Did you profit from the nut trolls at all?

24:05.420 --> 24:06.420
Excuse me?

24:06.420 --> 24:07.420
Did you?

24:07.420 --> 24:08.420
So.

24:08.420 --> 24:09.420
What did you say?

24:09.420 --> 24:10.420
I said to the problem.

24:10.420 --> 24:11.420
I'm sure you had to.

24:11.420 --> 24:13.420
Because I feel like the parents paid for the wedding.

24:13.420 --> 24:16.420
You're, you're wedding gift was kind of like a honey pot.

24:16.420 --> 24:18.420
Like help pay for our honeymoon.

24:18.420 --> 24:22.420
Like you just said you're not planning on taking anything anytime soon.

24:22.420 --> 24:23.420
Yeah.

24:23.420 --> 24:25.420
And you also did have sponsored content.

24:25.420 --> 24:26.420
Yeah.

24:26.420 --> 24:27.420
It was brand-out.

24:27.420 --> 24:28.420
Yeah.

24:28.420 --> 24:29.420
So you're.

24:29.420 --> 24:31.420
This was the cashment of your house.

24:31.420 --> 24:33.420
I probably made seven figures.

24:33.420 --> 24:34.420
Yeah.

24:34.420 --> 24:35.420
They saved it.

24:35.420 --> 24:36.420
Probably the richer you are.

24:36.420 --> 24:38.420
The more the poorer you look.

24:38.420 --> 24:39.420
Right.

24:39.420 --> 24:40.420
So like if you have like $5 million.

24:40.420 --> 24:41.420
Like we're a suit every day.

24:41.420 --> 24:44.420
If you have a billion dollars, you're wearing like a hoodie to a meeting.

24:44.420 --> 24:45.420
Right.

24:45.420 --> 24:47.420
And if you see how garbage a mirror is dressed today.

24:47.420 --> 24:49.420
It's like that looks like a rich guy.

24:49.420 --> 24:50.420
He doesn't have a shield.

24:50.420 --> 24:51.420
That's BD, you know what?

24:51.420 --> 24:52.420
Thank you.

24:52.420 --> 24:54.420
You look like one dress.

24:54.420 --> 24:56.420
Casey and I are broke.

24:56.420 --> 24:57.420
So.

24:57.420 --> 24:59.420
So does that mean that you got up like 30.

24:59.420 --> 25:00.420
Billions of dollars.

25:00.420 --> 25:01.420
It is dirty.

25:01.420 --> 25:02.420
No.

25:02.420 --> 25:03.420
I'm saying we look amazing.

25:03.420 --> 25:04.420
It's like.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.420
Is your shirt dirty on purpose?

25:06.420 --> 25:08.420
Or did you make it dirty and just not clean it?

25:08.420 --> 25:09.420
It's vintage.

25:09.420 --> 25:12.420
So that's those are grease stains baked in.

25:12.420 --> 25:15.420
That's even if that's a patina of a cloth.

25:15.420 --> 25:16.420
What's that?

25:16.420 --> 25:18.420
It's the cloth patina.

25:18.420 --> 25:19.420
So did he buy it?

25:19.420 --> 25:20.420
And it was dirty already.

25:20.420 --> 25:21.420
Yes, he bought it.

25:21.420 --> 25:23.420
The fabric itself is dirty.

25:23.420 --> 25:24.420
Yes.

25:24.420 --> 25:25.420
Or it's died to blow.

25:25.420 --> 25:29.420
In mechanic named Joe died in that shirt in 1996.

25:29.420 --> 25:34.420
And then Jeff paid $78 for it over on fig.

25:34.420 --> 25:35.420
I imagine.

25:35.420 --> 25:36.420
Right.

25:36.420 --> 25:37.420
Right.

25:37.420 --> 25:39.420
The website is very nice.

25:39.420 --> 25:40.420
The website.

25:40.420 --> 25:42.420
The website is fig.

25:42.420 --> 25:45.420
Figaro is the street where the dress stores.

25:45.420 --> 25:46.420
I'm here.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.420
Just focus on your fucking wedding.

25:48.420 --> 25:52.420
I wonder if that's a real grease stain or if they like actually make a fabric.

25:52.420 --> 25:53.420
Okay.

25:53.420 --> 25:55.420
Other than Marty and this can be a pull for the whole room.

25:55.420 --> 25:57.420
Other than Marty.

25:57.420 --> 26:00.420
Do you who do you wish hat wasn't invited?

26:00.420 --> 26:01.420
Wasn't invited.

26:01.420 --> 26:02.420
I didn't say I didn't wish.

26:02.420 --> 26:04.420
Marty wasn't invited.

26:04.420 --> 26:05.420
He didn't.

26:05.420 --> 26:06.420
He didn't.

26:07.420 --> 26:09.420
I already couldn't dance because he had a broken ankle or something.

26:09.420 --> 26:10.420
Yeah.

26:10.420 --> 26:11.420
Looks like he sprayed his foot.

26:11.420 --> 26:12.420
Yeah.

26:12.420 --> 26:16.420
But do you wish he was there holding up your chair?

26:16.420 --> 26:19.420
It would have been nice to have Marty holding up the chair.

26:19.420 --> 26:23.420
But ultimately we had enough able-bodied men to do the lifting.

26:23.420 --> 26:26.420
I was a little worried because people around me were getting hurt all day.

26:26.420 --> 26:27.420
Do you know what happened?

26:27.420 --> 26:28.420
What?

26:28.420 --> 26:30.420
Would you always know something that happened?

26:30.420 --> 26:33.420
I was in their holding up avi-tiles chair.

26:34.420 --> 26:38.420
Billy was to my right between me and over.

26:38.420 --> 26:40.420
We're lifting the chair.

26:40.420 --> 26:41.420
Yeah.

26:41.420 --> 26:44.420
And then I guess behind me it's your-you're about to go up.

26:44.420 --> 26:47.420
And you're yelling Billy Billy.

26:47.420 --> 26:50.420
And Billy holding avi-tile.

26:50.420 --> 26:51.420
Left.

26:51.420 --> 26:54.420
To go grab your chair.

26:54.420 --> 26:55.420
So avi-tile.

26:55.420 --> 26:56.420
Wow.

26:56.420 --> 26:57.420
Exactly right.

26:57.420 --> 26:59.420
Almost fucking come here.

27:00.420 --> 27:01.420
Yeah.

27:01.420 --> 27:02.420
Almost come crashing down.

27:02.420 --> 27:05.420
Because you called the strong man away from your wife.

27:05.420 --> 27:06.420
You're like a man.

27:06.420 --> 27:07.420
You're like a man.

27:07.420 --> 27:08.420
You're like a man.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.420
Billy Billy.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.420
Lesson 16.

27:11.420 --> 27:14.420
Six of the strongest dudes were currently on somebody else.

27:14.420 --> 27:16.420
So I'm like, I need at least one of those guys.

27:16.420 --> 27:17.420
Probably.

27:17.420 --> 27:18.420
So what that was mean?

27:18.420 --> 27:19.420
What was one of the strongest dudes?

27:19.420 --> 27:20.420
Yeah.

27:20.420 --> 27:21.420
Was you Billy?

27:21.420 --> 27:22.420
Nice.

27:22.420 --> 27:23.420
That was one.

27:23.420 --> 27:24.420
Oh for Jesse.

27:24.420 --> 27:25.420
My cousin was there at one point.

27:25.420 --> 27:26.420
Yeah.

27:26.420 --> 27:28.420
But we needed at least six per chair.

27:28.420 --> 27:29.420
We were running out of bodies fast.

27:29.420 --> 27:30.420
Yeah.

27:30.420 --> 27:32.420
I thought the chair hit the dance floor a little fast.

27:32.420 --> 27:34.420
But it's hard to just push the chair away.

27:34.420 --> 27:35.420
If it got there too early.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.420
When you were coming dance floor a little too fast.

27:37.420 --> 27:38.420
What's that?

27:38.420 --> 27:40.420
I think you hit the dance floor a little too fast.

27:40.420 --> 27:43.420
Oh, it was like our supposed to be like an entrance.

27:43.420 --> 27:45.420
And then the music starts right away.

27:45.420 --> 27:46.420
Yeah.

27:46.420 --> 27:47.420
It's his wedding.

27:47.420 --> 27:48.420
Yeah.

27:48.420 --> 27:49.420
That was fine.

27:49.420 --> 27:50.420
But there's like a certain flow.

27:50.420 --> 27:51.420
I thought the timing was going out.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.420
The horror is always just a great song.

27:53.420 --> 27:54.420
It goes on a little too long.

27:54.420 --> 27:57.420
But there's so many things that you forget about as it's happening.

27:57.420 --> 27:58.420
Oh, wait.

27:58.420 --> 27:59.420
No, I can't idea.

27:59.420 --> 28:01.420
We got to circle the circular dance.

28:01.420 --> 28:04.420
Oh, I forgot all of the guys are going to watch it.

28:04.420 --> 28:05.420
Yeah.

28:05.420 --> 28:06.420
Yeah.

28:06.420 --> 28:07.420
Hold hands and sort of dance around the bride.

28:07.420 --> 28:10.420
Hold legs and dance around the groom.

28:10.420 --> 28:12.420
Jump up and down like a jumping jack for some reason.

28:12.420 --> 28:14.420
Then there's the chairs.

28:14.420 --> 28:15.420
Yeah.

28:15.420 --> 28:16.420
The chairs are on.

28:16.420 --> 28:17.420
The chairs.

28:17.420 --> 28:20.420
I was at the thing because you're just doing like a jazzer size exercise.

28:20.420 --> 28:21.420
Yeah.

28:21.420 --> 28:22.420
And the sun is still up.

28:22.420 --> 28:23.420
Yeah.

28:23.420 --> 28:24.420
Sun was still out a little bit.

28:24.420 --> 28:27.420
I was saying I ended up being fitting because the whole vibe of the wedding was like,

28:27.420 --> 28:28.420
now you have fun.

28:28.420 --> 28:30.420
Now you don't.

28:30.420 --> 28:32.420
What wasn't the fun part?

28:32.420 --> 28:33.420
Yeah.

28:33.420 --> 28:34.420
You're not having fun.

28:34.420 --> 28:35.420
Yeah.

28:35.420 --> 28:36.420
Being seated at a table with Marty.

28:36.420 --> 28:37.420
Yeah.

28:37.420 --> 28:39.420
You know, I didn't appreciate that.

28:39.420 --> 28:40.420
Jesse, my buddy.

28:40.420 --> 28:43.420
He was like, Jeff and Marty have this like a love hate relationship.

28:43.420 --> 28:44.420
I know.

28:44.420 --> 28:46.420
He's like, you guys were arguing a lot during the wedding.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.420
He said at one point to Jeff.

28:48.420 --> 28:51.420
And by said, I mean, he exploded at Jeff.

28:51.420 --> 28:53.420
And this is unrelated to the shirt.

28:53.420 --> 28:54.420
This is a different explosion.

28:54.420 --> 28:55.420
So multiple explosions.

28:55.420 --> 28:59.420
We're like casually talking about like if we ever got married.

28:59.420 --> 29:00.420
But it would look like.

29:00.420 --> 29:01.420
Yeah.

29:01.420 --> 29:03.420
Because I definitely have this bit.

29:03.420 --> 29:04.420
It's not a bit.

29:04.420 --> 29:05.420
We're going to have a double wedding.

29:05.420 --> 29:06.420
We're going to get married at the same time.

29:06.420 --> 29:07.420
Right.

29:07.420 --> 29:08.420
Right.

29:08.420 --> 29:09.420
So each other.

29:09.420 --> 29:10.420
And it's all going to be happening.

29:10.420 --> 29:11.420
Like at the same time.

29:11.420 --> 29:12.420
It's not going to be like a double.

29:12.420 --> 29:13.420
It's not going to be like a double.

29:13.420 --> 29:14.420
It's not going to be like a double.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.420
It's not going to be like a double.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.420
Double letting anyway.

29:16.420 --> 29:17.420
We're talking about that.

29:17.420 --> 29:19.420
And then Marty just.

29:20.420 --> 29:22.420
Robs and Johnny.

29:22.420 --> 29:24.420
If you have a wedding.

29:24.420 --> 29:26.420
That's not in Los Angeles.

29:26.420 --> 29:28.420
I am not fucking coming.

29:28.420 --> 29:31.420
I was like, no.

29:31.420 --> 29:32.420
I was like, no.

29:32.420 --> 29:33.420
I was like, no.

29:33.420 --> 29:34.420
I was like, no.

29:34.420 --> 29:35.420
I was like, no.

29:35.420 --> 29:36.420
I was like, no.

29:36.420 --> 29:37.420
I was like, no.

29:37.420 --> 29:39.420
I'm not fucking coming.

29:39.420 --> 29:40.420
He wasn't in LA for this wedding too.

29:40.420 --> 29:42.420
So he didn't have to be angry.

29:42.420 --> 29:43.420
He didn't have to be angry.

29:43.420 --> 29:45.420
Is it slept though with the boo?

29:45.420 --> 29:46.420
Yeah.

29:46.420 --> 29:49.420
I mean, you know, the thing that led up to it was Jeff being like,

29:49.420 --> 29:50.420
if I have a wedding.

29:50.420 --> 29:53.420
I'm not spending time on Marty.

29:53.420 --> 29:56.420
Like I'm saying, thanks for coming and then walking away.

29:56.420 --> 29:57.420
So it was.

29:57.420 --> 29:58.420
You're organizing.

29:58.420 --> 30:03.420
I'm not only Marty was like, if you're wedding's not in Los Angeles,

30:03.420 --> 30:04.420
forget about it.

30:04.420 --> 30:05.420
That's not going to be there.

30:05.420 --> 30:06.420
That's a nice clock.

30:06.420 --> 30:07.420
Yeah.

30:07.420 --> 30:08.420
Yeah.

30:11.420 --> 30:12.420
An explosion.

30:12.420 --> 30:13.420
I saw it coming.

30:13.420 --> 30:14.420
I can see it coming.

30:15.420 --> 30:17.420
Where did you say you wanted to get married?

30:17.420 --> 30:18.420
He didn't.

30:18.420 --> 30:20.420
I didn't even make it.

30:20.420 --> 30:23.420
It doesn't feel like you would have a destination wedding.

30:23.420 --> 30:24.420
It's like a big search.

30:24.420 --> 30:25.420
It's a little bit great.

30:25.420 --> 30:26.420
Yeah.

30:26.420 --> 30:27.420
A deep jins wedding.

30:27.420 --> 30:30.420
I wouldn't do it at the Houdini.

30:30.420 --> 30:32.420
I would do it at the Houdini as well.

30:32.420 --> 30:33.420
Oh, would you just because it mirrored it?

30:33.420 --> 30:35.420
Is there you already did have this?

30:35.420 --> 30:36.420
Yes.

30:36.420 --> 30:38.420
I might do mine at the roundhouse.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.420
I mean, I wouldn't do that either.

30:40.420 --> 30:41.420
Just see.

30:41.420 --> 30:42.420
Seems weird.

30:42.420 --> 30:43.420
Yeah.

30:44.420 --> 30:46.420
To do it where your boss had that.

30:47.420 --> 30:49.420
Did welcome dinner at the roundhouse.

30:49.420 --> 30:50.420
That was Sarah.

30:50.420 --> 30:51.420
Yeah.

30:51.420 --> 30:54.420
Would it be weird if any of us had our weddings at the Houdini mansion.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.420
Now that you have already kind of like laid your claim to it.

30:57.420 --> 31:00.420
I think now that I did it, you guys can sort of do whatever you want.

31:00.420 --> 31:02.420
It would be weird if it was that.

31:02.420 --> 31:03.420
Yeah.

31:03.420 --> 31:04.420
It'd be weird if we did it before you.

31:04.420 --> 31:06.420
I could be worse for you than for me.

31:06.420 --> 31:10.420
Like it wouldn't take anything away from my evening because my evening already happened.

31:10.420 --> 31:12.420
You'd be like, wow, it amir's wedding.

31:12.420 --> 31:13.420
This happened at this.

31:13.420 --> 31:16.420
You'd have to admit that you'd be a little less, you know,

31:16.420 --> 31:19.420
like joyful with their wedding because you've seen it all before.

31:19.420 --> 31:20.420
Yeah.

31:20.420 --> 31:23.420
Well, I think it would be like more relaxed and comfortable and enjoyable.

31:23.420 --> 31:27.420
Would it be weird if I copied literally everything that happened.

31:27.420 --> 31:29.420
Like if Robbie married her and Daniel, again,

31:29.420 --> 31:30.420
I think I would be honored.

31:30.420 --> 31:31.420
I don't know.

31:31.420 --> 31:32.420
It would be exciting to see that you.

31:32.420 --> 31:33.420
Same floor.

31:33.420 --> 31:34.420
My wedding.

31:34.420 --> 31:35.420
Same.

31:35.420 --> 31:36.420
Same.

31:36.420 --> 31:37.420
Same.

31:37.420 --> 31:38.420
Same.

31:38.420 --> 31:39.420
Same.

31:39.420 --> 31:39.920
Same guests.

31:40.920 --> 31:41.920
So my camera.

31:41.920 --> 31:42.920
Right.

31:42.920 --> 31:43.920
Yeah.

31:43.920 --> 31:44.920
There's everything.

31:44.920 --> 31:45.920
Same.

31:45.920 --> 31:47.920
I'm wearing her dress.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.920
And wearing a double wedding.

31:49.920 --> 31:50.920
Yeah.

31:50.920 --> 31:51.920
All right.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.920
If you wore her dress, that would really be out.

31:54.920 --> 31:55.920
That would be out.

31:55.920 --> 31:56.920
That would be out.

31:56.920 --> 31:57.920
That would be out.

31:57.920 --> 31:58.920
That would be out.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.920
That would be out.

32:00.920 --> 32:01.920
That would be out.

32:01.920 --> 32:02.920
I knew that we were doing this episode.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.920
So throughout the night I took notes.

32:04.920 --> 32:05.920
This is real.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.920
These are, there are extensive notes.

32:07.920 --> 32:08.920
Yeah.

32:08.920 --> 32:11.440
This is like, you'll see, so anti-social during the wedding.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.360
Yeah, you didn't really make an appointment right?

32:13.360 --> 32:14.800
Almost tabletopped, obviously.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.360
Tell us mom, did you guys do that?

32:16.360 --> 32:17.200
No.

32:17.200 --> 32:19.560
Yeah, I like leaned down on all fours, like right behind her,

32:19.560 --> 32:20.880
but nobody ended up pushing her.

32:20.880 --> 32:21.720
Yeah.

32:21.720 --> 32:24.160
Sorry, not almost as in, like, it was an accident.

32:24.160 --> 32:25.320
You tried.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.760
Yeah, it was a failed attempt.

32:26.760 --> 32:29.360
Well, I did hear someone was crawling behind her a lot,

32:29.360 --> 32:31.160
but I didn't know that would be a lot.

32:31.160 --> 32:32.960
Yeah, I didn't stop because everybody was like,

32:32.960 --> 32:34.760
are you trying to look up her address?

32:34.760 --> 32:36.280
And I was like, no, I'm trying to forget it.

32:36.280 --> 32:38.880
Guys, some guys are crawling around.

32:39.160 --> 32:41.280
Almost like a dog, like, creature.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.880
It was like a done for Leon.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.240
That's what I was talking about.

32:48.240 --> 32:51.480
So as we walk up, the stairs from like,

32:51.480 --> 32:54.120
where everybody got welcomed, there's the statue.

32:54.120 --> 32:57.280
And it's sort of like standing out with like a palm

32:57.280 --> 33:00.880
phasing down like over like a body.

33:00.880 --> 33:01.680
And it's supposed to be like,

33:01.680 --> 33:04.960
who do you need is like making someone levitate or something?

33:04.960 --> 33:06.600
And I walked past and I,

33:07.240 --> 33:10.080
Maria, I think pointed it out or something.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.040
And she was like, did you see that statue?

33:12.040 --> 33:13.840
And I was like, yeah, did you make it move?

33:13.840 --> 33:15.240
And she was like, what?

33:15.240 --> 33:18.240
And I was like, yeah, no, look, if you touch your palm

33:18.240 --> 33:20.760
to the statue, the body underneath it,

33:20.760 --> 33:22.360
like sort of like, swivels.

33:22.360 --> 33:23.960
And she's like, no, I didn't know that.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.240
And I was like, did you read anything about the demon's tape

33:26.240 --> 33:27.080
for get it?

33:27.080 --> 33:27.960
And I was like, and then she was like,

33:27.960 --> 33:29.960
oh, I'll do it on my way out or something like,

33:29.960 --> 33:34.960
five hours later, she got stabbed and she's like,

33:36.600 --> 33:39.960
and I was like, she's like, what is your risk?

33:39.960 --> 33:42.520
And then she looks up and I'm like, you're fucking me it.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.520
No, I'm like, I've done it.

33:44.520 --> 33:45.520
Yeah, I've done it.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.120
That was the only note that you took.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.760
Yeah.

33:51.760 --> 33:52.720
I'm very sorry.

33:52.720 --> 33:56.400
I wouldn't even call that a prank as much as I just call it a lie.

33:56.400 --> 33:57.240
Yeah.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.640
I get that.

33:59.840 --> 34:02.040
And it didn't look like a,

34:02.040 --> 34:03.680
I'm like a movable statue.

34:03.680 --> 34:04.920
Yeah, it really did.

34:04.920 --> 34:07.760
Yeah, I did.

34:07.760 --> 34:08.960
To Jeff's credit.

34:11.960 --> 34:12.960
Is that it?

34:12.960 --> 34:14.160
I wonder what that is.

34:14.160 --> 34:15.320
Yeah.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.720
He's trying to do something.

34:17.720 --> 34:19.040
Let's talk about what I'm, yeah.

34:19.040 --> 34:20.160
So what are we doing?

34:20.160 --> 34:21.960
Are we still, well, I was going to get them

34:21.960 --> 34:23.760
to talk you, so I don't know what they're doing.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.000
OK.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.040
Obviously, tell us, mom, who is singed for like five songs.

34:28.040 --> 34:28.840
Oh, how about?

34:28.840 --> 34:29.400
Yeah.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.360
Yeah, it was our 80s songs.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.960
Yeah, how do I get you alone?

34:33.040 --> 34:37.120
Wait, she was also singing along with me to Natasha

34:37.120 --> 34:38.680
betting fields on written.

34:38.680 --> 34:41.840
Oh, this is my, this is one of my favorite moments

34:41.840 --> 34:45.840
of the wedding is on the dance warp.

34:45.840 --> 34:48.440
We're listening to that.

34:48.440 --> 34:49.840
You were singing along Jake.

34:49.840 --> 34:53.400
Comes on to the dance warp towards the end of the song.

34:53.400 --> 34:54.240
Yeah.

34:54.240 --> 34:57.560
Transitions perfectly into some of you termed kind of life.

34:57.560 --> 34:59.960
And you lost your mind.

34:59.960 --> 35:00.960
Yeah, it was true.

35:00.960 --> 35:01.960
It was true.

35:01.960 --> 35:05.960
She screamed, yes, it's very jumping up and down.

35:05.960 --> 35:06.560
It's good.

35:06.560 --> 35:10.200
And I think you have it on camera, and it is so, so funny.

35:10.200 --> 35:12.200
Is that my favorite song?

35:12.200 --> 35:15.200
I think Billy or somebody was like, you summoned to this song.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.200
I mentioned that.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.760
Oh, like, you manifested this.

35:17.760 --> 35:18.600
Yeah, really dead.

35:18.600 --> 35:19.800
And it felt like I did.

35:19.800 --> 35:20.320
Yeah.

35:20.320 --> 35:22.520
So I walked on to the dance floor and they just knew my,

35:22.520 --> 35:25.760
they knew my entrance music.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.960
Yeah, it was great.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.640
The dancing was very solid.

35:28.640 --> 35:29.960
Yeah, the DJ was really good.

35:29.960 --> 35:30.960
Another recommendation.

35:30.960 --> 35:34.960
Although somebody who got married at the beginning started, do you remember what

35:34.960 --> 35:36.960
the first song was?

35:36.960 --> 35:40.960
Like, because it did start on a low note.

35:40.960 --> 35:44.960
Yeah, it was like really the first song.

35:44.960 --> 35:48.960
Yeah, it was like, it might be a little warm.

35:48.960 --> 35:49.960
It was.

35:49.960 --> 35:50.960
It was a pretty spear.

35:50.960 --> 35:51.960
Oh, toxic.

35:51.960 --> 35:52.960
Yes.

35:52.960 --> 35:55.960
And he started it with, it's Brittany Bleep.

35:55.960 --> 35:56.960
Oh, no.

35:57.960 --> 36:01.960
This night's going to be interesting.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.960
Drushed in 2011.

36:03.960 --> 36:06.960
Did he, who was Brittany Spear sang, Bleep?

36:06.960 --> 36:07.960
No, he didn't.

36:07.960 --> 36:08.960
It was Brittany Bleep.

36:08.960 --> 36:09.960
And he believed.

36:09.960 --> 36:10.960
He said, Bleep.

36:10.960 --> 36:11.960
He felt bad.

36:11.960 --> 36:12.960
Saying the B.

36:12.960 --> 36:13.960
Yeah.

36:13.960 --> 36:14.960
He should have felt bad.

36:14.960 --> 36:15.960
He would finally sing.

36:15.960 --> 36:16.960
And then again.

36:16.960 --> 36:17.960
And then the other.

36:17.960 --> 36:18.960
Okay.

36:18.960 --> 36:19.960
I don't think that the kick off.

36:19.960 --> 36:20.960
This is the last song.

36:20.960 --> 36:21.960
Last song.

36:21.960 --> 36:22.960
Yeah.

36:22.960 --> 36:23.960
It played zombie.

36:23.960 --> 36:24.960
It wasn't the last song.

36:24.960 --> 36:25.960
Yeah.

36:25.960 --> 36:26.960
It was also our idea, though.

36:26.960 --> 36:27.960
Oh, that was not what it was.

36:27.960 --> 36:28.960
It was the last song.

36:28.960 --> 36:29.960
It was zombie.

36:29.960 --> 36:30.960
And then we all sing along.

36:30.960 --> 36:31.960
And that.

36:31.960 --> 36:32.960
Living and delivering.

36:32.960 --> 36:33.960
Living and delivering.

36:33.960 --> 36:34.960
Right.

36:34.960 --> 36:35.960
So you want to end up living Levitah Loka?

36:35.960 --> 36:37.960
We didn't know whether to end on like zombie.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.960
Because I don't know people would sing along.

36:39.960 --> 36:40.960
Yeah.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.960
Because we wanted like a kind of morose single-long song.

36:42.960 --> 36:47.960
And then we also wanted to potentially end on a song that was more upbeat and exciting.

36:47.960 --> 36:48.960
Right.

36:48.960 --> 36:49.960
So I want to do zombies.

36:49.960 --> 36:50.960
And then live in Levitah Loka.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.960
But you know, you should have, you should have had, like,

36:53.960 --> 36:55.960
for him to fake out last song with zombies.

36:55.960 --> 36:56.960
You didn't tell them to do that.

36:56.960 --> 36:57.960
I think, yeah, we did.

36:57.960 --> 37:00.960
I think you guys should have had like some kind of signal.

37:00.960 --> 37:03.960
Like, hey, if zombie crushes as hard as I think it will.

37:03.960 --> 37:04.960
Yeah.

37:04.960 --> 37:05.960
Call it.

37:05.960 --> 37:06.960
I was actually skeptical.

37:06.960 --> 37:07.960
Because obviously, obviously, it told was the zombie one.

37:07.960 --> 37:08.960
And then we have to sing along.

37:08.960 --> 37:09.960
Zombie was incredible.

37:09.960 --> 37:14.960
I think the only one that beats zombie was everyone's screaming to awareness more

37:14.960 --> 37:15.960
set.

37:15.960 --> 37:16.960
Yeah.

37:16.960 --> 37:17.960
Everybody.

37:17.960 --> 37:18.960
Everybody's voice was so harsh.

37:18.960 --> 37:19.960
Because we're all screaming along.

37:19.960 --> 37:20.960
They loved it.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.960
We were even dancing.

37:23.960 --> 37:24.960
We weren't even dancing.

37:24.960 --> 37:26.960
It was just, it was a fantastic show.

37:26.960 --> 37:28.960
It was like, everyone's just stomping.

37:28.960 --> 37:29.960
Yeah, it's all music.

37:29.960 --> 37:30.960
Oh, yeah.

37:32.960 --> 37:33.960
Everybody loved it.

37:33.960 --> 37:34.960
Man, a lot of it.

37:34.960 --> 37:37.960
But then, so then, I feel like to leave it all on the floor with zombie.

37:37.960 --> 37:38.960
Like,

37:38.960 --> 37:39.960
zombie.

37:39.960 --> 37:40.960
It's just like,

37:40.960 --> 37:41.960
she's it.

37:41.960 --> 37:42.960
She's it.

37:42.960 --> 37:43.960
She's it.

37:43.960 --> 37:44.960
She's it.

37:44.960 --> 37:45.960
Like it.

37:45.960 --> 37:46.960
She's it.

37:46.960 --> 37:47.960
She's it.

37:47.960 --> 37:48.960
She's it.

37:48.960 --> 37:49.960
She's it.

37:49.960 --> 37:50.960
It's like it.

37:50.960 --> 37:51.960
It's just like it's it's like it's.

37:51.960 --> 37:52.960
You're surprised.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.960
It's it's the.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.960
It's the.

37:56.960 --> 37:57.960
It's the.

37:57.960 --> 37:58.960
I've got the.

37:58.960 --> 38:00.960
I've got the.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.960
I've got the.

38:02.960 --> 38:03.960
You've got to have the best.

38:03.960 --> 38:04.960
Help them dog around.

38:04.960 --> 38:05.960
I mean, it never.

38:05.960 --> 38:06.960
I'm a strategy.

38:06.960 --> 38:09.960
You're a lot next to two thousand three, right?

38:09.960 --> 38:10.960
Yeah.

38:10.960 --> 38:11.960
It was.

38:11.960 --> 38:12.960
It was like a huge dance party.

38:12.960 --> 38:13.960
That point.

38:13.960 --> 38:14.960
It was walking off.

38:14.960 --> 38:15.960
It was great.

38:15.960 --> 38:16.960
It liked.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.760
I think we could review it.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.840
So speaking of that tape, that's all right.

38:20.840 --> 38:21.680
You want this tape?

38:21.680 --> 38:22.680
We were all having fun with you.

38:22.680 --> 38:24.360
You want it to look to sketch.

38:24.360 --> 38:25.880
I just wanted to keep us on schedule

38:25.880 --> 38:27.280
because we're getting kind of out of order.

38:27.280 --> 38:30.000
We talked about the order as we talked about how

38:30.000 --> 38:31.480
Riley lost her phone.

38:31.480 --> 38:33.640
We talked about the other as food.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.400
We talked about how there was.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.600
That was sort of like, did we?

38:38.600 --> 38:41.120
The edge is sort of like scoping out,

38:41.120 --> 38:44.440
like, okay, who's the hottest at the wedding?

38:44.440 --> 38:48.760
I do think it was the guy in the brown plaid suit.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.560
Guy in the brown plaid suit.

38:51.560 --> 38:54.480
I think it was the guy in the blue suit

38:54.480 --> 38:55.480
with the pink shirt.

38:55.480 --> 38:56.680
Couture Montenegro.

38:56.680 --> 38:57.520
Yeah.

38:57.520 --> 38:59.680
I thought he was the most dressed, not hottest.

38:59.680 --> 39:01.360
That's the best dress, that's the best dress.

39:01.360 --> 39:02.200
Yeah.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.680
Who are they talking about?

39:03.680 --> 39:04.680
I don't know these people.

39:04.680 --> 39:06.320
Let's keep it moving because we're the best.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.320
And this is what you wanted to talk about.

39:08.320 --> 39:09.160
You want to.

39:09.160 --> 39:10.160
Let's talk about ceremony.

39:10.320 --> 39:11.160
Right.

39:13.160 --> 39:14.520
Luke walked on the aisle.

39:14.520 --> 39:15.320
That was a highlight.

39:15.320 --> 39:18.120
That was a, can you explain Luke's full name?

39:18.120 --> 39:21.200
Yeah, Lucas Jackson Ash.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.040
Right.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.240
So let's not be tall.

39:23.240 --> 39:24.160
First got Luke.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.080
She wanted to name him after a movie character.

39:26.080 --> 39:31.480
And Lucas Jackson was a right cool hand Luke's full name.

39:31.480 --> 39:33.560
Or Paul Newman's full name and cool hand Luke.

39:33.560 --> 39:34.400
Oh, okay.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.920
So it's Lucas Jackson and then her life.

39:35.920 --> 39:39.320
It was surprised in like the in the program to see

39:39.400 --> 39:41.680
Luke's Jackson Ash.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.280
I didn't realize he was such a gentleman.

39:43.280 --> 39:43.800
Yes.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.360
He was talking about his little talks on and everything.

39:46.360 --> 39:47.360
I got to take a look.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.480
And I was like staring at the program.

39:49.480 --> 39:50.800
I was talking about that.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.240
It was kind of difficult to get on there.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.240
But I think it worked out.

39:53.240 --> 39:53.600
Yeah.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.520
Difficult to get him there.

39:54.520 --> 39:55.440
He's like 10 pounds.

39:55.440 --> 39:58.400
I know, but just like the logistics of like he can't be

39:58.400 --> 39:59.240
coming from.

39:59.240 --> 40:00.240
He has to go somewhere else.

40:00.240 --> 40:02.000
He got to get a friend to bring up and not a friend

40:02.000 --> 40:02.640
from the wedding.

40:02.640 --> 40:03.680
He had a lot of awkward.

40:03.680 --> 40:04.120
It's kind of awkward.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.800
It's like, oh, you bring our dog.

40:05.800 --> 40:06.560
But he can't stand.

40:06.560 --> 40:07.080
Yeah.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.280
He had a cameo.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.520
But he wasn't a welcome.

40:09.520 --> 40:09.800
Yeah.

40:09.800 --> 40:10.520
Correct.

40:10.520 --> 40:13.320
Because he's like, we're doing cameo's for $10.

40:13.320 --> 40:13.520
Yeah.

40:17.520 --> 40:19.080
No, but yeah, we were, it doesn't matter.

40:19.080 --> 40:22.240
That we were staring at the moment of earnestness.

40:22.240 --> 40:23.240
The vows.

40:23.240 --> 40:23.440
Yeah.

40:23.440 --> 40:24.360
Sorry about the vows.

40:24.360 --> 40:25.920
Sure.

40:25.920 --> 40:28.600
Um, they moved me to tears.

40:28.600 --> 40:29.640
Say it's nice to hear.

40:29.640 --> 40:30.440
Yeah.

40:30.440 --> 40:31.040
Did you miss it?

40:31.040 --> 40:34.040
Which was honestly, honestly, it was, we talked pizza.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.280
I was obviously a thousand.

40:35.280 --> 40:35.800
I mean, you cry.

40:35.800 --> 40:36.480
Yes, yeah.

40:36.480 --> 40:38.240
I cried and pretty hard.

40:38.240 --> 40:39.240
It's during, obviously.

40:39.240 --> 40:41.240
Both Caesar and I think it was like this.

40:41.240 --> 40:42.240
Which part for you?

40:42.240 --> 40:43.240
Yeah.

40:43.240 --> 40:44.240
I think it was like, Andrew.

40:44.240 --> 40:45.240
When she started crying.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.240
Yeah.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.240
I think it was like, I broke them down.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.240
I was finding you in the dark.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.240
Oh, that.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.240
Yeah.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.240
The floodgate.

40:55.240 --> 40:58.240
I didn't know how much of it was a quote and how much she added to it.

40:58.240 --> 40:59.240
For sure.

40:59.240 --> 41:00.240
Yeah.

41:00.240 --> 41:01.240
We'll have to review.

41:01.240 --> 41:02.240
Actually, pull up the vows.

41:02.240 --> 41:06.240
Was the quote where you blind and I def, I'd still find you in the dark.

41:07.240 --> 41:09.240
Or was it everything she said?

41:09.240 --> 41:10.240
I don't know.

41:10.240 --> 41:12.240
You didn't even ask?

41:12.240 --> 41:13.240
He didn't care.

41:13.240 --> 41:14.240
My God.

41:14.240 --> 41:15.240
I didn't cry at him here.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.240
I did.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.240
I had already cried.

41:18.240 --> 41:19.240
I cried at him here as well.

41:19.240 --> 41:20.240
I cried at him.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.240
When you have someone who doesn't promote.

41:22.240 --> 41:23.240
Right.

41:23.240 --> 41:24.240
Yeah.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.240
Yeah.

41:25.240 --> 41:28.240
That's like when you started crying, that's when I like fully lost.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.240
I wasn't.

41:29.240 --> 41:31.240
I was laughing so hard.

41:31.240 --> 41:32.240
Yeah.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.240
I was.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.240
I was sitting next to Rose McIver.

41:35.240 --> 41:42.240
Who lived with Amir and I and like we always would talk about how much of an unimotive robot he was.

41:42.240 --> 41:43.240
Yeah.

41:43.240 --> 41:50.240
But if you're ever going to get emotional like I'm like hearing a beautiful speech about myself for five minutes.

41:50.240 --> 41:55.240
And then I have to say a speech myself and then my entire family friends are there.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.240
Yeah.

41:56.240 --> 41:58.240
That was the one thing that pushed me over the emotional.

41:58.240 --> 42:00.240
It wasn't even when you got emotional.

42:00.240 --> 42:04.240
It was just like you even saying any of the stuff that you said in your vows.

42:04.240 --> 42:07.240
Rose and I were just like holding each other's shoulders.

42:07.240 --> 42:08.240
It's amazing.

42:08.240 --> 42:11.240
I wasn't crying but I was just so surprised.

42:11.240 --> 42:14.240
I was like I was joyfully surprised.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.240
I was like I can't believe it.

42:15.240 --> 42:20.240
I was like every single person that we talked to after like Ben Rose,

42:20.240 --> 42:22.240
Billy, all of them were like.

42:22.240 --> 42:23.240
We're proud of him.

42:23.240 --> 42:24.240
Yeah.

42:24.240 --> 42:25.240
Yeah.

42:25.240 --> 42:26.240
We're happy.

42:26.240 --> 42:27.240
Yeah.

42:27.240 --> 42:28.240
I had to happen there.

42:28.240 --> 42:30.240
But then I tried to memorize it so it was like kind of nerve.

42:30.240 --> 42:32.240
Did you just tell a case in your aura?

42:32.240 --> 42:33.240
Yeah.

42:33.240 --> 42:34.240
He's like.

42:34.240 --> 42:35.240
He's like.

42:35.240 --> 42:36.240
You're up.

42:36.240 --> 42:37.240
He's caught a pretty.

42:37.240 --> 42:38.240
He's caught a pretty.

42:38.240 --> 42:39.240
He's caught a pretty.

42:39.240 --> 42:40.240
He's trying to help you.

42:40.240 --> 42:41.240
You're up.

42:41.240 --> 42:42.240
Part of your life.

42:42.240 --> 42:43.240
I thought I really liked.

42:43.240 --> 42:45.240
When Avi tells her it hurts.

42:45.240 --> 42:47.240
Like she had her notes with her.

42:47.240 --> 42:48.240
Of course.

42:48.240 --> 42:49.240
Big day.

42:49.240 --> 42:50.240
Like a lot of emotions.

42:50.240 --> 42:51.240
Of course.

42:51.240 --> 42:52.240
Like you.

42:52.240 --> 42:53.240
I would want to have a copy of my vows.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.240
And she goes well.

42:54.240 --> 42:55.240
I'm here.

42:55.240 --> 42:56.240
Did it stay to reading his cheating role.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.240
I'm going to all had hers just in case.

42:58.240 --> 42:59.240
And then I'm here.

42:59.240 --> 43:00.240
You've fully been working as well.

43:00.240 --> 43:01.240
I did say reading.

43:01.240 --> 43:02.240
Yeah.

43:02.240 --> 43:07.240
Here's something really sweet that I saw.

43:07.240 --> 43:09.240
After both of them did their vows.

43:09.240 --> 43:11.240
Which is this is not standard in a wedding.

43:11.240 --> 43:12.240
Like Avi told that her vows.

43:12.240 --> 43:14.240
She's like still crying a little bit.

43:14.240 --> 43:15.240
Everybody's like aw.

43:15.240 --> 43:19.240
And then you just like went around the microphone to give her a hug.

43:19.240 --> 43:20.240
That was just so sweet.

43:20.240 --> 43:21.240
It's so sweet.

43:21.240 --> 43:22.240
You did.

43:22.240 --> 43:25.240
I would say you did like three high fives.

43:25.240 --> 43:27.240
That was very funny.

43:27.240 --> 43:28.240
Yeah.

43:28.240 --> 43:30.240
And Robbie did really well or efficient.

43:30.240 --> 43:31.240
Yeah.

43:31.240 --> 43:33.240
And he's able to like also capture the serious.

43:33.240 --> 43:34.240
But also.

43:34.240 --> 43:35.240
Yeah.

43:35.240 --> 43:36.240
And he's great.

43:36.240 --> 43:37.240
Yeah.

43:37.240 --> 43:38.240
Yeah.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.240
There were jokes.

43:39.240 --> 43:40.240
There was levity.

43:40.240 --> 43:41.240
But there was also gravity.

43:41.240 --> 43:43.240
Are you trying to make us cry right now?

43:43.240 --> 43:44.240
Yeah.

43:44.240 --> 43:46.240
I'll try to update.

43:46.240 --> 43:47.240
Jeff started.

43:47.240 --> 43:50.240
I maybe you didn't start it at the wedding.

43:50.240 --> 43:53.240
But at least ten times during the night.

43:53.240 --> 43:56.240
You did a new type of laugh.

43:56.240 --> 43:59.240
Is that on purpose?

43:59.240 --> 44:00.240
No.

44:00.240 --> 44:04.240
I just need different laughs for the day.

44:04.240 --> 44:05.240
It would be like.

44:05.240 --> 44:06.240
He'd say a joke.

44:06.240 --> 44:08.240
That was like okay.

44:08.240 --> 44:10.240
And then immediately follow it with.

44:10.240 --> 44:11.240
Huh.

44:11.240 --> 44:15.240
Like he was doing the lab on purpose.

44:15.240 --> 44:16.240
Yeah.

44:16.240 --> 44:17.240
Earlier in the night.

44:17.240 --> 44:18.240
Because Jeff does a lot.

44:18.240 --> 44:20.240
Like he'll do a joke in the me like.

44:20.240 --> 44:21.240
But then he was like.

44:21.240 --> 44:22.240
Then we were joking.

44:22.240 --> 44:25.240
We're like what if you didn't even do like the.

44:25.240 --> 44:26.240
We were like.

44:26.240 --> 44:27.240
We were like.

44:27.240 --> 44:28.240
We were like.

44:28.240 --> 44:29.240
But then we were like.

44:29.240 --> 44:30.240
I don't know.

44:30.240 --> 44:31.240
I thought it was gonna fun.

44:31.240 --> 44:33.240
I thought it was gonna.

44:33.240 --> 44:34.240
I got a time.

44:34.240 --> 44:40.240
So we'll move past the ceremony.

44:40.240 --> 44:41.240
Dinner.

44:41.240 --> 44:43.240
We talked about the ceremony.

44:43.240 --> 44:46.240
Dinner was the last.

44:46.240 --> 44:48.240
It was the last.

44:48.240 --> 44:49.240
It was the last.

44:49.240 --> 44:50.240
It was the last.

44:50.240 --> 44:53.240
They needed to have juggle for it.

44:54.240 --> 44:55.240
Yeah.

44:55.240 --> 44:56.240
Okay.

44:56.240 --> 44:57.240
You're calling up tables one by one.

44:57.240 --> 44:59.240
And then there's still being so.

44:59.240 --> 45:00.240
Lacks a days ago.

45:00.240 --> 45:02.240
The pizza's not coming out fast.

45:02.240 --> 45:04.240
Because we're waiting to say this for days.

45:04.240 --> 45:05.240
I didn't even eat the pizza.

45:05.240 --> 45:06.240
Yeah.

45:06.240 --> 45:07.240
I don't even know how.

45:07.240 --> 45:08.240
You don't eat a lot of people.

45:08.240 --> 45:09.240
Or that's true.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.240
Did you guys have the pizza?

45:10.240 --> 45:11.240
I had pizza.

45:11.240 --> 45:12.240
I had pizza.

45:12.240 --> 45:13.240
I don't even know.

45:13.240 --> 45:14.240
That's salmon.

45:14.240 --> 45:15.240
That's salmon.

45:15.240 --> 45:16.240
That's salmon.

45:16.240 --> 45:17.240
All right.

45:17.240 --> 45:18.240
Ultimately.

45:18.240 --> 45:19.240
The.

45:19.240 --> 45:20.240
The.

45:20.240 --> 45:22.240
The.

45:22.240 --> 45:23.240
Yeah.

45:23.240 --> 45:24.240
Oh.

45:24.240 --> 45:25.240
Yeah.

45:25.240 --> 45:26.240
I thought we were.

45:26.240 --> 45:27.240
I was.

45:27.240 --> 45:28.240
I was.

45:28.240 --> 45:30.240
I was.

45:30.240 --> 45:31.240
I was.

45:31.240 --> 45:32.240
I was.

45:32.240 --> 45:33.240
Uh.

45:33.240 --> 45:34.240
We were.

45:34.240 --> 45:36.240
We were called up in the.

45:36.240 --> 45:37.240
Everyone else.

45:37.240 --> 45:38.240
Yes.

45:38.240 --> 45:39.240
That was tough.

45:39.240 --> 45:40.240
That was tough to hear.

45:40.240 --> 45:41.240
At least for.

45:41.240 --> 45:43.240
It was like the older people first.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.240
Then the most likely to complain.

45:44.240 --> 45:45.240
And then it's like sure.

45:45.240 --> 45:46.240
Everybody else.

45:46.240 --> 45:47.240
It's the first and last name.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.240
Who do you think is most likely to complain at the wedding?

45:49.240 --> 45:51.240
I was parents friends for sure.

45:51.240 --> 45:52.240
It's RIPCAB Luminville.

45:52.240 --> 45:55.240
Anybody's under 50, can just fuck in fend for themselves, totally.

45:55.240 --> 45:57.240
It's the order of authority.

45:57.240 --> 45:58.240
I have a question about.

45:58.240 --> 46:01.240
No one was checking what table you are at when you went to get the food.

46:01.240 --> 46:02.240
I went through the.

46:02.240 --> 46:16.240
The buffet line three or four times before my table was called.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.080
because they felt too bad.

46:17.080 --> 46:18.840
At one point, they did cut you off, and you said,

46:18.840 --> 46:20.280
you can't legally do that.

46:20.280 --> 46:21.120
I know.

46:21.120 --> 46:23.200
And I write a little steal this beat.

46:23.200 --> 46:24.200
Oh, no.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.200
No.

46:25.200 --> 46:26.200
Beat down.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.200
Beat down.

46:27.200 --> 46:28.200
Beat down.

46:28.200 --> 46:31.400
If you have a question about the table orders,

46:31.400 --> 46:35.840
because we were set, I would say, way too close

46:35.840 --> 46:37.800
to where you were supposed to be sitting.

46:37.800 --> 46:39.200
Or I was supposed to be sitting.

46:39.200 --> 46:40.960
Yes, but you never sat down.

46:40.960 --> 46:42.360
Never sat down because it's weird.

46:42.360 --> 46:43.920
You got a table by yourself.

46:43.920 --> 46:44.800
I'm not just going to sit down.

46:44.800 --> 46:45.640
You got a sweet towel.

46:45.640 --> 46:46.640
Yeah.

46:46.640 --> 46:47.640
It's like that.

46:47.640 --> 46:49.760
Hadgum table is in front of the sweet heart table.

46:49.760 --> 46:50.760
Yes.

46:50.760 --> 46:54.000
But ultimately shouldn't that have been your parents?

46:54.000 --> 46:56.600
No, we wanted to keep friends close.

46:56.600 --> 46:59.200
Parents in the back sort of further away from me.

46:59.200 --> 47:01.200
I said it was actually in the back sort of.

47:01.200 --> 47:02.200
Yeah.

47:02.200 --> 47:03.200
Right.

47:03.200 --> 47:05.240
When you guys have kids, so you're already not cool.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.080
But we want to like the cool people up front.

47:07.080 --> 47:08.080
Totally.

47:08.080 --> 47:09.080
Yeah.

47:09.080 --> 47:10.080
I'm like young.

47:10.080 --> 47:11.080
Not everyone.

47:11.080 --> 47:12.320
I was think as the only person sort of like, people stay alone.

47:12.320 --> 47:13.320
They're having children.

47:13.320 --> 47:14.320
That have like a vibrant energy.

47:14.320 --> 47:15.320
Other people might say.

47:16.280 --> 47:17.680
Other people might say, well, we're young.

47:17.680 --> 47:19.360
I love that little time.

47:19.360 --> 47:21.760
I actually, I guess it wasn't the parent table kind of.

47:21.760 --> 47:22.760
Cheer up.

47:22.760 --> 47:25.760
That's what Riley's fucking saying.

47:25.760 --> 47:33.320
I would just like to say something really quick.

47:33.320 --> 47:35.320
And this is fine.

47:35.320 --> 47:37.240
They wasn't a coffee or tea.

47:37.240 --> 47:38.240
That's right.

47:38.240 --> 47:39.240
They're what?

47:39.240 --> 47:40.240
They're on the schedule.

47:40.240 --> 47:41.240
But there wasn't.

47:41.240 --> 47:42.240
Oh, that's true.

47:42.240 --> 47:43.240
That's true.

47:43.240 --> 47:44.240
That's true.

47:44.240 --> 47:45.240
That's true.

47:45.240 --> 47:46.240
The babysitter?

47:46.240 --> 47:47.240
Yeah.

47:47.240 --> 47:50.400
They're like, for some kids, they wanted like a potentially a babysitter

47:50.400 --> 47:51.400
to like just wrangle.

47:51.400 --> 47:53.200
But you said, no kids were allowed.

47:53.200 --> 47:54.200
That's right.

47:54.200 --> 47:56.200
I don't really want to be there.

47:56.200 --> 47:57.200
Correct.

47:57.200 --> 47:58.200
But then there's a babysitter.

47:58.200 --> 47:59.200
Some people just shoot that rule.

47:59.200 --> 48:02.600
There were, yeah, there were some kids just hung out with their parents instead.

48:02.600 --> 48:03.600
Yeah.

48:03.600 --> 48:09.080
Rise with this morning, smile with the rising sun.

48:09.080 --> 48:13.920
Five different cakes sat on the table.

48:13.920 --> 48:14.920
Why five cakes?

48:15.400 --> 48:15.920
Yeah.

48:15.920 --> 48:17.680
Is that, could I see your notes?

48:17.680 --> 48:18.680
Okay.

48:18.680 --> 48:23.920
That was all Casey said there was extensive notes on the wedding.

48:23.920 --> 48:28.920
That is a lot of notes more than my vibe.

48:28.920 --> 48:30.920
Five different cakes.

48:30.920 --> 48:32.920
What is that?

48:32.920 --> 48:34.920
A parody of it.

48:34.920 --> 48:36.920
Bob, Bob, three little words.

48:36.920 --> 48:37.920
Got it.

48:37.920 --> 48:38.920
Chocolate.

48:38.920 --> 48:39.920
Birthday.

48:39.920 --> 48:40.920
Sussex.

48:40.920 --> 48:41.920
Sussex.

48:41.920 --> 48:42.920
The Susie cake.

48:42.920 --> 48:43.920
Jordan Game Six.

48:43.920 --> 48:45.920
I'm Jackson Tyson, Jordan.

48:45.920 --> 48:46.920
Yeah.

48:46.920 --> 48:47.920
Lemon cake goes good.

48:47.920 --> 48:49.920
Obviously, it's in charge of the cake.

48:49.920 --> 48:51.920
I don't really care about anything.

48:51.920 --> 48:52.920
I don't think all loved dessert.

48:52.920 --> 48:54.920
That's why dessert showed up.

48:54.920 --> 48:55.920
Yeah.

48:55.920 --> 48:56.920
And then she's like, I want this kind of cake.

48:56.920 --> 48:57.920
And also this kind of cake.

48:57.920 --> 49:00.920
And like, when you say wedding cake, it's like, they charge you like $3,000.

49:00.920 --> 49:01.920
That's true.

49:01.920 --> 49:02.920
They charge everything.

49:02.920 --> 49:04.920
And so, like, let's just get fucking five Susie cakes.

49:04.920 --> 49:06.920
It'll be more delicious, more variety than they want to.

49:06.920 --> 49:07.920
I think that was the smartest.

49:07.920 --> 49:08.920
That was great.

49:08.920 --> 49:09.920
What was everybody's favorite cake?

49:09.920 --> 49:10.920
Let's start with cakes.

49:10.920 --> 49:11.920
Let's see.

49:11.920 --> 49:16.920
I only had a little bit of the lemon cake.

49:16.920 --> 49:18.920
I was, uh, I was working.

49:18.920 --> 49:19.920
Yeah.

49:19.920 --> 49:24.920
It's easy transition to one of my notes, which is Casey's constant woes.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.920
Can you walk us through your experience?

49:26.920 --> 49:27.920
Yes.

49:27.920 --> 49:31.920
Every time I met up with Casey around, he'd be like, man, like, this fucking

49:31.920 --> 49:34.920
BHS thing is giving me a go.

49:34.920 --> 49:36.920
And he did talk like that.

49:36.920 --> 49:37.920
The entire time.

49:37.920 --> 49:38.920
Just.

49:38.920 --> 49:39.920
That's my case.

49:40.920 --> 49:42.920
Casey's constant curls were kind of like the top.

49:42.920 --> 49:43.920
They were popping.

49:43.920 --> 49:44.920
The talk of the town.

49:44.920 --> 49:46.920
Your hair was like kind of going on.

49:46.920 --> 49:47.920
Wow.

49:47.920 --> 49:48.920
Yeah.

49:48.920 --> 49:49.920
Thank you so much.

49:49.920 --> 49:51.920
And your outfit matched the VHS of it all.

49:51.920 --> 49:52.920
It really did.

49:52.920 --> 49:53.920
I really, I would know.

49:53.920 --> 49:54.920
1991.

49:54.920 --> 49:55.920
Yeah.

49:55.920 --> 49:56.920
I was really going for that.

49:56.920 --> 49:57.920
Yeah.

49:57.920 --> 49:59.920
I wanted to sit the part.

49:59.920 --> 50:02.920
I wanted to make everyone that didn't know me at the wedding.

50:02.920 --> 50:04.920
Really unsure about what was happening.

50:04.920 --> 50:05.920
There.

50:05.920 --> 50:07.920
Does this guy live at the Houdiniest state?

50:07.920 --> 50:08.920
He's a ghost.

50:09.920 --> 50:13.920
There were moments of the wedding that it, if I didn't have

50:13.920 --> 50:16.920
Placic, I would have thought you were holding a gun.

50:16.920 --> 50:17.920
Oh.

50:17.920 --> 50:19.920
Is that from your notes?

50:19.920 --> 50:21.920
Is that from your notes?

50:21.920 --> 50:24.920
Is that your shot on a picture of the GoPro?

50:24.920 --> 50:25.920
Yeah.

50:25.920 --> 50:28.920
It's why you didn't have Placic.

50:28.920 --> 50:31.920
Just holding a photos of me.

50:31.920 --> 50:32.920
It's not like that.

50:32.920 --> 50:33.920
Yeah.

50:33.920 --> 50:34.920
I'm not even holding anything.

50:34.920 --> 50:36.920
This was you taking a shower that night.

50:36.920 --> 50:37.920
Casey's packing.

50:38.920 --> 50:40.920
Casey's home.

50:40.920 --> 50:43.920
Tell us about your experience.

50:43.920 --> 50:46.920
I thought we were doing everyone's favorite cake.

50:46.920 --> 50:47.920
Yeah.

50:47.920 --> 50:48.920
Yeah.

50:48.920 --> 50:49.920
My name is Susie Cakes.

50:49.920 --> 50:51.920
I only had to take two cakes.

50:51.920 --> 50:53.920
I only had to celebrate.

50:53.920 --> 50:54.920
The blue frosting.

50:54.920 --> 50:55.920
That's one.

50:55.920 --> 50:56.920
That's one of the favorite cakes.

50:56.920 --> 50:57.920
Period.

50:57.920 --> 50:58.920
I love that cake.

50:58.920 --> 50:59.920
It's like the birthday cake.

50:59.920 --> 51:00.920
It's so good.

51:00.920 --> 51:01.920
It was good.

51:01.920 --> 51:03.920
I had that in the lemon.

51:03.920 --> 51:04.920
Both good.

51:04.920 --> 51:07.920
The lemon had like a sugar coating on top.

51:07.920 --> 51:08.920
It was really gritty.

51:08.920 --> 51:09.920
Well.

51:09.920 --> 51:10.920
In addition.

51:10.920 --> 51:12.920
You're a trash.

51:12.920 --> 51:13.920
You were starting.

51:13.920 --> 51:14.920
You were starting.

51:14.920 --> 51:15.920
You were starting.

51:15.920 --> 51:16.920
You were starting.

51:16.920 --> 51:17.920
You were starting.

51:17.920 --> 51:18.920
Why are you guys doing that?

51:18.920 --> 51:20.920
A fucking separate podcast.

51:20.920 --> 51:21.920
What do you guys say?

51:21.920 --> 51:23.920
Just forget it.

51:23.920 --> 51:24.920
I just was talking to Casey.

51:24.920 --> 51:25.920
I was like.

51:25.920 --> 51:26.920
It's starting to get a word in from over here.

51:26.920 --> 51:28.920
So we have to talk about it.

51:28.920 --> 51:31.920
Jeff has started two different polls.

51:31.920 --> 51:32.920
First he started.

51:32.920 --> 51:34.920
How was everything feeling after the wedding?

51:34.920 --> 51:35.920
We'll start with Casey.

51:35.920 --> 51:36.920
And then only Casey got to answer.

51:36.920 --> 51:38.920
And then he goes, what's our favorite cake?

51:38.920 --> 51:39.920
Casey.

51:39.920 --> 51:40.920
Casey.

51:40.920 --> 51:41.920
Casey.

51:41.920 --> 51:42.920
Casey.

51:42.920 --> 51:43.920
Casey.

51:43.920 --> 51:44.920
Casey.

51:44.920 --> 51:45.920
Casey.

51:45.920 --> 51:46.920
What was your experience?

51:46.920 --> 51:47.920
Casey.

51:47.920 --> 51:48.920
Casey.

51:48.920 --> 51:49.920
Casey.

51:49.920 --> 51:50.920
Casey.

51:50.920 --> 51:51.920
Casey.

51:51.920 --> 51:52.920
Casey.

51:52.920 --> 51:53.920
Casey.

51:53.920 --> 51:54.920
Casey.

51:54.920 --> 51:55.920
Casey.

51:55.920 --> 51:57.920
Casey.

51:57.920 --> 51:58.920
Casey.

51:58.920 --> 51:59.920
Casey.

51:59.920 --> 52:00.920
Casey.

52:00.920 --> 52:01.920
Casey.

52:02.920 --> 52:03.920
Casey.

52:03.920 --> 52:06.920
Casey.

52:06.920 --> 52:08.920
Casey.

52:08.920 --> 52:09.920
كان.

52:09.920 --> 52:10.920
Or the small desserts.

52:10.920 --> 52:12.920
The pizza guy made small desserts.

52:12.920 --> 52:13.920
The pizza guys.

52:13.920 --> 52:14.920
That's so cool.

52:14.920 --> 52:18.920
inde minister.

52:18.920 --> 52:19.920
It was like a burnt caramel banana pudding.

52:19.920 --> 52:20.920
It was like the然 pizza.

52:20.920 --> 52:22.920
It was aケrmaad in a cup.

52:22.920 --> 52:24.920
It passed.

52:24.920 --> 52:27.920
Black's caramelized.

52:27.920 --> 52:29.920
It was caramelized.

52:29.920 --> 52:31.920
I can't take your word for it.

52:31.920 --> 52:32.920
Good, good, genuine word.

52:32.920 --> 52:34.920
That was the worst food of the wedding.

52:34.920 --> 52:36.920
But the rest of the food was like, maybe the best wedding food I've had.

52:36.920 --> 52:37.920
The Alfredo was real it.

52:37.920 --> 52:38.920
We should say.

52:38.920 --> 52:39.920
The Alfredo was.

52:39.920 --> 52:40.920
The Alfredo sauce was.

52:40.920 --> 52:41.920
That's what.

52:41.920 --> 52:42.920
Profile Alfredo sauce was.

52:42.920 --> 52:43.920
Unbelievable.

52:43.920 --> 52:44.920
The truffle pasta.

52:44.920 --> 52:45.920
We were talking a lot about it.

52:45.920 --> 52:46.920
It has to.

52:46.920 --> 52:47.920
It has to.

52:47.920 --> 52:48.920
We had to.

52:48.920 --> 52:49.920
We had to.

52:49.920 --> 52:50.920
We had to.

52:50.920 --> 52:51.920
We had to.

52:51.920 --> 52:52.920
We had to.

52:52.920 --> 52:53.920
We had to.

52:53.920 --> 52:55.920
I don't know where anybody even saw the same.

52:55.920 --> 52:56.920
I waited.

52:56.920 --> 52:58.920
I waited in that line three or four times.

52:58.920 --> 53:00.920
I never saw this.

53:00.920 --> 53:01.920
I never saw this.

53:01.920 --> 53:02.920
I never saw this.

53:02.920 --> 53:03.920
We were talking to them.

53:03.920 --> 53:04.920
That I'm even.

53:04.920 --> 53:06.920
I'm even.

53:06.920 --> 53:07.920
We were talking to them.

53:07.920 --> 53:08.920
That I'm even.

53:08.920 --> 53:09.920
I'm talking to them.

53:09.920 --> 53:10.920
Damn it.

53:10.920 --> 53:11.920
Sam and Resa beer.

53:11.920 --> 53:12.920
No.

53:12.920 --> 53:14.920
That was like part of the vows was like our good or

53:14.920 --> 53:15.920
Sam.

53:15.920 --> 53:16.920
My wife named.

53:16.920 --> 53:17.920
How long?

53:17.920 --> 53:18.920
Fucking now.

53:18.920 --> 53:19.920
I'm going to.

53:19.920 --> 53:22.920
And we should say we should also say during your first

53:22.920 --> 53:23.920
dance.

53:23.920 --> 53:24.920
You.

53:24.920 --> 53:25.920
You didn't.

53:25.920 --> 53:26.920
Something like.

53:26.920 --> 53:27.920
Fight.

53:27.920 --> 53:28.420
Yeah.

53:28.420 --> 53:33.660
Like remember that I sort of browned out during the first dance and then was like, do you guys practice that I'm like practice what exactly?

53:33.660 --> 53:39.420
Because I felt like we didn't know what we were doing. She's like, yeah, one point now. We told was fake slapping and like, oh, yeah, no, we didn't plan that and

53:39.420 --> 53:42.420
It was kind of the perfect first dance. Yeah, no, we've never done that

53:43.420 --> 53:51.540
It was good. I have a video of that. I think that's okay. Oh, yeah, I have a great video of you and your mom's first dance. That's not you. No, that's the way this is

53:51.540 --> 53:54.540
Avital's dad tripping into the frame of my video

53:57.540 --> 54:03.540
Ultimately it is 11. Yeah, just so we're on the same. We have a whole other segment to get through

54:04.540 --> 54:08.540
Also playing horse or course where we look at horses

54:10.540 --> 54:12.540
Triscan

54:15.540 --> 54:17.540
It's a selfie

54:18.540 --> 54:24.540
All right, let's wrap this up. Let's move on to that our next segment then, but not wrap it up even though we've been here for an hour

54:25.540 --> 54:28.540
Let's move on, but not wrap it up

54:30.540 --> 54:37.540
I did want to before we get to that segment. I did want to nail something down with you guys. Yeah, Casey, how did you feel about the way how many

54:38.540 --> 54:41.540
What did you think about the Truffle pizza? How many guests do you think we're there?

54:42.540 --> 54:45.540
170. Okay, great. So he's finding so

54:45.540 --> 54:55.540
This was on Sunday. He said 170. Great. I'll let us calculate her out. I found this to be kind of a deal when I looked this. That's a huge deal

54:56.540 --> 55:01.540
It's a great deal. It's a good space. Excuse me one second. That's just the venue

55:02.540 --> 55:08.540
That doesn't come with the food. It doesn't I don't even know if it comes with the chairs frankly

55:09.540 --> 55:13.540
And what kind of I think that was a 75% photo booth?

55:16.540 --> 55:22.540
Organic plugs of my notes because the next two were 1920s photo booth and 1940s photo booth. This 1920s

55:23.540 --> 55:25.540
I think it's also cheaper depending on the month. Okay, definitely definitely

55:26.540 --> 55:30.540
But not October they have events every night. So you never gonna act over this shirt for something

55:31.540 --> 55:33.540
Was I close when I said 75

55:34.540 --> 55:37.540
After party there was this kind of like upper area

55:38.540 --> 55:43.540
There was a chair with a quote from Harry who do you mean that just says conquer fear

55:44.540 --> 55:53.540
Spikes on the chair now. Yeah, you have I mean that's nice. It sounds like a basic quote now, but he would go into a

55:54.540 --> 55:58.540
A tub of water covered in like chains and need to like that's

55:58.540 --> 56:02.540
Yeah, it's standing up for Houdini. I'm a Houdini stamp. Yeah

56:03.540 --> 56:08.540
But I feel like we have to add that to like the growing mantra of this show because it's be joy

56:09.540 --> 56:12.540
It's get-wise. It's embellish faith, which is America addition

56:13.540 --> 56:18.540
Embellish faith and new to me and how it's conquer fear

56:19.540 --> 56:26.540
I think you had like you've had five new ones that you forget every single time you think conquer fear will

56:27.540 --> 56:29.540
Stick or no

56:29.540 --> 56:35.540
Can someone add to the had gum wiki page sure is really just bond of bonds of the week right now

56:36.540 --> 56:40.540
Which we didn't do Jeff's a little mantras two word quotes. Yeah

56:41.540 --> 56:43.540
Should we do bond of the week?

56:44.540 --> 56:47.540
It's gotta be billy scoffery because for leaving

56:48.540 --> 56:54.540
Yeah, that one chair going to the other one. That's that's good. I'll do a double chair. I'll do ramen raft for the officiating

56:55.540 --> 56:59.540
Let's rapid fire through the last these notes sparklers slash fire safety thoughts

56:59.540 --> 57:02.540
I might like my co a couple straight sparkler flames

57:04.540 --> 57:09.540
That was half hazard you're not so I think that that was I enjoyed it

57:10.540 --> 57:13.540
But I could see something have like gone wrong

57:14.540 --> 57:17.540
I was very dry olive tree

57:18.540 --> 57:21.540
You legally can't do sparklers in California

57:21.540 --> 57:26.540
You're blaming us for doing it

57:27.540 --> 57:29.540
No, I'm just saying you're right to think it was dangerous and I'm glad nothing

57:30.540 --> 57:35.540
They were also kind of like crowding all of us in to like to you know hold them towards you

57:35.540 --> 57:37.540
But they're like don't hold them over anybody's face

57:38.540 --> 57:44.540
But it's like what we're talking about and you're just raining and your dad is very loose waving

57:45.540 --> 57:52.540
It was trying to pass when off to somebody really quick my bond of the week is Murray can my Uber driver who noticed my phone was in the back of the car

57:53.540 --> 57:55.540
Yeah, with that puppy run

57:56.540 --> 58:00.540
Yeah, whatever man it's my bond of the week you don't have to agree

58:01.540 --> 58:02.540
Next up

58:03.540 --> 58:05.540
I was so many people

58:06.540 --> 58:09.540
I'm sorry

58:10.540 --> 58:14.540
It's just if I take it out on him it literally it's like he can't even register that it's happening

58:15.540 --> 58:16.540
Next no again rapid fight

58:17.540 --> 58:19.540
Next note is pile and I summoned the canyon

58:20.540 --> 58:24.540
Marika Riley pile and I approached a very steep set of lit up stairs

58:25.540 --> 58:28.540
And I'm like oh I bet this is where the mansion is because the mansion not much of a mansion

58:29.540 --> 58:31.540
It couldn't have been more than 1200 square feet ladies

58:34.540 --> 58:35.540
But

58:36.540 --> 58:37.540
Let me just get this

58:38.540 --> 58:39.540
But

58:39.540 --> 58:41.540
Thank God you have to play that

58:42.540 --> 58:45.540
But Tyler and I had the gall to go up there and

58:46.540 --> 58:51.540
We did the stairs and then we got to the top of the stairs and it was pitch black and nothing

58:52.540 --> 58:57.540
pitch black dirt pitch black dirt pile and I were high

58:58.540 --> 59:01.540
No, we went up to that without

59:02.540 --> 59:03.540
I'm going to camera

59:04.540 --> 59:06.540
I'm thinking those words as you say

59:07.540 --> 59:08.540
Like you guys in the earth

59:09.540 --> 59:11.540
Like you as your fucking rest teacher

59:14.540 --> 59:15.540
He did it

59:16.540 --> 59:18.540
How did she know the words you were going to make up that

59:19.540 --> 59:22.540
But we went up at the stairs and then up and up and up

59:22.540 --> 59:24.540
And we were literally at the top of the laurel canyon

59:25.540 --> 59:27.540
It made my year just to be at the actual what I consider this on it

59:27.540 --> 59:29.540
That's like you love laurel canyon for some reason

59:30.540 --> 59:35.540
The after party let's talk about it. It was like we were promised what a glass tree house and a pool

59:36.540 --> 59:40.540
Nobody swam and also the glass tree house was basically just a hot jail

59:43.540 --> 59:45.540
It was just like glass

59:46.540 --> 59:49.540
A heater running at 80 degrees for some reason

59:50.540 --> 59:53.540
He desperately set to 60 but the temperature at 80 now

59:54.540 --> 59:57.540
And Jeff when we got up to that kind of like will area with the pool

59:58.540 --> 59:59.540
Jeff finally took off his jacket

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:01.540
So Jeff is just kind of lounging

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:03.540
I have a great photo

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.540
Did you buy that suit for the wedding

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:08.540
Did you buy that suit for the wedding

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:10.540
That's an episode of me

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:12.540
I don't see that

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:14.540
That's your impression of me and I didn't say that

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:19.540
Okay, well, we're really running out of time

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.540
But I didn't get an answer to the question

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:24.540
I bought the suit to have

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:25.540
But also with the wedding in mind

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:27.540
I pissed off like six different people at the bearded vehicle

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:29.540
I walk in there's a maybe suit on the story

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:31.540
So I'll tell it next week

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.540
I bought a suit

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:42.540
As people started to leave slash when I left

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.540
People started to like we all hugged goodbye

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:49.540
The first person to hug me goodbye was Ben and he got a mouth full of my hair

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:52.540
And I noticed that and he didn't say anything

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.540
But also that happened to you I think

01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:58.540
I did not get a mouth full

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.540
You kept an echo in it happened to Jesse

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.540
And it happened to my friend Jesse hugged you goodbye

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:07.540
I hugged him goodbye

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:08.540
Maybe I shouldn't have done that again

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:10.540
Why is that happening

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:12.540
Because my hair was down at that point

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:14.540
And it was kind of down and out

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:16.540
And so was I

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.540
I think I was too short to get

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:22.540
Hey, come on, don't say that

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.540
Not a pig myself

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.540
He's at a priest

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:31.540
Krace at it and out

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.540
This is the final segment

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:37.540
Amir's wedding rubric

01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:40.540
You're in truth

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:41.540
You're in truth

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.540
You're in truth

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:45.540
You're in truth

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.540
You're in truth

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.540
You're in truth

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:53.540
You're in truth

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:55.540
It doesn't say rubric

01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.540
We're going to give it a score

01:01:58.540 --> 01:01:59.540
27

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:01.540
If anybody needs to leave you're welcome too

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:03.540
But whoever wants to stay is going to grade it on this rubric

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:05.540
Because I really didn't put a lot of effort into that

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:07.540
When you should get away

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:09.540
No, no, no

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:11.540
Do it, I just might have to do it

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:14.540
Okay, I think we're all going to leave you

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:16.540
Appearance of the bride, three

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:18.540
We have to read what the rubric says

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.540
We're all around

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.540
One episode of the night

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:24.540
His smile moved

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:26.540
Plus one's to heart flutters tears of joy for her

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:28.540
And viral jealousy of the groom

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:32.540
Whispers of how the fuck did he end up with her permeated

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:35.540
He actually says permeated the can

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:37.540
He's threatening

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:40.540
More like the white dress as one would expect

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:44.540
One be low standard and pride was fine to bad visual

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:46.540
Three, and yeah

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.540
I don't, but without any of the episodes

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.540
Of like how did he do that or jealous

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:54.540
Just three, I think so

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:56.540
Three and everyone was here

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.540
Here we go, Jake, continue

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.540
Appearance of the groom

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:04.540
Group presented himself with confidence and timelessness

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:07.540
And prior actions or action

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:09.540
He was

01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.540
And forever will be perfect

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:14.540
I don't think it's quite that one

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:16.540
The groom was dressed in a form-fitting black-toxic

01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:18.540
As one would expect

01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:20.540
So he's not that one either

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:23.540
The groom's appearance evoked that a repulsive

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:26.540
Fungal rot on a bitter and mud-covered

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:28.540
Cherry tomato

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:30.540
D-hydrated and sorry

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:33.540
His voice cracked at the start of everything

01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:36.540
He exhibited insecurity at every turn

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:38.540
And he fell down stairs

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.540
More than once, there's so many stairs

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:43.540
This smile imbued a

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:45.540
A big G-R-D-A enter

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:48.540
And he is gates and just a group

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.540
Early on set, three man syndrome

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.540
It's gotta be a one

01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:58.540
It's gotta be a one or a dollar

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:01.540
It's gotta be a one or a dollar

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:05.540
Can the hirrow you weren't three and you were in blue

01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:07.540
Not black so we have to go one

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.540
So far everybody's agree that it's a four out of this is a possible 27

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:14.540
Materials were selected and created

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:18.540
Modified in ways that made them even better for the purpose

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:20.540
Ivory linen tablecloths

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:23.540
Patinated antique tables, et cetera

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:25.540
Materials, they are

01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:29.540
Or construction materials consisted almost entirely of...

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:40.540
I think it's true, yes, we're at a six out of twenty two there, yes,

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:45.540
quality of sound quality of sound, there's like eight.

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:51.540
But the performances of the wedding ceremony and the disc jogging present at the reception

01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:56.540
were consisted of wide dynamic range and total contrast grading tapestry of a

01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:01.540
oral, oral pleasure that would have made even the Canyon's most musically

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:03.540
gifted innocence come.

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:06.540
We're talking about Joni Mitchell sir.

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:08.540
The doors exactly right.

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:13.540
This was an audible enough that the guests could bear legal witness to marriage.

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:18.540
Nubshells and music were hard to hear, integrate into your ears, drum,

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.540
mind's eye.

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:23.540
There was overwhelming feeling in the crowd that

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:30.540
could not be heard was probably not worth giving ear to in the first two.

01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:31.540
I think it too.

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:33.540
Yeah, eight out of twenty seven for now.

01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:35.540
Yeah, I thought we're not.

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:38.540
The dance music could have been bumping a little harder.

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:42.540
I've heard myself singing zombie to the level that I did.

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:43.540
Exactly right.

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.540
I'll ultimately half of that.

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:47.540
The DJ cut out.

01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:48.540
So everyone to sing.

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.540
Right.

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:50.540
Right.

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:57.540
The Vail Flowers Cake and Raised Dance floor were all noticed and appreciated,

01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:58.540
and appreciated.

01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:03.540
Choice details went above and beyond expectation to the point of sensory

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:04.540
Nirvana.

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.540
Unmatch.

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:08.540
What was Nirvana capitalized?

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:09.540
It's the band.

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:10.540
It's the band.

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:12.540
Obviously didn't spell check.

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:18.540
The Vail Flowers Cake and Raised Dance floor were present in some consciously acknowledged.

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:21.840
for one whole flower's cake in Rey's dance

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.540
where we're present in an angry fashion

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:29.840
and we're consciously and repetitively scorned

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:33.040
even the wedding's most humble and kind hearted of guests

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:36.540
see Billy Skiffierry's bracelet trips to the bath

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:39.540
bathrooms to quote spice things up.

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:42.040
I did hear a lot of complaints from you

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.040
about the dance where it being too slippery.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.540
It was like a bouncy.

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:46.540
Yeah.

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:47.540
So what do you think?

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:48.540
I think this was a two.

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:49.540
Yeah. We'd have to go two.

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:50.540
Okay. Well, yeah.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:51.540
Actually, you know what?

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.540
Let's go three for this one.

01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:54.540
There's five different, five different cakes.

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:55.540
So, yeah.

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:56.540
Okay. That's really nice.

01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:58.540
Okay. That's kind of an 11 out of 27.

01:06:58.540 --> 01:06:59.540
Continuing on.

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:00.540
Demonstration of love.

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:03.540
Frighting groups spoke loudly and clearly.

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:05.540
Their love was visible to guests and its value

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:09.540
was demonstrated through historic examples, shared pet appearances

01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:11.540
and emotional care and tours.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:13.540
The degree of action is named

01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:17.540
and the process by which it was created is described.

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.540
So a degree.

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:19.540
Let's hear the other categories.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:20.540
Number two.

01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:23.540
To be present, but sources are not exciting.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.540
The wedding itself stood.

01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:26.540
This is one.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:27.540
The wedding itself stood.

01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:30.540
And we'll continue to stand in attendees memories

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:31.540
as a talisman.

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:34.540
If we're in some serity of heart and muteness of law.

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.540
Are you in it?

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:39.540
This is like a fucking madly.

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:42.540
The union is to put it simply.

01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:43.540
Not.

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:44.540
I think.

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:45.540
I think.

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:46.540
I think.

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:47.540
Yeah.

01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:48.540
14 out of 27.

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:49.540
Doing well so far.

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:50.540
It's better when I see it.

01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:51.540
27.

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:52.540
It's like 18 right now.

01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:53.540
All right.

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:54.540
18 27.

01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:55.540
It makes it sound like it's really coming up.

01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:56.540
27 total.

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:57.540
14.

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:58.540
Time and effort.

01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:00.540
Class and time were spent and used wisely.

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:02.540
Much time and effort went into planning,

01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:04.540
designing, construction.

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:05.540
Construction.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:06.540
You can't go.

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:07.540
Construction.

01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:09.540
The guest experience.

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:10.540
It's rentals.

01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:13.540
The guest experience as well as the brides and grooms

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:17.540
were considered greatly and fairly special exception for Casey.

01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:19.540
And as well as yes, continue.

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:22.540
Case and class and time were spent and used wisely.

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:25.540
Much time and effort went into planning, designing, construction,

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:27.540
writing, groom, could have spent more time considering

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:28.540
the guest experience.

01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:32.540
Specifically in regards to inviting so many unknowns.

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:33.540
Unknown.

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.540
Like we should say.

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.540
Like we had like Sean gun was there.

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:40.540
And then also there was like pushing gun.

01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:42.540
I felt that's the second mention of her.

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:45.540
He's Kirk from Go Murder.

01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:47.540
He's the body of Rocket Rock.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:50.540
And number one below average for time and effort.

01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:51.540
Let's hear it.

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.540
Okay.

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:54.540
Little thought or poise went into the planning.

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:57.540
The ceremony and or reception.

01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:01.540
Even 40 cakes couldn't mask the guest overwhelming feeling

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:04.540
that they were participating in a lower echelon.

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.540
Oh my god.

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:08.540
I'm your line.

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:10.540
I think you're going to say three.

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:11.540
Yeah.

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:12.540
Yeah.

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:13.540
I think I do think three.

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:14.540
Three.

01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:15.540
Absolutely.

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:16.540
You were going to say two.

01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:20.540
I think a mere a mere gave it a two.

01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:22.540
But obviously tells mom gave it a three.

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:23.540
Which is a three.

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:24.540
Knowledge gained.

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:26.540
Attendees were joy.

01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:27.540
Got wise.

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:28.540
Embellish faith.

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:30.540
And ultimately conquered fear.

01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:31.540
Right.

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:32.540
It was the event of the year.

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:34.540
And will not soon be forgotten.

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:36.540
Attendees were there.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:37.540
And then we're.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.540
Who did he style?

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:40.540
Yeah.

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:43.540
The only knowledge gained by guests was how much they don't want their

01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:47.540
partnership to mirror the horrors and shame of the ash.

01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:49.540
Blumenfeld quote union.

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:53.540
A firstical and odd happening.

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:57.540
That not only that not only to basis the sacrament of marriage,

01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:00.540
but also to fise the laws of the universe entirely.

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.540
The whole thing was in it word.

01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:04.540
Bad.

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.540
I think it was too.

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:07.540
No.

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:08.540
I think it was three.

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:09.540
I think it was three.

01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:10.540
All right.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.540
Not bad at all.

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.540
Yeah.

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:14.540
We don't say two, two, two.

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:16.540
So it would have been a lot worse if you were a fucking judge.

01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:19.540
I know score is going to be 20 out of 27.

01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:21.540
Which is low.

01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:22.540
It does feel low.

01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:24.540
But I mean, it's hard for a wedding to be.

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:25.540
I feel like we gave three.

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:28.540
That's a solid sea, which is a passing.

01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:29.540
Great.

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:30.540
You don't want to retake the course.

01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:31.540
You don't want to get married again.

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:32.540
No.

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:33.540
It's not going to get married.

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:36.540
If we got an 18 out of 27.

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:39.540
What?

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:42.540
That was a mere wedding.

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.540
I have different gay.

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:45.540
Nice nice.

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:47.540
That on the table.

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:56.540
What is that episode coming out on the neck a week from this Friday?

01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:58.540
Is that playing the song?

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.540
So the head gum, the live shows.

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:02.540
We should plug those.

01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:03.540
Yeah.

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:04.540
I'm happy hour.

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:05.540
Unfortunately, we are at time.

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:06.540
Yep.

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:08.540
But no plugs down the line.

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:09.540
Jake, rapid fire gun.

01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:12.540
I will be reading Amir's vows at head gum.

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:13.540
Happy hour.

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:14.540
November 6th.

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:15.540
9.

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:16.540
9.

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:17.540
9.

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:18.540
3.

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:19.540
9.

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:20.540
9.

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:21.540
9.

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:22.540
9.

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:23.540
9.

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:24.540
9.

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:25.540
9.

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:26.540
9.

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:27.540
9.

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:28.540
9.

01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:29.540
, 9.

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:30.540
9.

01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:31.540
9.

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:32.540
9.

01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:34.540
9.

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.540
89.

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:37.540
10.

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.540
And you are making a fun video!

01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:54.540
I think you are back.

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.340
I'm not going.

01:11:56.340 --> 01:12:04.380
All right, so I'll be on Instagram and I'm here and let's end this on you, just some final

01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:06.900
parting wisdoms now what?

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:12.660
I planned very little for the wedding and I was pleasantly surprised with all the decisions

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:16.020
that Avi Tull's mother made for the night of July.

01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.740
He's zooming in on the cost.

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:22.860
He can draw an old, ultimately unblood you guys all were there and had fun and ate well

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.500
and danced good.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:31.180
And yeah, overwhelming, but overjoyed at the same time.

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:36.100
You tried very hard to ruin the evening and I'm glad you were unsuccessful.

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:40.620
And I really hate to ask, how was the consummation?

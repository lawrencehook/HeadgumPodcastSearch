00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.560
You know what my problem is with edibles? Sometimes you get so high. I mean it can really be

00:12.560 --> 00:16.880
difficult to control to dose it right. There's nothing worse than being baked out of

00:16.880 --> 00:21.200
your mind when you didn't plan on it. And you know once you eat it, there's no going

00:21.200 --> 00:27.880
back. You just sit there suffering stone out of your mind. That's why when I need the perfect

00:27.880 --> 00:36.600
medium high, I hit up my friends at diet smoke for their delicious Delta 8 THC gummies. Diet

00:36.600 --> 00:42.600
smoke isn't light. It's just right. So what exactly is Delta H? Well Delta H is it simply a

00:42.600 --> 00:48.840
less potent THC. The THC that you're probably most familiar with is Delta 9 and while both

00:48.840 --> 00:54.040
are natural to the cannabis plant, diet smoke extracts their Delta 8 from hemp. Some may call this

00:54.120 --> 00:58.600
a loophole. I call it the secret recipe to getting a smooth, stable and most importantly

00:58.600 --> 01:04.440
legal high. Diet smoke is legal in most states and it's non-prescription. Just check diet

01:04.440 --> 01:08.360
smoke's website to see if they ship their delicious gummies to your state. Now you

01:08.360 --> 01:14.200
probably ask them yourself, does diet smoke really get you high? Of course, the high you get

01:14.200 --> 01:18.680
with diet smoke is best described as somewhere between the chillness of CBD and that classic

01:18.680 --> 01:23.640
stone feeling that you get with regular weed. Plus diet smoke comes in two delicious flavors,

01:23.640 --> 01:30.120
blue raspberry and watermelon. I like blue raspberry, but Amir loves watermelon. I say try them both.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.280
When CBD isn't enough and traditional THC is too much, enjoy the smooth buzz of diet smoke.

01:36.280 --> 01:41.640
Each gummy isn't fused with 10 milligrams of Delta H, THC derived from American grown hemp.

01:41.640 --> 01:47.320
And you know what they say by American, get high with American. Delta 8 gummies are low in sugar,

01:47.320 --> 01:52.360
fat, free, and delicious. Oh, and I mentioned their legal, they're absolutely legal. Otherwise

01:52.360 --> 01:57.720
we wouldn't be advertising with them on this podcast. So go to dietsmoke.com and use promo code. What's

02:35.480 --> 02:40.840
Let's get into the show. So far away from the mic. There's no way it's picking you up. Really?

02:41.800 --> 02:48.600
Yeah, it's kind of quiet. Yeah. You're not hearing what's going through this. And this is a horrible way to start the show.

02:48.600 --> 02:52.280
Okay. Yeah. Talk about technical difficulties up there.

02:52.280 --> 02:58.120
But I mean, we always have technical difficulties at the top. It feels like that every single episode.

02:58.120 --> 03:02.760
Yeah, no last one. The last one was great. The last one was perfectly executed.

03:03.400 --> 03:08.840
I guess, like it really depends on what other people are feeling.

03:09.640 --> 03:12.280
I mean, it came out today. We should say. It's a phrase.

03:12.280 --> 03:17.480
Yes, right. And I think that's fine to have to. I mean, I think the, the, the, the, the barrier to entry

03:17.480 --> 03:19.800
with podcasting is lower. Okay. B.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.680
Don't be what? Sorry. Don't like checking mid-shit.

03:28.040 --> 03:31.960
What do you mean check it? I'm just waiting for you to finish the, your sentence. You started to think.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.920
Sitting, I don't appreciate it. I really don't because it doesn't show that you're listening.

03:34.920 --> 03:38.920
It's showing that you're waiting, biting at the bit, trying to get your shit in.

03:38.920 --> 03:44.040
Active listening is a, is a psychological technique to prove that I am listening.

03:44.040 --> 03:50.760
So if you're really validating what you were saying. Well, I'm salivating at the idea of

03:50.760 --> 03:55.720
finishing my thought. Can I do that, please? Yeah, finish it. If you can pick it up where you left off.

03:56.440 --> 04:00.120
A, the barrier to entry to audio is lower. Because you only have to worry about audio,

04:00.120 --> 04:07.160
not audio and video. B, people have more of an attention span because they're queuing this up

04:07.160 --> 04:13.240
for a road trip, for a commute, for a workout, for a walk. So if it takes you 30 seconds to get into it,

04:13.240 --> 04:17.400
that's fine to them. Absolutely. That's fine to them. And I don't, I don't know,

04:17.400 --> 04:24.680
appreciate being like interrogated and blamed for the fucking issues. Avier otherwise on this show.

04:24.680 --> 04:26.760
Because guess what? I'm the only one who fucking works on it.

04:27.400 --> 04:32.920
You know, man, I'm really sorry. No, it's sorry that you have to see me like this,

04:32.920 --> 04:40.200
Jonathan, usually I'm like, worse at explaining why I'm upset. You're so good at explaining,

04:40.200 --> 04:46.280
exactly what made you upset this day. Up, go, up, aside. We've got another,

04:48.200 --> 04:53.480
move on. We've got another three person episode. I don't know. It's the kitchen effect here,

04:53.480 --> 04:58.600
because the last time it was Johnny Mariek and I for 30 minutes, and then Gianna for 10,

04:58.600 --> 05:03.080
and then Mariek had to leave. So it was three people for that show. Today we've got three because

05:03.080 --> 05:09.640
Michael was supposed to be on and he got food poisoning. Gianna, what's new in the life and times

05:09.640 --> 05:15.400
of kinshin? You know, okay. So I'm graduating next week. I'm in college.

05:17.400 --> 05:22.680
In correct. Actually, no. What, what does it? Exactly. So check it out. No, it's, it is next week.

05:22.680 --> 05:29.000
It's next Thursday. I'm graduating. You may think that you got me. You did just gas like the

05:29.000 --> 05:36.440
fuck out of me. It's okay. I'm graduating next Thursday. Very excited. God willing. I'm graduating

05:36.440 --> 05:44.040
next Thursday. I go to temple to college in the great city of Philadelphia. Go birds.

05:45.960 --> 05:51.960
That's the best. I was just birds. The eagle. Yeah, actually. Yeah, but also the temple owl.

05:51.960 --> 05:59.480
So yeah. Oh, wow. It's all birds. Oh, yeah. Two birds. The shoe. Oh, yeah. Yes. Thank you.

06:00.040 --> 06:05.560
Gianna, we were just hanging out recently and I want you to talk about your yoga class

06:05.560 --> 06:08.920
that you signed up for and what you need to do for that class right now.

06:10.040 --> 06:16.680
Okay. So at the beginning of this semester, I needed 18 credits to graduate. That's like a fully

06:16.680 --> 06:22.440
packed schedule. So I was trying to make it as easy on myself as possible. So I was like,

06:22.440 --> 06:27.560
all right, you know, let's take a typing so loud. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's not, it's not

06:27.560 --> 06:30.280
fine. It's not because it's not going to be picked up on the show because I'm recording through

06:30.280 --> 06:35.240
this. The studio microphone. So you have plenty of it out. Makes it worse because now you interrupted

06:35.240 --> 06:40.840
Gianna. Okay. Fine. Just continue. But type quieter. So I don't have to hear it.

06:40.840 --> 06:48.840
All right. That's, that's a good note. That is a good note. Sorry. Okay. Okay. 18 credits.

06:49.640 --> 06:55.240
Yes. 18 credits. So I was like, let me take this class. This yoga class because I was like,

06:55.240 --> 07:01.000
it's going to be fucking easy. Three easy credits. Like, you know, it'll be, it'll be a cakewalk.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.480
And it was all online, too. Like a synchronous totally. No, just do meetings or anything. So I was like,

07:05.720 --> 07:16.360
it's going to be so easy. So come to find out. Oh, wow. That's that kind of very say one that podcast

07:16.360 --> 07:22.360
veritate that we needed. Yeah. What would be the fancy word for podcast? Like, what's film and

07:22.360 --> 07:28.520
cinema podcast and blank? I don't think there is a fancy word. I think that is definitely a gap

07:28.520 --> 07:33.800
in the market. Sure. Yeah. There's nothing I can do about this right now. We're just going to have to wait

07:33.800 --> 07:40.120
for it. I think you can go to a closet or something. It'll be done in a second. Just give it a

07:40.120 --> 07:47.960
minute. It's my house phone. We still have a house phone. I can't even do anything about that.

07:47.960 --> 07:55.400
Yeah. It's our cake. It's our cake. This fucking yoga class. Okay. I'm so sorry about it.

07:55.400 --> 07:59.880
Taking, like, I'm supposed to be falling along with this YouTube video. Like, there's like a

07:59.880 --> 08:05.000
weekly YouTube video that the professor is making of like the class. I'm supposed to be following

08:05.000 --> 08:09.800
along with the YouTube video and recording it and like turning it in every week. And that's like

08:09.800 --> 08:15.720
most of my grade. Yeah. I didn't do that the whole semester because I had other shit going on

08:15.720 --> 08:20.280
and working in. I got a bunch of other classes. I was like, this is a fucking yoga class. I could put

08:20.280 --> 08:28.040
on the background. It'll be fine. You failed. I didn't fail. Not, I did not fail. I have

08:29.000 --> 08:33.080
until Sunday. It's Friday now. You have to do like 20 yoga sets.

08:33.080 --> 08:40.040
It requires 11 hours of fucking yoga. You're going to be serious. I'm being dead serious. No. Like,

08:40.040 --> 08:47.560
I'm dead fucking serious. I've been doing speed yoga. Fucking the most stressful yoga of my life.

08:47.560 --> 08:54.840
I have the YouTube video of her on like 1.5 times speed on YouTube and I'm like fucking

08:54.840 --> 08:59.720
following along in like fast motion in my fucking living room. And then I'm talking to

08:59.720 --> 09:08.840
out of post. Yes. I didn't know you were slowing it down. Oh my gosh. It's a fucking nightmare.

09:10.360 --> 09:16.600
Well, fucking nightmare. I'm not going to lie. You did walk into this. I did. I did it to myself.

09:16.600 --> 09:22.600
You made your bed, but I am glad that right now you have to lie in it because it brings me so much

09:22.680 --> 09:29.240
joy to see you in a lot of stress. You know what? It's fine. I'm going to get a fucking

09:29.240 --> 09:37.720
grace out with her response. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. I should out. All right. Let's

09:37.720 --> 09:44.280
hash it out. Actually, it's not because Gianna knows too many of my innermost secrets. Let's hear one.

09:44.280 --> 09:50.120
Let's go. That's fine. We don't have to. I don't even know where to start. That's a thing.

09:50.120 --> 09:55.800
She can definitely just a treasure trove. For podcast listeners, we're just listeners in general.

09:56.920 --> 10:01.800
We grew up together. We went to the same high school. Oh, not all four years. But she

10:01.800 --> 10:07.800
seen me at my lowest points. And she seen me at my highest points. AKA right now filming

10:08.600 --> 10:15.160
back on podcast. Are you kidding me? Now you're excited. You're on the show. Like three out of four

10:15.160 --> 10:25.960
episodes a month. This one is special. He's good. It will prepared for it. Yeah, technical difficulties.

10:25.960 --> 10:31.640
But that's just part of the course for this kind of groundbreaking podcast. No, because we started

10:31.640 --> 10:36.200
it off. We didn't have to address the technical issues. And you put me on blast for it from the jump.

10:37.400 --> 10:41.240
That's true. Now you're fine with them. That's true. Yeah, because now I'm kind of caught in

10:41.240 --> 10:46.040
the group of like, wow, what's the next? The technical difficulties. People want to see the

10:46.040 --> 10:55.640
raw shit. They like that. Yeah. Yeah. Major killer spread the wealth in terms of joy. So

10:55.640 --> 11:00.040
basically, like, if you have a certain amount of social energy to give, make sure you're

11:00.040 --> 11:05.480
doling it out throughout the week in a sustainable manner. Don't go out Monday and Tuesday to see

11:05.480 --> 11:09.240
people. And then suddenly it's the weekend. And you're like, actually, you know, I really need to

11:10.200 --> 11:13.960
because that's, that's when shit happens. You know, you shouldn't have gone out on Monday or if you're

11:13.960 --> 11:19.080
going to go Monday and Tuesday, choose one of the other. Does that make sense? You should practice

11:19.080 --> 11:25.480
what you preach. We literally went up for trivia on Tuesday. Wednesday. Wednesday. Wednesday.

11:25.480 --> 11:29.160
I was Wednesday. I was Wednesday. I was Wednesday too. All of us. Yeah, we're going to draw

11:29.160 --> 11:34.120
some musicals. The fourducers. Yeah, the fourducers. Yeah, the fourducers. That's going to be

11:34.120 --> 11:38.840
exciting. Yeah. That is going to be exciting. Good pun, too, because if you guys didn't catch that,

11:38.840 --> 11:45.000
it's peed. We did. We caught it. Okay. Well, you've seen the, the written stuff. You've seen the

11:45.000 --> 11:49.880
fires. Some people might not know that it's peed. People don't know the concept. They don't get it.

11:49.880 --> 11:56.040
Drunk musicals, poorducers. Yeah, what is that? What is that? It literally doesn't take

11:56.040 --> 12:03.320
anyone who is older than 10 to figure it out for our under 10 listeners. I'm sorry.

12:04.280 --> 12:11.720
That was easy. That was easy. That was easy. Um, I don't know. I don't know what kind of energy

12:11.720 --> 12:18.360
to bring to this episode, because you guys have this, like, close, pinch, hip, and I just don't,

12:18.360 --> 12:24.440
I don't know how I fit in on YouTube. A little insecure, I'll be honest. Yeah, you honestly should

12:24.440 --> 12:32.040
feel it. You should be. Yeah. Yeah. You still feel insecure. Yeah, I don't want you to feel that way

12:32.920 --> 12:38.360
until the end of this episode and actually well beyond the episode to kind of look, I want that

12:38.360 --> 12:44.040
insecurity to follow you every waking moment of your life. That's what it follows is about. Yeah,

12:44.040 --> 12:49.480
insecurity. Yeah. I don't know what. That's the second it follows reference I've made. That's

12:49.480 --> 12:54.760
the second week in a row of mid and it follows reference. Did you have that movie recently? No,

12:54.760 --> 12:59.320
I saw it three years ago. It's a lot. Since a good one. It is good.

13:00.680 --> 13:07.400
Janna, how's your love life? I'm good. Have you been? He's cool. Yeah.

13:07.400 --> 13:13.560
Name first and last. Jonathan Sturmer. Shout out. Shout out.

13:17.560 --> 13:22.600
Did you go to Temple with you? How'd you guys meet? Let's hear the whole story. All right, let's hear the

13:23.560 --> 13:29.480
story ass. Just the whole story, comma ass. Don't you don't have to say that. Just say it

13:29.480 --> 13:33.720
let's hear the whole story. Yeah, you don't have to say that. Yeah, all right. Like you don't really

13:33.720 --> 13:37.320
what else should do I not have to do? Can you guys give me a list? Because I don't understand now

13:37.320 --> 13:41.480
you're like narrowing the space that I can play with. Yeah, I actually don't even have to be on this

13:41.480 --> 13:46.840
podcast at all. We can probably handle it. Yeah, actually. Yeah, because we're pretty close and we can kind of

13:46.840 --> 13:54.600
like, yeah. Yeah, but I highly suggest that. Oh, God. Why don't you talk about, um,

13:55.640 --> 14:02.200
talk about John for a second and I'll figure out what bit I can do. Okay, um, me and John met.

14:03.560 --> 14:09.000
Okay, well, I guess I should start with Stacey. This all starts with Stacey. This is already

14:09.000 --> 14:12.920
it. We're in too deep. Less, we're in too deep. We don't have to talk about that.

14:13.880 --> 14:19.320
All we that all the people needs to know is that you're dating a handsome man in his name is John. He has the best

14:19.320 --> 14:26.520
name ever. Yes. Yeah. That's facts. Yeah. They don't need to know everything. We're doing them too much already.

14:27.320 --> 14:32.200
I need to tell you what is the, uh, what does the picture that is hanging above your head right now?

14:33.080 --> 14:38.280
Yo, I need to address this. I'm putting out a fucking press release about this because I got

14:39.000 --> 14:47.320
some, uh, or disparaging comments. Yeah. You did. I'm glad that I did. I was the four

14:47.320 --> 14:53.000
runner for those. Yeah. Thank you for starting that. But yeah, I got some disparaging comments about

14:53.000 --> 14:59.000
this fucking live laugh love sign. And I would like to say to the people that this is my parents'

14:59.000 --> 15:05.560
house. Yeah. And when you talk shit on that live love love sign, you're talking shit on my two

15:05.640 --> 15:13.720
very hardworking sweet parents. I'm not chuggy. You're being a fucking asshole. Wow. Oh,

15:13.720 --> 15:20.120
that was Jeffrey still here. All right, Jeffrey, you can come back now. I do feel bad tonight.

15:35.880 --> 15:41.800
Financial planning. Personal finance. Let's get into it. How do you guys manage your cash?

15:44.200 --> 15:47.000
One way or the other. Are you good with money or you not? Let's start with Jonah.

15:47.000 --> 15:55.720
Uh, actually, I, I do want to interject a little bit. Um, we, in our friend group chat from

15:55.720 --> 16:02.600
back home, we recently did a poll across just, we asked everybody a few questions about

16:02.680 --> 16:08.280
everybody else in the group chat. One of the questions was, who is the worst with money? And it was

16:08.280 --> 16:15.400
Gianna unequivocally. She is the worst with money. Jonah, what's the biggest purchase you've made

16:15.400 --> 16:21.640
in the last month and what was it? Um, in the last month. That was the same question back to back.

16:21.640 --> 16:31.560
I meant not much was it. I just spent like $300 on close. Yeah. That's like usually what it is.

16:31.560 --> 16:36.280
It's, it's all closed. Um, I bought my car not too long ago. So that was like a big purchase.

16:36.280 --> 16:41.880
I don't have a license. So I bought a car. Yeah, exactly. So I don't have it. It's cute though.

16:41.880 --> 16:46.360
It's a cute little bloomyata. It was sexy. I was going to make a joke about it being a meata.

16:46.360 --> 16:53.320
That's very funny. Yeah. So yeah. And it was also, when did you buy this car?

16:53.400 --> 17:03.560
Uh, I want to go maybe October September. Okay. Yeah. So it's like already getting, okay. It was already

17:03.560 --> 17:11.960
getting cold. Correct. And it's, you don't know if it was correct. She said it was, it's her life.

17:11.960 --> 17:20.280
So she's right. Fine. All I wanted to say was that the meata is a drop top and she bought it at the

17:20.280 --> 17:26.200
start of the colder months, which makes it even worse that it was just an ill-timed purchase.

17:26.200 --> 17:32.520
You can't drive. Listen, everybody keeps talking shit on the fucking meata. But when you want to

17:32.520 --> 17:39.880
roll down to the beach in the Barbie dream car, don't hit my line. That's fair. Because I do want to hit my

17:39.880 --> 17:44.040
line. I do want to hit the beach in the Barbie dream car pretty bad. You got to join me. What you have to

17:44.040 --> 17:49.640
do is you have to have to wear a cropped top with a jock sock in the drop top. And then you have to

17:49.640 --> 17:56.520
make a stop at a mom and shop. Mom and pop shop, we should say. You don't have to rhyme everything.

17:56.520 --> 18:00.200
It doesn't make you cool, right? I haven't yet. Until just then. And then we're going to move on.

18:01.080 --> 18:05.560
Okay. So yeah, why don't we just move on from that horrible rhyme that you just

18:07.080 --> 18:11.960
assaulted us with, really? Damn, Daniel. Craig is out as James Bond.

18:12.040 --> 18:22.200
Oh, okay. Bonds of the week. We're doing this new segment. Bond of the week. Daniel Craig is out.

18:22.200 --> 18:26.200
We don't know who's in. Every week until the next James is cast, we're going to

18:26.200 --> 18:34.200
lob up our casting options as the new James. The new double seven. So who do you want to see as Bond

18:34.200 --> 18:41.800
in the next couple movies? You know, I've never seen a James Bond movie. But I've heard people say

18:41.800 --> 18:49.880
Idriselba a lot. Yeah. It's been like a conversation, right? Yeah, not goals. I feel like that could be

18:49.880 --> 18:56.120
good. I don't know. I don't really know what James Bond's whole deal is. Who is a cool celebrity to you?

18:56.120 --> 19:02.760
You just cool. He's a cool dude. I don't know. You're going to have to get back to me.

19:03.400 --> 19:10.200
Yeah, because I was thinking, Tyboro. Tyboro, filled down from me has modern family. Yeah.

19:11.880 --> 19:17.080
He's sort of funny. Yeah, but like James Bond is not really supposed to be,

19:17.080 --> 19:20.440
like I guess he's like witty and charming, but that's exactly like so as Phil.

19:21.160 --> 19:26.200
Don't think. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Exactly. Are you know who could be good? You know, could be good.

19:26.200 --> 19:31.160
What? Who? Stewie Griffin. Charles Stewie Griffin. That'd be hilarious.

19:31.160 --> 19:36.040
fictional fictional by the way. That's not a real person. Okay. I don't even watch James Bond.

19:36.040 --> 19:40.360
But yeah. I know you watched television and assume everything is real in front of you. But

19:40.440 --> 19:46.200
Stewie Griffin is not. Yeah. I succession is based off the Murdox. So it is real.

19:46.200 --> 19:50.280
A lot of stitches are based off of real experience that happen to the writers actually. Yeah,

19:50.280 --> 19:53.720
but family guy. Family guy. Remember we talked about Stewie Griffin. Yes.

19:54.760 --> 19:59.400
It's like some things are real and some things are not. Yeah. I think you know. You're having trouble

19:59.400 --> 20:05.720
making that distinction. No. I get it. Okay. Whatever. Whatever. Okay.

20:06.040 --> 20:13.640
Johnny, who's your bond of a week? Bond of the week? Any science majors out here?

20:13.640 --> 20:23.480
Ionic bond. No. Okay. And I guess I would go for someone who's like really cool.

20:24.520 --> 20:31.080
Yeah. Yeah. It would probably be like, I think it would kind of be me. I think I could be

20:31.080 --> 20:37.560
a way. No way. No way. Yeah. I think I would be a pretty good bond. I just watched the last bond.

20:37.560 --> 20:43.960
Yeah. And that was the only one I watched. And I think I kind of got what was going on. Sure.

20:44.920 --> 20:50.360
Yeah. Like, so you understood no time to die. And that's why you think you'd be a good James Bond.

20:50.360 --> 20:57.000
Yeah. I mean, like, I saw M as this kind of maternal figure. So I think my mom could be castes M.

20:57.640 --> 21:03.080
I do have a whole casting list. Like, okay. You could be like my dad or some shit like that.

21:03.080 --> 21:08.520
So you're just casting your family. I mean, like, it's just, I guess it's kind of a coincidence

21:08.520 --> 21:13.320
that they fit those kinds of roles and those kinds of descriptions and breakdowns.

21:14.120 --> 21:19.000
But I wouldn't say the breakdown for M is a maternal figure. You're talking about the head of

21:19.000 --> 21:24.200
M. I. Six, the best intelligence agency. And when did you say your mom is kind of the head of the

21:24.200 --> 21:31.400
household sometimes? Sure. But that's not that's such a loose connection between us too.

21:31.400 --> 21:38.920
Like, M has to be like in control. Yeah. My mom. So my mom come. Yes. A lot of that's like every

21:38.920 --> 21:42.920
mom. I'm just saying that it's like you can be a great mom. Okay, fine. I had an intelligence.

21:42.920 --> 21:47.160
Okay, fine. I guess your mom could also be M if she wanted to. That's not what you want.

21:47.160 --> 21:53.640
Two M's and it's you're in my mom's. Yes. Is that fine? No. That's a horrible casting

21:53.640 --> 21:59.960
decision. Okay. This is let's move on. Yeah. This three person episodes are going great.

22:02.280 --> 22:08.360

22:13.800 --> 22:20.520
matter who you are or what you have. Your life is probably stressful. I know that for me, sleep issues,

22:21.000 --> 22:30.440
cash, family, friends, work can get me down and out. And you may not be feeling totally down

22:30.440 --> 22:34.360
and out or totally depressed or like you're at a loss. But if your stress is high, your temper

22:34.360 --> 22:38.280
is shorter than usual or even if you're starting to feel straining in any of your relationships,

22:38.280 --> 22:42.840
you could probably use the chance to unload. So unload the stress and get it out by talking to

22:42.840 --> 22:47.480
somebody who's completely unbiased about your life. Somebody who's not going to take sides on

22:47.480 --> 22:51.960
anything or judge you. You know, when there's things that you feel like you can't tell anyone or that

22:51.960 --> 22:57.000
you feel like you can't unload to family and friends, you need to unload it. That's what therapy

22:57.000 --> 23:02.600
can be. Better help specifically is customized online therapy that offers phone, video, and even

25:58.280 --> 26:04.200
We can move on to our first segment. Let's just do that. This is the first segment now. That was

26:04.200 --> 26:22.360
not the time to play this. Are you guys familiar with the supply chain issue? What supply chain

26:22.360 --> 26:30.280
I'm sure. So the Sue has canal being backed up as all sorts of results. It has pushed back

26:30.280 --> 26:37.720
a lot of timelines for manufacturing and business because we live in a global economy. Yeah. And

26:38.520 --> 26:46.520
was that? Yeah, I said, but I do want to say that it's oddly serious for a comedy podcast.

26:46.520 --> 26:50.920
I've been telling you guys I'm trying to get more wise. So I've been reading a ton about this

26:50.920 --> 26:57.640
stuff, man. I mean, everything has to get places just so. I don't know if you saw a documentary

26:58.520 --> 27:03.320
that came out a couple years ago about people who work on these cargo ships. It's incredibly

27:03.320 --> 27:07.160
stressful because there's so much money involved. There's so much power involved. And it's like

27:08.440 --> 27:12.040
at the hands of capitalism, like the individual doesn't matter, right? Like you just become a cog.

27:13.560 --> 27:21.320
And so the supply chain issue in my view is an argument for localization, right? Local

27:21.320 --> 27:26.440
produce local products. But that's not the world we live in. We live in a world with the supply chain

27:26.440 --> 27:37.560
that is fucked up right now. So I thought we could kind of fix it. Okay, so all right. So

27:38.680 --> 27:45.000
so this is this is the supply chain as we know it. No way, maybe this can start. Let's start with

27:45.000 --> 27:50.440
the consumer, right? Gianna, what's something you want or need right now? Product wise. And you can

27:50.440 --> 27:58.840
be honest. And you can be honest. New clothes. What kind of clothes? One item, one item. Let's just

27:58.840 --> 28:06.600
for arguments. Okay, leather pants. Okay, leather pants. As the supply chain currently stands,

28:07.320 --> 28:12.920
you are the consumer. You demand pants. If you want to start from the bottom and then end up where

28:12.920 --> 28:17.720
we're here being you buying the getting the pants. It's raw materials, right? leather hides.

28:17.720 --> 28:23.240
That comes from cows. Suddenly logistics lead to the supplier, right? And it's all logistics.

28:23.240 --> 28:28.600
So that's communication back and forth. That's, you know, the supplier of high. Did you study this?

28:28.600 --> 28:33.080
Like, did you like do a lot of research on this just for this segment? Because it feels like a lot of

28:33.080 --> 28:39.320
research for a segment that undeniably is going to be boring to some of the world. Yeah, I'm kind of

28:39.320 --> 28:44.280
wondering where the joke is going to be. Yeah, you know what I'm fucking sick of doing this show every

28:44.360 --> 28:48.360
week. Everybody demanding jokes. Why can't we talk about something real? That's interesting to me.

28:49.480 --> 28:53.800
That's wise. We are, we did talk about something real. We talked about our personal lives. We

28:53.800 --> 28:59.720
talked about stuff like that. We did. We talked about the wrong way. We don't have any same casting.

28:59.720 --> 29:05.800
How's that real? This is every day. Every day. This is happening. Whether we know it or not.

29:05.800 --> 29:13.960
We don't have any say in this either. Yeah, we don't have any say. What can we just do it? Come on.

29:14.280 --> 29:19.320
It's Friday. I don't want to have to do come up with something on the fly. Okay, fine. Why don't you

29:19.320 --> 29:24.280
continue the segment and then see try to get some more of our participation? Because it seems like you're

29:24.280 --> 29:34.440
just lecturing right now. You chime in. I want your thoughts. Romaterials. Highs. Tant leather goods.

29:34.440 --> 29:39.160
Okay. It starts with the skin of cows and there's no way around that. Unless you're talking vegan

29:39.160 --> 29:43.240
leather, which is a different conversation. But let's talk about it. There are ways around it.

29:43.240 --> 29:50.840
You said there's no way around it. In this instance, if she wants genuine leather,

29:50.840 --> 29:56.840
that's the raw material is cows being slaughtered for me and the skin being used for leather.

29:56.840 --> 30:02.520
Suddenly, the leather is brought from the farm to a supplier who specializes in hides.

30:02.520 --> 30:06.360
Okay. Are you with me? That's all I just with you. I'm with you. It's all fine.

30:07.320 --> 30:13.160
From the supplier goes the manufacturer, right? Where is the supplier? Uh-huh.

30:16.200 --> 30:21.480
The supplier again through logistics sends the hides to a manufacturer

30:21.480 --> 30:28.600
who turns the hides into pants. Man, that's logistics. There's no way around that.

30:28.600 --> 30:34.760
It's logistics. It has its stands, which is part of the problem. From the manufacturer,

30:34.840 --> 30:43.960
our borne, the trousers, and we're awful able to, such a weird way to put it.

30:45.960 --> 30:51.400
What you're looking at when you're in this space, where the pants are in a warehouse of the manufacturer,

30:52.280 --> 30:57.080
who knows where the leather belt is in this country. That's where the buck stops for me.

30:58.680 --> 31:03.480
But at this point, in this supply chain, there's just boxes and boxes of leather pants,

31:03.480 --> 31:11.320
which Gianna wants as the consumer. How is it going to get from the manufacturer to Gianna?

31:11.320 --> 31:17.800
That's where logistics comes in. So the distributor enters the frame just a little bit,

31:17.800 --> 31:24.280
and then it fully, the frame, after a while. Unnecessary. So you don't have to say that,

31:24.280 --> 31:29.720
just say the distributor enters the frame. And also speed up because obviously, this is dragging along.

31:30.680 --> 31:36.040
Let's say Gianna wants to get him from Madewell. Sorry, that's offensive, Gianna, but

31:37.800 --> 31:42.840
it's not just going to be stocked on shelves, just because it's in the manufacturer's warehouse.

31:42.840 --> 31:49.320
It has to get there. So through logistics, it's shipped via a distributor, right? So whether that's

31:49.320 --> 31:56.840
a DHL, whether that's a FedEx, it has to get there some way, or the company, if it's big enough,

31:56.920 --> 32:02.680
or smart enough, might have their own trucks and use shipping companies, right? So suddenly,

32:02.680 --> 32:08.120
through logistics, and there's no way around that, these trucks are trucking them to the retailer,

32:08.120 --> 32:13.720
right? That's all, that's all communication. That's all emails. This phone calls that logistics.

32:13.720 --> 32:21.080
Suddenly, now the shelves are stocked with leather pants. Now Madewell has the opportunity to

32:21.080 --> 32:25.480
connect with the consumer, the consumer being Gianna, and that is also, that doesn't just stick.

32:25.480 --> 32:30.760
I don't, I really wish I had stuff to contribute to this segment, but man, you're just, um,

32:30.760 --> 32:35.960
I don't know. You're so, yeah, you're so knowledgeable about something that we really can't

32:35.960 --> 32:41.480
wax about, like, not even have any funny sides or anything like that. So, you're, I mean,

32:41.480 --> 32:48.600
this is just an ad for Madewell. I keep seeing these billboards in Brooklyn that say that you're

32:48.680 --> 32:54.040
seven minutes from jeans, and it's just a Madewell billboard that's like, you're here,

32:54.040 --> 33:01.160
our store is here, and they make it look like a threat. Yeah. Anyway, at this point in the conversation,

33:01.160 --> 33:06.440
Gianna walks into a Madewell leather pants are there because of this chain, and mostly logistics.

33:06.440 --> 33:11.160
There's no way around that. Okay. Okay. So, that's sort of the world that we're living in. You're

33:11.160 --> 33:16.360
not just, you're not living in a world where you walk to Main Street anymore. You go to the

33:16.360 --> 33:22.440
Tanner, and he has pants that he got from his farm made into leather pants himself, and as

33:22.440 --> 33:26.680
it's going to sell to you to the consumer. That, that would be localization, which I'm for, but doesn't

33:26.680 --> 33:31.160
exist. Um, doesn't exist anywhere. I don't care what anybody says. It's all supply chain. It's all

33:31.160 --> 33:35.000
logistics, and there's no way around it. Here, and do you guys see what's fucked up about this?

33:38.200 --> 33:43.480
No, but we don't really care, right? Like, we've been, I think, I've been expressing my

33:43.960 --> 33:49.640
distaste for the segment and also the anger that just laden within me about this show and about

33:49.640 --> 33:57.800
being around you all the time. And I genuinely hope that what you have to say next is going to be

33:57.800 --> 34:02.760
somewhat insightful or moderately funny to kind of save the segment as it stands.

34:05.720 --> 34:12.360
This is how you have another slide that supply chain being fixed. All right. The fuck

34:12.360 --> 34:17.400
up part about how it stands right now is that it is too global. A ship getting stuck in a

34:17.400 --> 34:23.640
canal shouldn't be the reason why Gianna can't get for lack of better term bridges leather or

34:23.640 --> 34:29.640
otherwise, she should be able to walk to a local Tanner in my opinion, uh, so that you can shop local.

34:29.640 --> 34:35.720
You can shop small American Express style. Here's how we might get there. Maybe steps. Keep in

34:35.720 --> 34:39.800
mind, this is all baby steps because you're not going to go from a global economy to the local

34:39.800 --> 34:43.880
economy like that. You know, you're not going to go from a gas powered vehicles to EVs like that.

34:43.880 --> 34:50.280
It's going to make you wise, by the way. I just want you to know that let's let's go through

34:50.280 --> 34:58.040
the leather pants through my version. Okay. Gianna still the consumer wants leather pants. She's

34:58.040 --> 35:05.560
craving them. That's the difference. Instead of demanding, she's craving. Demand and Craver, very,

35:05.560 --> 35:13.160
very, very close, very, very. And also. Yeah. What's the difference? What are you getting at?

35:14.760 --> 35:19.720
As it stands, the consumer demands. Don't go back. Don't go back. Push for my

35:19.720 --> 35:26.920
drivers. The consumer would crave because it's going to take a certain hunger to have any sort of

35:26.920 --> 35:33.640
structural change in our economy, in the way that products are delivered to people like Gianna. Is that

35:33.720 --> 35:42.280
fair to say? Yes. Gianna will leave you go. Promise materials. Still necessary. Yeah. Because

35:42.280 --> 35:47.160
you're not going to just, you're not just going to have pants. You have to have the material that

35:47.160 --> 35:52.680
creates the pants. So that's the leather. That's from a farm or whatever. Okay. From there, it takes tons of

35:52.680 --> 35:59.720
planning, which by the way is part of logistics. Planning is part of logistics. Yeah. And I'm actually

35:59.720 --> 36:03.880
just, I'm just going to steam roll through this. Yes. The circuit communication also just a huge

36:03.880 --> 36:10.200
part of logistics in general. Skill drivers, I guess, is logistics. It's a real simpler. It's really just

36:10.200 --> 36:14.680
can you drive a truck? Do you have a license? Yes. I would say you didn't. But continue. I see what you're saying.

36:14.680 --> 36:19.560
I can. Okay. Well, the way that, okay. So if anything, the way you put it makes it even more of a

36:19.560 --> 36:26.200
logistical issue. And also necessary arrangements and then vend whatever the hell that means.

36:26.200 --> 36:36.520
Well, yes. So. Yes. So. Yes. So. So. Not funny. Okay. You can stop now. And then yeah, it's pretty much all logistics, right?

36:38.680 --> 36:43.320
I'll give you tons of planning. I'll give you an necessary communication. I'll give you skill drivers.

36:45.800 --> 36:50.680
Necessary arrangements to me. It feels a little more playful than logistics. It's more like,

36:50.680 --> 36:53.560
well, I'll make the necessary arrangements. And it's like you're finding someone across

36:53.560 --> 37:00.280
Ms. President. So that's or you're setting a reservation for bay. You know, John. Let's say you're talking,

37:00.280 --> 37:07.160
you're comparing driving a UPS truck or DHL truck driving to a retailer to picking out a Christmas

37:07.160 --> 37:16.200
present for bay. That is not, that is they're incomparable. And necessary arrangements from a DHL

37:16.200 --> 37:23.000
truck to a retailer. That is logistics. Yeah. This is not how I thought this was going to go.

37:23.000 --> 37:27.080
I thought you guys, I did think you guys would be a little bit more knowledgeable in this. And you've

37:27.080 --> 37:31.320
admitted to not knowing Jack shit about it. So I have to take everything you're saying with a grain of salt.

37:32.200 --> 37:37.640
But also you're making some good points. But it is lucky. They are lucky guesses. And do you recognize that?

37:39.080 --> 37:45.560
I recognize that. Why would we know about this? Yeah. We work at a podcast network. So to

37:45.560 --> 37:50.600
all. You know is a major. I was a film major. Why should I know about supply chain? But here we are

37:50.600 --> 37:55.160
talking about it. Why should you? Why should you know that? I guarantee if somebody went to

37:55.160 --> 38:01.240
if anybody listening as an MBA they know that I'm speaking wise. I guarantee. Are you qualified to

38:01.240 --> 38:08.360
speak about this? Are you qualified to speak with us? Yeah. You don't have any kind of credentials.

38:08.360 --> 38:14.200
If anything, you went on Reddit explained like I'm five. And then you can go and through the motions

38:14.200 --> 38:21.080
of reading through the supply chain thread. Business admin degree. What is that? That's that

38:21.080 --> 38:25.320
qualifies somebody to talk about any of this? Yeah, but you don't have that. Yes. I'm not. I'm saying

38:25.320 --> 38:29.960
oh, because I disagree. I think that it's all bullshit. All of this is nonsense. You want to talk about

38:29.960 --> 38:33.400
this not being a right fit for this podcast. It's the perfect fit for this podcast. Because people

38:33.400 --> 38:41.160
over complicate nonsense. And this show I'm trying to get it down to a base level. This is too much.

38:42.120 --> 38:49.560
This isn't good to hear or see or to be. Exactly. Yes. I agree with you. You want to fill a

38:49.560 --> 38:57.800
Southical level, but on a literal level. It's just, it's like not funny. This is not the reaction.

38:57.800 --> 39:04.920
Then when you're not. No fun. It's not fun. You go. Yeah. Keep going. No. We'll defend yourself. Please.

39:04.920 --> 39:10.840
Fine. Let's just move on then. Okay. We have more to get to anyways. Thank God. And I'm sure

39:11.400 --> 39:17.240
you guys just don't feel proud of what you just did. I'm not proud of what we just did because of

39:17.240 --> 39:24.360
anything. We just, we're just terrorizing our listeners with terrible segments. Don't sit like that.

39:24.360 --> 39:28.840
Don't sit all relaxed like you're. You should be on edge right now.

39:41.480 --> 39:56.200
I hope you're having a decent time on the podcast. I know that it's a little hard to kind of

39:56.200 --> 40:02.600
be around Jeff all the time. I mean, I know it more than anybody else, but I hope you're

40:02.600 --> 40:08.520
not much so fucking wrong. Yeah. I'm having a great time though. Yeah. You don't have to lie. It's okay.

40:11.720 --> 40:16.440
All right. Jeff, what do you got next? I'm getting comfortable. You should have gotten

40:16.440 --> 40:19.800
comfortable before we started recording. Yeah. I was. And then it changed.

40:22.120 --> 40:29.080
All right. That changed. Why is that relatable? Janna, do you like reality TV?

40:29.800 --> 40:36.680
I fucking love reality TV. Perfect. Johnny, do you watch reality TV? Yes. I love HG TV, which is

40:37.240 --> 40:41.800
somewhat a step removed from reality, but yeah. The furniture is real.

40:43.720 --> 40:48.200
I love HG TV, which is a step beyond reality, but the furniture is real.

40:49.480 --> 40:59.800
A little horrible sentence. Well, listen, I, you know, in a very vague way, I work in content here.

41:00.360 --> 41:06.120
Used to more than I do now, but, you know, we're talking about what we can do on the video

41:06.120 --> 41:10.200
of the side of things, and also on the TV side of things. You know, whether we're going to turn

41:10.200 --> 41:13.800
or have you got my originals into TV shows? We haven't yet, but maybe we will in the future.

41:14.200 --> 41:17.560
I'm saying skip that step, because some of these podcasts work better as podcasts,

41:17.560 --> 41:23.720
then they want us TV shows. I'm wondering if we get into the easiest TV game, which is reality,

41:24.440 --> 41:28.680
and if we kind of come up with a couple reality show pitches that the three of us,

41:28.760 --> 41:32.200
that we can bring to the content team and say, let's take this out.

41:34.040 --> 41:39.720
I'll start with, I'll start, and then guys come have an ear. Yeah, I have a few, you, I just

41:39.720 --> 41:44.360
prepare a few, yeah, and can't wait for you to hear them. So go on, Jeff,

41:45.240 --> 41:50.360
hoarding with the herwises. Okay. So it's a reality show that follows the new haven, herwises,

41:50.360 --> 41:55.320
as they collect and stockpile brick a bracket, and that would be kind of a keeping up with the

41:55.320 --> 41:59.640
Kardashians meets hoarders. And it would be a little bit of a twist, though, because hoarders

41:59.640 --> 42:05.560
is kind of about people who have certain, I think mental illnesses, honestly, but with this,

42:05.560 --> 42:11.240
it's then, who are, they're not prone to hoarding, and the show is making them hoard.

42:14.120 --> 42:19.160
What are they hoarding specifically? You said brick a bracket, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick,

42:19.240 --> 42:25.640
yeah, stuff like that. Boxes of trinkets, you know, okay. So, said it's keeping up with the

42:25.640 --> 42:30.280
with the Kardashians, mixed with hoarders. It's just following their lives as people who hoard

42:30.280 --> 42:35.000
things. I don't think that's really interesting. It's maybe just following them, and then there's

42:35.000 --> 42:40.120
this like weird tertiary thing where every episode, it's them like getting another box of shit.

42:42.040 --> 42:46.520
They just, oh, it's an unboxing. That could be a YouTube series. It's a reverse unboxing.

42:47.480 --> 42:52.680
Yeah, they're just putting something like the emotional journey. Like when you watch hoarders,

42:52.680 --> 42:57.800
it's like so that you can get that catharsis at the end when they're like, are no longer a hoarder.

42:59.080 --> 43:04.920
Where's the journey here? Yeah. It's a good point, Gianna. There might not, yeah,

43:05.640 --> 43:08.920
there might not be a journey in this one. But if you're looking for a journey, I do have an idea

43:08.920 --> 43:13.480
for that. That's very journey focused. Okay. Why don't you say that then? Epic's villa.

43:13.880 --> 43:22.440
Okay. Have you guys seen Epic villas? Yes. So this would be Epic's villa. So it's a show that

43:22.440 --> 43:31.640
follows Gianni on an Odyssey on Epic's. It's the show is hopefully we want to land it at

43:31.640 --> 43:38.840
Epic's, but it's also you going on an Epic. So it's Epic villa meets you, Lissies. Oh, okay.

43:38.840 --> 43:44.600
Like you as Odysseus. No, it'd be Gianni as Gianni, but like he maybe gets distracted by

43:44.600 --> 43:50.280
sirens at some point. Okay. Okay. I will watch the fuck out of that. This feels more like a fictional

43:50.280 --> 43:57.480
series. Like no. Yeah. So it would basically be like you show up on day one. And there's this whole

43:57.880 --> 44:02.760
Odyssey set up for you to kind of go through. And like we all know the heroes journey structure,

44:02.760 --> 44:06.680
but it would like so you have a loose idea of what's going to happen. Like you will make it home

44:06.760 --> 44:14.280
eventually. But it's like survivor. Yeah. Honestly, it's Epic villas meets Lissies meets survivor.

44:15.080 --> 44:19.640
All right. I am actually completely on board with this idea. Yeah. I kind of think I do not want

44:19.640 --> 44:26.120
is to be with Epic. I think that's the one. Yeah. That's well, that's I'm walking if we don't

44:26.120 --> 44:30.040
land with Epic's. And because the whole point is that it's Epic's villa instead of Epic villas.

44:30.600 --> 44:36.200
Yeah. But actually a quick note on the title. You can't put a trademark name.

44:36.760 --> 44:45.000
In the title. I understand. Yeah. What about MSNBC? MSNBC villa? No, I'm saying like what about NBC news.

44:45.000 --> 44:50.440
NBC news is on NBC. Yeah. Because they're part of the same company. The same current company.

44:50.440 --> 44:54.520
Yeah. I'm saying Epic's villa on Epic. So it would be the parent company or whatever.

44:55.240 --> 44:59.560
Yeah. But like I thought this was like a head gun show. Well, it would be not the whole

44:59.560 --> 45:03.160
price. This would be like hitch to reality or just to television. It's still be on TV.

45:03.880 --> 45:08.200
Yeah. There's such a slim chance that we'd get this picked up one. And also an even

45:08.200 --> 45:17.720
slimmer chance that we would land with Epic's. All right. Then forget that one. Okay.

45:17.720 --> 45:24.840
Fine. Let's hear one of yours, Johnny. Okay. This one was the best idea I had. How old are

45:24.840 --> 45:31.560
you Jeffrey? I'm 24. Okay. 24. What is your natural citizenship? America? Okay.

45:32.280 --> 45:38.840
Yeah. Have you lived in the United States for over 14 years? Yeah. Okay. So this show is called

45:38.840 --> 45:46.360
Jeffrey 2032. This is the first year of Jeffrey that you're able to actually run for

45:46.360 --> 45:52.520
president of the United States. We can finally start putting some of those Patriot on Dollars to use

45:53.240 --> 45:57.960
fund some very, very small stage campaign and some random town. That's already a campaign.

45:57.960 --> 46:03.320
But finance violation. But yeah. Did you know that a dog recently became elected mayor?

46:03.320 --> 46:08.760
There's like two years ago, I think. Do you know about that? In Idaho? I don't remember the

46:08.760 --> 46:13.640
place, but it seems like you do. Is Idaho out as had a dog mayor for like 20 years? Yeah. Yeah.

46:13.640 --> 46:20.840
And you know how politicians are just glorified dogs, right? Yeah. Sure. Imagine if we can just

46:20.840 --> 46:29.320
run the gambit. Yeah. Hop. Sorry. It's run the gamut. Not gambit. Gambit. It's gamut.

46:29.320 --> 46:35.080
Run the gamut. It is gamut. It is gamut. G-A-M-U-T. I'm going to have to go with Jeff on this one.

46:35.080 --> 46:43.400
Okay. Well, that was when we drove the pitch in time. Right. But like this kind of was like,

46:44.040 --> 46:50.120
uh, uh, my world is crumbling before my very eyes because Grammarly didn't even say shit about this.

46:50.680 --> 46:56.440
Okay. That was, it makes me feel like it is a horror. Yeah, but now we're not like,

46:56.440 --> 46:59.800
you're looking for the gamut. That's the idea because we haven't even gotten to it.

46:59.800 --> 47:04.760
No, it's like gambit. Gamut? I don't know. I'm just looking at Queen's Gambit on Netflix.

47:04.760 --> 47:09.080
The Queen's Gambit? Yeah. Nope. Yeah. So it's a one-to-one confusion for you.

47:09.960 --> 47:16.440
Well, eventually, we'll run the gamut and eventually work our way up to a seat in the white house.

47:18.600 --> 47:23.960
Why did you say it like that? So it's a campaign trail docky series. Yeah. A not reality

47:23.960 --> 47:30.840
TV and B not going to happen. It is kind of reality television. You know, you know, how there's a

47:30.840 --> 47:39.160
sliver of fiction in every, uh, every reality television series. Yeah. Yeah. So we have a fiction here

47:39.160 --> 47:44.840
be that I didn't get a White House seat, but we're saying in the show that we did, I did. No, no, no,

47:44.840 --> 47:48.200
you will get the White House seat. And I'm just saying that we're just going to come in. Also,

47:48.200 --> 47:52.040
White House seat doesn't exist. I think I just said that. That would just be the presidency.

47:52.040 --> 47:58.040
Yeah, it's the presidency in the oval office. Okay. Yeah. So that's my idea. Your ideas

47:58.040 --> 48:02.920
follow me as I get elected president. Correct. Yeah. It's not going to happen. I think it could

48:02.920 --> 48:08.280
happen genuinely. You have to at least pitch it in a way where it's like whether he gets the presidency

48:08.280 --> 48:14.040
or not, it'll still be interesting. Yeah. I mean, like we'll follow your campaign trail and

48:14.040 --> 48:19.000
God forbid you lose, which you probably won't. If you do happen to lose, then we can just

48:19.640 --> 48:26.280
next few seasons will just be you starting from scratch again for the next four years. I think this

48:26.360 --> 48:31.960
is a very sustainable series because they're very young, you're very spy. And you know how these

48:31.960 --> 48:39.480
old folks are getting into the presidency game. Joe Biden, 107 years old or 70 years. I don't have

48:39.480 --> 48:45.960
any experience. I don't have any interest in this. So, you know, there's so many arguments to be made

48:45.960 --> 48:52.600
against me as a candidate that I would also agree with. Well, I mean, would you argue that

48:53.560 --> 48:59.320
and I don't mean to bring him up, open up that old wound, but would you argue that the dog

48:59.320 --> 49:08.120
mayor had the any interest or anything like that? That's that I if this show would already have

49:08.120 --> 49:12.200
more legs if you were saying that I was running for mayor because maybe I would have interest in

49:12.200 --> 49:17.560
that and could actually do it of a spy town. Fine, Jeffrey, for mayor, we could do and then we just

49:17.640 --> 49:23.160
ramp it up and spin off serious Jeffrey. No, I can't solve it. Jeffrey is more than the mayor, but yeah.

49:25.640 --> 49:31.480
All right, not a bad idea. We got to a good place with it. Okay. What about glove island?

49:32.280 --> 49:38.200
Half hoties, half full bodies. Everyone in chunky sweater and sweaters and winter clothes,

49:38.200 --> 49:43.960
who is hot? Who is not? Find out on glove island. Love island meets 90 day fiance.

49:44.600 --> 49:50.440
How does it meet 90 day fiance? Because wasn't there that like really ugly looking dude?

49:51.000 --> 49:58.200
There was. Yeah. So it's half hoties. This is not a body positive show. We should say.

49:58.200 --> 50:04.600
Yeah, that sounded fucked up to me. Yeah, so this is definitely not going to sell

50:05.400 --> 50:11.400
on television and call. I mean, they do say, oh, what have we got Amy Sherman Paladino attached to

50:11.400 --> 50:17.480
ZEP? Because she loves making fun of who's Amy Sherman Paladino? Really? Who the fuck is that?

50:17.480 --> 50:22.440
She created Gilmore girls. She created Gilmore girls and marvelous, marvelous, amazing.

50:23.800 --> 50:31.160
So many fat phobic jokes in her shows. It's interesting. So maybe yeah, I think if we can get her

50:31.160 --> 50:36.520
her backing behind it, she could probably because she hasn't been in the reality space yet. Yeah.

50:36.520 --> 50:41.320
So I think it's interesting. I also think that there's a logistical issue because I think

50:41.320 --> 50:46.360
you can still tell what someone's body type is, even if they're wearing a sweater.

50:48.920 --> 50:55.960
Yeah, I think gee, I'm just pretty right about that. Wow. So yeah, you should probably be more

50:55.960 --> 51:00.200
body positive and the fact that you came up with that idea. Yeah, it's just a show.

51:01.320 --> 51:05.240
Yeah, but like the fact that the inkling was in your head and passed through like several layers

51:05.240 --> 51:10.600
of consciousness before you put it down on paper or wrote it down somewhere. Just kind of

51:11.800 --> 51:19.080
just paints a picture about you. Yeah, your values. But I think like you have a solid pitch.

51:19.960 --> 51:27.320
I think you just need to scrap it entirely. Yeah. Yeah. Um, sorry about that. Yeah, that's fine.

51:27.320 --> 51:37.960
Do you want to hear my pitch? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Let's just move on. Hexkyum. What? Hexkyum.

51:38.440 --> 51:44.920
Ha ha ha ha. That's a poem. Me man. You know, do you guys remember nexkyum? Yeah, nexkyum. The

51:44.920 --> 51:51.960
cult that was just recently busted for a lot of charges, money laundering, racketeering and

51:51.960 --> 51:59.880
fraud to name the lowest, lowest charges. Overall, very bad group of guys. It was like self-help

51:59.880 --> 52:07.000
thing, right? Yeah, like self-help. All right, but it was a cult. Yeah. But that said,

52:07.080 --> 52:11.560
now that they're busted, there is a huge gap in the market for a cult to take their place.

52:12.840 --> 52:17.560
Their practices are actually available through, uh, for public consumption through their

52:17.560 --> 52:22.360
court documents. So we can see exactly how they coerce people into joining something, you know,

52:22.360 --> 52:28.840
bigger than they think. Um, bigger than they are, bigger than they think. Yeah, that is what they think.

52:29.640 --> 52:35.080
It's kind of both. Yeah. You would never be able to be a cult leader because you're selling it.

52:35.640 --> 52:45.080
Do you want to be part of something bigger than you think? Uh, no. Oh, okay. Sorry.

52:46.280 --> 52:52.920
I'm thinking that, uh, we have a pretty huge talent roster ahead gum that could host this.

52:52.920 --> 52:57.640
I think we could have Finn Wolfhard be the figureheads and she already has such a big following.

52:58.760 --> 53:03.560
We can start looking in places where people feel like they don't belong like, uh, uh,

53:03.560 --> 53:08.840
ahead gum live or gaming conventions or Comic Con or some shit like that. What was that first one?

53:08.840 --> 53:13.560
Sorry. I said, what was that a game of conventions? No, you said,

53:13.560 --> 53:18.600
ahead gum live. The live shows. Oh, did I? Did I say that? Which, you're actually factually

53:18.600 --> 53:22.440
incorrect because those are probably filled with people who, it is filled with people who connect

53:22.440 --> 53:26.760
on the same thing because they all came for that thing. Oh, so they all went there there. They

53:26.840 --> 53:34.280
feel like they do belong. Hmm. Yeah. Oh, okay. So like gaming conventions, though, Comic Con,

53:34.280 --> 53:41.480
yeah, again, they're all connected. Yeah. You think that's a good idea or

53:42.600 --> 53:48.120
no, I'm just kind of like, I'm not going to get out of ways. Yeah. Let's move on. Is that the entire idea?

53:50.120 --> 53:53.800
Yeah, that's the entire idea. Is it a show where you just want to start a cult? This is a show.

53:53.880 --> 54:00.760
We'll follow, follow the rise of headgeum. It could also be called anything. It could just be

54:00.760 --> 54:08.440
called head gum. It doesn't have to rhyme with nixium. Yeah. But I like, I like the name nexium a lot.

54:08.440 --> 54:18.120
I think that was pretty, pretty catchy. And, and, and hexium. Hexium. Hexium. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like so like

54:18.760 --> 54:25.160
a harsh sounding to a point where you have to remember it. Yeah. Yeah. No one knows how to spell it.

54:25.160 --> 54:35.240
So they can't Google it. Okay. Yeah. Well. Yeah. Well. Yeah. There's a bunch of freaks try to make

54:35.240 --> 54:40.360
things work. Get them to the Greek meets beauty in the geek hosted by Russell brand.

54:41.320 --> 54:46.680
Hoseby Russell brand. He doesly. There's no way we don't have, we don't have access to Russell brand.

54:46.680 --> 54:51.800
Russell brand at all. He's free. He's a veil. He's definitely a veil. Yeah. It doesn't matter.

54:51.800 --> 54:55.960
He's, we still have to go through his agent. And we don't even know if he's going to want to talk

54:55.960 --> 55:01.240
to us and all that. It's, how hard could it get me to get a meeting with brand to say,

55:01.240 --> 55:07.160
hey, I'll offer, by the way. We are offering you the role of host of oddballs and vaginal walls.

55:07.480 --> 55:15.000
First of kind of fucked up or like washed up. Like what does he do now? He does inspirational

55:15.000 --> 55:21.400
talks. Is that what he does? See, you can get Russell. Actually, I would love to get brand on this show.

55:21.400 --> 55:27.080
Maybe my goal for this show of next year is to get like really big guests. That would be insane.

55:27.080 --> 55:30.520
I'd love that. That would be insane. It's hard. Every time you have a big guest on a podcast,

55:30.520 --> 55:36.200
though, it's like nerve wracking and not fun. Yeah, especially this podcast, which

55:37.880 --> 55:44.760
for lack of a better term, assaults every guest. Johnny, do you have any more ideas or

55:44.760 --> 55:53.240
do you have any ideas? I don't know. You go. I just want to say I would watch the

55:53.240 --> 55:58.840
fuck out of whatever that show that you just said was. One of the great joys in life, and I think

55:58.840 --> 56:06.120
is watching like hot girls and they're ugly little boyfriends exist. That's a good reality,

56:06.280 --> 56:12.600
I think it's a good idea. It is. My next idea is called gum shoes.

56:13.880 --> 56:20.280
So Jeffrey, you and I are going to solve crimes. Okay. I don't think it gets, it doesn't get any

56:20.280 --> 56:25.960
simpler than that. Well, there are a lot of cold case files that are available in public domain.

56:25.960 --> 56:31.800
So we just find that and we're kind of on our way. And the whole season can revolve around

56:31.800 --> 56:37.880
a specific case, just like overarching plot. Yeah. A missing dog or a stolen wallet with a

56:37.880 --> 56:45.080
bunch of mini cases along the way. Like we're stopping J walkers or people are skating. Yeah,

56:45.080 --> 56:54.360
people who are I mean skating. I mean, don't go up to skateboarders and say stop.

56:55.800 --> 57:01.000
I mean, sometimes I have you seen the signs, no skating in a skate, in a skate zone?

57:01.480 --> 57:07.480
Yeah. I mean, it's, that's like building members being cops. Yeah. But I think we, we don't,

57:07.480 --> 57:13.000
I also don't like the word cops. I think cops are just like, there's such a bad connotation.

57:13.000 --> 57:19.000
What you and I are crime fighters, really, or detectives, gum shoes, really.

57:20.840 --> 57:24.520
And you don't want to write this as like a sitcom, like there's so, there's so much room there

57:24.520 --> 57:29.960
if you and I are like detectives, freelance, that could be really funny. It was scripted and absurd.

57:29.960 --> 57:34.920
Instead, you want to actually try and solve cold case files, which we don't have any detective

57:34.920 --> 57:42.040
backgrounds. It's also so disrespectful. Disrespectful to who?

57:43.240 --> 57:46.520
Like, these are real people. Yeah, their family's so

57:46.520 --> 57:59.800
spicy. I think we can do right by them. You think, like, no, on paper, it's kind of disrespectful.

57:59.800 --> 58:05.880
I think I understand where you're coming from. Slightly, I understand. But if we can solve these,

58:05.880 --> 58:11.160
what kind of people, we can't. That's why it's disrespectful, because we think we can figure it out.

58:12.120 --> 58:19.000
You do, and we can't. You have such little faith in the speech. How am I going to have

58:19.000 --> 58:23.480
you as my partner in crime? Don't tell people in the room, even if we did take this out,

58:23.480 --> 58:30.520
don't tell people in the room, you have such little faith in this speech. What bad etiquette.

58:33.800 --> 58:35.400
You think this sucks, don't you?

58:36.040 --> 58:42.680
Yeah. Actually, we kind of liked it, but that was really aggressive. So now we're not sure

58:42.680 --> 58:49.240
about working with you. Really, really. Yeah. Those are those are my big pitches. All right.

58:49.240 --> 58:54.840
This isn't reality television, but I've been waiting for an opportunity to pitch my version of

58:54.840 --> 59:01.160
the notebook without the old people, because I think that the old people fucking ruin the notebook.

59:01.240 --> 59:07.880
How? I think it is. I haven't seen the notebook, but don't they provide some sort of conflict

59:07.880 --> 59:13.640
between the two lovers in the notebook? Well, the plot is like, you see these old people at the

59:13.640 --> 59:18.280
beginning and they're old and the lady has dementia and there's like this old man who's reading

59:18.280 --> 59:27.000
her story. Jeffrey, don't look your phone. He's just thinking. He's thinking hard about the old people.

59:27.080 --> 59:32.280
And he reads her the story and then you get like flashbacks to the forties and it's like, you know,

59:32.280 --> 59:37.960
this beautiful love story. At the end, you find out that the whole love story that you've been

59:37.960 --> 59:43.400
watching is the old people's love story and it's been raining it to her so that she can remember

59:44.200 --> 59:51.960
and then at the end, they die together and you know, whatever. Isn't that still cute? Like,

59:51.960 --> 01:00:01.800
it's a romance movie, right? But old people are off putting in not sexy. So, okay. So that's where

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:08.360
your standpoint is. That's old, no clapping. No need to clap people suck. Old people do suck. It's a

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:13.000
beautiful love story in and of itself. If you watched the movie, you would understand this. You

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.440
don't need the old people to sell the love story. There's no way that I stand alone on this.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:23.240
Like, this is such a weird stance that you guys are taking. They also age doesn't look like,

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:29.080
they look like, you got to have some actors. Yeah, you do. Everybody needs a one bias and for me,

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:36.280
it's old people. That's a good phobia. I hate kids. Oh, my God. That's a hot sentence. That's

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:42.600
okay. They hate old people like it. They're like, our future is like me. You,

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:50.280
so narcissistic. You have a god complex. You got to be James Bond. You also said you solved

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:56.280
cold case files. We're all narcissists. Gianna spent $300 on a coat or something.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:03.000
Or something. Yeah, she spent $300 on clothes. That doesn't make her a narcissist. I don't.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.160
Yeah, there's $1,000 shoes. Okay, that makes you a narcissist. My boyfriend got this.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:21.640
So John's rich. You got to stem me. Yeah. What about this dancing with the cars?

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:28.200
Professional dancers pair up with various Mazda's in this ballroom dancing competition

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:37.720
featuring horseless carriages starring Gianna Kenshin. Don't show her ego. She likes the fact that she's

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.400
going to dance with a Mazda. No, she's not going to dance. She's going to hoax. She's the

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:47.800
tire base. Oh, dancing with the cars. I am tire banks. Well, that incident was a new film. That

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:55.720
tire is a role. Yeah, we're all narcissists. She's just as host. Yeah. Yeah, I fuck with that. All right.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:03.000
And then my last one is Amir's fears. Louise, I'm your blue and fell faces a new fear every episode.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:10.040
Fear factor meets biggest loser. I don't know. It's the biggest loser in all the show.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:19.640
Just he is. He's the biggest. That's just a title for him. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Well, that one is just

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:26.920
a mean, mean pitch. Even if the people in the pitching room, whatever the hell is called,

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:32.120
even if they didn't know whom your blue and felled was, they'd realize that it's just a mean

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:39.800
spirited pitch towards somebody else. You're like antagonizing somebody else. All right. All right.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:44.360
Like, you, you hear what I'm saying and you don't want to do the pitch anymore or,

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:48.920
like, you shot it down. It's over. Yeah. It's okay. Good.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:59.640
I hope this, I hope this taught us all very good lesson about ourselves.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:07.960
Then we're all very narcissistic, I think. We should probably go to therapy or something. I don't know.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:26.200
Bloods. John, what do you have? Go on. What do you want to point people to?

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.160
So this is how you want to end the show with such

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:34.600
sour energy. Such, this is just bad energy. All right.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:42.680
Don't be so, now you're like, you're carrying it over to us and it's kind of, it's actually ruining the mood a lot.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:51.720
What do you want for me, man? You want me to be smiling while I'm feeling absolute poison on the inside

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:58.200
from you. Yeah. When, like, a professional performer will turn that off. That kind of separate

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.880
whatever is, whatever negative energy they have and just try to turn it into something positive.

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.280
Okay. Like who?

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.400
Like who?

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.640
Digmiley Cyrus does that. Absolutely. She does. Yes.

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:17.240
Because she's a professional. All right. Are you a professional?

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:25.240
I am. Okay. So bring up the energy. All right. There we go. See, John. What do you want to point the people to?

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:29.160
Okay. Your eyes are watering, but that's okay. You can just push through it.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:38.040
It's, it's, I'm having, I'm, I'm happy. Okay.

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:46.360
Can I do my fucking plug? Yeah. Thanks. Follow me on Instagram at Gianna.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:55.480
G-I-O-N-N-A. Tell me that I am a delicate flower. Tell me. No. No way.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:58.280
We've got to cut the choice. We've got to cut my face.

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:06.520
Bring's meaning to your otherwise meaningless life. Wow. You, you're on the wrong spot for your.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:12.360
Tell me that in the comments. Yeah. Tell me that in the comments. We'll see. I mean, last time.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:18.360
Say that to them. I'm just seeing how far I could take it. Listen, last time. We'll did it.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.560
Nice. You guys better fucking do it. Or else I'm going to look stupid.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.320
You're just like, make sure you're right. Yeah. Make it look stupid, please.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:32.920
Johnny. Follow me on Instagram at JohnnyVJLH and N-Y-V-I-I.

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:37.400
And that's it. At Jeffrey James on Instagram at Jeff by already on Twitter.

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:43.080
And we have some special, have gone podcast episodes coming in the next three weeks. So,

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:47.960
look out for those. We have a two-part, or I believe, for the holidays. A holiday special.

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:56.920
Extravagants are. And it'll be good. Until then, have a great weekend. But not too great.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:02.120
Terrible way to end it. No, because you want it to be, you want to have stuff to look forward to.

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:07.320
And if you went, like, when we did the live show in New York, I was like depressed for two

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:12.200
weeks after that. No, no, no, no. Because it was such a high. And then I went from there to a

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.800
physical low, being in my basement apartment. And I was like sad.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:42.120
That was a hit dumb original.

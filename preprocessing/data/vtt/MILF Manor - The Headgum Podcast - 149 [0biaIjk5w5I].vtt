WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:30.000 --> 00:52.000
Welcome to the first time in the second time.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
We're coming in with a lot of mismatched energy today.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
We've also got some segments here that are going to be polarizing for sure.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
But let's just all introduce ourselves for the audio listeners and then we'll get on

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
with this shit.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Let's start with Joel.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
The name is Joel.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Moving on.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Marika.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
My name is Marika.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Brad.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
It's going to be.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
I'm Brad.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
I'm mad at you.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Why?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Because we didn't climb.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
You fucking ghosted me.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
You're sick.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Just focus on being sick.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
It's by the way.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Focus on being sick.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Focus on Jeff ghosting you.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Yeah.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
You didn't even fucking text me back.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I was packing.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
I don't care.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
So let's try to go to Gabriel.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
I didn't know that.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
You told me the week before that you were going to be around and that you would go climb with me.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
I was a builder.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
We were supposed to go bouldering.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
All right.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I think Jeff was scared.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Yes.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Brad's really good at climbing.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
I haven't climbed for like two months.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Right?

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
So I'm not going to do well.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I have something to say about this.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Revenge is a dish best served bouldering.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
That's awful.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Joel.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
You said that was really really.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
I really like no.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
He said he said that's one liner.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
I said Joel during.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And that's gold.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Joel.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Now.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Can I be better than I ghosted you?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
But I might come to Portland.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
I don't care.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Why?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
What do you mean why?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
You know what?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Don't come to Portland.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
You're not welcome.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
You know why don't we keep Portland clear of your views.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
No, seriously though.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Fuck you.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
I am sorry.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I've been known to ghosts.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Not women.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
I usually will have a specific.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Sorry.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
I might stug just me.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I've been known to ghosts.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Scar Joe.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
You call in.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Just did me.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
That was good.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
We've a lot to get to.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Do you guys have any bullshit?

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
You want to get out of the way first before we get to the good stuff?

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
I might edit it this out.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I guess not.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I want people to know.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
I want people to know.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Spent the last hour.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
China.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Think of a good one line or about climbing.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
And it is all billable.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Joe, can we talk about the the stuffed animals that are on the bed behind you?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah, what you got.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
But let's not actually.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Are you in Philadelphia?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Because yeah, you're in like a gaming chair.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Next to like a 2010 dole.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
I'm not in Philadelphia.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Don't worry about it.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
You're in Manila.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
There's a fight going on tonight.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
Like like a UFC or boxing fight or like a thriller.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Somebody from UFC follows a bunch of headgun people.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I want to shout him out of he's listening to this.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
I don't remember his name, but you know who you are.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Thanks for listening and please don't hurt me.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Right.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Well, I feel you see fighters.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
I'm coming in with this Friday feeling.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Did you see fighters don't like just hurt people.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Willy and Ellie you'd have to go into the ring.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
What do you think we should.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
I think we should do.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
I think we should do a Logan Paul S.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Oh my god.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
You win a mirror or you.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Yeah, Brad goes first.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
You like really.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
You would beat him up for sure.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm sorry.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
He's the one for the final punch.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
You'll be a ghost.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
It's come to this.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
It's been 150 fucking episodes before somebody threatened me with physical violence.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah, that can't be true.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Me.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Definitely not true.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Well, I'm here.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Said he wants to kill me or that he wants me to die.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
But not by his hand.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Yeah.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
He's finished.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Not by his hand.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
You probably pay someone else to do it.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Like who Brad?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Maybe.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
That was part of the job description.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
That would include any one of the top brass of head gum paying Brad.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Which has yet to happen.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
We should say.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
This isn't.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
He doesn't get paid for his job.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
No, well, he was texting me before I goes to them that he hasn't had any paystubs.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
He's only had pay snubs, which is like he sends in an invoice and he's also like he was

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
holding Jim goes.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
That's good.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
I forgive you.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
No.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
That's not what should have made that happen.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
When you come to Portland, stay with me.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
That's no, it's not going to be right.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Don't go.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
I stay with your ass.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
My door.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
My door is open to you.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
I want to stay at the Ace Hotel.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
I want it to be good.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
I won't.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Bye.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Staying at the Ace Hotel.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
If head gum will allow.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
That's a Bonnie Vera reference for all my.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Mail manipulators.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
What?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Why are you coming to Portland?

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
We're going to do a head gum podcast tour.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I mean, let's fucking announce it right now, right?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
It's not.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Really?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
No, I thought we were doing 20 dates.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
We're going to tap the year.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Not the south.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
Because the west south by southeast.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
And in Miami.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Yeah.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
We're doing.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
I don't want to announce the two soon.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
And I'll believe this all out of it's not true.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
But I think we're doing L.A.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Big Sur San Francisco Portland Seattle.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Bangor Maine.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Boston.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
We go all the way over to Bangor Maine.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
It's sort of up the west coast.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Cross country to the Northeast.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Down to me.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
The Seattle.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
We make it.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
We make it.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
We make it to Miami.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
I want to say December.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Oregon Trail style.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Yeah.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
We're traveling by spring buggy.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I'll come to Portland and Seattle.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
We're doing a series of one-offs in the middle of nowhere.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
So I think we're doing.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
What is it?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Bethel, New York, Woodstock style.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
We're doing sugar and falso, high-o-proper.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
That's the home show.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
And then we're doing Wichita back to Bangor and then home again.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Home being New York.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Did I pitch on the podcast?

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
The idea that I had where I just thought we should do.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
Like we should rent a van, like a full tour bus.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
And then just do live shows out of the tour bus and like parking lots.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
You did.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
And I think that's a really good idea.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
The issue is like, it has to be you, me, a mirror, and then a fourth.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Right.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
And then he's not going to want to do that.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
You don't know.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
You never know what's up with him.

07:57.000 --> 08:06.000
You never know what's up with him.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Vincent Castle is my bond week.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
He's a French actor.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
There's like a blockbuster movie that I saw a bunch of ads for in Palorie.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
And he's the fucking star of the shit, right?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
And so I don't know.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
He looked kind of zaddy.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
And I wonder if it's if we're ready for a French daddy in terms of bond.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
So it would be like instead of dended in and you know, with an electric guitar,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
it would be an accordion.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
And an accordion.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
Joel, that's for you playing accordion with your knee.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Yes, exactly.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Good one, Joel.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
I said, Joel, help me out.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
And he actually did immediately.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
He saved that.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
What do you guys got?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
What do you want to?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Forget bond of the week.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Let's just do plugs.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
No, I want to do fun.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Like.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
My bond of the week is going to.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I'm just going to go.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Winnie the Poo.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I'm just going to go.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Winnie the Poo.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I think that's it.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I have a little Winnie the Poo.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
That's stuck to my mic arm.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
So proud of it.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
I'm stuck between Lil Dickie and Donald Duck.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
No, Pam.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Dave Bond.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
I.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Well, I think I've said.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I think I've actually said Dave bird before.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
All right.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
We'll go.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
We'll go Donald Duck then.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
It's time for a bond that lives in a pond.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
I don't think.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I don't think bond is hung.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
I don't think he swings that thing.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
I think that.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Because you know what I mean?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Like he hasn't had a.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
He hasn't.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
He hasn't fucked somebody more than once.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
The entire fucking franchise until this last movie.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
And then he died, which is obviously Lil Dick energy.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Spoilers.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Well, spoilers for not two years.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
He dies in the last one.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
And I think that's Lil Dick energy.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I don't think.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
I don't think.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
I just feel like.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Not to not to once again.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Bring up casino royals ball torture scene.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
But I feel like.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
He there must have been something to hit.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
It was so I'm not saying he doesn't have a dick.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
I'm not saying he's a unique.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I'm saying his dick isn't thick.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
I'm saying that in that scene he would have only been able to withstand that pain.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
If he doesn't have a lot when he gets erect to gain, right?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Like not that many inches.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I'm not saying something.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
I'm girthy.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
I'm not.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Maybe that's where the confusion's coming in.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
I'm just saying that lengthwise he's not hitting anybody's cervix.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
The fuck is wrong with you guys.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I'm going to go with the wrong one here.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
I'm going to go with the wrong one here.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
The fuck is wrong with you.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Milk.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Lemonade.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Murray and 20.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
That's pretty good as bond.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
That's pretty good.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Let that me cake the remake.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
I know that like historically she was talking about not even actual cake.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
She was talking about like bread.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
But what if she was talking about like, yeah, a rimming.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah, I mean that's true.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
That's sort of an unlimited resource.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
Like there's no way society could run out of nasty.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
I remember one to export in France.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Yeah, I don't know.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
All right.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
Should we re-examine our relationship with work?

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Because I was actually reading this article about work ism.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Right.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Which is.

11:49.000 --> 11:56.000
Predominantly American belief that work can provide everything that we have historically expected from like organized religion, right?

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
Community, meaning self-actualization, et cetera.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Versus Europeans and I would know because I just didn't.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
Gay pretty that they don't really value work as much because they historically were like working class, you know, under a monarchy.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
And you know, they kind of shed their belief that they could ever be king a while back.

12:16.000 --> 12:23.000
And so now they are just sort of a unified working class that sort of protects the simple pleasures they have, right?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
cigarettes, record, right?

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
There's not much more to it than having Sundays off for sure.

12:30.000 --> 12:36.000
And a retirement age that should still be 62, but things to Macron's white ass.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
It's now 64.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
And I did partake in a protest.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
What about what I just said was an interesting enough to respond to?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Come on.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
I came in with something kind of interesting to talk about.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Brad's Mike is muted, right?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Joe's just smiling, which I do appreciate the smile.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Because it makes me feel joy.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Really unmuted.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Marika?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
I just don't know what you said.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Yeah.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
And it's entirety.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I actually think it's a great point.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
And I agree of all heartedly.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
It sounds like what you're saying is we should go back to being really religious.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
And that's what you're agree with all heartedly.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
It is Easter weekend we should say.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
This is good Friday for those who celebrate.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
I do not.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
But I think it's going to be a good Friday.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
But I think a lot of people should.

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
And that they should get more into being devout.

13:45.000 --> 13:52.000
I think that we should be devout in protecting the ability to eat a two hour lunch during the work day.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Yeah.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
A power lunch.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
Raise your hand if you've ever girded your loins on Lamoyne.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
What?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
What do you mean what?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I thought that a mirror would be on this episode.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
That's a very local Los Angeles reference.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Joe's in fucking where are you?

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
The mall divs.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Marika's in.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Let's say it.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
And Brad's.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Shitting all over Portland.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Not letting it stay weird.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I was just an L.A.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Not on Lamoyne.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
You were a local friend with Marty.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
I was staying with Marty.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Very good.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
I went to La Falmasi Duvae.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I love La Falmasi Duvae.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Yeah.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
I'm a part one.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
They're wine club.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
We could be together.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Let me ask you this.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
You shut the fuck up.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Joel, how are you doing?

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I'm fine.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
I feel like I'm sort of in the middle of something now.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
I don't think so.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I think it's kind of like a like.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
So mad.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Like right.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
The cat energy.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Like if you if you don't move.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Or ignore you sort of thing.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
It's like when it's pressing.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Scratching is tummy.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Hello.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
The question was.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Raise your hand.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
If you've ever done it.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
You've never heard of it.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
You've never heard of it.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
You've never heard of it.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
You've never heard of it.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
You've never heard of your loins on the street.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Called the Moin and Echo Park.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
Oh, I actually did do that when it was there.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
Everybody's talking about this Trump indictment.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
You know who I'd like to indict.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Brad.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
For me.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
It doesn't matter.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
It doesn't matter because you know what.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
He lands an L.A.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
And he gives himself up.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
He guards his loins.

15:53.000 --> 16:03.000
He gives himself up as I mean, like he's spread.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
Is it something I said or done to make you guys just really love?

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Yeah.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Can we get to the polarizing segments of planned?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Well, we have to take ad breaks before we do that.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
Actually, I just canceled all the ads on the show.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Yeah.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
You guys haven't been doing a good job selling this shit.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
All right.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I do great ad reads.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
You do do great ad reads.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Yeah.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
It's probably the best part of the show.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
I was actually thinking you are like, you sort of uniquely suited for this.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
Because so many brands are kind of like improving yourself.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
That.

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
And you're like, it's only up.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Yeah.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
You can only go sleep like shit.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
My personal relationships are bad.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Here are some ways you can improve them.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
It feels really genuine.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
So maybe you're not good as a podcast host in the sense of the podcast being good.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
But the ads are truly believable.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
And the ads are what gets us the cash.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
So that's ultimately what's important.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
It's a really good selling.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
You've become a worse host and a worse person.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
You're actually more monetizable for the company.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
That's legitimately how I'm going to sell this show from now on.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Yeah.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
I think you should.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Yeah.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
How does it feel to make a round man said?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
You don't look sad.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
This show is sponsored by Better Help.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Guys, getting to know yourself can be a lifelong process.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Right?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
It's all a journey.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
The other day, I realized that when I have nothing to do when I have idle hands and only

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
time on my schedule, I'm really anxious.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
If anything, I'm maybe more anxious than when I'm busy because I'm like shit, like

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Did I not respond to somebody?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Is somebody mad at me?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Is there something I need to be doing?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Versus when I'm busy?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
I'm just focusing on the task at hand.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
And ironically, I'm more present.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Right?

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
And so that's something that's useful for me to know.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
And useful to talk about in therapy.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
And that's where Better Help comes in.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
I'm in therapy every week and it really helps me along my personal growth journey.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Can't recommend it enough.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
Would you guys say that you've found your beach?

18:50.000 --> 18:56.000
Meaning like Corona style, like have you found what brings you peace and joy?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Yeah.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Oh, the climbing.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Is that it?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
No, it's not it.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
That's one thing.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
You're in a loving game for relationship.

19:08.000 --> 19:16.000
Yeah, that spending time with friends, music, playing a music with friends, animals, spending time with animals.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Reality TV.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
No, not so much.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Really?

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Because it's next segment.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
You're not going to get them.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Great.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Rica, have you found your beach?

19:26.000 --> 19:36.000
Yeah, it's probably like sitting in a theater watching a play or a musical.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Joel.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
My beach is domino park.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Domino park is right.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
And a picnic blanket.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Are they going to say, my beach is this dull?

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
Yeah.

19:51.000 --> 20:06.000
Have you guys seen Milk Manor?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Yeah.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
No.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Well, I'm going to have a look at it.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Let's go to a clip here.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
This is Milk Manor on TLC.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Cheers.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Cheers.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
Oh, hey, guys.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I got a text.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Yeah, yeah.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Right.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Welcome to the villa.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Lisa and Ryan.

20:27.000 --> 20:33.000
We have an activity plan that is sure to get you well acquainted with the other moms and sons.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
Guys always think they know what you want in the bedroom.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Facts.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
But you really.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
Truth is, if anyone knows about sex, it's us ladies.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
You have the age, wisdom, and experience.

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
And now we are giving you the opportunity to share that Carnal knowledge with your son.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
No.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Oh.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
That knowledge.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
So that is basically what the show is.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
It's these milfs, right?

21:03.000 --> 21:10.000
And then their sons dating the other milfs in vice versa.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
And so I thought we could play Milk Manor.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
But instead of.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Mothers, I'd like to fuck.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
It's Marika.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
I'd like to fire, right?

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
So me, Brad and Joel are going to be the young studs.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
And Marika, you're the milk.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
But milk stands for Marika.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
I'd like to fire.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
So the three of us are going to basically try and like spit game at you.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
But it's all how we would let you go without severance.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Does that make sense without severance?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Of course not.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Why would you get a severance package?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
That's one of the knowledge.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Carnal.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Is the package.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Let's start with Joel.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
Joel, you're a young stud on a Mexico Beach.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
You sightle up to Marika.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
And you have to break the news that she's no longer employed at gum.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
What do you say?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Wait.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Wait.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
What?

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
As these.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
As they so called young studs that are on a beach, I guess.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Sure.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
You also, my boss, or you're just telling me.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
You heard.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
What about this is the green?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Right?

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
It's milk matter.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Milk standing for Marika.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
I'd like to fire.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Joel is Joel at head gum.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
I am me at this at 1099.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Brad and Brad at head gum.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
But we are the young.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Yeah.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
He all heard from the higher up.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
The sea sweet made the choice.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
And we just for some reason have to deliver the news at studs on a beach.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
On a beach.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Got it.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Yeah.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Why not on the beach?

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
You could be, you know, at home for all I care.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
The issue is.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
I'll say, I'll say home.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Okay.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Joel, why don't you deliver the news?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
How would you?

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Marika.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Can I buy your peanut collada?

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
I don't know how that would work.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Simon home.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
You could like deliver a peanut collada for my ass.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
I thought you were coming to the office today and the office is the beach.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
The office is the beach news to me.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
Well, it that actually was your office.

23:11.000 --> 23:23.000
But I'm sorry to say that we're going to need to let this birdy fly away.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
Spread your wings and fly, Marika.

23:26.000 --> 23:33.000
Just this shit hole and find something better.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Wow.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
What?

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Who are you pointing to?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
You don't have any response?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
You just got fired.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Yeah, but it was good.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Can I say no severance?

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
No, it's clear.

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
No, it's clear.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Saypany.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Theme.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Okay.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
That was great, Joel.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
Especially where you like tried to give it a saw.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
You like you tried to soften it by like giving it this wing metaphor and then said,

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Oh, yeah.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
By the way, no severance.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Cutting her off.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
It's sentence two.

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
Marika, if you were one of the milfs at milfman or but milf stands for Marika,

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
I'd like to fire.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
How are you taking it from Joel there?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
How are you taking that news?

24:21.000 --> 24:28.000
I think I would be ultimately a little confused because the metaphor was a little rough

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
at first.

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
It was kind of just like this little birdie needs to spread its wings.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
But it wasn't clear.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
The birdie was and then one T said, and by the way, no severance.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Then it was clear.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
I think I wouldn't handle it well.

24:46.000 --> 24:53.000
But, you know, I'd probably ask for confirmation from somewhere else.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Yeah.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
All right.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Brad.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Okay.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Hey, Marika.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
I'm on a beach.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
How's it going?

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
That's really fun.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Yeah.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I'm going to conference you in with Marty.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Jeff, you play Marty.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Okay.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Here's Marty.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Guys, you have no idea.

25:12.000 --> 25:22.000
Oh man.

25:22.000 --> 25:31.000
You're so sorry.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
The cold drop.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Carl drop at Marty.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Sorry, Mary.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
You.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
You wanted me to let you know that you're fired, and there is no severance.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.500
But I am sending you opinion you call out in the mail.

25:41.500 --> 25:43.500
Oh, thank you.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.600
It should be there next week.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.500
FedEx tracking is updating.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.000
It's just hanging pending.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
So it might be melted.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Yeah, for sure.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
We'll be.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Yeah, appreciate that sentiment.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Technically you're separate.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
San Francisco.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Me too.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Penicol.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Joel says, by the way, he's on the beach.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Do you want to, do you want to talk to Joel?

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
No.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
What I have to say is that somehow Brad's was worse than Joel's.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
And Joel, like, went on about wings for half of the call.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
Maria, what did you think about Brad's attempt?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I thought Brad's attempt was fine.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
I thought it was a good idea to loop in Marty.

26:17.000 --> 26:24.000
I just think that Marty was caught at a bad moment.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
And it didn't reflect well upon.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
OK.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
But and compared to Joel's, which one would you have rather been told that your

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
ship can without several?

26:36.000 --> 26:46.000
I think Brad's because I think like ultimately that would give me some love for

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
itch.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Yeah.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
All right.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Well, I guess it's my turn.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
Hello, Maria.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Hi.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Hey.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
It's Jeff.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Yeah.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
I don't know.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Anywho.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I'm going to beach.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Great.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
And are you surfing?

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
I'm surfing the web to find articles.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
On the beach.

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000
On the beach physically, but the subject that the articles are on is how to let someone

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
go with grace.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
That seems like a good step for you.

27:29.000 --> 27:36.000
I feel like you need some sort of guidance when it comes to just like communicating with people

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
openly.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
You're gone.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Sorry.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
You're shit.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Without severance.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
What are you saying?

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
I was talking about how you're bad at communicating with people.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
No exit package.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
And I am listening.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
But no exit package.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
You're listening to what?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
What you're saying about.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
I get that.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I need to communicate better.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Great.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
But it is because of your performance and personality.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Does that make sense?

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
No.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Bottom line.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Bottom line.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
No.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Why?

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Why?

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
I don't think she's fired.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
You didn't.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
She's a nice person.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
She's a nice person.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
Yeah, but that could mean anything.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
I think you have to say your mother fucking fired.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
Ah.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
How did you find go this bad?

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
I hit all morning to think about how I was going to do this.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Say, Fini.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
What?

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
All right.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Which between the three did you like?

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
Like if you're going to get fired, which one would you want it to be?

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Keep in mind you don't meet the longest.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
So I don't want you to fire me.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
You just didn't even have Joel in it.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Yeah.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
That's true.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
I got to go with Brad.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
What?

29:00.000 --> 29:05.000
I just think it was like a good type of chaos that at the end of the day.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
I could probably come away from that meeting and be like, what's I actually fired?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
And then just show up to work again.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
And then people don't have the heart to tell you twice.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
All right.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Well.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Yeah.

29:18.000 --> 29:34.000
That's the end of the milk manner of the way I responded.

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
Who do you think would make the best contestant on the TV version of the show?

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
Had a head come?

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
I don't know.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
Probably you.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Oh, no.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
Oh, God.

29:55.000 --> 30:01.000
Welcome to Spankt or Raw.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Go on.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
Can we just take a minute to look at the gradient that I did in the background here?

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
Does that ring true to your guys' asses?

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
There's something wrong with his thumb.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Yeah.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Well, forget that the song.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
I mean, the game.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
Are you asking the background supposed to be about red and white?

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Pink and white.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
Gradient rings true to all of our asses.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
This is the question that you're asking.

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
I'm just saying, yeah, I think the tone is somewhere in there.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
The name of the game is Spankt or Raw.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
Do you guys want to guess what this is?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
No.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Brad.

30:41.000 --> 30:49.000
I'm guessing that we're going to have to listen to soundbites of someone either getting spanked

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
or having unprotected sex.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
That's maybe better than what I came up with.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
Well, Joel, and he guesses Brad was wrong.

30:59.000 --> 31:05.000
An image of a tfuchus that's either untouched or just that's also more fun already.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
I love that word.

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
I thought of this game as I was walking the hallowed halls of the Louvre.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
And that's not a joke.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
I'm going to show you guys photos of 10 celebrities.

31:19.000 --> 31:25.000
And you have to tell me whether you think they were spanked as children,

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
or if they weren't, which is what I call Raw.

31:31.000 --> 31:37.000
So Brad, you thought of this in one of the most famous art museums.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Correct.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Okay.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Brad, do you spanked as a kid?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Yeah, I was.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Okay, so, okay, Marie, could we spank to the kid?

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Yeah.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Joel, your shit.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Joel, are you spanked as a kid?

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
No.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Okay, so Joel is wrong.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Joel is someone I would call Raw.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Because you never got a kid.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
We got the definition.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
I'm just trying to make shit clear.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
All right.

32:01.000 --> 32:07.000
Which for some people is also the bonus of spanking.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Where do you spank to the kid?

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
I think like twice.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Do you want to talk about it?

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Not really.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Okay.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
Have you guys seen Oliver?

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
I'm going to see Oliver.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
If I even pile some.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
All right.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Let's just play spank to Raw.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Here we go.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Spank to Raw.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Raw.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Yeah, sure.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Got a rod.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
When why is it?

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Why is that?

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Because of this, he's just so joy.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
He's a liar.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
He's a liar.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
He's a liar.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
I would be gone.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Exactly.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Like mine.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Like mine.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
And Marie goes.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I really wanted Brad's response.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Like spank is a kid.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
I'm still spank when I go home for Christmas.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Wow.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Right.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
It's fine to have joy.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
This is a fun light-hearted segment about child abuse.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
Brad, don't go home for Christmas.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Spank to Raw.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Spank.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
He's older.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Yeah.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
He's from an older generation.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Yeah.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
I think spanking him would hurt your own hands.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
That's what I was going to say.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Shiled.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
Do you guys see those photos of this guy when he was like 14?

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
He looks like a fucking 50 year old.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
It was born with a rock hard ass.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
That's why they call him the rock.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
We don't rock hard abs.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
They want rock hard ass.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
His dad was a hard ass.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
I honestly feel like it Joel had said that you guys would attract the fuck up.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
It's just that you guys have this weird vendetta against everything I say.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Let's not wear it.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Spank to Raw.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Who is that?

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
He's very sirens.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Billy race.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
No way.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Wait.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Is it really?

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Yes.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
That was damn cool.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
He had something fun.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
No, it's very good.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
He was held in a well for a year.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
For a spank.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
He was definitely spanked.

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
We're going to take my ass to the old town road.

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
I'm going to get spanked by my own dad.

34:18.000 --> 34:25.000
It's kind of funny that the biggest song of the last century was made by Billy Ray Cyrus.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
I think Gangnam style sold more.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
He was on the remix, Joel.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
He didn't make it.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Should be clear.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Yeah.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
It was a little nuts.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Spank to Raw.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Oh, spanked.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Spanked for sure.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
And he still gets spanked.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
I think you.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Yeah.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
I'm with Joel.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Spanked by Fetty Waff.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
No.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
I think he should have been spanked.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
I don't think he got spanked.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
And I think that that's why he had the confidence to run for office.

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
And the confidence to have the show, honestly.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
I agree that he should have been spanked.

34:58.000 --> 35:03.000
And if you look at the sound wave length of the episode, you'll see that every time

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
I say something, there's like a three second pause where you all don't either don't know what

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
to say or don't care to respond.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Spank to Raw.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Who's that?

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Good.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
That's true.

35:14.000 --> 35:19.000
I want to say.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
This is hard.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
Because she's a neppo baby, right?

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Yeah.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
And she was famous for a young age going to Hollywood.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
I'm going to say Raw.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Yeah.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
She didn't.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Yeah.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Her parents weren't present enough to spank her around.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Yeah.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Eventually she had to wait for some.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
I know.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
I know.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Yeah.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
Right.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Oh, this is all subjective.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
It's not a game.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
It's also like.

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
I want to think that where my standard hit her child, you know.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
You want to think that.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
I said I don't want to think.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Oh, okay.

35:51.000 --> 35:56.000
What database Joel would I have found the data on whether or not they got spanked?

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
It's all subjective.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
It's all guesstimating.

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
I mean, the text and me and pile asking if we could get into the main frame and get that information for you.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
The main frame.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Spank to Raw.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
She changed.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
I don't like looking at the queen.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
I think spanked.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Look at how like there's not a lot of life behind her eyes.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Definitely not a lot of life behind her eyes.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Well, this was on this side.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
She is dead.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Yeah.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
Spanked or Raw.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Who's that?

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Charlie Bunger.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
It's like one of the richest guys ever and he's like 98.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
And doesn't spend his money.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
Spanked and definitely wearing a diaper in that photo.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Yeah.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Oh, good.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Yeah.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Holy shit.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Charlie needs a change.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
And judging by the look on his face, it might be full.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
He loves it.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
He's proud of this.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
His date.

37:01.000 --> 37:06.000
So you think not only spanked as a kid, but also diapered as a kid and adult.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Yeah.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Yeah.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
Spanked or Raw.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Raw.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Raw, right?

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
But spanked as an adult, maybe.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
I think he really pays.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
I think let me finish.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
I think he's in the season to something weird.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
But it might not be spanking.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
What do you think it is?

37:24.000 --> 37:29.000
Professional cuddling where, you know, you kind of pay somebody to cuddle you.

37:29.000 --> 37:34.000
Uh, it could be the new fetish I heard about this week, which is the new.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
New to me, I should say.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
Uh, it's fin-dom plus chin-dom.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
So you're getting extorted financially by your dentist.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
And also they mess up your jawline.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Zachary front was into that, right?

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Yeah.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
That was fucked up.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
Spanked or Raw.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Who is that?

37:58.000 --> 38:03.000
That's the situation.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Oh.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Yeah.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Probably spanked.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Spanked.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Yep.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
That was the most unanimous one so far.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Spanked or Raw.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Is that Mr. Beast?

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Hmm.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
I don't think so.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
I mean, I think he has the confidence of someone who's never been sort of.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Yeah.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Yeah.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Should have been, though.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Bent over someone's knee.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Yeah.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Good segment.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
It's interesting.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
We were pretty aligned.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
Um, I think that's not the only interesting thing that we learned from this segment.

38:44.000 --> 38:49.000
We learned that Brad sort of had his cheeks red and as a child.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
This is the kind of stuff I would have learned if we'd gone climbing Brad.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
Yeah, I actually had a really good time at the climbing gym in LA too.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
It's nice.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
I like met some people hung out for a while.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Got some good food recommendations.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Me too.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
And then I walked from the studio to a meba records.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Stop it a couple parks.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
It was a nice day.

39:17.000 --> 39:22.000
Got a cool rare record at a meba and never been there.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
Brad, do you want to buy my speakers?

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
I have speakers.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
And I'm going to share with you a Twitter, I guarantee it.

39:31.000 --> 39:36.000
Audio, engine A five plus built in Bluetooth capabilities.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
RCA input, ox input.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Ox input.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000

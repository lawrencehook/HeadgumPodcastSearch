00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:08.000 --> 00:25.000
It's been a long time coming. Yeah, and...

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
It's been a long time coming. Yeah, and...

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
What better timing?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Um, I...

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
We could start over if you love him.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
We fucking got his ass!

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
On the network!

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Yeah!

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Moons here, boons here!

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
That's right!

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Is Bunsen your Italian?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Yeah!

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Damn it!

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
What is that, friend?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
We...

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Uh...

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Are you a perfect person? Let's fucking jump into it.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
We've got Marieka Brownlee zooming in from New York.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
We've got a mirror blue and filled up on the sacks.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Miles Bunsen here, am I saying it?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Not at all.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
He's Bunsen your A.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Bunsen your A.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
When the moon hits your eye.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Like a big piece of my Bunsen your A.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
He like, we're having fun.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Oh, wow.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
I don't know how Marieka's three hours ahead in New York City.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
And I've known who feels most daily and needed already.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Right?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
I mean, I agree with it.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
It does feel like it's a mirror in Miles against you,

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
which I appreciate.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
It does already Miles against you is like pretty even...

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Turg.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
We're talking in very similar spaces.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Really pushes it over the edge.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Miles, I have...

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
I was just agreeing that you could continue talking.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
I was going to say, yeah.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
So you're furious at him.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I have to admit, I knew...

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
So I knew you from Twitter vaguely.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Yeah.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
I think I had followed you on Twitter because you were verified and you had funny tweets.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Absolutely not verified.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Absolutely.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Don't have funny tweets.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
But I believe I followed...

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
You probably saw that I followed you.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
I don't know what happened.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
But I remember that we were trying to do a guest swap with the try guide.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Right.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
And then I didn't know you were associated with the try guide until we were on that show.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Really?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
And then I was kind of...

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Oh, that's so funny.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
You can't...

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Trying to help.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Happy to try my chime in.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
There's no way that'll be a good flow to the end.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Listen, we're teetering on...

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
We're teetor burrowing on...

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yes.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
The fucking...

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Bring...

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Between that Friday feeling and utter despair.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
And I'm trying to near...

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
You're...

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Vira's towards that Friday feeling.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Yeah.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
But my energy today is sour.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
And I need y'all to get me on the right court.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah, you came in and live it.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
This is my first time at the headgum studio.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
You're giving it up and that.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Yeah.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
You were like, live it off of some meeting you had.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
The things like what didn't go according to plan.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Yeah.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
I got a fucking demotion financially.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Marty said I'm not really pulling my weight or pushing weight.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
So now I'm getting 30 an hour.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
We doesn't feel fit.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
That's a lot.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Really?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Yeah.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
That's actually what I thought.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
You deserve slash gut.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Here's the deal.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
I didn't know who you were.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Then I knew who you were.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
And then we did a show together at the try guys studio.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
We did do an episode of the try about a show that I also produced.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
And we did my show.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
And that'd give me that work though.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Right.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
This was...

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
I think a year before.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Show call the try pod with my bosses.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
You came on.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Yeah.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I realize that I'm a pandemic.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
It kind of looks.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Just stay in your fucking lane for five minutes.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Well, I explain to the people out there how Miles and I are best friends.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Yeah.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Unbelievable.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
No.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
It's not unbelievable.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
No.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
It's not like everybody kind of tense stuff in the studio.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
And I feel like that was more tense.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
We're like having fun.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Me too.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Like is great.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
You have the energy of like a bicyclist who almost just got hit by a car.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Yeah.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I want to like slam on the monster.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
No.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
I'm bicyclist.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I'm bicyclist.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
I'm bicyclist.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I'm Tiger Blood.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
But I realize during that record and from your Twitter that I feel like we have a very similar sense of humor.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
A hundred percent.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Yeah.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
And then people on Twitter have been begging for the Miles Jeffery show.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
People want us to collab.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
And so do I.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Yeah.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
And I feel like this might not be the first.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
But certainly the last.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
This is the first.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Certainly not the last.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
There we go.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Yeah.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
We'll probably do something else together if this goes super well.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
And I consider myself a perfect person.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
And so I'm excited to go on that show and prove it.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I'm curious what you have to see.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
You're a you're a flawed man.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
There's no way.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I'm just what you have to man.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Like sometimes people will call in and have like real problems.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
I'm curious like what you're how you're going to get real in that environment.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
I'll get real.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
And this arena.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
I can be visceral.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
This really do treat it like an arena.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Yeah.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Are you not in today?

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
That's really good.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Do you guys have a voice of God Mike speeding?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
We do.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Hell yeah.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Okay.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
So please chime in as much as probable.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I'm loving the energy.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Yes.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
It's already unraveling.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
And I know that by minute 30 mid segments.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
I'm going to need your guys.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Okay.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Um.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Let's keep it going.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Well, okay.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Maria, how the fuck are you doing?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
I'm fine.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I'm really tired.

05:24.000 --> 05:32.000
This was a bad idea to go to me for this to keep it rolling in lively.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
I know.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
You weren't even near the mic.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Yeah.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
I was really adjusting in my chair.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Where we got a magazine.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Look at Twitter.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Can I go see a movie after this?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Probably.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Um.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
Did you have to go into the headgum studio just to record this or read there all day?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
I wasn't here all day.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
I had a doctor's appointment and I walked here after.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
That's awesome.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Yeah.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Maria's body's never been at a stasis.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
No.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Yeah.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
I went to the doctor's appointment for one thing.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
And the doctor was like, that's fine.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
But here's three other things that are like.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
I could be the cause of what your experience.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Like I haven't the time for this.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
And that's your issue.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
And I want to hear about Miles medical history soon.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
But you don't you need a non perfectionist general practitioner.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Right?

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
Somebody who's just going to bandate everything and not try to get you to perfection.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Ah, that's the opposite of what she needs.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
It sounds like she has to get to the underlying issue.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
And you just want to like give her add bill for like yeah.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Yeah.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Just like no amount for a few hours.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
You want to sweep it under the rug.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Yeah.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Arguably that's what I was trying to do.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
I went in for I keep hearing a gurgling in my ear.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
And the doctor was like, let's do an allergy test.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Also, you have TMJ.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
Also, your tonsils are three times the size they should be.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Oh, no.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
I hear getting an adult tonsillectomy is extra painful.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Yeah.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
He said I don't need that.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
That's the thing.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
It was all things that were like you're teetering on the verge of like problems.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
But mostly you're fine.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I'm doing great.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
That's good to hear.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
You know, I have actually been enjoying some TMJ myself recently.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Wow.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Wow.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Is that my girlfriend got a grind guard.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
And now she's having jaw problems.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
And I guess that's a very common thing.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Maybe they're like messes your bite or like gives you jaw stress.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Have you guys experienced that in any way?

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
Grind guard related jaw pain or your TMJ predates that.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I don't know when it started.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
But I do a retainer to keep my teeth straight.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
But it's definitely like I'm definitely clenching my teeth all the time.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
I'm constantly in a state of stress and distress.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Yeah.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
So it makes sense.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
It's hard because you're asleep.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
So you can't really tell yourself not to do something.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Yeah.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
I'm grinding my teeth tonight.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Got a baby tooth.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Pop that fucker out of there.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
And baby tooth still.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Well, I had a baby tooth and then they popped it out.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
And then so I don't have a tooth and I got an implant.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Yeah.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
And I'm waiting for them to screw on a like white part like the cat.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
So I was doing on one side of my mouth.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
This will screw.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
It was a screw.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Yeah.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
And you're currently awaiting the tooth implant.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Yeah.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
And so I was chewing on one side of my mouth.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
So I didn't like get any danger there.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Yeah.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Yeah.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Don't do that.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
That sucks.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Yeah.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
The doctor was like, you know, if you decide to like go and need a kind bar.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
This is literally what he said.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
He's like.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
He's like.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Yeah.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Actually, if you eat this kind bar.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
It has eight grams of sugar.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
All grams of protein.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
He was like, maybe don't go for the kind bar.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
And you go for something more like scrambled eggs.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
The same.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Maybe he's got a baby in favor of Google.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Yeah.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Wow.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
And then I came to the office and I ate five packs of skittles.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
So jokes on him.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Yeah.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Jesus.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Oh my god.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
In the mix, it seems like it's not going to be that loud.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
That's because fucking Grace Harper does her magic.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Our new mix engineer.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Oh, that's nice.

09:26.000 --> 09:34.000
Also, we didn't congratulate on you on being the new supervising producer of the fucking show, man.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Top brass for my fat ass.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
That's really exciting.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
It's nice to see in the fucking credits.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
There's a whole team that puts this thing together.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Right?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
It's nice to see.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
I used to see.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
I'm a hyper off of coffee.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
And I don't know where to place my energy.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Other than send it to the microphone.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Good comment on today's episode.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
And they called you the ghost of cold brew's past.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
That's really good.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
That's really good.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
You are going to crash, right?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Excuse me.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
Miles, in terms of the the screw that you have coming out of your mom.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Are you going to use that to your advantage?

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
Like to eat something that usually is crunchy to have.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Like, you're going to use the screw Dave.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Eat something so like a walnut.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Yeah.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Are you going to not crash?

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
So you're asking if I'm going to use my sort of medical situation to crack a walnut with my teeth.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Yes.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Have you ever been?

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Do you ever go to Mendocino farms?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Have you ever been on a ride or something?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
I've been to Mendocino.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Yeah.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
They're almost chicken sandwiched.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
They're not so fried.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Yeah.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
That thing will fry the top of your fucking, you know, mouth.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Yeah.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Unless you have a fucking, a Phillips head.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Yeah.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Did you rate this before?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I'm floundering.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
The crash is starting early.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Shit.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Um, what did we have?

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
And even.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Let's just get our bonds of the week out of the way.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Uh, our bonds in your eyes of the week.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Miles bonds in your eyes.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Yeah.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Yeah.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
You're my bond of the week.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
I think you're tall.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
I think you're fit.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
I think you're married.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Which seems to be a weird through line for all the bond actors.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Yeah.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Oh, yeah.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
For the most part of your line.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yeah.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Like.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
But like.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
There's an relationships.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Yeah.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
You're a laughing stock, man.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
You're laughing stock.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
It's, it's good to see them in this angle.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Because you are panicked.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Like, swiping through.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Screens on your MacBook.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
And then you live on one that doesn't seem like you were trying to get there as

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
our split.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
I've never felt so seen.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
The best is when he, you watch him choose a sound.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And then immediately choose another one.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Because he's the best.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Wow.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
A couple of decided.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Nice.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Do you guys have any bonds of the week?

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Producers.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Casting for the next 007.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Before it's too late.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Uh, Timothy Shalame with like just like 200 pounds of muscle.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Maybe.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
That's pretty good.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Wow.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
That's what I'm casting.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Let's go with the rock.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Huh?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
It's going to rock.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
She.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Wow.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
The rock has had a whirlwind of a,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
honestly, three years, but most importantly, last week.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
He is so busy promoting this black Adam movie that I fear what would happen if it

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
bombed at the box office.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
I don't know if the rock could open up such a drama.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Scott's been getting some batteries.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
That's going to bomb.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
It's scary.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Sad for the rock who really put his entire seemingly emotional net worth

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
into promoting this film.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Not to mention his Dwayne John Nocy.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
His what?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
His Dwayne John's Dwayne.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Yeah.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Do you want to try that one more time?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Basically his John Nocy.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
John Nocy.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
He put his ruckusy into it.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Okay.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
No.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
I didn't.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
I don't think I still understand what you're doing.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
My favorite part of this set up is that the people I can hear the

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
poster onion case.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
It's just really funny.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Yeah.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
I really would have preferred instead of black Adam black

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Adam.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
But it's Dwayne Johnson.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Repreasing the role.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Interesting.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Do you ever see black Adam?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
No.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
It's like a great.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
It's black Adam.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
I don't know what that is either.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
It's mister.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Yeah, though.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Yeah.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
I just wanted him to go on to the next thing.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Oh, true.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Because now we're talking about it.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Do you think you put your whole Jeffrey Jesse and

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Peter?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Is it a pencil?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Yes.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Who's that?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Oh.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
I've always said I put my whole Jeffrey and through it.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Yeah, we don't like.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
I do feel my foot content.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
I do.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
I have a thing for feet.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Well, I guess you can do that.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
I was going to do it.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
We can.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Well, we have a whole segment about fetish later.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Basically.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
We'll use.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
We'll use.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.360
Forget it.

14:09.360 --> 14:11.240
We have a wrap up the bonds of the week.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.160
You said Timothy Shalamea getting stacked.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.000
I want to see him stacked like doing action,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.400
but I think that would be really interesting.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.640
From Wonka to Bonka.

14:19.640 --> 14:20.720
What's Bonka?

14:20.720 --> 14:22.640
That's Bonka.

14:22.640 --> 14:27.200
But he has a tonka ass from doing so many squats.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.440
Blumenfeld, are you going to pass or what?

14:29.440 --> 14:31.320
Yeah, I think I'll pass this week.

14:31.320 --> 14:34.640
On your Casey, James Bonk could be anybody.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.680
Anyone you've already mentioned?

14:37.680 --> 14:39.920
Is anyone that's off limits for me?

14:39.920 --> 14:44.720
No, just cast anybody as the next double or seven.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.560
A corn kid.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.360
That's pretty good.

14:47.360 --> 14:50.080
Oh, it's going on.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.040
I really like fun.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.680
I want him to get a real, I want him to have a career out of this.

14:53.680 --> 14:54.720
I want him to have a career out of this.

14:54.720 --> 14:58.400
He doesn't have to help one of the most important action

14:58.400 --> 15:00.080
moving French, I have some all time.

15:00.080 --> 15:03.520
I just feel like we're using him and he's going to get 15 minutes

15:03.600 --> 15:05.680
of whatever and then we're all going to forget him.

15:05.680 --> 15:06.720
And I don't want that to happen.

15:06.720 --> 15:07.760
I don't think it's fair.

15:07.760 --> 15:12.000
He has some kind of like garden green sponsorship.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.320
So it's like shake and not stirred.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.160
And then as he's waiting for his martini,

15:16.160 --> 15:18.240
he like chomps into a corn on the cob.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.120
That's good.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.800
I like that.

15:20.800 --> 15:21.760
See you on his corn.

15:21.760 --> 15:22.880
See you on his corn.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.440
I feel like right the whole concept.

15:25.440 --> 15:26.480
He has a fake ID.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.520
Well, he is 21.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.520
One of his gadgets is a fake ID.

15:34.480 --> 15:35.040
Brieca?

15:36.400 --> 15:40.240
I'm going to go with Megan the stallion.

15:40.240 --> 15:40.800
That's good.

15:41.680 --> 15:42.240
Yeah.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.440
I'm going to take a very easy.

15:44.240 --> 15:44.560
All right.

15:46.800 --> 15:49.600
This country produces more cinnamon than any other

15:49.600 --> 15:50.960
per the tasting table.

15:50.960 --> 15:51.680
What do you guys think?

15:54.720 --> 15:55.760
Sorry.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.280
I'm sorry.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.320
Am I supposed to have like a city like,

16:00.320 --> 16:02.400
am I supposed to say what city it is?

16:02.480 --> 16:04.160
Or am I supposed to say what I think?

16:04.160 --> 16:06.320
What country do you think per move?

16:06.320 --> 16:07.360
Produce is, I'm sorry.

16:07.360 --> 16:08.560
Now I'm getting angry again.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.440
Produce is the most cinnamon.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.960
That was so out of the blue.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.160
That, don't you want to be like,

16:12.160 --> 16:13.760
all right, let's play food trivia.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.120
All right, this is the game.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.640
We're going to answer questions.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.680
First one to do this.

16:17.680 --> 16:18.480
That and the other.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.960
You just launched right into a question about cinnamon.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.240
This is news of the day.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.680
We do this every week now.

16:23.680 --> 16:24.240
Okay.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.320
So I at least say that.

16:26.320 --> 16:26.880
Yeah.

16:26.880 --> 16:28.080
I'm going to say that of first.

16:28.080 --> 16:28.480
Yeah.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.320
It's time to move on to news of the day.

16:30.320 --> 16:30.720
Okay.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.480
This headline had to do with the cinnamon output.

16:34.480 --> 16:34.800
Yeah.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.320
Of a specific nation.

16:36.320 --> 16:37.520
Uh-huh.

16:37.520 --> 16:38.640
I think it's Indonesia.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.000
Who you know, though, because you wrote the article.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.440
Well, let's get all of our answers in.

16:45.440 --> 16:48.960
I want to take a swat in the dark and say Iceland.

16:48.960 --> 16:49.280
Okay.

16:49.280 --> 16:50.080
So random.

16:50.080 --> 16:50.720
Yeah.

16:50.720 --> 16:51.040
Yeah.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.240
How weird would it be if it was just America?

16:54.240 --> 16:56.240
Or it's like, yeah, I guess I figured,

16:56.240 --> 16:57.920
but that's not really article worthy.

16:58.560 --> 16:58.880
Yeah.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.600
Let's go Vietnam.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.360
This small country.

17:05.360 --> 17:05.760
Thoughts.

17:06.960 --> 17:07.840
Although India.

17:07.840 --> 17:08.560
Mm-hmm.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.800
Oh, India is a really good guess because it's big.

17:10.800 --> 17:11.200
Yeah.

17:12.400 --> 17:12.960
Cuba.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.240
Interesting.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.520
I want to say,

17:15.520 --> 17:17.280
on your was the most correct.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.600
Your correct, your answer is Indonesia.

17:19.600 --> 17:20.960
You said you said that.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.240
Well, I said it but I knew.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.280
Yeah.

17:23.280 --> 17:24.880
She's the most right alphabetically.

17:24.880 --> 17:25.520
What do you mean by that?

17:25.680 --> 17:26.480
Yeah.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.840
The New York Times reports that Inline skating is back.

17:32.880 --> 17:33.680
Oh, hell yeah.

17:33.680 --> 17:34.720
Yeah, what do we think?

17:34.720 --> 17:38.400
I'd like to be one of those cool like Tiktokers who does like sexy

17:38.400 --> 17:38.960
skating and then.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.560
Yeah, fun music.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.400
I think you in like a two-engine scene

17:42.400 --> 17:44.640
withinline skates on Venice Beach boardwalk would get.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.080
Yeah, that'd be cool.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.040
That's funny.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.000
I think we'll do numbers.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.120
I don't see what's funny about it.

17:51.120 --> 17:51.920
I think it's sexy.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.200
Well, okay.

17:53.200 --> 17:53.920
I want to make it.

17:54.000 --> 17:54.880
Inline skates.

17:54.880 --> 17:55.760
I'm trying to defend you.

17:57.440 --> 17:57.760
Yeah.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.760
Yeah, but they're not the forage top.

18:01.760 --> 18:02.160
Yeah.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.360
So three in the row.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.040
Oh, so three instead of four.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.000
That's the only difference.

18:06.000 --> 18:06.400
Yeah.

18:06.400 --> 18:06.960
Wait.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.360
So roller blades are four in a row.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.040
Inline is three in a row.

18:11.040 --> 18:11.680
You know.

18:11.680 --> 18:14.480
I'm just giving us a big note for this venture.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.960
Or when roller blades and inlines are the same.

18:16.960 --> 18:17.840
They're all in row.

18:17.840 --> 18:18.240
Great.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.480
Roller skates are the four.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.520
And that's two and two.

18:21.520 --> 18:21.920
Yeah.

18:21.920 --> 18:22.640
That's what I thought.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.080
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a blader.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.360
I'm very bad at wheels.

18:27.360 --> 18:28.560
I can't, I ride a bike.

18:28.560 --> 18:29.680
I can't get on skates.

18:29.680 --> 18:30.560
I just have no balance.

18:30.560 --> 18:31.920
I can't even stand on a skateboard.

18:31.920 --> 18:36.320
Like I just have no balance when it comes to wheels for some reason.

18:36.320 --> 18:36.800
Yeah.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.320
I'd like to get into long boarding.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.080
So feel like you don't have to balance as much.

18:40.080 --> 18:40.720
But you still have to.

18:40.720 --> 18:41.520
That's true.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.880
You still have to do a little bit.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.080
Oh, it's a little bit of balancing.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.200
But I mean, I'm tall.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.280
So when I fall, it's like a long distance.

18:47.280 --> 18:48.080
Yeah, it hurts.

18:48.080 --> 18:50.400
Does that mean you have more reaction time to catch your fall?

18:50.400 --> 18:51.840
No, all right.

18:52.640 --> 18:55.360
What scare your supernatural forces are bad parenting?

18:57.600 --> 18:59.680
That was an LA Times article, headline.

18:59.680 --> 19:00.960
And I want to know what you guys thought.

19:00.960 --> 19:01.360
Sorry.

19:01.360 --> 19:03.680
Super natural forces are bad parenting.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.160
Well, I guess bad parenting is like a more consistent evil.

19:06.160 --> 19:06.640
Yeah.

19:06.640 --> 19:09.200
That's going to make the Twitter.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.000
That parenting is a more consistent evil.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.760
I would say bad parenting is also real.

19:15.760 --> 19:16.720
And the other one's not.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.680
So I would say that's one point in favor of bad parenting.

19:19.760 --> 19:25.760
Yeah, I would say the inverse of that to have a kid is good.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.000
And everyone should do it.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.280
I'm having a kid.

19:29.280 --> 19:30.960
Are you pregnant?

19:30.960 --> 19:32.320
Yeah, well, my wife has a couple.

19:32.320 --> 19:33.760
Yeah, we're having a baby in December.

19:33.760 --> 19:34.320
Wow.

19:34.320 --> 19:34.960
That's exciting.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.320
Are they going to be a Sagittarius?

19:37.360 --> 19:37.680
No.

19:39.680 --> 19:40.560
And that's that.

19:41.920 --> 19:42.880
It's a camera.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.080
I'm afraid it's a camera.

19:44.080 --> 19:44.880
Late December.

19:44.880 --> 19:45.360
Late December.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.480
Yeah, it's a saddest.

19:46.480 --> 19:47.360
Yeah.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.160
What are you?

19:48.160 --> 19:49.360
I'm a Sagittarius.

19:49.520 --> 19:50.320
Yeah, thank God.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.520
You want to get it out of that.

19:57.520 --> 19:58.000
Wow.

19:58.960 --> 19:59.520
What?

19:59.520 --> 20:00.000
What?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
One of the nice things I've ever said to you.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.200
Yeah, and that was still mean.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.880
I would say bad parenting because it's more common.

20:10.560 --> 20:11.600
Are we still on?

20:11.600 --> 20:14.160
Yeah, I don't know what the question was.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.400
Yeah, sorry.

20:17.360 --> 20:21.120
Oh, more often than not, this show is me against everyone else.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.440
But I really feel like I'm on the fucking hot seat.

20:23.440 --> 20:25.200
Because I'm on the couch by myself.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.400
Casey's laughing in my fucking face on just looking

20:28.400 --> 20:33.120
over with Pidgey eyes Miles took time out of his vizzy schedule to be here.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.560
And I feel guilty of it.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.080
And amir is in a sour mood.

20:37.040 --> 20:37.440
Yeah.

20:37.440 --> 20:40.560
Well, you first message me on Instagram July 13.

20:40.560 --> 20:45.120
I said, you want to do the show sometime in the next two weeks?

20:45.120 --> 20:47.300
I said, yeah, I'd love to.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.040
He didn't respond for a month.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.040
Yeah.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.340
That he responds seven months later.

20:52.340 --> 20:53.500
Hey, I'm running late.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.040
Yeah.

20:55.040 --> 20:57.840
I hit him back with, hey, just checking in on this.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.640
Nothing for two more weeks.

20:59.640 --> 21:00.480
Yeah.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.880
And he said, hey, just one final time.

21:02.880 --> 21:03.920
And then make a little joke.

21:03.920 --> 21:05.880
He responds a week later.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.080
Let's do this thing.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.080
Yeah.

21:08.080 --> 21:15.080
And then, like, I responded immediately to what she says nothing.

21:15.080 --> 21:18.800
But this is not good to know for the new surviving producer.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.360
I'm happy to have this in both.

21:20.360 --> 21:21.360
Did you?

21:21.360 --> 21:24.240
At any point, did you take that personally or did you kind of think of this?

21:24.240 --> 21:25.240
Sure.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.240
But I knew.

21:26.240 --> 21:27.240
But I knew.

21:27.240 --> 21:28.520
I was like, I'm sure he's just busy.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.680
No, I mean, we're just about to.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.680
And then, and then Thursday, he said, great.

21:32.680 --> 21:33.680
I'm so glad you're doing the show.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.320
I'll send you a calendar and invite no calendar.

21:35.320 --> 21:36.680
But that's true as well.

21:36.680 --> 21:37.680
And then I got in this morning.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.160
And I was like, I'm psyched to be doing the show.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.160
And that relate.

21:40.160 --> 21:42.520
Now it's seeing the reality of the rails.

21:42.520 --> 21:45.040
It is, do you understand that, yeah, now do you not take it?

21:45.040 --> 21:46.040
No, no, I don't take it.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.040
Okay.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.040
I'm good.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.040
I'm good.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.040
I'm good.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.040
And I'm happy to be here.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.040
I'm happy to have you here.

21:52.040 --> 21:54.040
One of our best guests, thus far.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.040
Really.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.040
That's true.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.040
Really nice.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.040
Well, how do you think is better than miles?

21:59.040 --> 22:00.040
Can you name him?

22:00.040 --> 22:04.560
You'll rank the, I think Zack Dunn is the goat of the show.

22:04.560 --> 22:05.560
Interesting.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.040
He hasn't been a time for a year, right?

22:07.040 --> 22:08.040
Yeah.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.040
Yeah.

22:09.040 --> 22:12.240
So we're going to, I should bring him on for an end of the year episode to do writing advice

22:12.240 --> 22:13.240
too.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.240
Because that's my favorite episode.

22:14.240 --> 22:15.240
I'm sure we've ever done.

22:15.240 --> 22:16.240
Yeah.

22:16.240 --> 22:17.240
Oh, right here we go.

22:17.240 --> 22:18.240
Probably.

22:18.240 --> 22:19.240
Yes.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.240
And really, I'm scared of this episode because nobody else is on it.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.240
Shut up.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.240
Okay.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.240
Um.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.240
Perfect.

22:25.240 --> 22:26.240
For Buzzfeed News.

22:26.240 --> 22:27.240
Yeah.

22:27.240 --> 22:33.240
A major content house in New York, your mom's house has splintered.

22:33.240 --> 22:34.240
So.

22:34.240 --> 22:36.240
What does this mean?

22:36.240 --> 22:37.240
Was there an end of that sentence?

22:37.240 --> 22:39.240
It seems like you're going to keep talking.

22:39.240 --> 22:40.240
I don't.

22:40.240 --> 22:42.240
You laughed really hard at it.

22:42.240 --> 22:43.240
But I didn't.

22:43.240 --> 22:46.240
It didn't seem like a joke or wasn't like a news content.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.240
Yeah.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.240
That felt that foul.

22:48.240 --> 22:54.240
ostensibly the content house of New York City, your mom's house is experiencing

22:54.240 --> 22:57.240
factionism.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.240
Okay.

22:58.240 --> 23:00.240
I'm microdosing LSD.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.240
Yeah.

23:01.240 --> 23:02.240
Yeah.

23:02.240 --> 23:03.240
It's clear now.

23:03.240 --> 23:04.240
Who's in that one?

23:04.240 --> 23:05.240
Anybody we know?

23:05.240 --> 23:06.240
Hmm.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.240
Your mom's house.

23:07.240 --> 23:08.240

23:20.240 --> 23:22.240
Do you think we know any of the people?

23:22.240 --> 23:23.240
Like if you listed the people that live there,

23:23.240 --> 23:24.240
I think we would know them.

23:24.240 --> 23:28.240
Do you think keo has ever been to big sir wise?

23:28.240 --> 23:34.240
I'm trying to go to deep jins for my birthday this year.

23:41.240 --> 23:44.240
I can't afford a camping spot in the winter.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.240
So I settled for deacions.

23:46.240 --> 23:49.240

23:54.240 --> 23:55.240

23:58.240 --> 24:00.240

24:04.240 --> 24:05.240

24:12.240 --> 24:13.240
I want to have a feast.

24:13.240 --> 24:18.240
I want to have scrambled eggs.

24:18.240 --> 24:19.240
What's the feast going to be?

24:19.240 --> 24:21.240
You've mentioned the feast like three times.

24:21.240 --> 24:23.240
I normally don't eat during the day, but then at the end,

24:23.240 --> 24:24.240
I have a feast.

24:24.240 --> 24:25.240
You said that word.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.240
Yeah.

24:26.240 --> 24:27.240
Like a couple of times before you're recording.

24:27.240 --> 24:28.240
And then now.

24:28.240 --> 24:29.240
What's the feast?

24:29.240 --> 24:31.240
You make a bunch of sweet potatoes.

24:31.240 --> 24:34.240
What's the Thanksgiving style dinner?

24:34.240 --> 24:36.240
Or are you just going to have a sandwich at 8 p.m.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.240
I'm an air fryer.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.240
X Trader Joe's mom.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.240
Oh, so good.

24:41.240 --> 24:43.240
So I just go up and down,

24:43.240 --> 24:44.240
waltzing,

24:44.240 --> 24:47.240
hither than thither through the aisles of frozen goods.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.240
Yeah.

24:48.240 --> 24:49.240
Toss him in the air fryer.

24:49.240 --> 24:51.240

24:51.240 --> 24:52.240

24:54.240 --> 24:56.240
Uh.

24:56.240 --> 24:59.240
Usually it's like one or two frozen things.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.240
Thanks in a blanket or.

25:01.240 --> 25:02.240

25:02.240 --> 25:03.240
That's a really good one.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.240
Yeah.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.240
At the one of the frozen sauce.

25:05.240 --> 25:06.240
You don't have to boil it.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.240
You just put in a lot of it.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.240
Just put in a lot of it.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.240
We'll be arguing about that.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.240
You're right.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.240
What the fuck?

25:11.240 --> 25:12.240

25:12.240 --> 25:14.240

25:22.240 --> 25:23.240
No.

25:23.240 --> 25:24.240
No.

25:24.240 --> 25:25.240
No.

25:25.240 --> 25:28.240
And then I guess.

25:28.240 --> 25:30.240
Um, no, you can plug it at the end.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.240
Uh.

25:31.240 --> 25:33.240
Let's talk about this.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.240
Are you rich?

25:34.240 --> 25:35.240
No.

25:35.240 --> 25:36.240
You're right.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.240
Well, you're wearing a corridor sweater.

25:38.240 --> 25:40.240
Oh, so my friend works at corridor.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.240
Fucker.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.240
Everybody knows.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.240
My other buddies.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.240
Oh, my friends.

25:44.240 --> 25:45.240
My friend.

25:45.240 --> 25:46.240
My friend Zach Thurlkill.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.240
He works at corridor.

25:47.240 --> 25:48.240
And he's just like seven to sweater.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.240
If I had other buddies, buddy owns industry of all nations.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.240
I don't know.

25:51.240 --> 25:52.240
How much is that sweater?

25:52.240 --> 25:53.240
Is it like a $200?

25:53.240 --> 25:54.240
It was like a $200.

25:54.240 --> 25:55.240
It was like a $200.

25:55.240 --> 25:56.240
I think I got it for like a hundred.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.240
Ten.

25:57.240 --> 25:58.240
Yeah.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.240
And that's a sweater that'll last a lie.

25:59.240 --> 26:00.240
It's gonna last long time.

26:00.240 --> 26:01.240
And I also didn't have any good clothes.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.240
I felt not confident all my clothes.

26:03.240 --> 26:04.240
Yeah.

26:04.240 --> 26:05.240
They were always red bear.

26:05.240 --> 26:06.240
I didn't want to say anything.

26:06.240 --> 26:07.240
I'm going to have to try.

26:07.240 --> 26:08.240
Yeah.

26:08.240 --> 26:09.240

Yeah.

26:11.240 --> 26:12.240
That's right.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.240
He was ghosting my outfit.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.240
Like, just like, I wanted to buy a bunch of clothes.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.240
I was going to make it feel confident.

26:16.240 --> 26:17.240
Yeah.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.240
And this sweater, I feel fucking cool and hot.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.240
And you look it too.

26:19.240 --> 26:20.240
And I want to ask.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.240
And you don't have to answer this.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.240
And we'll go to commercial break.

26:22.240 --> 26:25.240
Either during your answer or right after.

26:25.240 --> 26:26.240
Yeah.

26:26.240 --> 26:30.240
Has the confidence that the sweater has beard.

Well, well, Jeff.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.240
That's all.

26:43.240 --> 26:45.240
We'll be right back.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.240
Thank you to Fairety for sponsoring this episode of our show.

26:53.240 --> 26:57.240
Guys, Fairety is all about clothing for life's best moments.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.240
Right?

26:58.240 --> 26:59.240
It's a Friday night football game.

26:59.240 --> 27:02.240
The first day of school or hanging with the family in your backyard this fall.

27:02.240 --> 27:07.240
Fairety makes clothes that feel good and make you feel good.

27:07.240 --> 27:11.240
Fairety's a family brand that believes comfort and quality are key.

27:11.240 --> 27:13.240
It was founded by two twin brothers, Alex and Mike.

27:13.240 --> 27:19.240
And Fairety grew out of their long time love of the surf and mountains, road trips,

27:19.240 --> 27:20.240
and beach bonfires.

27:20.240 --> 27:21.240
You know the feeling.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.240
They're passionate about craftsmanship and sustainability.

27:24.240 --> 27:27.240
That's why every piece is designed to be a lifetime favorite.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.240
In fact, they're clothes even get better with age.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.240
I can't attest to this.

27:31.240 --> 27:36.240
I have been wearing Fairety since far before they started sponsoring the show.

27:36.240 --> 27:40.240
I think since 2017, I was when I got my first Fairety shirt.

27:40.240 --> 27:45.240
It was this reversible striped guy that I still have today that I still wear.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.240
And it is healthier.

27:46.240 --> 27:47.240
They make great clothes.

27:47.240 --> 27:48.240
I don't know what else to say.

27:48.240 --> 27:52.240
And if anything happens along the way Fairety will replace or fix your clothes.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.240
For life, no matter what.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.240
They're perfect for layering, too.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.240
For a cozy fall vibe.

27:58.240 --> 28:01.240
And it even, or even make it easier with a one and done jumpsuit.

28:01.240 --> 28:05.240
I mean, they have incredible stuff, including their jumpsuits that I think look great.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.240
Jump suits are still in fashion.

28:07.240 --> 28:08.240
They might always be in fashion.

28:41.240 --> 28:43.240
I use athletic greens every day.

Athletic greens helps me recover when I don't have those full eight hours.

28:49.240 --> 28:50.240

I wake up.

28:51.240 --> 28:52.240
I have my water.

28:53.240 --> 28:54.240
I'm ready to go.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.240
So what is this stuff?

29:13.240 --> 29:15.240
All right, the taste is very pleasant.

29:15.240 --> 29:18.240
Even though it's chock full of all these really healthy for you things,

29:18.240 --> 29:21.240
it still has a nice pleasant sweet taste.

29:21.240 --> 29:22.240
I don't exactly know how to describe it,

29:22.240 --> 29:24.240
but all I know is that I like it.

29:24.240 --> 29:27.240
I have gotten my whole family on athletic greens now,

29:27.240 --> 29:28.240
especially my dad.

29:28.240 --> 29:29.240
He's very fit.

29:29.240 --> 29:30.240
He does.

29:30.240 --> 29:31.240
He works out every day.

29:31.240 --> 29:34.240
And now he's on athletic greens and is feeling even better.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.240
or artificial anything while still tasting good.

29:47.240 --> 29:49.240

I've said this before.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.240
I used to take a bunch of pills and vitamins and all that stuff.

30:50.240 --> 30:53.240
I'm not sure if you're out of your bag.

30:53.240 --> 30:54.240
And we're back.

30:54.240 --> 30:58.240
I've been asking a lot of people on this show,

30:58.240 --> 30:59.240
especially guests.

30:59.240 --> 31:02.240
What's on your sexual bucket list for the rest of 2021?

31:02.240 --> 31:05.240
Well, my wife is going to be 22.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.240
22 year off.

31:07.240 --> 31:10.240
My wife's going to be eight and the nine months pregnant.

31:10.240 --> 31:11.240
Right.

31:11.240 --> 31:13.240
So I think that a lot of stuff's off the table.

31:13.240 --> 31:17.240
But also stuff is newfoundly slash land on the table.

31:17.240 --> 31:21.240
Don't look at me when you talk about shaking.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.240
Yeah.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.240
Well, I guess maybe you can start us off.

31:23.240 --> 31:27.240
Like, what's something you're looking to adventure in the bedroom?

31:27.240 --> 31:28.240
And is this like, you're not seeing anybody.

31:28.240 --> 31:31.240
You're sort of single and you're looking for.

31:31.240 --> 31:33.240
I'm just trying to get the full picture.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.240
But this is like someone you're meeting on Tinder

31:35.240 --> 31:37.240
and you're like, hey, like, let's go to fucking

31:37.240 --> 31:38.240
and then like.

31:38.240 --> 31:44.240
I don't like how close to my house that is.

31:44.240 --> 31:46.240
I'm a fuck to see those.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.240
Where do you live in town, man?

31:48.240 --> 31:50.240
I'm out jeffering you.

31:50.240 --> 31:52.240
This is so fucked up.

31:52.240 --> 31:53.240
You go.

31:53.240 --> 31:56.240
And after like one beer, you're like, let's go back to my place.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.240
Let's like, I want to try something interesting.

31:58.240 --> 31:59.240
And what's that thing?

31:59.240 --> 32:00.240
Yeah.

32:00.240 --> 32:02.240
So one beer and then I leave.

32:02.240 --> 32:04.240
And I offer to, for her to hear.

32:04.240 --> 32:05.240
Yeah.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.240
Actually, this is a good question.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.240
I don't know.

32:10.240 --> 32:12.240
You, you opened up the conversation.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.240
Harnesses.

32:15.240 --> 32:16.240
Sorry.

32:16.240 --> 32:17.240
Sorry.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.240
What?

32:22.240 --> 32:26.240
Like a fucking, like, that you're wearing.

32:26.240 --> 32:30.240
Or like sex swing type of situation.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.240
Sex swing type situation is there.

32:32.240 --> 32:35.240
I just haven't figured out a way to hang it.

32:35.240 --> 32:37.240
And my landlord lives above me.

32:37.240 --> 32:40.240
So I'm not going to put a fucking heck screw in the ceiling.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.240
All right.

32:41.240 --> 32:43.240
I don't know if they're with child or not.

32:43.240 --> 32:46.240
But what I have been doing and what I've been trying to make a habit

32:46.240 --> 32:48.240
out of doing is practicing.

32:48.240 --> 32:50.240
Sorry, Casey, but shibari.

32:50.240 --> 32:51.240
Right?

32:51.240 --> 32:53.240
It's fucking rope.

32:53.240 --> 32:54.240
Bondage man.

32:54.240 --> 32:58.240
So you figure out a way to make a harness around someone's thighs.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.240
You're on shibari TikTok.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.240
Yeah.

33:00.240 --> 33:01.240
Yeah.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.240
You're on shibari Instagram.

33:02.240 --> 33:03.240
Yeah.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.240
It's better.

33:04.240 --> 33:05.240
I can't understand.

33:06.240 --> 33:09.240
Don't obviously grace cut that out.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.240
I don't want to be in the same category as him.

33:11.240 --> 33:14.240
Because what he did crossed a lot of lines of consent.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.240
I'm sorry to say.

33:15.240 --> 33:16.240
Yeah.

33:16.240 --> 33:17.240
Wait, don't you have to show your ass on Twitter?

33:17.240 --> 33:18.240
What's that?

33:18.240 --> 33:19.240
Oh, yeah.

33:19.240 --> 33:20.240
I saw people were talking about that.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.240
That is pending.

33:21.240 --> 33:22.240
That is, first of all, patent pending.

33:22.240 --> 33:23.240
Second of all.

33:23.240 --> 33:25.240
Great March, lawsuit.

33:25.240 --> 33:26.240
It is pending.

33:27.240 --> 33:28.240
Marika knows what's happening.

33:28.240 --> 33:31.240
I'm planning something for a grand reveal.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.240
Next Friday.

33:32.240 --> 33:33.240
Are you doing an only fence for sure?

33:33.240 --> 33:34.240
It's so bad.

33:34.240 --> 33:37.240
I'm doing a lonely fence for my own fucking mental health man.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.240
When is this episode come out?

33:39.240 --> 33:41.240
Well, that'd be before after your butt.

33:41.240 --> 33:43.240
Uh, that's going to be before.

33:43.240 --> 33:44.240
Before we out?

33:44.240 --> 33:45.240

33:45.240 --> 33:47.240
Uh, well, we're recording next Friday.

33:47.240 --> 33:49.240

34:01.240 --> 34:02.240
A week from today's 28th.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.240
When you show your butt.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.240
Two more episodes that are coming out.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.240
So we're recording.

34:07.240 --> 34:08.240
Oh, yeah.

34:08.240 --> 34:09.240
Is this going to skip those?

34:09.240 --> 34:12.240
Or is this going to air like some time and make no them for them?

34:12.240 --> 34:13.240
Air this next spring.

34:13.240 --> 34:17.240
Here's what's going to happen.

34:17.240 --> 34:18.240
Right?

34:18.240 --> 34:20.240
Is this good for the listen?

34:20.240 --> 34:21.240
Yeah.

34:21.240 --> 34:22.240
Good for that.

34:22.240 --> 34:23.240
Any updates?

34:23.240 --> 34:24.240
Listen.

34:25.240 --> 34:26.240
What I'm going to do.

34:26.240 --> 34:28.240
We have two episodes from New York that are banked.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.240
Those are going to come out after today's episode.

34:30.240 --> 34:33.240
Just so that I can announce to people that.

34:33.240 --> 34:34.240
Wait.

34:34.240 --> 34:35.240
No.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.240
I'm right here.

34:36.240 --> 34:42.240
I'm physically shaking because I've had too much caffeine.

34:42.240 --> 34:43.240
Um, my eye is twitching.

34:43.240 --> 34:44.240
Okay.

34:44.240 --> 34:45.240
Okay.

34:45.240 --> 34:48.240
This episode is coming out on November 4th.

34:48.240 --> 34:49.240
Correct.

34:49.240 --> 34:50.240
Currently scheduled.

34:50.240 --> 34:52.240
Unless we want to change that.

34:52.240 --> 34:53.240
So you could announce.

34:53.240 --> 34:54.240
Nay.

34:54.240 --> 34:57.240
But again, the listeners know when it came out.

34:57.240 --> 34:58.240
Yeah, they're listening to this.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.240
They're listening to this.

34:59.240 --> 35:00.240
Yeah.

35:00.240 --> 35:01.240
Yeah.

35:01.240 --> 35:02.240
Everybody's listening on November 11th.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.240
And we're like October 28th.

35:04.240 --> 35:05.240
Maybe.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.240
Next Friday, October 28th.

35:07.240 --> 35:10.240
There's going to be a surprise.

35:10.240 --> 35:11.240
During the record.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.240
Something will.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.240
I think this is coming out like tomorrow.

35:13.240 --> 35:14.240
Yeah.

35:14.240 --> 35:15.240
Who are you talking?

35:15.240 --> 35:16.240
Yeah.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.240
So we have to move on.

35:18.240 --> 35:21.240
Last Friday, October 28th.

35:21.240 --> 35:27.240
You will have watching this having seen Jeff's ass for a week.

35:27.240 --> 35:29.240
My ass is coming.

35:29.240 --> 35:33.240
Whether anyone likes or not.

35:33.240 --> 35:37.240
With consent because there's going to be a sensitive content warning on Twitter.

35:37.240 --> 35:39.240
Otherwise, I'll lose my verification.

35:39.240 --> 35:40.240
Are you doing it on Twitter?

35:40.240 --> 35:41.240
Doing it on Instagram.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.240
Instagram.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.240
You're off for sure.

35:43.240 --> 35:44.240
You can.

35:44.240 --> 35:45.240
You can put born on Twitter.

35:45.240 --> 35:46.240
You can put born on Twitter.

35:46.240 --> 35:47.240
You can't put on Instagram.

35:47.240 --> 35:50.240
And you know, I'm very good at the fact that you haven't done it on a research.

35:50.240 --> 35:51.240
It's exactly my onion.

35:51.240 --> 35:52.240
It's the super rising cruise.

35:52.240 --> 35:54.240
Like we have to move on.

35:54.240 --> 35:55.240
We have to move on.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.240
We have to move on.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.240
Yeah.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.240
Break it.

35:58.240 --> 36:01.240
You've been holding your show together for a really long time.

36:01.240 --> 36:03.240
I don't think anyone talks about that.

36:03.240 --> 36:04.240
Welcome to.

36:04.240 --> 36:10.240
The hash cab.

36:10.240 --> 36:12.240
We should have put it on the.

36:12.240 --> 36:14.240
Yeah, because I was like, yeah.

36:14.240 --> 36:15.240
What?

36:15.240 --> 36:17.240
Is this the smart Samsung smart?

36:17.240 --> 36:18.240
It's the frame.

36:18.240 --> 36:19.240
Click on it.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.240
Yeah.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.240
Did you make this graphic?

36:22.240 --> 36:23.240
I did.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.240
That's awesome.

36:24.240 --> 36:25.240
I did.

36:25.240 --> 36:27.240
We already played gash cab.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.240
So there wasn't that much work to be done.

36:29.240 --> 36:30.240
Sorry.

36:30.240 --> 36:32.240
I turned the G into an age.

36:32.240 --> 36:34.240
Yeah.

36:34.240 --> 36:37.240
I guess this is not a heighten for gash cab.

36:37.240 --> 36:38.240
Yeah.

36:38.240 --> 36:39.240
It's a de-escalation.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.240
Yeah.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.240
Here's how things are going to go.

36:41.240 --> 36:44.240
I'm going to ask you guys general knowledge questions about hash.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.240
They stash.

36:46.240 --> 36:48.240
That's pretty good.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.240
There are days.

36:51.240 --> 36:54.240
Man, where I'm like, let's just so I can take it into the courtyard.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.240
Let's go courtyard.

36:56.240 --> 36:59.240
Where are you going to beat him at in the courtyard?

36:59.240 --> 37:01.240
Oh, fuck.

37:01.240 --> 37:03.240
Fisticos.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.240
Don't want to be me.

37:05.240 --> 37:10.240
I'm going to ask you general knowledge questions about hash browns.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.240
Okay.

37:11.240 --> 37:12.240
They start me.

37:12.240 --> 37:17.240
I just now I have an image of like a Jeff versus a mirror.

37:17.240 --> 37:21.240
Like Logan Paul versus whoever the fuck you thought.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.240
Boxing match.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.240
And I feel like we should do that.

37:25.240 --> 37:26.240
People would pay for that.

37:26.240 --> 37:27.240
Yeah.

37:27.240 --> 37:30.240
You would actually want to like put boxing gloves on and fight me.

37:30.240 --> 37:31.240
Yeah.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.240
Could be fun.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.240
I feel like you're secretly buff.

37:34.240 --> 37:35.240
Oh, really?

37:35.240 --> 37:36.240
I don't know.

37:36.240 --> 37:37.240
Do you work out more?

37:37.240 --> 37:38.240
I used to work out more.

37:38.240 --> 37:40.240
I'm less buff now than I was like in 2018.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.240
Okay.

37:41.240 --> 37:43.240
Jeff.

37:43.240 --> 37:46.240
I don't think I've gone to the gym since April.

37:46.240 --> 37:49.240
But I've been walking a lot.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.240
Let's have a walk off.

37:51.240 --> 37:52.240
A walkathon.

37:52.240 --> 37:53.240
Yeah.

37:53.240 --> 37:54.240
Did you put on treadmills?

37:54.240 --> 37:55.240
First of the hit.

37:55.240 --> 37:58.240
Santa Monica wins.

37:58.240 --> 38:01.240
The Ellie marathon is like in three months.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.240
I wonder if we walk it.

38:02.240 --> 38:03.240
That's pretty cool.

38:03.240 --> 38:04.240
Yeah.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.240
That'd be awesome.

38:05.240 --> 38:06.240
Let's go walk it.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.240
And then we also record it.

38:07.240 --> 38:09.240
And then it's walk it as I tuck it.

38:09.240 --> 38:10.240
Okay.

38:10.240 --> 38:12.240
Walk it as I howling would it take to walk a marathon.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.240
12 hours.

38:13.240 --> 38:15.240
Can I just fucking read.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.240
Now I'm like actually a little.

38:17.240 --> 38:20.240
What are you reeling you, are we?

38:20.240 --> 38:23.240
And when you were making this segment, did you make this segment being like,

38:23.240 --> 38:24.240
Well, Miles is coming on.

38:24.240 --> 38:25.240
He knows a lot about hash bones.

38:25.240 --> 38:26.240
Or was it like you had this banked.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.240
And then you were like, he's going to come on.

38:28.240 --> 38:30.240
I just enjoy the segment.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.240
Uh, I've sort of panicked last night.

38:32.240 --> 38:35.240
And it was like, I need to play a game.

38:35.240 --> 38:36.240
Cool.

38:36.240 --> 38:37.240
And that's good.

38:37.240 --> 38:39.240
They primed with cash.

38:39.240 --> 38:40.240
Yeah.

38:40.240 --> 38:41.240
Yeah.

38:41.240 --> 38:42.240
Yeah.

38:42.240 --> 38:43.240
Yeah.

38:43.240 --> 38:46.240
I'm going to ask you general knowledge questions about hash.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.240
They start off easy and get harder as you go.

38:48.240 --> 38:53.240
And as long as you answer them correctly, you will win a hash brown.

38:53.240 --> 38:57.240
So you were in the, I'm surprised these aren't treated Joe's frozen hash brown.

38:57.240 --> 39:00.240
They serve from the little market near my house.

39:00.240 --> 39:02.240
Uh, is that good?

39:02.240 --> 39:05.240
We should have um, should have heated them.

39:05.240 --> 39:07.240
So you can actually eat them.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.240
Yeah.

39:08.240 --> 39:11.240
Um, three strikes though for three wrong answers.

39:11.240 --> 39:14.240
And you're out of here.

39:14.240 --> 39:19.240
You can also use one 15 second brown out, which is basically phoning a friend.

39:19.240 --> 39:21.240
Do we have a limited option?

39:21.240 --> 39:22.240
Who we can call or anybody.

39:22.240 --> 39:24.240
Uh, no, but you just have to do 15.

39:24.240 --> 39:25.240
It's 15 seconds or less.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.240
And if you exceed 15 seconds, that's another strike.

39:27.240 --> 39:28.240
Uh, here we go.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.240
Marie, can you get it?

39:29.240 --> 39:30.240
Or do you have to let share?

39:30.240 --> 39:31.240
Sure.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.240
You're like your five.

39:32.240 --> 39:33.240
Okay.

39:33.240 --> 39:37.240
Um, two or false hash browns are popular American and British breakfast food

39:37.240 --> 39:40.240
consisting of finely chopped potatoes that have been fried until brown.

39:40.240 --> 39:41.240
True.

39:41.240 --> 39:42.240
True.

39:42.240 --> 39:43.240
True.

39:43.240 --> 39:44.240
That is correct.

39:44.240 --> 39:46.240
I heard, uh, Marieka first.

39:46.240 --> 39:47.240
Actually, I forgot.

39:47.240 --> 39:49.240
This is a team effort.

39:49.240 --> 39:51.240
Um,

39:51.240 --> 39:54.240
Oh.

39:54.240 --> 39:57.240
And what do we just exercising a demon?

39:57.240 --> 39:58.240
Yeah.

39:58.240 --> 39:59.240
I was like, kind of a moan.

39:59.240 --> 40:02.240
Never heard that noise come out of you.

40:02.240 --> 40:08.240
Uh, I'm actually glad you brought up moans because I used my sleep at last night.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.240
Take your phone out of your ass.

40:11.240 --> 40:14.240
Your voice is so deep.

40:14.240 --> 40:18.240
Is it, did you record yourself moaning?

40:18.240 --> 40:23.240
Um, not on purpose, but yeah, let's get something for it.

40:23.240 --> 40:26.240
Oh.

40:26.240 --> 40:27.240
Oh.

40:27.240 --> 40:29.240
Look at the middle of the night.

40:29.240 --> 40:32.240
That's so intimate to hear.

40:32.240 --> 40:34.240
Oh, my God.

40:34.240 --> 40:36.240
I know he's so private.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.240
You don't even know you made.

40:38.240 --> 40:39.240
I can't hear it.

40:39.240 --> 40:40.240
Well, just great.

40:40.240 --> 40:41.240
Oh.

40:41.240 --> 40:44.240
I was sharing a bed with someone the other night.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.240
And I punched them in the face by accident as I was obviously.

40:46.240 --> 40:47.240
Interesting.

40:47.240 --> 40:48.240
Somebody you went to birdsman.

40:52.240 --> 40:57.240
Uh, in what decade was the hash brown appearing on New York City diner menus?

40:57.240 --> 40:58.240
What decade?

40:58.240 --> 41:00.240
Hey, the 1770s.

41:00.240 --> 41:01.240
No, no.

41:01.240 --> 41:02.240
B, the 1890s.

41:02.240 --> 41:03.240
No way.

41:03.240 --> 41:04.240
See, the 1920s.

41:04.240 --> 41:06.240
Wow, that was going to be my guess.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.240
Okay.

41:07.240 --> 41:08.240
The 1950s.

41:08.240 --> 41:10.240
I'm going to go 20s.

41:10.240 --> 41:13.240
And I guess we answering as a unit or do we get the three answers?

41:13.240 --> 41:16.240
You all get your own answers, but you know, whatever.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.240
So I'll do 20s.

41:17.240 --> 41:18.240
20s?

41:18.240 --> 41:19.240
Solid.

41:19.240 --> 41:20.240
1890s.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.240
Oh, interesting.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.240
Because I was going to go 1950s.

41:22.240 --> 41:25.240
Like diners that we, you know, see.

41:25.240 --> 41:27.240
Uh, you guys are not a unified front, actually.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.240
It's every man from self.

41:28.240 --> 41:31.240
Uh, Marieka's actually exactly right.

41:31.240 --> 41:33.240
Uh, you guys just got two strikes.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.240
Uh, another matter.

41:34.240 --> 41:41.240
We drew a false, the original name for the dish was hashed browned potatoes.

41:41.240 --> 41:44.240
Say that last time.

41:44.240 --> 41:45.240
Potatoers.

41:45.240 --> 41:48.240
And, and I see it more to it, really.

41:48.240 --> 41:53.240
The original name was hashed browned potatoes.

41:53.240 --> 41:57.240
You know, that orida is Oregon and Idaho.

41:57.240 --> 41:58.240
Really?

41:58.240 --> 41:59.240
Yeah.

41:59.240 --> 42:03.240
That famous potato company orida is actually portmento.

42:03.240 --> 42:05.240
Do you know that, Marieka?

42:05.240 --> 42:06.240
We have another segment to get to.

42:06.240 --> 42:07.240
It's pretty cool.

42:07.240 --> 42:08.240
Right.

42:08.240 --> 42:09.240
It's pretty cool.

42:09.240 --> 42:12.240
I just want to make sure that people were actually learning

42:12.240 --> 42:13.240
shit.

42:13.240 --> 42:14.240
False.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.240
Uh, yes.

42:15.240 --> 42:16.240
Sure.

42:16.240 --> 42:17.240
They were called hashed.

42:17.240 --> 42:18.240
True.

42:18.240 --> 42:19.240
False.

42:22.240 --> 42:23.240
That's correct.

42:23.240 --> 42:24.240
You all have one star.

42:24.240 --> 42:25.240
Uh, star.

42:25.240 --> 42:26.240
Strike.

42:26.240 --> 42:27.240
Uh, let's correct.

42:27.240 --> 42:29.240
You just said that's correct.

42:29.240 --> 42:30.240
Yeah.

42:30.240 --> 42:31.240
You guys were right.

42:31.240 --> 42:32.240
We're right.

42:33.240 --> 42:34.240
Uh, we're right.

42:34.240 --> 42:35.240
Got it, man.

42:35.240 --> 42:36.240
Yeah.

42:36.240 --> 42:37.240
The way.

42:37.240 --> 42:38.240
I'm just trying to go.

42:38.240 --> 42:42.240
The words hashed is dried from what?

42:42.240 --> 42:44.240
French word.

42:44.240 --> 42:45.240
A.

42:45.240 --> 42:46.240
Hosse.

42:46.240 --> 42:48.240
B.

42:48.240 --> 42:49.240
Brosse.

42:49.240 --> 42:50.240
C.

42:50.240 --> 42:52.240
Oro.

42:52.240 --> 42:53.240
Or D.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.240
Hashet.

42:54.240 --> 42:55.240
I don't remember the question.

42:55.240 --> 42:56.240
That wasn't paying attention.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.240
And none of them sound like hash except for the last one.

43:00.240 --> 43:06.240
Can you give us the definitions of each of those?

43:06.240 --> 43:07.240
Hosse.

43:07.240 --> 43:09.240
Uh, is to raise.

43:09.240 --> 43:11.240
Brosse is to tan.

43:11.240 --> 43:14.240
Oh, oh, is happy.

43:14.240 --> 43:17.240
And Hashet is to hack or chop.

43:17.240 --> 43:18.240
I'm going to go for Hashet.

43:18.240 --> 43:19.240
Yes.

43:19.240 --> 43:20.240
Of course.

43:20.240 --> 43:21.240
Yeah.

43:21.240 --> 43:22.240
Have you defined it?

43:22.240 --> 43:23.240
It's an easy giving.

43:23.240 --> 43:26.240
What similar Swedish dish?

43:27.240 --> 43:29.240
A.

43:29.240 --> 43:30.240
Mote.

43:30.240 --> 43:32.240
B.

43:32.240 --> 43:34.240
Roasty.

43:34.240 --> 43:36.240
No way.

43:36.240 --> 43:38.240
C.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.240
Yarna.

43:39.240 --> 43:40.240
Or D.

43:40.240 --> 43:42.240
Yattipin.

43:42.240 --> 43:43.240
Also.

43:43.240 --> 43:45.240
This is a really badly question.

43:45.240 --> 43:47.240
Why is it also with Marika?

43:47.240 --> 43:51.240
This is a poorly very questioned because those dishes could be anything.

43:51.240 --> 43:52.240
It's any.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.240
You said what dish predates.

43:55.240 --> 43:56.240
It doesn't have to be potatoes.

43:56.240 --> 43:57.240
It could be what?

43:57.240 --> 43:58.240
What?

43:58.240 --> 43:59.240
What?

43:59.240 --> 44:00.240
Similar Swedish dish.

44:00.240 --> 44:01.240
I should say.

44:01.240 --> 44:03.240
And again, you can brown out.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.240
Brownly out.

44:05.240 --> 44:07.240
By calling a friend.

44:07.240 --> 44:08.240
Well, it's.

44:08.240 --> 44:09.240
It's.

44:09.240 --> 44:10.240
Call your.

44:10.240 --> 44:13.240
Call your girl friend.

44:13.240 --> 44:16.240
Say it's not a hash.

44:16.240 --> 44:17.240
Yeah.

44:17.240 --> 44:23.240
My mom is not going to answer a text in 15 seconds.

44:23.240 --> 44:24.240
Can you repeat them?

44:24.240 --> 44:25.240
Time is up.

44:25.240 --> 44:27.240
The correct answer was.

44:27.240 --> 44:29.240
Roasty.

44:29.240 --> 44:30.240
You said.

44:30.240 --> 44:31.240
Roasty.

44:31.240 --> 44:32.240
Yeah.

44:32.240 --> 44:33.240
I don't know.

44:33.240 --> 44:34.240
Say it.

44:34.240 --> 44:35.240
I first you said.

44:35.240 --> 44:36.240
Wow.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.240
And you gave up.

44:37.240 --> 44:38.240
And you said.

44:38.240 --> 44:39.240
Roasty.

44:39.240 --> 44:42.240
It's like a pan fried potatoes.

44:42.240 --> 44:44.240
Cake.

44:44.240 --> 44:45.240
Like a lot.

44:45.240 --> 44:46.240
Yeah.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.240
Oh.

44:47.240 --> 44:48.240
Oh.

44:48.240 --> 44:50.240
Somebody said the words of the day.

44:50.240 --> 44:52.240
I forgot about that.

44:52.240 --> 44:55.240
Yeah.

44:55.240 --> 44:56.240
Ah.

44:56.240 --> 44:58.240
Fucking.

44:58.240 --> 45:02.240
It's time for the brown pan challenge.

45:02.240 --> 45:05.240
LA is home to many famous diners.

45:05.240 --> 45:06.240
Yeah.

45:06.240 --> 45:10.240
Name eight notorious LA diners in 30 seconds.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.240
Starting.

45:11.240 --> 45:12.240
LA only.

45:12.240 --> 45:13.240
Ah.

45:13.240 --> 45:14.240
Yeah.

45:14.240 --> 45:15.240
Sorry, Maria.

45:15.240 --> 45:16.240
But LA only.

45:16.240 --> 45:17.240
You have 30 seconds.

45:17.240 --> 45:21.240
If you can name eight, you will take home this tray of hash.

45:22.240 --> 45:23.240
Browns.

45:23.240 --> 45:24.240
Minus one.

45:24.240 --> 45:26.240
You actually only get one.

45:26.240 --> 45:29.240
I accidentally googled 30 seconds to Mars.

45:29.240 --> 45:30.240
Here we go.

45:30.240 --> 45:31.240
Starting now.

45:31.240 --> 45:34.240
Eight diners in LA made famous by hash.

45:34.240 --> 45:35.240
Fred 62.

45:35.240 --> 45:36.240
Correct.

45:36.240 --> 45:37.240
Nell's driving.

45:37.240 --> 45:38.240
Yes.

45:38.240 --> 45:39.240
Heroes.

45:39.240 --> 45:40.240
Yeah.

45:40.240 --> 45:41.240
What's that?

45:41.240 --> 45:42.240
Caros.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.240
Okay.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.240
I trust you.

45:44.240 --> 45:45.240
You were born here.

45:45.240 --> 45:46.240
Denny's.

45:46.240 --> 45:47.240
Yep.

45:47.240 --> 45:48.240
The one here.

45:49.240 --> 45:50.240
Diners.

45:50.240 --> 45:51.240
And then.

45:51.240 --> 45:52.240
Emerson.

45:52.240 --> 45:53.240
Big one.

45:53.240 --> 45:54.240
Yeah.

45:54.240 --> 45:55.240
Johnny Rockets.

45:55.240 --> 45:56.240
Yep.

45:56.240 --> 45:57.240
Is that seven?

45:57.240 --> 45:58.240
Millies.

45:58.240 --> 45:59.240
Yes.

45:59.240 --> 46:02.240
That's correct.

46:02.240 --> 46:03.240
Me.

46:03.240 --> 46:05.240
That's right there.

46:05.240 --> 46:07.240
It's close.

46:07.240 --> 46:08.240
Yes.

46:08.240 --> 46:09.240
Really close.

46:09.240 --> 46:11.240
Potatoes aren't great.

46:11.240 --> 46:14.240
Those are all places that are famous for hash.

46:15.240 --> 46:17.240
Doopars.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.240
Yeah.

46:18.240 --> 46:20.240
Apple pan.

46:20.240 --> 46:21.240
Now.

46:21.240 --> 46:22.240
You guys have.

46:22.240 --> 46:24.240
All want a hash brown.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.240
I mean.

46:25.240 --> 46:26.240
I mean.

46:26.240 --> 46:27.240
I sound.

46:27.240 --> 46:29.240
Obviously not me though.

46:29.240 --> 46:31.240
I mean.

46:31.240 --> 46:32.240
I mean.

46:32.240 --> 46:33.240
I mean.

46:33.240 --> 46:35.240
As this goes on.

46:35.240 --> 46:38.240
I'm not done yet.

46:38.240 --> 46:42.240
Because y'all can double down on the ground.

46:42.240 --> 46:45.240
You can double brown.

46:45.240 --> 46:46.240
Brown.

46:46.240 --> 46:47.240
Bye.

46:47.240 --> 46:49.240
Naming the movie.

46:49.240 --> 46:51.240
That this quote.

46:51.240 --> 46:52.240
Is from.

46:52.240 --> 46:54.240
Are you guys going to double brown?

46:54.240 --> 46:55.240
I think so.

46:55.240 --> 46:56.240
Yeah.

46:56.240 --> 46:57.240
All right.

46:57.240 --> 46:59.240
It's good thing you just.

46:59.240 --> 47:01.240
We're going to need to hear.

47:01.240 --> 47:02.240
No.

47:02.240 --> 47:03.240
You got.

47:03.240 --> 47:04.240
No.

47:04.240 --> 47:05.240
On you.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.240
I don't want to give up the browns.

47:07.240 --> 47:09.240
I think he thinks if we hear.

47:10.240 --> 47:13.240
Well, he needs the hash browns.

47:13.240 --> 47:15.240
Well, he needs the hash browns for his feast later.

47:15.240 --> 47:16.240
Yeah.

47:16.240 --> 47:18.240
It's going to be mostly hash.

47:18.240 --> 47:19.240
Yeah.

47:19.240 --> 47:20.240
Do you see does that sound familiar?

47:20.240 --> 47:21.240
Wait.

47:21.240 --> 47:22.240
Can you see.

47:22.240 --> 47:23.240
Can you play it again?

47:23.240 --> 47:25.240
It's good thing you didn't know hash browns.

47:25.240 --> 47:27.240
It does sound familiar.

47:27.240 --> 47:29.240
Is it from six crazy pieces or whatever?

47:29.240 --> 47:30.240
You're the movie with your mouth.

47:30.240 --> 47:31.240
No.

47:31.240 --> 47:33.240
That's just what's in my closet.

47:33.240 --> 47:35.240
Okay.

47:35.240 --> 47:36.240
Another correction.

47:36.240 --> 47:37.240
Crazy.

47:38.240 --> 47:39.240
I don't know.

47:39.240 --> 47:40.240
It's not even.

47:40.240 --> 47:42.240
It's the movie where Jack Nicholson is like.

47:42.240 --> 47:43.240
Five easy pieces.

47:43.240 --> 47:44.240
Five easy pieces.

47:44.240 --> 47:45.240
I wanted that one.

47:45.240 --> 47:47.240
It's good to eat your hash browns.

47:47.240 --> 47:48.240
Is that famous actor?

47:48.240 --> 47:49.240
Who's the actor?

47:49.240 --> 47:50.240
I don't know who the actor is.

47:50.240 --> 47:51.240
Christian Slater.

47:51.240 --> 47:52.240
Yeah.

47:52.240 --> 47:54.240
It's good to eat it in your hash browns.

47:54.240 --> 47:56.240
It's a cool guy.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.240
I'll give you two hints.

47:58.240 --> 47:59.240
Okay.

47:59.240 --> 48:00.240
Is it a quintet?

48:00.240 --> 48:01.240
2001.

48:01.240 --> 48:03.240
Kind of a cult comedy classic.

48:03.240 --> 48:05.240
I was at that movie that you really liked.

48:05.240 --> 48:06.240
That nobody really likes.

48:07.240 --> 48:09.240
Swingers.

48:09.240 --> 48:10.240
Wow.

48:10.240 --> 48:11.240
That's a good guess.

48:11.240 --> 48:13.240
That's 90's though.

48:13.240 --> 48:15.240
I am sorry, guys.

48:15.240 --> 48:16.240
But um.

48:18.240 --> 48:20.240
You doubled or nothing in you all.

48:20.240 --> 48:21.240
Is it.

48:21.240 --> 48:22.240
Is it.

48:22.240 --> 48:24.240
Fast times at Ridgemont High.

48:24.240 --> 48:25.240
Right.

48:25.240 --> 48:26.240
Yes.

48:26.240 --> 48:27.240
Stand right now.

48:27.240 --> 48:28.240
It's the opposite.

48:28.240 --> 48:29.240
It's the opposite.

48:29.240 --> 48:32.240
Isn't that before the 2001?

48:32.240 --> 48:33.240
Yeah.

48:33.240 --> 48:34.240
Older woman.

48:34.240 --> 48:35.240
Stand in a fair.

48:35.240 --> 48:36.240
Easy.

48:36.240 --> 48:37.240
Made.

48:37.240 --> 48:39.240
It was from Super Troopers.

48:39.240 --> 48:40.240
No.

48:40.240 --> 48:41.240
No.

48:41.240 --> 48:42.240
Okay.

48:42.240 --> 48:55.240
This is kind of fucked up, but we have another second.

48:55.240 --> 48:57.240
What did you just look at suddenly?

48:57.240 --> 48:58.240
I don't know.

48:58.240 --> 48:59.240
I had the.

48:59.240 --> 49:00.240
Oh, here it goes.

49:04.240 --> 49:06.240
I guess I should just stop screens sharing.

49:06.240 --> 49:08.240
Because then it goes to the logo, huh?

49:08.240 --> 49:10.240
Is this all going in?

49:18.240 --> 49:20.240
I'm like, I.

49:20.240 --> 49:22.240
Yeah.

49:22.240 --> 49:24.240
I graduated high school early.

49:24.240 --> 49:25.240
Yeah.

49:25.240 --> 49:26.240
I had a 4.0 GPA.

49:26.240 --> 49:29.240
I got a 2340 on my SATs.

49:29.240 --> 49:30.240
I'm a very smart person.

49:31.240 --> 49:33.240
And then now what I look where I found myself.

49:33.240 --> 49:34.240
Yeah.

49:34.240 --> 49:35.240
That's really smart.

49:35.240 --> 49:36.240
A 2340.

49:36.240 --> 49:37.240
Yeah.

49:37.240 --> 49:38.240
Back when I was on the 23.

49:38.240 --> 49:39.240
For 2400scare.

49:39.240 --> 49:40.240
Scale.

49:40.240 --> 49:41.240
Here.

49:41.240 --> 49:43.240
I'm a fucking dumbass.

49:43.240 --> 49:44.240
Welcome to.

49:44.240 --> 49:46.240
And I actually do need to screen share again.

49:46.240 --> 49:47.240
This is fucked up.

49:47.240 --> 49:49.240
He's this.

49:49.240 --> 49:52.240
Welcome to hash or brown.

49:52.240 --> 49:56.240
That's where you either have potatoes or me.

49:56.240 --> 49:59.240
Or have or have potatoes.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.240
All right.

50:01.240 --> 50:05.240
This is a segment I like to call the Miles digs test.

50:05.240 --> 50:06.240
Miles.

50:06.240 --> 50:07.240
Do you know your Myers Briggs?

50:07.240 --> 50:11.240
I think I was like in the NFB like a long time ago, but I'm taking a while.

50:11.240 --> 50:12.240
Interesting.

50:12.240 --> 50:14.240
You got to come out things with more judgment.

50:14.240 --> 50:16.240
Um, what does that mean?

50:16.240 --> 50:20.240
Like I should be more discerning about the test I take or I should have taken it sooner.

50:20.240 --> 50:21.240
Casey.

50:21.240 --> 50:22.240
What?

50:22.240 --> 50:25.240
You're going to really go ahead and talk to me.

50:26.240 --> 50:27.240
Okay.

50:27.240 --> 50:32.240
So what we're going to do, the name of the game is Miles digs.

50:32.240 --> 50:36.240
Miles, you are going to re-up on your Myers Briggs.

50:36.240 --> 50:37.240
Let's do it.

50:37.240 --> 50:38.240
Well, hang on a second.

50:38.240 --> 50:41.240
You're going to figure out your personality of the 16 personalities.

50:41.240 --> 50:44.240
And while you do that, we're going to sort of take unrelenting digs that you're going

50:44.240 --> 50:45.240
to bully your ass.

50:45.240 --> 50:46.240
Jesus.

50:46.240 --> 50:47.240
Okay.

50:47.240 --> 50:48.240
Let's do it.

50:48.240 --> 50:49.240
All right.

50:49.240 --> 50:50.240
You regularly make new friends.

50:50.240 --> 50:51.240
I guess I agree.

50:51.240 --> 50:52.240
Sure.

50:53.240 --> 50:55.240
Sadness behind drugs is otherwise.

50:55.240 --> 50:56.240
Seems nice.

50:56.240 --> 50:57.240
No idea.

50:57.240 --> 50:58.240
But yeah, thanks.

50:58.240 --> 51:00.240
Uh, you kind of suck.

51:00.240 --> 51:01.240
You kind of suck.

51:01.240 --> 51:02.240
A full year group.

51:02.240 --> 51:03.240
You have a sadness.

51:03.240 --> 51:04.240
Yeah.

51:04.240 --> 51:05.240
You came to you.

51:05.240 --> 51:06.240
Your sad.

51:06.240 --> 51:07.240
It seems like you have a lot of it.

51:07.240 --> 51:09.240
Can a mirror take this at the same time?

51:09.240 --> 51:11.240
Because I really want to know what a mirror says.

51:11.240 --> 51:12.240
You might be opposite.

51:12.240 --> 51:16.240
Uh, you don't take kindly to people changing the segment mid to way.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.240
I'm sorry.

51:17.240 --> 51:18.240
We just started.

51:18.240 --> 51:19.240
Yeah.

51:19.240 --> 51:20.240
Yeah.

51:20.240 --> 51:21.240
I got another question.

51:21.240 --> 51:22.240
Is that what they do it from here?

51:22.240 --> 51:23.240
Okay.

51:23.240 --> 51:24.240
There's that one.

51:24.240 --> 51:25.240
And that's that.

51:25.240 --> 51:26.240
That's that.

51:26.240 --> 51:27.240
The web site.

51:27.240 --> 51:28.240
Sorry.

51:28.240 --> 51:29.240
The web site.

51:29.240 --> 51:30.240
Sorry.

51:30.240 --> 51:36.240
The team personalities.com forward slash free dash personality dash test.

51:36.240 --> 51:37.240
Seems like that.

51:37.240 --> 51:38.240
Thank you.

51:38.240 --> 51:39.240
America too.

51:39.240 --> 51:40.240
Hashtarown game.

51:40.240 --> 51:41.240
Yeah.

51:41.240 --> 51:42.240
Do you guys want to see my finances?

51:42.240 --> 51:43.240
Yeah.

51:43.240 --> 51:44.240
Yeah.

51:44.240 --> 51:45.240
Be great.

51:45.240 --> 51:47.240
The mic.

51:47.240 --> 51:48.240
Kind of impressive.

51:48.240 --> 51:49.240
You're going to open.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.240
This feels like the moon that we saw.

51:50.240 --> 51:51.240
Oh, my lord.

51:51.240 --> 51:52.240
I don't know.

51:52.240 --> 51:53.240
I don't know.

51:53.240 --> 51:54.240
I don't know.

51:54.240 --> 51:55.240
I don't know.

51:55.240 --> 51:56.240
I don't know.

51:56.240 --> 51:57.240
I don't know.

51:57.240 --> 51:58.240
I don't know.

51:58.240 --> 52:02.240
So what I do is this is what I'm allowed to spend for myself.

52:02.240 --> 52:03.240
This is rent each month.

52:03.240 --> 52:05.240
And then this is my savings.

52:05.240 --> 52:07.240
And that's particularly high at the moment.

52:07.240 --> 52:09.240
Because I just was in a Shopify commercial.

52:09.240 --> 52:12.240
That's good.

52:12.240 --> 52:15.240
That was just the low balance alert is tough.

52:15.240 --> 52:17.240
Well, I have to have discipline.

52:17.240 --> 52:19.240
Otherwise, I spend it all on a fucking what.

52:19.240 --> 52:20.240
Yeah.

52:20.240 --> 52:29.240
But I would have granted it regularly.

52:29.240 --> 52:34.240
I'm trying to get a fucking word.

52:34.240 --> 52:35.240
It's fun.

52:35.240 --> 52:38.240
And you played three sound effects.

52:38.240 --> 52:39.240
What only happened?

52:39.240 --> 52:41.240
Also, you should put the slit.

52:41.240 --> 52:43.240
Sorry, I'll first say it.

52:43.240 --> 52:53.240
If you guys could flag that at the forehead happens, it'd be great for the other.

52:53.240 --> 52:54.240
You added.

52:54.240 --> 52:58.240
You added that at the forehead happens.

52:58.240 --> 53:01.240
This might be the most unjust I've ever done.

53:01.240 --> 53:03.240
Don't you say agree or disagree?

53:03.240 --> 53:04.240
Like you have to say.

53:04.240 --> 53:05.240
I said, yeah.

53:05.240 --> 53:06.240
I agree.

53:06.240 --> 53:07.240
I agree.

53:07.240 --> 53:08.240
I agree.

53:08.240 --> 53:09.240
I agree.

53:09.240 --> 53:10.240
I agree.

53:10.240 --> 53:11.240
I agree.

53:12.240 --> 53:13.240
And then in a move.

53:13.240 --> 53:17.240
No, I don't make friends, but I don't make new friends that easily.

53:17.240 --> 53:18.240
I would go in the middle.

53:18.240 --> 53:20.240
The smallest green, you know.

53:20.240 --> 53:24.240
You spend a lot of your free time exploring various random topics that peeke your interests.

53:24.240 --> 53:25.240
Yeah, for sure.

53:25.240 --> 53:26.240
Maybe like middle of the green?

53:26.240 --> 53:27.240
Yeah.

53:27.240 --> 53:30.240
I sort of have the same hobbies that I always had.

53:30.240 --> 53:31.240
But yeah.

53:31.240 --> 53:34.240
I explore I guess various random things.

53:34.240 --> 53:36.240
All the dogs out on the floor.

53:36.240 --> 53:37.240
Say that again.

53:37.240 --> 53:38.240
Here's the next hobby to explore.

53:38.240 --> 53:39.240
When you get out of the shower,

53:39.240 --> 53:42.000
out of the shower, little servy, right?

53:42.000 --> 53:44.960
A little weird dress learned how to pronounce that last week.

53:44.960 --> 53:48.640
Great shot, I'm the obitray.

53:48.640 --> 53:50.040
She's drinking milk.

53:50.040 --> 53:52.440
I've never seen that before.

53:52.440 --> 53:53.280
Full glass of hold.

53:53.280 --> 53:55.320
Give me the smallest green circle for my answer.

53:55.320 --> 53:58.160
Okay, seeing other people cry can easily make you feel like you want to cry too.

53:58.160 --> 54:00.160
Oh no, full of disagree.

54:00.160 --> 54:02.400
Yeah, I'm a hard sociopath disagree on that one.

54:02.400 --> 54:04.960
Well, I think it's just like I've already cried all the tears I need to cry.

54:04.960 --> 54:05.960
Yeah.

54:05.960 --> 54:06.960
What do you mean?

54:06.960 --> 54:07.960
This doesn't affect me whatsoever.

54:07.960 --> 54:11.880
Oh, you're like that sad for them and I'll comfort them, but it doesn't make me need to cry.

54:11.880 --> 54:12.880
Okay.

54:12.880 --> 54:14.280
So, okay.

54:14.280 --> 54:15.280
What if you're what?

54:15.280 --> 54:16.280
Both of you.

54:16.280 --> 54:17.880
How hard disagree for both of you is.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.280
Maybe not hard.

54:19.280 --> 54:21.400
Like it makes me sad, but it doesn't make me cry.

54:21.400 --> 54:22.400
I don't cry really.

54:22.400 --> 54:23.400
Yeah.

54:23.400 --> 54:24.400
Okay.

54:24.400 --> 54:26.680
You don't be uncomfortable by that.

54:26.680 --> 54:29.400
No, I also don't cry, but it's for different reasons.

54:29.400 --> 54:30.400
What's that?

54:30.400 --> 54:31.400
My bowing gland dysfunction.

54:31.400 --> 54:32.400
Really?

54:32.400 --> 54:34.680
God, you're so fucking proud of that.

54:34.680 --> 54:37.080
The way you say it so fast and good.

54:37.120 --> 54:42.000
I don't do it because I have like emotional like that block, which is in trauma, but you think

54:42.000 --> 54:43.400
it's cool too.

54:43.400 --> 54:47.600
I also have hyper cholesterol, I mean, so I have like arterial block, let's do the next.

54:47.600 --> 54:49.600
You should probably eat breakfast, then.

54:49.600 --> 54:54.200
If I have high cholesterol, I'm trying to not.

54:54.200 --> 54:55.200
I'm trying to not.

54:55.200 --> 55:01.200
I'm trying to not make a backup plan for a backup plan.

55:01.200 --> 55:07.040
No, I fucking go with the flow, baby, but maybe like first, no.

55:07.040 --> 55:08.040
Okay.

55:08.040 --> 55:09.040
No, no.

55:09.040 --> 55:10.360
I'm a big purple circle for that.

55:10.360 --> 55:11.360
The biggest one?

55:11.360 --> 55:12.360
Yeah, disagree.

55:12.360 --> 55:14.960
You usually stay calm even under a lot of pressure.

55:14.960 --> 55:15.960
Yeah.

55:15.960 --> 55:17.960
I would agree too because this has been a pressure.

55:17.960 --> 55:20.320
It hasn't been hot in here.

55:20.320 --> 55:22.920
We're kind of a pressure cooker of a podcast.

55:22.920 --> 55:23.920
Yeah.

55:23.920 --> 55:26.160
I'll do a similar medium green circle.

55:26.160 --> 55:27.160
Okay.

55:27.160 --> 55:28.960
It's good and hot in here.

55:28.960 --> 55:29.960
So take a.

55:29.960 --> 55:30.960
Yeah.

55:33.960 --> 55:36.960
Yeah, or the next question.

55:36.960 --> 55:40.160
At social events, you rarely introduce yourself to new people, and you mostly talk to the

55:40.160 --> 55:41.160
ones you already know.

55:41.160 --> 55:42.160
No, disagree.

55:42.160 --> 55:43.160
Middle.

55:43.160 --> 55:44.400
I mean, I talk to people I know, but middle disagree.

55:44.400 --> 55:46.640
I'm a pretty firm agreeer on that.

55:46.640 --> 55:47.640
I don't know.

55:47.640 --> 55:48.640
That was 10%.

55:48.640 --> 55:51.160
There's 10 pages.

55:51.160 --> 55:54.000
Let's not fucking finish this because we, it's 52 minutes.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Okay.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
What do you just think you are?

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
You NFP?

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
That sucks.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
That sucks.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
I'm gonna dig a dig at mile.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.440
You only went through one of these, but you end up being close.

56:02.440 --> 56:05.880
The digs premise sort of fell by the way side very early.

56:05.920 --> 56:08.760
I think we spent too much time on the potatoes quite frankly.

56:08.760 --> 56:13.920
This show has segments to move things along when there isn't momentum.

56:13.920 --> 56:15.880
This episode is at so much momentum.

56:15.880 --> 56:17.400
I feel like we didn't even need them.

56:17.400 --> 56:20.560
If this had been a wax, we would have gotten a lot out of your axe.

56:20.560 --> 56:21.560
Yeah.

56:21.560 --> 56:23.400
I'm gonna waxing, but I don't know about this.

56:23.400 --> 56:24.400
Yeah.

56:24.400 --> 56:25.400
We got it.

56:25.400 --> 56:27.400
Next time when you come on, we got to do a two-parter because we do have to wrap things up,

56:27.400 --> 56:29.200
and I feel like I could go for another hour.

56:29.200 --> 56:30.200
Yeah.

56:30.200 --> 56:31.200
Which one have things to have cool?

56:31.200 --> 56:33.360
Would you come on again?

56:33.360 --> 56:35.360
Yeah, I would come on again.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.920
But only because I'm like a little worried about you.

56:43.920 --> 56:46.640
That's what Melanie Bracewell said.

56:49.440 --> 56:50.720
No one.

56:50.720 --> 56:53.600
And she thought it was two years ago, she was on this show.

56:53.600 --> 56:59.680
Your recall for the episodes that happened just once with one guest years ago is

56:59.680 --> 57:01.920
honestly alarming and alerting.

57:02.160 --> 57:06.400
I'm scared for the more important things you've forgotten because you have this

57:06.400 --> 57:11.600
recall for these really obscure guests that we've had on this show.

57:11.600 --> 57:13.680
When did Melanie Bracewell say that to you?

57:13.680 --> 57:14.400
29.

57:14.400 --> 57:15.840
May Shakira learn!

57:15.840 --> 57:19.440
When you have an ass for a boss?

57:19.440 --> 57:21.280
Spank it.

57:21.280 --> 57:23.840
I'm gonna have an ass.

57:23.840 --> 57:24.640
I got that.

57:24.640 --> 57:25.520
Okay, I get that.

57:25.520 --> 57:27.680
It's like spank me.

57:28.480 --> 57:29.600
Spank him here.

57:29.600 --> 57:30.480
Wow.

57:30.560 --> 57:31.840
I'm still figuring it out.

57:31.840 --> 57:33.600
Like sometimes, yeah.

57:33.600 --> 57:34.880
You have an ass for a boss.

57:35.680 --> 57:37.120
Spank it.

57:37.120 --> 57:39.840
My disgraced boss was the heckest bagus last week.

57:39.840 --> 57:40.320
Kind of makes sense.

57:40.320 --> 57:41.520
I didn't think you were gonna see that.

57:42.240 --> 57:43.280
Because it came up today.

57:44.320 --> 57:45.680
Like she did.

57:45.680 --> 57:47.920
I tuned in to just be like, well, I wonder what the show's gonna be.

57:47.920 --> 57:49.120
And I was like, oh, that's interesting.

57:49.120 --> 57:50.880
They don't have a TV and all of it.

57:50.880 --> 57:52.720
But there's like a square that looks like a TV.

57:52.720 --> 57:53.520
How's your sex life?

57:57.360 --> 57:58.800
I feel like we never talked about that.

57:58.960 --> 57:59.920
I feel like I could.

57:59.920 --> 58:00.960
He's going back in.

58:02.400 --> 58:03.120
You do you?

58:04.720 --> 58:06.480
Well, myiles, what are you going on?

58:06.480 --> 58:08.080
What do you want to point the people towards?

58:08.080 --> 58:10.800
Um, yeah, if you liked this for some reason,

58:11.520 --> 58:13.440
you can go listen to my podcast, Perfect Person.

58:13.440 --> 58:14.320
Now I'm headgun.

58:14.320 --> 58:14.880
Yeah!

58:16.880 --> 58:17.360
Yeah.

58:17.360 --> 58:18.800
EA Sports.

58:18.800 --> 58:19.600
It's in the game.

58:20.800 --> 58:21.120
Yeah.

58:21.120 --> 58:24.800
We take calls from people like Jeff who are struggling emotionally.

58:24.800 --> 58:27.120
And then we sell the problems.

58:27.600 --> 58:28.720
To make them a perfect person.

58:28.720 --> 58:29.680
To make them a perfect person.

58:29.680 --> 58:31.600
And do you consider yourself a perfect person?

58:31.600 --> 58:35.040
I do because being perfect means never having to say you're sorry.

58:38.640 --> 58:39.600
So you don't cry.

58:39.600 --> 58:40.560
You don't say I'm sorry.

58:41.280 --> 58:43.600
You won't have this really never mind.

58:43.600 --> 58:45.200
Yeah, I won't mind.

58:45.200 --> 58:47.440
Yeah, I won't dive into the gas.

58:48.080 --> 58:50.400
But um, no, I do consider myself perfect.

58:50.400 --> 58:54.800
Um, only because I feel like I'm able to help others.

58:54.880 --> 58:56.320
Yeah, it's my way of cool.

58:56.320 --> 58:59.520
I'm going to your sexual prowess and stuff.

59:00.560 --> 59:01.600
But how is this sex?

59:01.600 --> 59:02.720
He asked about your sex life.

59:02.720 --> 59:03.200
He didn't really.

59:03.200 --> 59:04.160
You're going to dodge the question.

59:04.160 --> 59:07.360
I'm not a perfect person.

59:07.360 --> 59:09.120
Who's that?

59:09.120 --> 59:10.320
Nickelback or some shit?

59:10.320 --> 59:13.680
Um, and the reason is you.

59:14.880 --> 59:15.440
Creed.

59:15.440 --> 59:17.120
The reason is who bestank?

59:17.680 --> 59:18.320
Who bestank?

59:18.320 --> 59:19.520
That's why you break the screen.

59:19.520 --> 59:20.720
Yeah.

59:22.720 --> 59:24.160
Casey's wearing a hoopestank shirt.

59:25.040 --> 59:26.880
Off screen.

59:27.440 --> 59:29.680
Um, anything else social media?

59:29.680 --> 59:32.400
Uh, out of my eyes, bond on the gram.

59:32.400 --> 59:33.120
Patreon.

59:33.120 --> 59:34.160
Patreon.

59:34.160 --> 59:35.680
Yeah, perfect person also has a Patreon.

59:35.680 --> 59:38.240
We have platinum episodes that are just like bonus episode stuff.

59:38.240 --> 59:41.680
And they may have a premium version of the show that's had free and has like bonus

59:41.680 --> 59:42.480
calls and stuff.

59:42.480 --> 59:43.280
So love that.

59:43.280 --> 59:43.920
Hit it up, baby.

59:45.920 --> 59:48.400
Um, are you okay?

59:48.400 --> 59:51.680
No, I literally don't like someone's supposed to end.

59:51.920 --> 59:53.440
I am so anxious right now.

59:53.440 --> 59:58.320
I also feel guilty because my friend Sarah needed me to move a couch in my truck after this.

59:58.320 --> 01:00:01.600
And then she couldn't, it's not really my fault, but she couldn't because of the offer

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.120
person had to push earlier to one.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.480
And I was like, I'm recording.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.480
Yeah.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.960
So I just feel like I wronged a friend.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:07.960
Yeah.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:08.960
I was late to this.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:09.960
Yeah.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:13.360
And ultimately, uh, my weekend doesn't start to online PM tonight.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.400
So that's where I'm at at at Jeffway already on Twitter.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.760
We got to 10,000.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.360
I'm going to be bearing hole.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.800
You guys didn't can't Twitter?

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:21.600
Yeah.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.120
Next Friday, week from today.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.840
So although when this comes out, it'll already be out.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:28.800
I, this, this is why I don't like banking episodes, right?

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.600
Yeah, I don't know.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.400
You know, yeah.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.800
What do you, what do you, uh, what do you want to plug?

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.440
Watch a perfect person.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.280
I'm going to be on it.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:40.960
I'm going to be honest.

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.880
I haven't asked you if I could be on it.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.680
You can be on it.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:43.840
All right.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.880
I'm going to be on it, guys.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.320
I'm going to be on it, maybe.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.600
You can, you run the network.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.000
Yeah.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I'm on it.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.960
Marica and the reason is you.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.120
Listen to who bestank.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:00:59.920
There's no way.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.760
Watch the end of Hot Rod.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:09.440
Where Rod wakes up and just says who bestank for some reason.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.600
And follow me on Twitter and Instagram and

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.840
the Letterboxed at Marie K-Lon.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.480
Are you, what are you seeing today?

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:20.800
Sorry.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:28.720
The band she's of inertia, whatever that word is, the new one.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.840
Extend a movie.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.640
Cutting you off.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.320
I don't really know what that movie is.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:32.880
Yeah.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.680
Well, I'm curious.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.120
Well, I was going to say shout out to Marie

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.680
because Letterbox, because I'm, I'm a follower and it's really a good,

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:38.720
good cinema.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.000
Miles, thank you.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.360
You had critiques.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.720
Are you going to see Black Adam?

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.120
I was going to, but now I just kind of don't care enough

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.080
because it's so seemingly so bad.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:53.760
I'm worried about the way he's pouring his heart to the film.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.120
Oh, he just can't quite encourage people to see it fast enough.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:57.520
Yeah.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.160
Do you think you're going to be able to screw that scene?

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.800
With just a Marvel movie because he's given up entirely.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.200
I don't know.

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:03.920
It's hard to say.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:04.080
Yeah.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.880
He's really, you really, really wants this to be his thing.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:07.920
I don't think so though.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.240
Yeah.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.920
I don't think it's just a feel because I've never heard of Black Adam before.

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.120
Never signed on.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.560
And that, he was already starting in a position of weakness with that.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.480
But he's been doing his best to sort of push this boulder up a hill.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.400
It's a Cicifissian task.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.000
It seems to market this movie.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:24.240
For sure.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.800
And if the rotten tomato score is there, it's annoying that it just gets boiled down

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.840
to that like the noise of new cars.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.480
It's going to be a mirror watching the DC universe.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.840
But it's just information and news about Washington, DC.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:46.080
That's nothing to do with political cartoons.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.520
Yeah, you've never seen before.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:51.520
Well, this one's interesting, but I just don't know what the gilded age was.

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:52.800
Can we see it on the screen?

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:56.640
Or it's kind of two right-of-center to show.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.120
This one's a far side.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.120
This one's a far side.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:11.440
Um, on your casey, plugs, pit wall, uh, yeah, listen to the pit wall.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.800
An apple on podcast.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:13.520
I'm on it.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.160
Japs on it.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.040
Marie Kazanit.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.400
On you as weirdly, not on him.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.520
On you watch that one.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:18.960
Of course I do.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.520
She does not.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:19.920
She does.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.120
She does.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.320
I watched one season.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.120
I don't know, I believe.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.320
One's, oh, yeah.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.440
She doesn't watch the races.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.600
Which, uh, we exclusively talk about it.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.920
But I, I think I could chime in and tell you guys, every time,

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.680
every time the Ferrari boys are on their cue.

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:34.800
And that, I think is the comment.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.040
Okay.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:35.840
That is the comment.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.040
We could get on you on the show.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:37.360
Yeah.

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:39.040
That is a key at the week segment, right?

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:39.840
Yeah.

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:40.080
Yeah.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:40.560
Yeah.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.720
That's kind of, I'll just come in for just that segment, Emily.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.160
Coming for a holiday that we can then leave.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:44.320
Yeah.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.040
By the way, we mostly record on Sunday nights and Monday nights.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.680
There's going to be, well, I guess we've been doing Mondays.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:50.320
Monday afternoon.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:53.360
And don't say we, because you skipped last week.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.160
Yeah.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.840
If you remember to watch,

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.680
I, you're on it.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:58.480
Yeah, that's true.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.560
You're not part of that thing.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.760
Don't insert yourself.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.520
You're not a wee.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.680
You're barely a me.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.440
Everyone's laughing at you.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.280
Take that feeling and go into the weekend with it.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:17.920
Oh.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.000
It's just simply a 9 p.m.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.560
Why is your weekend started at 9 p.m.?

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.160
I have a Patreon Zarty.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:29.680
What is that?

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.920
Zarty, I have a lot of money.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.680
It's a zoo party.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.760
We hang out with the party.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.920
People who pay the highest tier, we get to,

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.360
it's kind of just going to grow.

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:41.200
So people have made their session.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:41.520
Yeah.

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:42.240
We gotta go.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:42.720
Yeah.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:45.760
I would like to say that I got a little bracelet that says,

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:49.200
why is, to remind myself to be wise.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.560
Are you walking out?

01:04:54.560 --> 01:05:12.960
That was a hit-dum original.

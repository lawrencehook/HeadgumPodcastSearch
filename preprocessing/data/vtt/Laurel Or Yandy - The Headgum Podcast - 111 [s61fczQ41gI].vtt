00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Wednesday.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
July 13th.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
I don't know if we've ever recorded on a Wednesday, Casey.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
No, I've never done this on Wednesday, no.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Casey, down to you on the podcast officially,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
not just behind Mike, people can see your beautiful mug

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
and my God, the wood panel behind you.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
I brought it up off air, but I just saw it again

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
basically for what felt like the first time.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Choice charming vintage details in an apartment, no less.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
It's only one wall.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
Every other wall is, you know, standard, white rental apartment walls,

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
but, you know, how can you beat this?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
It's like you're in one wall.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
It looks like you're in big bear.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
It looks like you're in Lake Arrowhead.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
That's the vibe I'm going for on Zoom specifically.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
He's shooting Glendale for Tahoe.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
That's good.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Let's talk about your back.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
You message us on Slack saying that the pain that your back was whack.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Yeah.

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
Yeah, I'm currently bedridden in a way that's,

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
in a way that's like, I'm still in pain,

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
but maybe this is like the least painful.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
I don't know what happened.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
I think I yesterday,

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
yesterday was like relatively fine.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Was dealing with some pain woke up this morning.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Got out of bed and then immediately mind.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Right.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Come across your head.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
My legs started cramping.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Like, just everything on one side of my body hurt.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
And I had to go to physical therapy.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
And the only position that was not painful for me for some reason was

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
if I stood on my good leg and I bent over

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
so that my other leg was in the air.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
So I was like a T.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
That was the only position that didn't hurt.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
So I was like biking to physical therapy.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
And then like any time.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Why did you just cancel it?

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Because I was like, maybe he can help me.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
It's like, but I couldn't sit.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
So I was like biking and then like every block would have to like mimic that position

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
on my bike and like lean on my ankle.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Oh my God.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I finally got there.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
We couldn't figure out any other position that was comfortable for me.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
And then like finally after he like,

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
like we tried cupping and like all kinds of stuff.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
I was like laying down relatively not in pain.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
So I just laid there for 30 minutes with heat back.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
So I got up.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
And then I was okay.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I was like, I was able to walk.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
But I was so scared that if I stopped walking,

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
it would hurt again that I just kept walking.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
So I walked truly half the way I walked so far.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
And then I was like maybe I'll try biking.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
And I biked a little bit.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
It was fine.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
And then I got like three blocks or more.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
But I was like, I got a walk again.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
And then walking hurt.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
And then that position that was good.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Also hurt.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh, it betrayed you.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah, absolutely betrayed me.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
So I got home was like relatively fine.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
And now it's kind of like if I move a certain way,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
I might spasm.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
But for right now, I'm okay.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
I got my doctor on the phone.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
I want to know about the spasm.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Is that if that's like being seized with pain,

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
where you can't really move,

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
because you're afraid to move it'll hurt more.

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
That it's like every muscle from my lower back to my knee is cramped.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
That's what that's the pain that I'm experiencing.

04:21.000 --> 04:29.000
And then my foot is has felt asleep for three hours.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Part of the day.

04:32.000 --> 04:40.000
Because I was walking my leg did feel on fire.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
It was hot out.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
I got my doctor on the phone.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Finally after like frantically calling being like,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm in so much pain.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Can I just talk to her on the phone?

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
And now I have a lot of medication to take.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
How am I going to fly to LA next week?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Is anybody's guess?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Will I be there?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Who can say?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Will I leave my bed tomorrow?

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
That was like the button says to be continued.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I thought there was a different sound, but I was like,

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Oh, what if this is the promise of more?

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
Anyway, yeah, that's why I'm blurred background.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
I follow questions based around.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Treatment methods.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Have you taken to the baths?

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Have you soaked?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
I have not soaked.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
But that also reminds me that I saw a TikTok

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
that was like the bath house and Williamsburg

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
is the worst place I've ever been.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Maybe think of you and Micah?

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
It's one of our favorite places.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
We are probably the guys that make it bad.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
It's like the equivalent of going to the lion's seat.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
No, it's like the YMCA except if we're a club.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
It's like it's kind of like the W hotel,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
but all baths.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Yeah.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
I think it's great.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I think you should go baths though.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Okay.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I think when you're feeling like you can walk or ride,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
let me know and I'll take you to the bath house.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Because we've got the cold plunge.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
We've got the hot tub.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
We have the neutral pool.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
We have the sauna.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Excuse me.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
What's so funny, Jeff?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
The neutral pool.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
What is that?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
That's the cup of water.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
It's a tepid bath.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
For when you've had too much heat,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
but you don't want to get in the cold,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
because you paid $200 to be there.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Right for the day.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
That's day you.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
For the day.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Okay.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
So yeah.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
They have the sauna.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
They also have the tropical sauna.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
I'm still talking.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
And they have to make such a tropical.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
There's a little bit of steam in that sauna.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
A little bit of pineapple.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
I love steam.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
The steam room is all steam.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
And the sauna's all dry heat.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
The sauna's the dry heat.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
But now the tropical sauna.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
That's a little bit of a moist heat.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Then the steam room is a steamy heat.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
The steam room.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
You try to cut me off.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Yeah.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
The steam ahead.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
The hot marble stones.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
The hot marble stones.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
The hot marble stones.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
That is going to say.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Now the way that's what like Tobin Yaki is grilled on.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
You're talking about like a Japanese barbecue house.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Or more marble stones, I should say.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
But it's hard to say warm marble.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
And what's hard to say?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
And what's hard to say?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
What's hard to say?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
What's hard to say?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Have you ever been to a salt room?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
No.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I've never heard of a salt.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
It's like a room mate.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
I want to say made out of like covered in pink Himalayan salt.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
And I think it's like heated and it's supposed to be like pretty healing.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
I've been to one of those.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
But it was a store in Santa Barbara.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
So it was like a salt room.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
But everything was per sale.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
And you could just kind of buy the rocks.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
But I really think you should take to the baths.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
I think that would.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
You'd like to assault my room.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Okay.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
It's blurry.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Yeah.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
How's that one?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
I want to.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
1100 a month or whatever you're paying.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
I'm not paying that.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
It's really small and messy.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
So that's my display.

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
But you can kind of see my shelf of binders that full of wood.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
They hold a bunch of play bells.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
Oh my god.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
I'm really sorry to say what I'm about to say.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
I feel like the back is a sunk cost.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
And you can afford to still go out tonight and get your back thrown out.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
You know what I mean?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
So my back is my back.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
No.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
Well, I want to I want to break it down a little bit because you're saying.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
My back is bad.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Arguably my back is thrown out currently.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
But you're saying that I can still.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
Leave my house and get it thrown out more or that getting it thrown out again is.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Would be the same as now.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
The back's already bad.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
So you can go find like a honey.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
You could go find like a lover.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
You know what make it worse.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Yeah.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
As long as I can't really do a lot in your team position.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
And limping in my foot's asleep.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Right.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
But you also have the an excuse to not be a generous lover in terms of pain.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And so like you don't have to be good in bed.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
You can just be in bed with a backpack.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Or I can be in bed.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
I can I can be in bed with a backpack without doing anything.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Because that's how I'm currently.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Legs.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Spread into a tea.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
As if you're doing a taste.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
I think they'll love these ideas.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Jake, are you in chronic pain still?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Thank you for bringing it up.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
I love to talk about pain.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I love to talk about other people's pain.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
But more than that I love to talk about my pain.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
So let's get into it.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Yeah.

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
I recently developed something that I believe is called decar veins.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
So right.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
Is that a self diagnosis?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
It's a self diagnosis.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
But my dad helped me with it because he had it also.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
And there's apparently just like a really simple test you can do.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
So like, I have just joint pain right here in my wrist.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
It's very acute.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
And everything feels fine.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
I can do pushups.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I can like lift weights.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
I'm not really like in pain.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
But when I do this motion, like almost like shaking a hand.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
It's severe pain all along the side of the wrist.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
And apparently the way you test for it is you like cross your thumb over.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
You do this and you just turn.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
You might feel a tiny little pinch.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
You feel like tiny little pinch?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Yeah.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Yeah.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
For me, that is excruciating pain.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
So.

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
And it's really weird because like I can basically avoid doing that emotion all the time.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
Except for like a few little things that you just like do all the sudden where you like,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
you know, you don't really do anything.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Yeah.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I've been on vacation for two and a half weeks.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
I didn't wash any dishes.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
And then we got home.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
And I picked up like a dish in the sink to wash it.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
And it was just like shooting pain time.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
I am tired.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I was like, Julian, I can't help.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
With the dishes.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
That's what I'm saying.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
Use your chronic pain to get out of others ways.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
That's right.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
That's right.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Casey, um, pain.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
My pain.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
Uh, I wasn't a lot of pain up until recently.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I broke my hip skateboard.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
And that was using a cane for a while.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
All the front side nose grind goofy footage.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
All the bobbah.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Uh, spring light.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
I was sliding.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Chop, shove it.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Yeah.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Back to tray flip.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
Back to his hip being broken at seeters.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Yeah.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Yeah.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Kick flip.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
That's exactly what happened.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
No kick flip.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
I can do all that.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
But the kick flip.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
But yeah.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
I was walking around.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I was walking around on a broken hip.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Yeah.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
I know where that was broken.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Mm.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Then I went to the doctor's like, I fell skateboarding.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I think it's a real bad bruise.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
And then he took an x-ray.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I was like, this is a broken hip.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Yeah.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
You need to stop walking immediately.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
And then he took a long way.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
That you don't skateboard.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
And you're at this fine.

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
I really needed that doctor's note saying that I broke it skateboarding.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Yeah.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
He helped out.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
So no, but it was.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Yeah.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Yeah.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
And I still, I walk weird now.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
I got like a little bit of a swing in my hip.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
I stuck in your step.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
You're just a happy guy.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Yeah.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Yeah.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
I hit the swing.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
I hit it than feather.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Left and right.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Mm-hmm.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Yeah.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
And now I think I look way cooler.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
And when you want to ask, why do you walk like that?

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Let's say I broke my hip skateboarding.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Pretty cool.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Yeah.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Yeah.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
When you were using the cane, did you ever kind of like,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
lifted above your head?

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Um,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
I would point with to stuff with it a lot.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Okay.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
So you were raising kids.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Yeah.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
There we go.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Yes.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Something.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Um,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
And you painted.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
No prize.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Yeah.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Just dry eyes.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
As aesthetically red.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Slash, unpleasing to vine eyes.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Mine have been drier than.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Let's say Baker's field thighs.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
In that when you're chafed in the central valley of California,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
that's as dry as it gets.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
And that.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Yeah.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Your twice is nice.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Uh, they are getting better though.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Lace, it helps a lot.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Shout out to Dr. Arthur Benjamin.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
That's a basic name.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
You know, what will be able to find that doctor?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
He.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
What he lacks in like a creative name.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
He makes up for in giving me Xanx about 30 minutes to late.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
So that I'm fully awake for the surgery.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
They did that for me, too.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
They're like here.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Here you go.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Here's his annex.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
So you can relax before the eye surgery.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
And now come into this room.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Like, well, this isn't going to hit.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Yeah.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Tell my wife is picking me up.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
And now.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
My friend AJ picked me up after the surgery.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
No, is it?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Well, you guys.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Marie can check now, AJ.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
Uh, and it hit as I was getting home, basically, on the way home.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
And I just kept like swaying back and forth and being like, I don't like this drug man.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Uh, I.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
I think it's solid.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
It felt like the world was ending to me.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
It felt like I was dying.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I wonder if it was annex.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
That seems like that.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
It's not.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
I was.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
I was supposed to feel on it at all.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
They did say that we ran out of Xanx,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
but we can get you some in the next 15 minutes.

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
And so it was probably cut with fentanyl.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
And you're recommending this doctor.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
They just, yeah, they bought it out the street.

15:48.000 --> 15:59.000
Uh, anyway, I'd be curious if we didn't get to, um, our.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Bond of the week.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
Uh, this week, my bond of the week is mortgage backed securities.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Same.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
One of the most interesting types of bonds.

16:12.000 --> 16:22.000
Um, I'll have a dry MBS monthly payments, not semi annual coupons.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
I'm surprised they haven't chosen a new bond at this point.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Just so this segment can end.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Mm-hmm.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
What are they waiting for?

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
They have to, they simply have to announce it, right?

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Yeah.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
They said it's going to be well.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Reese, yeah.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I was like a recent thing.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
But they said they're, it's going to reimagine the franchise.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
So.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Great.

16:49.000 --> 16:55.000
My bond of the week is Fernando Alonso.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Oh, nice.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
How come the finger wagots inota?

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
She can.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Yeah.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Yeah.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Definitely that one.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Uh, no, I think he, I think he just fucked some shit up.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Good.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Probably going to sneak in around.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
I'd actually pitch Alonso for the villain.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Yeah.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Because they are usually a little more brooding and have a different accent.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
They're always too Russell.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Yeah.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
George Russell would be bond because the kings have been.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Yeah.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Yeah.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
I see.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
I see.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
George Russell as a villain.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
I agree.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Yeah.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Yeah.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
I see him as a, I see him as a formula one villain.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
I, but I think as, I do see him as bond.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
He's classically British.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
He went to the rescue for zoo.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I mean, what?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Did you not?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Jeff?

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
I thought he was in a formula one chat with us and never respond to anything.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
So he said, it's, I've missed the last like three or four races because I just haven't

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
been able to wake up for them or have been traveling.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
So I just feel like I'm, I miss him.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
I would miss him too if I were a McLaren fan.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
By the way, I was on my honeymoon.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
I watched both of this.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Yeah.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
He really did.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Your honeymoon.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
It was responsive.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
He sent us photos of Ferrari merch.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
He didn't have to do that.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Here's my fan.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
There was so much for our family.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
I might admit that it was a feat in that you guys were correct.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
I hate rooting for McLaren.

18:19.000 --> 18:28.000
Dangal record is bad at driving and he's about to switch to TV anyways.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
You have to pick a new team.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Ferrari.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
All right.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Welcome.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
I like.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I always liked Ferrari, but it wasn't my team.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Yeah.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Right.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Houses.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Yeah.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Houses.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Me too.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Yeah.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
Casey is recently gotten into Formula One after we told him about drive to survive.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Yeah.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Casey.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
What's your team?

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
Oh, man.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
I think I really like horse.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
They're the most fun.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
I like the middle of the grid.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
That's where the action is.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Yeah.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
I'm over taking.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Yeah.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Sure.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Yeah.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I think car is going through a turn.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
That's where you learn who can drive and who can survive.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
But I guess at the front.

19:17.000 --> 19:23.000
At the front of the grid, I like I like Ferrari.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I can't move for red bull.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
Something about the red bull vibe or organization.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
It's from the top.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
It's I think it's Christian Horner.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
He's such a little dickling.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
He'd be a bomb owner man.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
The perfect bomb villain.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Yeah.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
He would be a good bomb villain.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Yeah.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
He's very hitable.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Guys, our next partner has a product.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
I use literally every day.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
All right.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I'm talking about electric greens.

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
I started taking out electric greens because I have poor sleep habits and hygiene.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Honestly, I don't eat enough vegetables.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
So I thought I could knock two birds with one stone.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
And I absolutely did with athletic greens.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
So what is this stuff?

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
Well, with one delicious scoop of athletic greens, you're absorbing 75 high quality vitamins,

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
minerals, whole foods or superfoods, probiotics, and adaptogens to help start your day right.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
The special blend of ingredients supports your gut health, your nervous system, your immune system,

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
your energy recovery, focus and aging, all the things.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
I take it in the morning.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
I have a glass of water, my athletic greens, and then a coffee.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Boom.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
I'm off to the races.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
And it just gives me the energy I need to start the day.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
It's lifestyle friendly.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Whether you eat keto, paleo, vegan, dairy-free, or gluten-free.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
And it contains less than one gram of sugar, known GMOs,

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
no nasty chemicals or artificial anything while still tasting good.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
It supports better sleep quality and recovery, mental clarity and alertness,

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
and it's the one thing with the best things.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
Athletic greens use the best of the best products based on the latest science,

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
with constant product iterations, and third-party testing.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
And it costs you less than $3 a day, and you're investing in your health,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
and it's cheaper than cold brew.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
It's cheaper also than getting all the different supplements yourself.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
I used to take a bunch of vitamins and pills, and now I just take athletic greens,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
and I get everything I need.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
You're investing in basically an all-in-one nutritional insurance.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
So right now, it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system,

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
with convenient daily nutrition, especially heading into cold and flu season.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
It's just one scoop in a cup of water every day.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
That's it.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
No need for a million different pills and supplements, and to make it easy,

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
athletic greens is going to give you a free one-year supply of immune-supporting vitamin D

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
and five free travel packs with your first purchase.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
I've been taking it on the road.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
I've been traveling a lot.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Take it by Athletic Green.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
All you have to do is visit AthleticGreens.com slash what's that?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Again, that's AthleticGreens.com slash what's that?

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
To take ownership over your health, and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Thanks AthleticGreens.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
Okay, we have to move on to talk about some news of the day.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
What is this episode?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
I have secrets.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I wanted to let him breathe.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
Yeah, so we're doing pain to bond to the week to news of the day.

22:00.000 --> 22:09.000
Headline Reads, M&M's daughter, Haley Mathers, may be starting a clothing and beauty line.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
Mathers not Mathers, first of all.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
What?

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
What is your publication?

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
What publication is this from?

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
That is going to be, I believe, from the Guardian.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
No, it's from Page Six.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
And she may have run out of things to report on.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
She may be starting a clothing line, but she also may not be.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
As first reported by the sun, not the news.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Don't get angry at us.

22:44.000 --> 22:55.000
Haley has filed a trademark application to sell clothing and non-medicated skincare preparations in conjunction with her new entertainment brand Haley Jade LLC.

22:55.000 --> 23:03.000
I, frankly, would like to see a crossover between the beauty line and this entertainment branch.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
Like, what if there is a euphoria under eye cream?

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
I can't believe he stopped an interesting conversation for those.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
So I think that we are all interested in.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
It's formula one.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Yeah, I love it.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
I feel like we have to contain formula one to five minutes per episode because people do complain.

23:24.000 --> 23:30.000
The people who don't complain because we're not talking about Haley matters.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
I know nothing about Haley matters, I.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
People want me and Jake to start a formula one podcast.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
I want to be a part of it.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
Sean actually Danny Rick might be a part of it too.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
If he's not driving next year.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
Yeah, I mean he lives in LA in the off season in Beverly Hills.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Actually, I have the address.

23:52.000 --> 24:01.000
Sean Mendez needed to slow down amid tours as source being in the public eye has put pressure on him.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Listen, I get that.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
Yeah, I can actually speak to this.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
How so?

24:07.000 --> 24:20.000
Because, you know, he went through a pretty public break up with Camila Cabello and a lot of people online bullied him for being in that relationship to begin with.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
So I feel like, you know, slowing down would be good for him.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
For sure.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
I think he's got a great voice.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
I like the way he sings and sounds when he does it.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Yeah.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
That's all.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I don't really care about the whole thing.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
He sings any sounds.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
You're Columbia Records A&R.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
I wanted to be happy.

24:41.000 --> 24:48.000
Okay, let's start with the music before you see if the artist himself will be happy if we sign him.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
Evidently, that's actually important because now he's going to cancel fucking shows, right?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
That's money out of their pocket.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
You need to have the artist because that's how you get paid.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
All right.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
That's stranger things.

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
Demagorgan fight looks pretty different without CGI.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Is this news?

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Is this a news item?

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
This is that's from you.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
You're just just like a thought you had.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
You're you're reading clickbait and we can't see the image.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
So it's extra not interested in the project.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
Suggest taking heartache days.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Should we?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah, sure.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Well, you have houses.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
That's the same as mental health day, right?

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Yeah.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
It's just calling it something different.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
Well, yeah, but this was in like 2009.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
Wait, is this news of the day from 2009?

25:40.000 --> 25:50.000
Yeah.

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
Jordan Peterson's daughter proves his popularity and his laughter, his suspension.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Jordan, by the way, now we're not even talking about anything.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
You're saying the headlines at us until we barely understand them.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
And as soon as we do, you're on to the next one.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
I don't know who Jordan Peterson is.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
He's like an alt-right guy who got kicked off.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
Twitter or something.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Fine.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Let's talk more about Formula One.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
What's the next race?

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
And this will be my first Grand Prix as a Ferrari.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
To Focie.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
To Focie.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Yeah.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
There you go.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Next race is France.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Yeah.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Yeah.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
I am going to the Formula E Grand Prix this weekend.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
If I can.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
With the bad back.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Yeah.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Listen.

26:38.000 --> 26:45.000
I got to see Antonio Javanese be bad at racing for me.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I didn't know he moved over there.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
He did.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
And he's not great.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
But I went last year.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
No, it was really.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
It was fun.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
So excited to go now that it's like an actual event.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Last year was like a scrap together.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Last minute.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Like, please come.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
We need people and see this thing.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Yeah.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Um.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
We do have to move on.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Fine.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Yeah.

27:10.000 --> 27:25.000
Welcome to Laurel or Yandee.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
We had to move on.

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
We simply have to get to Laurel or Yandee.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Do you guys know Yandee?

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
No.

27:35.000 --> 27:42.000
It's this like affordable lingerie store online.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Cool.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
So I'm going to play some sounds.

27:45.000 --> 27:52.000
And you're going to tell me if you hear Laurel or an item from Yandee.com.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Ready?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Hmm.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Yeah.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Gary.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
I heard Laurel.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
I heard Laurel.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Yeah.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
I also heard Laurel.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Okay.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Interesting.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
I wasn't paying attention to the rules.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
I kind of forgot.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
It's not a game.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
It's just like a experiment of like, what do we hear?

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Uh, here we go.

28:13.000 --> 28:19.000
Daddy's little disaster costume.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Daddy's little disaster costume.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
What do you gonna ask?

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Yeah.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
That was an item from Yandee.com.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I heard Laurel.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Hmm.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
You might be in the minority there.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Okay.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Now I understand the game.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
All right.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Here we go.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Gary.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I heard Laurel at time.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
I heard Laurel.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
I heard Laurel.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Item from Yandee.com.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Yeah.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
I heard Crushless Camusole.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
I bet the diesel laurels.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Roger this.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Camusole.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Is that what you said?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Obviously it's crotchless.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Right.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
It's a top.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Oh, crotchless top.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
How do you like a t-shirt where you could see your whole fucking

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
neck.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
I'm fucking sorry.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
All right.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Here we go.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
I cared you, Natba at his talking.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
I think that was...

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
I think you didn't.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
I think you didn't.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Laurel.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
I think you didn't.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
I think you didn't.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Laurel.

29:47.000 --> 29:57.000
I think I heard I kid you net body stocking.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Casey, what did you hear?

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I got it.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
I heard Laurel.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
I also heard Laurel.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Sweet whisper,

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
a crotchless bodysuit.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
That was a lot of sense.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Okay.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
I heard crotchless bodysuit.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
I heard just laid whisper, crotchless bodysuit.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
Oh, yeah, sweet whisper is what I heard.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Okay.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Wait, let me listen to it again.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
Sweet whisper, crotchless bodysuit.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Yeah, sweet whisper.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
That time I heard Laurel.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Yeah, if you'd like every other time,

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
whichever one you listen for is what you hear.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Yeah.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
That was listening for you.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Yeah.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
And then I heard it.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Yeah.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
That one Laurel.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
That was the Laurel.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
That was Laurel.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Jeez, please.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Pete's the pasties.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
I don't think that was Laurel or an item from Yandy.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
I think that I think Jeff made that one up.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
I think it was your caveat right there.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
That's a pasties.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Geez, please.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Pete's the pasties.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
So they're like little pepperoni's on your nipples.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Yeah.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
But I heard Laurel.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Dude, it's pepperoni.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Dude, it's not pizza pasties.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Yeah, it's pepperoni.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
That'd be a full pizza.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
That's it.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
We have to move on.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
We have to move on.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
All right.

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
I really don't want to do this one.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
But I needed to come up with another segment.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
And I thought that this would be fun for people to watch me sweat.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
I've been playing online chess recently.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
And I thought that I could play against one of you.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
You guys can elect who's going to play.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
I will send you a chest dot com link.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
And let me look at what I wrote down.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
For every pawn you capture,

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
I will text somebody that I hooked up with that I'm on good terms with.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
For every rook night bishop,

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
I will text someone that I dated that I'm on good terms with.

32:11.000 --> 32:17.000
If you take my queen, I will text someone that I dated that I haven't spoken to in seven years.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
And if you take my king,

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
I will text my longest term x that does not like me at all.

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
This is called chest for chest for texting your x.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
That's interesting.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Yeah.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
You guys know I got stunned by a jellyfish when I was on vacation?

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
No.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
That's horrible.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Yeah.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
How bad was that?

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
It was scary.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
It hurt a lot and it was very scary.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
It was.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
It was a little um.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Yeah.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
It was a it was a shock.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
It was a surprise.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Have you ever been stunned by one before?

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I had but not like that.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
I've been stunned where I like got out of the water.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
And I like felt like something was staying.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I was like, oh, I must have swam through a jellyfish.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
This was like.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
I was swimming and I heard the.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
And it was just like intense pain.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
And then I like spun around.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
I screamed to Jill that there was a jellyfish.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
I swam for sure.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
It was.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
It was shameful.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
All right.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
We got the game is up.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Who is.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I'm first lack.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Casey's white.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Okay.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
I'm going first.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Yeah.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
So Jeff's name on the chest board is Gus Brandham.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
And Casey's is Theodore Fernando.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Yeah.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Beautiful.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
Okay.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
Okay.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Casey's opening move.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Pond to see four.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Jeff's.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Pond to E5.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
This is really bad.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
Who here comes the horsey.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Excuse me.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Slow down.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
There's Jeff's.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
This.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
I believe to be for.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Jeff.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
I would not have done that.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
That is.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
You've never played chess.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Casey, I believe that's check.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
There's no way.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
No.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Yeah.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
No.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
It's not check at all.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Very nice.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Here comes the horsey.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Hey.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Jeff.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
The night is out to F6.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Woo.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
Oh.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Casey counters with a pawn.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
Horsey moves again on Jeff's board E4.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Very good.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Pond to go.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
It's gone.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
What of Casey's was captured?

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
But no one needs to be tested.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Gotcha.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Jesus Christ.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Jesus Christ.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
I don't want to talk to any of them.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
Oh, Jeff retreats on the night back to F6.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
That is a coward's move.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
You are frightened.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
You are shook.

35:01.000 --> 35:07.000
Casey, it's time to mount the attack.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Very nice.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
Pond for Rade 3.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Now let's see if Jeff falls for the trap.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
I don't think he's dumb enough to fall for the trap that Casey has laid out.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
But let's see what his move is.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Well, don't tell him about the trap.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Yes.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Excuse me.

35:23.000 --> 35:29.000
We'll see what Jeff decides to make of the board.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
And he's falling for the trap.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
Jeff, don't know what's happening.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
This is truly only for the video watchers.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
I can't talk and do this because I don't.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
This is awful.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
He didn't.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
You're scared.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Yeah.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
He didn't fall in the trap.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
But he's trying to set a trap for me.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
No.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
You guys have no idea what you're saying.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
Nice move, Casey.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Thank you.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
Knight to C6.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
I'm running out of time.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Oh, yeah.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
This game is going to end in a minute.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
No.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
I don't think so.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
I think you guys only have three minutes total.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
I thought that was perturne.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
That's perturne.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Okay.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
It's a dangerous game.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Just can sometimes last for hours.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Yeah.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
What if this turns into a real stalemate?

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
I would love that.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
The stakes are so high.

36:33.000 --> 36:40.000
Usually like sacrificing a pawn is good.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
All right.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
The first pawn is down pawn.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
This isn't bad actually.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
This is texting somebody.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
I've hooked up with that.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
I'm on good terms with.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
That's interesting.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Right.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Somebody who's a close friend actually.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
What should I say?

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Okay.

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
So let's pretend we'll text them something like it's almost like you're texting a doctor

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
about the location of a rash.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Okay.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
So you say no.

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
Just above the thigh.

37:13.000 --> 37:18.000
But on the outside.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
Raised redness.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
But the itching has stopped.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Perfect.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Yeah.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Thank you.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Great.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Nice.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
All right.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Does it say delivered?

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Did you get that?

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Good.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Good.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Good.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Good.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
We're already at minute 40.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
There's no way.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
This is going to work.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
You have 20.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Two seconds left.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
What?

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
I did those.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
My turn.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
That was the trap.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Wow.

37:58.000 --> 38:09.000
And Jeff moves the pawn to H5.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Fuck.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Another.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
You can't.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
It's a captured.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
All right.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
That's you have to text an X.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Right.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
I have to.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Okay.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
Person first person just responded saying what are you all right.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
So I guess I respond.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
And I just seated my time.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
Get over.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
I guess let's just continue with this conversation then.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
We only have like three minutes anyways.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
What do you want me to respond?

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Casey.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
I think it's thing.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
You feel sorry that was for.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
Gosh.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Random.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
Well, yeah.

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
It was the idea that you were texting a doctor.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
And it's.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Yeah.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
That's it up.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
I say continue to.

39:01.000 --> 39:06.000
Engage as if you were still talking to the doctor.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
Okay.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
So she said what are you all right?

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
That's what she said.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Yes.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
What are you all right?

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Yeah.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
You say yes.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
The itching has gone down.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
But I feel like the redness is getting a little bit deep.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
But the redness is getting more of a crimson.

39:22.000 --> 39:29.000
Something like that.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
Yes.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
The itching has gone down.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
But the redness is becoming more crimson.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Wait.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Can I can I add it slightly?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
I already said.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
Okay.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
What would it tell me what the other would have been?

39:41.000 --> 39:51.000
Just going to suggest saying that it's starting to spread lower like a crimson river.

39:51.000 --> 39:56.000
Should I like that's happening in real time.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Yeah.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
I said shit.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
It's spreading downwards in a crimson river of boils.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
You escalated too fast.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
Yeah.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
The boils are going to give it away.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Now.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Yeah.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Okay.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
I thought.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
You have this whole thing up I guess.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Yeah.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Well, now you have to text.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
Now you have to text the X because the case he did also before this game was over.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Yeah.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Yeah.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
I think capture that visual.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
But it's an extra still on good terms.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Good terms with which I have to.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Great.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
I'm going to one or two.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Two.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Two.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Two.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Okay.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
What do I say?

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
We're on good terms, right?

40:37.000 --> 40:49.000
You're not on good terms.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
You're not on good terms.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I don't know.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
No.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Two.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Not with that text also.

40:55.000 --> 41:01.000
Well, can I do anything else?

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Sure.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
Yeah.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
I'm not going to make you do it.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.200
No, I'll do something equally bad. I just can't do that

41:09.560 --> 41:12.360
What if it could you do we had fun, right?

41:17.200 --> 41:21.240
It's not even going to be good for the show because she's not going to respond fast because she has an Android

41:22.480 --> 41:27.720
Okay fine, what if you just text a picture a picture of your face and say should I cut my hair?

41:27.720 --> 41:29.720
But it's really close and it's just your eye

41:29.720 --> 41:31.720
I

41:32.160 --> 41:34.160
My phone's dead. I have to

41:36.960 --> 41:42.080
You're fucking segment it was your idea to play chess and to text your exes

41:42.080 --> 41:48.000
Text goes you look tough. We captured one pawn and then you're and you texted one person then you're phone died

41:48.200 --> 41:50.200
You wouldn't text

41:50.200 --> 41:55.280
I think I don't think it should be your eye. I think it should just only be your hair like the end of your hair

41:55.280 --> 41:58.960
Yeah, it's good. Just the split in

42:05.440 --> 42:08.080
Oh god, and maybe like hold it up like you're

42:09.680 --> 42:11.680
Hang on

42:11.680 --> 42:14.320
I have to delete. This is so embarrassing

42:16.480 --> 42:18.480
Okay

42:18.480 --> 42:20.480
Oh

42:24.640 --> 42:31.720
Hold that end in the hair a little bit we have to play these other videos. So it looks like you're showing it to camera

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
That's great

42:36.000 --> 42:52.000
All right, okay, now my computer is freezing

42:53.040 --> 42:57.120
Of course you guys talk about formula one or some shit. I got to figure this shit up

42:59.840 --> 43:01.840
Okay, so you playing

43:01.840 --> 43:06.640
Formula the 22 game. I'm playing 2021

43:09.360 --> 43:11.840
Because it was cheaper because 20 and two just came out

43:13.040 --> 43:17.200
And then I just got that the racing wheel with yeah, I saw that

43:17.200 --> 43:19.520
And man, oh, man

43:22.240 --> 43:24.240
I'm going to

43:24.720 --> 43:27.520
I'm thinking of becoming an e-sports

43:28.080 --> 43:30.080
Formula one champion

43:31.040 --> 43:38.080
You can't break your hip doing that. Well, you've got to get yeah, okay. You've got to get a different wheel awful photo

43:38.400 --> 43:40.400
Yeah, like my hair

43:41.440 --> 43:43.120
Love it

43:43.120 --> 43:45.280
We're not going to need a response, but I'll update next week

43:47.040 --> 43:49.040
We got to wrap this shit up anyways

43:53.440 --> 43:57.760
We made it to another week, you know, this show's still fucking going ads out the wazoo

43:58.240 --> 43:59.440
um

43:59.440 --> 44:01.440
We didn't take an ad break

44:05.040 --> 44:07.520
Do we have ads at every James on Instagram

44:08.960 --> 44:12.640
at Jeff boy already on Twitter. I am 400 followers away

44:13.520 --> 44:15.520
from 10,000 and

44:15.520 --> 44:17.520
a huge if

44:17.520 --> 44:24.000
Let's say if I get to 10,000 followers by the end of July. I will post an Instagram story of my actual ass

44:24.080 --> 44:28.080
I think you do that. You should re-mate

44:30.080 --> 44:34.320
First, yes, I feel like you should also recreate the the bot test photo

44:35.760 --> 44:37.280
Oh, that's like a mystery

44:39.040 --> 44:41.040
Yeah

44:41.040 --> 44:45.280
Okay, if we get to 10,000 followers by the end of the July. I'll recreate the bot test photos somehow

44:45.680 --> 44:47.040
I don't know where I'm going to do that

44:47.760 --> 44:50.560
I'm going to be hard. We'll find a stream. All right. Yeah, to Penga

44:51.520 --> 44:53.520
Or in the L.A. River

44:53.520 --> 44:59.440
The L.A. River is perfect. So polluted. You guys want me to get fucking a weird river disease

45:01.120 --> 45:03.120
Ideally, yeah

45:03.120 --> 45:08.320
It would be really funny if you did that, but it was just like the dry concrete part

45:09.680 --> 45:11.680
That's funny

45:11.680 --> 45:14.800
Casey plugs. What are you got going on? What do you want to point the people to?

So if anyone wants to follow me out of just like goodwill and know that I won't do anything in return

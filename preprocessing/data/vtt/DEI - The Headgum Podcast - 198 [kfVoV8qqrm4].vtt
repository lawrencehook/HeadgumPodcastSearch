WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Cold open.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
It's one of those rare cold opens where it happened after the show.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
Cold closing.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Cold closing, but it's going to start the episode.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Got it.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Got it.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
I understand what you're trying to do.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
Which is to salvage the app because a mere forgot to record the video.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Yeah, I guess producer am here.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
I never hit record.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Yeah.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
You didn't press the button or something.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
I'm behind the desk.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
I could have pressed record.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Yes.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
But I left that job up to you today.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
And guess what didn't end up happening?

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
I didn't know that.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
It was my job.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Really?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Of course not.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Is that because I didn't say anything.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Yeah.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
I don't know that one.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Red off the bat the first time.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
You probably should have known.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
You like it.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
There's no real indicator for you.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
There's usually a red light.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
And I kind of did after I.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yeah.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
The last thing I was like, is this video?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Or, and I was surprised when you said it.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
It was video.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
She knew the whole time.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
I did.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
You could have said anything at any point.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
You could have said it by intelligence.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
You could have said, hey, I don't think the video was recording.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
And then I would have been like.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
You were perfect.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
I'm so rarely in front of the camera.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I know.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
They know what they're doing.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
I'm really in front of it.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Yeah.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Your biggest mistake is thinking that Jeff knows what he's doing.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
It's hard.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Because again, it's getting the benefit of it.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Versus reward.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
It's risk versus reward.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
It's me versus reward.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
It's me versus reward.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
And ultimately, that is the.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Drawing.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Drawing.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
It all makes sense soon enough.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Enjoy the episode everybody.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
Let's get straight into it.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Let's all introduce ourselves.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
I'll introduce you guys because I'm a host and that's kind of part of my job.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Amelia and I'm already forgetting your last name.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Marino.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Like Sam.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah, like Sam.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Amir Blumenfeld.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
And on your kind of Scott.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Sorry.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
And Marina.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
And like Dan.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah, like Sam and Dan.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Like Sam.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Marino.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Like the city.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Next to Pasadena.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Not like the world famous football.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
What do you know?

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Home to the Huntington Gardens.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Is that true?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
I think so.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Or Huntington that might be Pasadena.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
It's the city over.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
It's not even ultimately Sam.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
And then on your kind of sky.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Okay.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
You want to take that again.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
On your kind of sky.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
And then on you.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I sent you a little something about myself to introduce me.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Do you want to go ahead and read that?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Yeah.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Do you want to do it me or first or no?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I said Amir Blumenfeld.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
And if we skip them, that's.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
That's fine.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Okay.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Please welcome to the show.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
The head gun podcast.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
DEI host Jeffrey James.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Wow.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
I don't think it's fair that he doesn't want to wear a brown man.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Can't get ahead.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
But without people tearing him down by saying the reason he hosts the show is.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
What diversity and inclusion.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
You said that.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Actually, I said it.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
But you told me to say it on you.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Checkmate.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Really?

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Cause you had a bad day.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Do you want to.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Do you want to.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
For anyone who doesn't know you.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Introduce yourself.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
I don't think I did a great job.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
I am Amelia Marino, like San Marino.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Pretty good.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Pretty good.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Pretty good.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
I'm also an associate producer on another head gun podcast called Do Boys.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
So, uh.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Unbelievable.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Big ol' Yikes.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
One of our most popular shows definitely not only in numbers.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Definitely not only metric to metric.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
The other metric is culture.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
How many of our listeners across the entire network?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Have a mustache and long hair now because of me.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Zero.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
On you, zero.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Cause yeah.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Can you hear the sound of that?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Do you still look for it?

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Can you hear some of our other words?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
I know.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
I actually have a question for on you.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Really?

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
If you ever don't want to tell somebody something to ever say on your business.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
That's good.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
That's pretty good.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.700
Yeah, let's keep the buzz on it.

04:42.700 --> 04:46.600
Do you want to tell people, do you want to tell Amelia what my name on the show is?

04:46.600 --> 04:47.400
On your zero.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.200
I think it's not a hero.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.600
It's because my alias for a while was Tony zero and then she ended up taking it.

04:54.600 --> 04:55.600
Oh, right.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.000
Yeah.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.400
I feel like the fans did that.

04:57.400 --> 04:57.800
Exactly.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.000
A lot of it is canon.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.600
I feel like we are a little glossary of truth.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.800
I mean, you listen to all 200 episodes of the show.

05:02.800 --> 05:03.400
I did.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.200
198.

05:04.200 --> 05:04.600
198.

05:04.600 --> 05:05.600
I was right.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.200
It's hard because I feel like the doughboys don't have their own like glossary of

05:08.200 --> 05:08.600
terms.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.600
I feel like the show has that.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.600
So that's what we definitely do.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.800
Amelia segments and jokes and kind of callbacks.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.600
There's like a side jokes though.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.600
And they've been doing it for ten years.

05:16.600 --> 05:17.600
Ten years?

05:17.600 --> 05:18.600
Yeah.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.600
And how old were you ten years ago?

05:19.600 --> 05:20.600
Ten years ago.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.600
I would have been a middle school.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.600
Yeah.

05:22.600 --> 05:23.600
So there's the difference right there.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.600
I have to tell you a story.

05:29.600 --> 05:30.600
I actually forgot to tell you.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.600
This is funny.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.600
Yeah.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.600
American.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.600
I fast from you thinking that I was only a diversity higher.

05:37.600 --> 05:38.600
Let's go on.

05:38.600 --> 05:39.600
Sure.

05:39.600 --> 05:44.600
We'll come back to it.

05:44.600 --> 05:45.600
Did you?

05:45.600 --> 05:46.600
American.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.600
I've been designing some head gum merch, which is very exciting.

05:48.600 --> 05:49.600
I saw something.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.600
Did you see the one that she was.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.600
You know the one that she's talking about.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.600
She being me.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.600
You know.

05:54.600 --> 05:57.600
And you know the one you're talking about.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.600
You know the one you're talking about.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.600
You know the one you're talking about.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.600
Do you know what you're saying?

06:00.600 --> 06:01.600
Yeah.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.600
I have an idea.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.600
Are you saying that you like?

06:03.600 --> 06:05.600
I think you're saying the same thing as you.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.600
Yeah.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.600
You're saying the same thing as you.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.600
Yeah.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.600
You know the shirts that she's building.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.600
I mean.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.600
I mean.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.600
I know.

06:17.600 --> 06:18.600
Same.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.600
Yeah.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.600
I was the same page.

06:20.600 --> 06:21.600
Two zeros today.

06:21.600 --> 06:22.600
In a way.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.600
What is this shirt?

06:23.600 --> 06:25.600
So we've been designing these shirts.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.600
We're working with like a company.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.600
It's going to help us just like put them together.

06:28.600 --> 06:29.600
And we kind of sent them.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.600
American.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.600
I like sent them a.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.600
A deck with our ideas, but we didn't like finish doing them.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.600
Like we we we like here's the link.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.600
And we didn't have time to really go back and look at it.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.600
And then what they sent back there was a page of just.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.600
Kind of we were like a head gum jokes and kind of just ran them ideas.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.600
Yeah.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.600
And what they sent back.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.600
And they sent back.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.600
It was just things we had jotted down.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.600
So what they sent back is actually was like a shirt with like a mishmash of things.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.600
And then it just like randomly says on your zero.

06:56.600 --> 06:57.600
And then like rice.

06:57.600 --> 06:58.600
Rice.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.600
So it's like if A I made a shirt.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.600
And it was clear that they were like, what?

07:03.600 --> 07:05.600
But I guess we have to put this together.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.600
Jeff's man.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.600
Jeff's not reacting in his mad because there's no reference to his name on the shirt.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.600
We had shirts with my whole face on it.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.600
It was me.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.600
I'm not mad.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.600
I'm just planning the next fucking thing.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.600
But I'm telling you a story.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.600
Are you saying you already heard from someone named me?

07:18.600 --> 07:20.600
You're saying you're the same.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.600
You're saying you're the same.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.600
You're the same.

07:22.600 --> 07:25.600
You don't need all of this to have me tell that earlier.

07:25.600 --> 07:26.600
You've me has already told you that.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.600
It's the same story.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.600
Same shirt that same shirt.

07:29.600 --> 07:30.600
Same shirt different day.

07:30.600 --> 07:31.600
Sure.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.600
Sure.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.600
Now that's a shirt idea.

07:34.600 --> 07:35.600
Really good.

07:35.600 --> 07:40.600
It's hard because I love to have shirts on that are saying what I'm about to say.

07:40.600 --> 07:46.600
Like if I had a shirt that said, if I had a shirt that said, yeah, that'd be the perfect time to wear it.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.600
And say it.

07:47.600 --> 07:53.600
Because when you wear the shirt that says the sentence, you have to make sure you say it the day you wear that shirt.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.600
Same shirt different day.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.600
I feel like I'm in a fever drain.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.600
That's a good show.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.600
Yeah, that's a good show.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.600
Yeah, that's a good show.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.600
That's a good show.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.600
A log line for the show.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.600
I know I say overlap in dialogue with things.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.600
That's good doesn't add much to the conversation.

08:06.600 --> 08:07.600
And say that.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.600
We're clearly having a listen to a doughboys episode.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.600
Nice.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.600
Wow.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.600
That's good.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.600
It's very valid.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.600
Yeah.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.600
Kind of like a jungle theme.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.600
Jungle both.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.600
A jungle both.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.600
Jungle both.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.600
A live show at the rainforest cafe.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.600
Where is that?

08:25.600 --> 08:26.600
We can't afford that.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.600
I don't really listen to the doughboys much.

08:28.600 --> 08:29.600
I do like that show though.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.600
Do you listen to this show?

08:31.600 --> 08:36.600
I did listen to all 198 episodes to prep for this.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.600
You listen to episode 198.

08:38.600 --> 08:39.600
To prep for this.

08:39.600 --> 08:45.600
I listen to the first couple minutes of this episode.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.600
Sitting here right now.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.600
To prep for this moment.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.600
I think you got it.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.600
That's kind of like.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.600
So you didn't know anything about it.

08:56.600 --> 08:57.600
But you wanted to be on it.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.600
I kind of wanted to go.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.600
I asked on you, which episode I should listen to.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.600
And she said on your business.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.600
That's really, really.

09:04.600 --> 09:05.600
She said that.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.600
Because she had heard it when you said it.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.600
Yeah.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.600
And you were like, just pick anyone.

09:10.600 --> 09:11.600
It doesn't matter.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.600
And then I asked what to expect.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.600
And you were like, it's going to be like,

09:15.600 --> 09:17.600
It's going to be wild.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.600
Or I don't know.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.600
I feel like that's not fair.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.600
The show is like a wild spot.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.600
It's not fair.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.600
It's a wild spot.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.600
I don't know.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.600
I feel like that.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.600
I realized maybe I go in blind and maybe that's

09:28.600 --> 09:30.600
Maybe that's maybe better.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.600
I'm glad people are getting a chance to get to know

09:32.600 --> 09:34.600
your ass because you're going to be on the,

09:34.600 --> 09:35.600
the 200th episode, right?

09:35.600 --> 09:37.600
Oh, I actually won't.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.600
Unfortunately.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.600
I'm going to, I'm going out of town.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.600
Where are you going San Marino?

09:41.600 --> 09:42.600
I'm going to.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.600
I'm going to.

09:43.600 --> 09:44.600
Miami.

09:44.600 --> 09:45.600
Really?

09:45.600 --> 09:46.600
Where'd you go?

09:46.600 --> 09:47.600
San Marino.

09:47.600 --> 09:48.600
I'm going home.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.600
Back east.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.600
Are you from Miami.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.600
No, no, sorry.

09:51.600 --> 09:55.600
I was making a Dan Marino joke. I try to keep up.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.600
I have no idea.

09:56.600 --> 09:57.600
I'm from Marino.

09:57.600 --> 09:58.600
I feel like a show now.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.600
I mean, do you want to host the show?

10:00.600 --> 10:01.600
Yeah.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.600
Is this it?

10:02.600 --> 10:03.600
Yeah. Like permanently?

10:03.600 --> 10:04.600
Sure.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.600
All we have to do is sort of rotate.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.600
I don't know what we consider the head of the class.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.600
Yeah.

10:10.600 --> 10:11.600
Okay.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.600
I can do that.

10:12.600 --> 10:13.600
Kind of being, yeah.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.600
Yeah.

10:14.600 --> 10:15.600
It actually is a problem.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.600
Give me a little more advice.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.600
Okay.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.600
So.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.600
Yeah.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.600
This is kind of fucked up.

10:25.600 --> 10:26.600
Makes sense though, right?

10:26.600 --> 10:27.600
It feels right.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.600
Oh, nice catch Dan Marino style.

10:30.600 --> 10:33.600
Is this audio or visual as well?

10:33.600 --> 10:34.600
It's a video.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.600
It's a video.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.600
Okay. So everyone saw that.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.600
I caught the glasses.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.600
No.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.600
Why the way?

10:39.600 --> 10:40.600
Can you tell where she's from?

10:40.600 --> 10:41.600
The way she just said that word?

10:41.600 --> 10:42.600
You're from the South Shore of Long Island.

10:42.600 --> 10:46.600
I just mentioned where I was from like a few seconds ago.

10:46.600 --> 10:47.600
I don't think we were.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.600
I'm from.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.600
I'm from New York.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.600
Amityville.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.600
Uh, no.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.600
But that's a movie.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.600
Right.

10:56.600 --> 10:57.600
Amityville.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.600
My mom is from Amityville.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.600
Are you from Long Island?

11:00.600 --> 11:01.600
No.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.600
I'm from a.

11:02.600 --> 11:03.600
Originally.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.600
It's from Brooklyn.

11:04.600 --> 11:05.600
Which is why.

11:05.600 --> 11:06.600
The weird.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.600
Sometimes.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.600
Second one.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.600
A mirror.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.600
But I'm not in love with it.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.600
This other people.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.600
I'm very, very happy.

11:12.600 --> 11:13.600
So I'm like.

11:13.600 --> 11:14.600
I'm like.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.600
I'm almost brother.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.600
Yes.

11:16.600 --> 11:17.600
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.600
Oh,Woman.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.600
And your dilemma or you know,

11:21.600 --> 11:24.600
no, and because you pop the glasses you're more of an old Jim,

11:24.600 --> 11:26.600
like You dog.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.600
I was like, Eat it.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.600
Okay.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.600
We'll put in it in a good 11 minutes,

11:32.600 --> 11:33.600
but I thought that was kind of funny

11:33.600 --> 11:35.600
We'll put it in like a river deep.

11:35.600 --> 11:36.600
I'm like in this show a lot.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.600
That was the cold open.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.600
Basically there's no way.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.600
That was a cold open,

11:40.600 --> 11:41.600
welcome.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.600
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:42.600 --> 11:43.600
this is the Head Them podcast.

11:43.600 --> 11:44.600
I'm your host.

11:44.600 --> 11:49.000
Amelia Marino and sitting here we have Jeff. Jeff, have you heard the shit before?

11:51.880 --> 11:53.240
On your business?

11:53.240 --> 11:54.040
Nice.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.040
This rocks by the way.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.560
Do you know me or Bloominville?

11:57.560 --> 11:59.720
I feel like this whole game is correct.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.200
Happened because on you was upset about the DEI.

12:03.400 --> 12:04.280
Don't say that.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.080
On the they did.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.280
Don't touch that out.

12:06.280 --> 12:07.320
Grace cut that out.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.200
DEI.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.320
More like DEI.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.080
Diversity.

12:11.880 --> 12:12.680
Equity.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.720
Does it happen today?

12:17.720 --> 12:19.400
You got it. She's got the pacing.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.600
I feel like we could sell the show better with you at the helm.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.200
I feel like we need to talk about the helm.

12:24.200 --> 12:24.920
My guest.

12:24.920 --> 12:25.640
Okay.

12:25.640 --> 12:26.600
If you, yeah.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.120
This could be nominated for one.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.400
So he do a good job.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.920
Oh, okay.

12:30.920 --> 12:31.720
Pressure's on.

12:31.720 --> 12:32.920
He is on top.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.760
On top of that.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.040
The heat is up.

12:36.040 --> 12:36.920
On top of that.

12:36.920 --> 12:37.880
Jeff doesn't even have that on.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.240
It's too young.

12:40.440 --> 12:41.400
Jeff's 25.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.440
25?

12:42.440 --> 12:43.720
For 26.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.560
I'm 29.

12:45.560 --> 12:46.280
It's kind of young.

12:47.480 --> 12:48.200
That's not young.

12:48.200 --> 12:48.920
Pretty baby to me.

12:48.920 --> 12:49.960
I feel like a dead end.

12:49.960 --> 12:50.760
No.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.920
I feel like I'm like still like the youngest in the room.

12:52.920 --> 12:55.000
I feel like I'm sort of like a prodigy sex.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.480
He's a little bit of a prodigy who's prodigy.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.960
Fucking David Cross.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.480
Most NBA all stars are young.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.200
But that's because they're like,

13:02.200 --> 13:03.400
Mozart was younger.

13:03.400 --> 13:03.800
Correct.

13:03.800 --> 13:04.600
And he was DEI.

13:04.600 --> 13:05.160
Amidates?

13:05.160 --> 13:05.800
That's it.

13:05.800 --> 13:06.680
You haven't unrelated.

13:06.680 --> 13:07.800
What about Amidates zero?

13:07.800 --> 13:09.800
Yeah.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.560
Oh, he even had his last name.

13:11.560 --> 13:12.680
Zero is funny.

13:14.680 --> 13:16.760
Oh, I'm really guilty.

13:16.760 --> 13:17.960
Amidates last night.

13:17.960 --> 13:18.760
No.

13:18.760 --> 13:19.880
What about the after party?

13:19.880 --> 13:20.360
What should I say?

13:20.360 --> 13:21.160
The Amber party?

13:21.160 --> 13:22.840
No after the script.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.560
Did not just, you know,

13:25.560 --> 13:27.960
slept like a bear last night.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.640
You went, you had a live stream.

13:30.360 --> 13:30.840
Oh, yeah.

13:30.840 --> 13:31.320
Oh my god.

13:31.320 --> 13:31.640
Yeah.

13:31.640 --> 13:34.280
The live, the doughboys live show is last night.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.080
I was a lot of fun.

13:35.080 --> 13:35.640
Yeah.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.280
That was a lot of fun.

13:36.280 --> 13:36.920
I was a lot of fun.

13:36.920 --> 13:39.640
And like a lot of tickets sold on the live stream as well.

13:39.640 --> 13:40.440
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.360
Have you ever sold out?

13:42.440 --> 13:43.480
Time to see typewriter?

13:43.480 --> 13:44.440
I have.

13:44.440 --> 13:45.480
Have you ever?

13:46.040 --> 13:47.320
Be nice.

13:47.320 --> 13:47.800
Why?

13:47.800 --> 13:48.120
What?

13:48.120 --> 13:48.920
The headgum happy hour.

13:48.920 --> 13:49.800
We sold 150 tickets.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.720
No, like, you're, we did not sell that out.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.320
Well, they roped off sections.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.640
But they filled all the sections that weren't roped off,

13:55.640 --> 13:56.600
which is kind of selling out.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.440
It's selling out like it's cheap to do.

13:59.880 --> 14:00.360
Really?

14:00.360 --> 14:01.560
What?

14:01.560 --> 14:02.040
I don't know.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.560
You know.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.280
I've never sold out that dynasty typewriter.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.160
Well, that's a chew on.

14:07.160 --> 14:08.760
Either way, I'm proud of you.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.760
But you sold it on your own.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.920
Because now you're giving a participation trophy.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.200
By the way, I haven't tried.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.440
I haven't not tried to sell out dynasty typewriter.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.280
But the content is not tried.

14:18.280 --> 14:21.320
Hell bent on not giving the show live shows.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.320
We did well at the Grand Merci Theatre.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.080
We almost had 300 people there.

14:25.080 --> 14:27.240
But they seem to look past that.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.800
They don't think that we can cut it in the live format.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.080
I tend to disagree.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.360
We almost got a show of it.

14:32.360 --> 14:33.160
I think it looks like loose canon.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.960
Like what will you say in that environment when they show it?

14:35.960 --> 14:37.560
I think different than I say here.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.160
You could yell fire.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.360
That's funny.

14:40.440 --> 14:41.160
See.

14:41.160 --> 14:41.880
So.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.960
Did anyone yell fire last night?

14:43.960 --> 14:45.960
I'm maybe like this show is fire.

14:45.960 --> 14:46.920
That's fine.

14:46.920 --> 14:47.480
Yeah.

14:47.480 --> 14:48.440
Which is good.

14:48.440 --> 14:49.880
That actually means good.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.600
Can we talk about onions sheet pants?

14:52.600 --> 14:53.640
That's on your business.

14:55.240 --> 14:55.880
Shut down.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.080
Thank you, Billion.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.080
Can we talk about Amir's stench lunch?

15:01.080 --> 15:05.080
Oh, I feel like so Amir, I don't know if you weren't here for this.

15:05.080 --> 15:05.320
No.

15:05.320 --> 15:06.920
I don't know if you can still smell it through the glass.

15:07.880 --> 15:10.360
Amir had this barbecue and rice.

15:10.360 --> 15:11.960
I want to say dinner.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.640
I was late lunch.

15:14.360 --> 15:18.200
But it had the contents of what should have been said for like a 7pm meal.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.600
When you say, because the eggplant was scalding hot.

15:20.600 --> 15:21.800
It's good, but it's heavy.

15:21.800 --> 15:22.600
It wasn't heavy.

15:22.600 --> 15:28.520
Quite dull, but it was funny because Amir does suggest it for lunch every time we do a group lunch.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.440
And everyone says no.

15:30.440 --> 15:34.120
And so for you to get it on the day when you're just getting lunch for yourself is really.

15:34.120 --> 15:34.920
Makes sense.

15:34.920 --> 15:35.320
Yeah.

15:35.320 --> 15:36.520
I can't veto me.

15:36.920 --> 15:42.520
Well, the first thing I said to you today was, is that

15:42.520 --> 15:45.960
Amir, you just bought, not to be confused with Amir.

15:45.960 --> 15:46.360
Yeah.

15:46.360 --> 15:47.560
I did get confused.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.920
I was like, thank you.

15:48.920 --> 15:50.760
I feel like you're really, I just bought.

15:50.760 --> 15:54.200
Is that Amir, you just heard just walked over with or is it?

15:54.200 --> 15:57.240
One, is it left over is that you didn't put in the fridge for days?

15:57.240 --> 15:57.720
Yeah.

15:57.720 --> 16:00.440
And you said, I said, I just purchased it.

16:00.440 --> 16:01.960
Follow me down in a way.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.520
I feel like it's not just during the show that you're like,

16:04.520 --> 16:06.120
you've really just like answered your question.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.080
What are the contents?

16:07.080 --> 16:08.680
You got eggplant, you got...

16:08.680 --> 16:09.720
Drift-oo rice.

16:09.720 --> 16:10.760
So forky as well.

16:10.760 --> 16:11.240
There was like...

16:11.240 --> 16:12.440
Hashing-olding rice?

16:12.440 --> 16:13.880
There was sort of this...

16:13.880 --> 16:15.240
Hashing milk-oil.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.440
Smothered-saw.

16:17.240 --> 16:17.800
saw.

16:17.800 --> 16:18.760
He's so soft.

16:18.760 --> 16:19.960
So he's soft.

16:19.960 --> 16:20.920
So he's soft.

16:24.920 --> 16:28.600
Would you say this episode has been good so far, medium or poor?

16:28.600 --> 16:29.960
This is the fucking best.

16:29.960 --> 16:30.520
That's awesome.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.360
There's no way you can feel that way.

16:32.360 --> 16:33.480
This is gas.

16:34.280 --> 16:35.480
And I actually do have gas.

16:35.480 --> 16:35.880
Yeah.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.240
It's drowsome of the fucking beauty.

16:37.240 --> 16:38.040
From the barbecue.

16:38.040 --> 16:38.520
Yeah.

16:38.520 --> 16:41.720
The barrel of sides that you put together and cold a sauce.

16:41.720 --> 16:42.760
Soy sauce.

16:42.760 --> 16:43.960
Soy sauce.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.960
Because you had a bad sauce.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.760
Not on your tailor-joy.

16:56.760 --> 16:59.800
Aaron Taylor Johnson is being touted as the new bond.

16:59.800 --> 17:00.600
Do you have something to do?

17:00.600 --> 17:01.400
Oh, that's right.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.440
Maria called it.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.840
Well, she did like five years ago, but-

17:04.840 --> 17:06.680
Which is not less expensive.

17:06.680 --> 17:07.160
Not more.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.480
Well, it seems like we're rounding third and heading home

17:11.480 --> 17:12.520
towards the new James.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.920
I just, so we have to bring back the segment.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.000
Because I tabled it for literally like two weeks.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.840
We've been doing this for four years.

17:18.840 --> 17:21.960
And I just like, well, they're not going to fucking circle the next 007

17:21.960 --> 17:23.160
for like years apparently.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.840
So let's just put this on the shelf right now.

17:24.840 --> 17:26.680
They were waiting for you to shut the fuck up about it.

17:26.680 --> 17:27.480
And then they made it.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.280
And I have beef.

17:28.680 --> 17:29.480
But you know what I say?

17:29.800 --> 17:30.840
I'm sorry.

17:32.840 --> 17:33.720
I'm sorry.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.720
It's good to be able to predict the joke before even the first sentence.

17:37.720 --> 17:38.360
Please, is that?

17:38.360 --> 17:40.840
Sorry, I'm saying culture.

17:42.200 --> 17:42.840
Yeah.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.320
Right, right.

17:45.320 --> 17:49.320
We should do an episode where it's just the things you say all the time.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.040
And we just kind of...

17:50.040 --> 17:50.840
You find it.

17:50.840 --> 17:51.720
Yeah.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.240
The title is for you, thank you.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:55.000 --> 17:55.800
I are why.

17:56.440 --> 17:56.840
Cool.

17:56.840 --> 17:59.160
I don't know who I am.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.840
That's what the show has kind of become.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.760
What's your glasses help ground you?

18:02.760 --> 18:05.480
I really am like self conscious about the dry eyes.

18:05.480 --> 18:05.960
Yeah.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.000
Oh yeah, here you go.

18:07.000 --> 18:07.960
Dry eyes.

18:07.960 --> 18:08.200
Dry eyes.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.480
I mean, there's two nice for this show.

18:09.480 --> 18:10.760
I heard it was a Dan Rina bass.

18:10.760 --> 18:11.960
She's only been on once.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.000
I'm afraid I'm actually going to get it.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.200
No, she's a sweetheart.

18:14.200 --> 18:14.840
Thank you.

18:14.840 --> 18:19.880
Um, Amelia, to explain Jeff for four years made every guest every week.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.720
Say who they thought would be the next James Bond.

18:22.360 --> 18:26.280
And then stopped for two weeks and then they announced the next one.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.760
Because the bit was supposed to be, let's track the song until they cast.

18:28.760 --> 18:29.960
But I thought that was going to take a year.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.960
And to take into the floor.

18:31.960 --> 18:32.840
It's not even done yet.

18:32.840 --> 18:34.040
We did it for four.

18:34.040 --> 18:34.840
It's just hard.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.040
Anyway, who do you think should be?

18:36.040 --> 18:37.480
Winning it earned.

18:37.480 --> 18:38.840
Kind of like a linen blanket.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.520
Are we doing bond of the week or one?

18:40.520 --> 18:41.240
Oh, yes, all right.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.000
Mine is Matthew Morrison bond of the week.

18:46.440 --> 18:49.240
And I can't say our Taylor Johnson, he's taken.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.280
I mean, you can.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.040
You might get raped over the calls in the comments.

18:52.040 --> 18:54.200
Yeah, I feel like I feel like that's cheating.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.320
Yeah, yeah.

18:55.320 --> 18:56.280
Um, hmm.

18:57.560 --> 18:58.680
You know what?

18:58.680 --> 19:01.320
Let's get a shallum a bond.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.520
Let's get it.

19:02.520 --> 19:06.680
Let's get a, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

19:06.680 --> 19:07.880
A little scrawny.

19:07.880 --> 19:11.320
Yeah, that's exactly what he was sort of an action hero in Dune.

19:11.320 --> 19:12.120
Just kind of a little bit.

19:12.120 --> 19:12.600
There you go.

19:12.600 --> 19:13.880
I'm seeing Dune too tonight.

19:13.880 --> 19:14.600
I'll interesting.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.440
Are you going to text Casey Donnie, you about it?

19:16.440 --> 19:17.560
Cause it's only one's to talk about it.

19:17.720 --> 19:18.120
Yes.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.760
I talked about it with Casey last night, actually.

19:20.760 --> 19:21.640
We can believe it.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.000
Yeah, we're talking about it.

19:23.000 --> 19:23.320
Yeah.

19:23.320 --> 19:24.200
Do two.

19:24.200 --> 19:28.440
Like it's, once the last time, everyone rallied behind something.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.880
Barbonheimer six months ago.

19:29.880 --> 19:34.040
No, Barbonheimer didn't have the same effect that Dune 2 has seemed to have.

19:34.040 --> 19:37.080
Did you actually be not wanting to raise the retirement age in France?

19:37.080 --> 19:37.560
What?

19:37.560 --> 19:37.880
Mm.

19:37.880 --> 19:38.040
Yeah.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.360
I mean, that's, that's another one.

19:40.360 --> 19:40.680
Yeah.

19:40.680 --> 19:40.920
Yeah.

19:40.920 --> 19:41.160
Yeah.

19:41.160 --> 19:41.880
It's our thing.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.000
I was going to come out and go.

19:43.000 --> 19:43.880
Was another one.

19:43.880 --> 19:44.360
Yeah.

19:44.360 --> 19:44.520
Yeah.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.560
We're going to go to the polls.

19:45.560 --> 19:46.760
That's when people really took off.

19:46.760 --> 19:47.400
Yes.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.400
Yeah.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.960
And in terms of other people's bonds, do you

19:53.960 --> 19:56.760
case out of my responsibility to make you say a bond?

19:56.760 --> 19:58.360
I mean, as you said, hers, I said mine.

19:58.360 --> 19:58.600
Right.

19:58.600 --> 19:59.560
Go ahead or don't.

19:59.560 --> 20:00.520
Sorry, hold for sound.

20:09.640 --> 20:10.520
They're almost hit us.

20:11.400 --> 20:11.960
I was low.

20:14.200 --> 20:14.680
We're clear.

20:17.640 --> 20:18.680
Keep our southern land.

20:18.680 --> 20:19.160
Yeah.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.520
We have to take a quick break.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.160
Yeah.

20:21.160 --> 20:21.400
Yeah.

20:21.400 --> 20:22.360
We're going to take him off him.

20:22.360 --> 20:22.840
I'll be up.

20:22.840 --> 20:23.160
Sorry.

20:23.160 --> 20:23.960
I can't hear you, sure.

20:23.960 --> 20:26.280
This show is sponsored by Better Health.

20:26.280 --> 20:31.080
Guys, a lot of us spend our lives wishing we had more time.

20:31.080 --> 20:33.480
The question is time for what?

20:33.480 --> 20:36.520
If time was unlimited, how would you use it?

20:36.520 --> 20:42.120
Now, the best way to squeeze that special thing into your schedule is to know what's important

20:42.120 --> 20:44.680
to you and make it a priority.

20:44.680 --> 20:50.600
And that's where therapy comes in, because therapy can help you find what matters to you,

20:50.600 --> 20:51.800
so you can do more of it.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.600
I have personally benefited from therapy.

20:54.600 --> 20:59.960
I had it today, and emotionally, I'm kind of soaring because of it.

20:59.960 --> 21:03.480
And that's not an unusual experience on a weekly basis.

21:03.480 --> 21:06.680
I would highly recommend therapy to anyone who has the access to it,

21:06.680 --> 21:08.520
and Better Health makes it easier.

21:08.520 --> 21:13.880
So if you're starting to give therapy a try, or if you're wondering if you should maybe

21:13.960 --> 21:18.120
start therapy and give that a try, give Better Health a try.

Tag yourself.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.520
At least people don't bash them afterwards.

21:50.520 --> 21:55.320
When they say something, you know, about reality, which is like I sometimes wish.

21:55.320 --> 21:59.000
Yeah, I'm the person in the green sweater, just to her right.

21:59.000 --> 21:59.480
Yeah.

21:59.480 --> 22:05.000
Who asked the editor to just cut me out of the clip completely as I want nothing to do with this.

22:05.000 --> 22:05.640
Yeah.

22:05.640 --> 22:08.040
I'm obviously daddy to veto, I guess.

22:08.120 --> 22:13.160
That's good. I'm Chris Evans, who started reply to the street with put it in the loop.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.880
Chris Evans.

22:20.760 --> 22:23.960
Yeah, the fucking turn the TV off for that.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.480
I thought we did well.

22:26.200 --> 22:29.960
Are we not doing like any segments or another convertible?

22:31.720 --> 22:32.520
Jesus.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.160
I like it.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.680
I like, is yours just turned down?

22:38.680 --> 22:39.240
Maybe.

22:39.240 --> 22:40.600
Yeah, I haven't changed the longer.

22:40.600 --> 22:41.720
That's why I don't know why people.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.960
I'm sorry, why don't you have your headphones on your cans?

22:43.960 --> 22:46.440
I can hear it so loudly.

22:46.440 --> 22:47.880
Through other old cans.

22:50.040 --> 22:51.720
Or you'll get cans.

22:55.720 --> 22:58.360
I mean, like, what else do people need to know about you in preparation?

22:58.360 --> 22:59.800
Absolutely nothing.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.080
Really in terms of the things.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.520
They don't need to know anything.

23:02.520 --> 23:03.400
Well, you're from Brooklyn.

23:03.880 --> 23:07.080
Well, I was even close to done.

23:07.080 --> 23:08.440
I was bored.

23:08.440 --> 23:09.640
I was bored and Brooklyn.

23:09.640 --> 23:10.440
But I can't remember.

23:10.440 --> 23:15.160
I was, I was brazed in a suburb outside of Manhattan.

23:15.160 --> 23:20.360
Okay, rye or, oh, well, across the Hudson in the Rockland County area.

23:20.360 --> 23:21.960
So, the palestades of New Jersey.

23:22.760 --> 23:23.960
Of New York, yeah.

23:23.960 --> 23:26.760
I'm not from like the border of New York and New Jersey.

23:26.760 --> 23:31.160
Yeah, so like, if people say I'm from New Jersey, I don't correct because like,

23:31.240 --> 23:33.480
I'm literally a five minute walk from the border.

23:33.480 --> 23:33.880
I love that.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.880
A Pearl River is the name of the town I've from.

23:35.880 --> 23:36.920
Okay, that's right.

23:36.920 --> 23:38.040
Home of the pirates.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.800
You know who lived someone near to there?

23:39.800 --> 23:40.280
Where?

23:40.280 --> 23:40.760
Who?

23:40.760 --> 23:41.960
Jasper Johns.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.160
What about this?

23:43.160 --> 23:44.120
The artist.

23:44.120 --> 23:44.760
The artist.

23:44.760 --> 23:46.920
But maybe now the ghost to the artist.

23:46.920 --> 23:47.480
He's the artist.

23:47.480 --> 23:48.120
I wouldn't.

23:48.120 --> 23:48.760
Sorry.

23:48.760 --> 23:49.560
He's dead.

23:49.560 --> 23:50.600
I don't know the ghost to the artist.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.200
Oh, I didn't know that.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.400
I was making a cast for it.

23:53.400 --> 23:54.040
Don't he point?

23:54.040 --> 23:57.640
Oh, Jasper's cast for the friend Lee Johns.

23:58.440 --> 23:59.640
That's Jasper's ghost.

23:59.720 --> 24:00.920
I mean, they're fell asleep.

24:00.920 --> 24:04.040
Painting a flag and using the portal.

24:06.440 --> 24:08.760
I'm 41.

24:08.760 --> 24:11.720
You can't waste my time as in disgrace.

24:11.720 --> 24:12.920
So close to that.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.920
It was easier when you were like 37.

24:14.920 --> 24:15.800
Yeah, exactly.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.000
It was fun.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.280
Now it's like times ticking and I'm wasting it in here.

24:20.280 --> 24:22.360
Would you say it's more of a chore or more of a war?

24:22.360 --> 24:22.840
Sure.

24:22.840 --> 24:23.240
Yeah.

24:23.240 --> 24:23.640
Yeah.

24:23.640 --> 24:24.440
And have you done?

24:24.440 --> 24:25.880
You've we've all seen this session.

24:25.880 --> 24:26.840
So there's more on the floor.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.240
Uh-huh.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.240
That's just recording an episode of this show on the floor.

24:29.240 --> 24:30.360
And this is a chore.

24:30.360 --> 24:31.800
You know, on the door.

24:31.800 --> 24:32.360
Yes.

24:32.360 --> 24:33.400
That's it.

24:33.400 --> 24:36.200
And please welcome our next guest, Dan Gore.

24:39.320 --> 24:42.280
It's funny that all of our colleagues, the offices completely.

24:42.280 --> 24:45.480
I'm taking the wrong the podcast and we're in here.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.000
We're at podcast series.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.840
This is episode 198.

24:48.840 --> 24:51.000
I want to say it's a filler episode.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.880
I mean, I don't know if you guys listen to a 99 in a million, but uh,

24:53.880 --> 24:55.800
that was right before the 100th episode, obviously.

24:55.880 --> 25:00.280
And it was just a episode where me Caleb and Shelby like waxed.

25:00.280 --> 25:01.640
It was like each other.

25:01.640 --> 25:07.640
Appropriation of age slash the call in special.

25:07.640 --> 25:08.120
Cool.

25:08.120 --> 25:11.240
Uh, the show is indeed a hemroyed on the network.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.680
It's kind of a growth.

25:12.680 --> 25:13.080
Yeah.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.280
It's like basically, uh,

25:15.560 --> 25:18.520
ultimately not a single vein.

25:18.520 --> 25:19.320
The land.

25:19.320 --> 25:20.040
Yeah.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.760
It's sort of like, uh, eight.

25:22.840 --> 25:26.040
It hurts over the tanker or otherwise.

25:26.040 --> 25:26.840
Correct.

25:26.840 --> 25:29.880
Uh, on the roof of the mouth of joy.

25:29.880 --> 25:30.680
It's a mole.

25:30.680 --> 25:38.200
Whereas I'm the turt and you're in four of wisdom and the conquering of fear.

25:39.160 --> 25:43.400
Oftentimes what ends up in its stead is a canker.

25:45.560 --> 25:48.600
That that is like slam poetry right there.

25:49.640 --> 25:50.280
Thank you.

25:50.280 --> 25:53.480
So compared to a dough boy's episode, how is this one?

25:54.040 --> 25:56.600
Um, a little less structured maybe.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.640
Yeah, yeah, I would say a little less structured, but you know what?

26:00.280 --> 26:02.600
That's, that's where all the one way.

26:04.440 --> 26:04.840
Right?

26:10.680 --> 26:16.040
Welcome to the Nash cab.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.520
Well, here's how this show is going to work.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
I'm going to ask you various, uh, multiple choice questions about

26:23.000 --> 26:25.240
Bruxism, the Nash.

26:25.240 --> 26:26.760
And nine of teeth.

26:26.760 --> 26:27.880
I'm going to read it.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.960
Sorry, on your are we boring you?

26:29.960 --> 26:32.120
You took so long to just pull that up.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.120
Yeah, but people have a check screen in that.

26:34.120 --> 26:35.080
All the challenge.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.600
Now who do you tested?

26:36.600 --> 26:39.080
I was checking email from.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.520
I got one from Miles Bonson, you're a.

26:40.520 --> 26:41.400
And what did he say?

26:41.400 --> 26:43.960
He said he's fucking busy when you wanted him to be in the studio.

26:43.960 --> 26:45.160
So really?

26:46.120 --> 26:48.520
I want to send an hour check emails too.

26:48.520 --> 26:49.720
That's you want to send me one?

26:49.720 --> 26:50.120
Yeah.

26:50.120 --> 26:52.120
Why is it more exciting to the three of you?

26:52.120 --> 26:54.760
Why don't we just take the time to check our email for a little bit.

26:54.760 --> 26:57.560
Then it's like, okay, we'll be able to come back to the show.

26:57.560 --> 26:59.000
The renewing email is.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.360
And then I'll play the city on your behalf cab.

27:03.480 --> 27:06.680
All right, uh, these questions are worth cash, though.

27:06.680 --> 27:07.400
That's so much.

27:07.400 --> 27:08.680
No, I'm paying attention now.

27:08.680 --> 27:10.280
Well, no, you're getting your cash.

27:10.280 --> 27:11.400
No, well, you guys made your bed.

27:11.400 --> 27:12.200
No, you got to lie in it.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.160
So why don't you check your email.

27:14.120 --> 27:15.320
And I want to add to it.

27:15.320 --> 27:16.920
That's going to end up on my time card.

27:16.920 --> 27:17.560
Sorry, Marty.

27:17.560 --> 27:18.840
But I thought this was Nash cab.

27:18.840 --> 27:21.720
It's Nash cab, but that doesn't mean you can't win cash.

27:21.720 --> 27:23.960
Oh, wait, you told me about this and I said, don't do it.

27:23.960 --> 27:26.440
I'm saying, Nash cab is a cash grab.

27:26.440 --> 27:30.840
I'm saying that you can win money if you play along.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.280
Could you win Nash?

27:32.280 --> 27:32.680
What's up?

27:32.680 --> 27:34.280
Could you win Nash, perhaps?

27:34.280 --> 27:38.200
If you guys were a Nashville, for every question, you guys write all Nash.

27:38.920 --> 27:39.720
My teeth.

27:39.720 --> 27:40.760
Okay, sort of grind.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.560
Down to a nob, down to the gums.

27:43.560 --> 27:44.120
Okay.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.880
And now I'm going to have.

27:45.880 --> 27:46.920
All right, here we go.

27:46.920 --> 27:47.800
Question number one.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.040
Check your emails.

27:50.440 --> 27:50.920
No, I'm.

27:50.920 --> 27:51.720
That's the question.

27:51.720 --> 27:52.440
Okay.

27:52.440 --> 27:55.640
What is the medical term for the gnashing of teeth?

27:55.640 --> 27:56.920
A, Bruxism.

27:56.920 --> 27:57.880
He just said it.

27:57.880 --> 27:58.040
He just said it.

27:58.040 --> 27:59.240
He just said it.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.280
Oh, we're Bruxism.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.120
I didn't mean to say it to the intro.

28:02.920 --> 28:03.400
Right.

28:04.520 --> 28:05.560
So who said it?

28:06.200 --> 28:07.080
You mean it?

28:07.640 --> 28:08.680
Take the cash.

28:08.680 --> 28:09.480
I don't mind.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.840
Buy bucks from Marty.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.880
Again, for the record, he asked me.

28:13.880 --> 28:15.320
He should do this and I said no.

28:15.320 --> 28:15.800
Yeah.

28:15.800 --> 28:16.120
Yeah.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.120
He said, can I put the money on my time card?

28:18.120 --> 28:18.520
I said no.

28:18.520 --> 28:19.720
It's just hard.

28:19.720 --> 28:20.680
It's not hard.

28:20.680 --> 28:23.080
It's hard to put together stuff.

28:23.080 --> 28:25.080
But I'm really planning the next episode.

28:25.080 --> 28:25.880
You know what I mean?

28:26.680 --> 28:28.680
You're really gnashing your teeth at me.

28:28.680 --> 28:32.520
I have a lot of anxiety.

28:32.520 --> 28:36.920
And it ends up at the tips of my canines.

28:37.800 --> 28:38.680
Nashing.

28:38.680 --> 28:39.720
He means his dog's.

28:39.720 --> 28:40.680
Bruxism.

28:41.240 --> 28:41.560
All right.

28:41.560 --> 28:42.280
Hi, question.

28:42.280 --> 28:43.640
I go, hey, Bruxism.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.160
I'm dollars to Amelia.

28:47.880 --> 28:48.520
Marino.

28:48.520 --> 28:49.000
Yes.

28:50.440 --> 28:50.840
Number two.

28:51.800 --> 28:52.360
Signs.

28:56.120 --> 28:58.920
Signs and symptoms of gnashing your teeth

28:58.920 --> 29:01.640
include a, aching teeth.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.600
B, ear pain.

29:05.480 --> 29:10.200
C, both A and B or D all of the above.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.360
So C is D.

29:12.360 --> 29:13.720
C and D.

29:13.720 --> 29:14.600
Who said D?

29:14.600 --> 29:14.760
Me.

29:15.640 --> 29:19.160
Correct $5 to the woman wearing a duvet.

29:21.640 --> 29:22.360
Number two.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.640
Oh, my god.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.640
That is not going to fly.

29:28.280 --> 29:29.640
What are you talking about?

29:29.640 --> 29:30.840
On my face.

29:30.840 --> 29:34.040
That's the way that fly.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.320
I don't know about where mirror lives, right?

29:37.320 --> 29:40.520
Bucking up to the fucking thing.

29:40.520 --> 29:41.240
It's hard.

29:41.240 --> 29:41.800
Leaping.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.960
Number three, who in this room is most at risk

29:45.960 --> 29:48.280
for for lack of a better term, Bruxism?

29:49.880 --> 29:51.320
A, a mirror.

29:51.320 --> 29:52.920
B, Amelia.

29:52.920 --> 29:55.640
C, Ania, or D, B.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.480
D, I don't know with a mirror.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.480
Well, I got the grind guard.

29:59.480 --> 30:02.040
So I don't know if that puts me at high risk or fun.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.600
You can't be at risk or something.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.600
You already have because the risk is passed.

30:06.600 --> 30:07.400
You have.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.000
I don't agree with that.

30:09.640 --> 30:12.760
I would say he's more at risk because he experiences it.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.760
If you take out your guard, then you're, you're screwed.

30:16.760 --> 30:23.560
If you get run over by an 18 wheeler or you at risk for being run over by an 18 wheeler,

30:23.560 --> 30:25.080
it doesn't remove the risk of an happening again.

30:26.280 --> 30:28.280
It's hard because it's also a risk of a reward.

30:28.280 --> 30:29.240
I'm not seeing any reward.

30:29.240 --> 30:30.680
Lightening can strike twice.

30:30.680 --> 30:31.400
That's true.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.160
The reward is five bucks.

30:33.160 --> 30:35.160
Charge to Marty for a season.

30:35.160 --> 30:36.120
You know what?

30:36.120 --> 30:37.480
No, we're given it to a mirror.

30:37.480 --> 30:38.760
I didn't say anything.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.120
He didn't say anything.

30:40.120 --> 30:45.400
But it's kind of a consolation prize for using the grind guard.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.520
Rising behind guard.

30:48.360 --> 30:48.680
What's up?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.040
These options clear.

30:50.040 --> 30:53.000
What's the best way to manage teeth gnashing?

30:53.640 --> 30:55.960
A, regular exercise.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.600
B, eating more regularly.

30:58.920 --> 31:02.920
See having discipline or de-buying a bite-splint.

31:05.320 --> 31:05.880
Boto.

31:05.880 --> 31:07.480
Oh, yeah, master.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.760
Both incorrect, unfortunately.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.840
This one's kind of subjective, but there is a race.

31:12.840 --> 31:15.640
Um, it's actually, oh, go ahead on you.

31:15.640 --> 31:18.120
No, no, I'm just pointing out that it can't be kind of subjective,

31:18.120 --> 31:19.320
but also have already answered.

31:19.320 --> 31:20.040
It's hard.

31:20.040 --> 31:22.360
Have you guys done, master, about talks for a TM today?

31:22.360 --> 31:23.080
I don't know.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.680
No, but I heard you know about it.

31:24.680 --> 31:25.560
You heard about it.

31:25.560 --> 31:26.200
You heard about it.

31:26.200 --> 31:27.880
Yeah, because it's a small talk.

31:27.880 --> 31:30.360
It helps, uh, with the locks.

31:30.360 --> 31:31.720
It helps relax this muscle.

31:31.720 --> 31:32.920
So you grind as much.

31:32.920 --> 31:35.080
Because the muscle of how much you have to relax.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.040
It's like sprinklers like.

31:36.040 --> 31:38.040
We're trophying my tight.

31:38.040 --> 31:38.280
Yeah.

31:38.280 --> 31:38.920
Bucking.

31:38.920 --> 31:39.240
Yeah.

31:39.240 --> 31:42.680
As my neck, my ass, my gums, my teeth.

31:42.680 --> 31:43.240
Which we've seen?

31:43.240 --> 31:47.080
Are you happy that your segment has brought up at Sparked Conversation?

31:47.080 --> 31:53.400
I don't want ambient nonsense to be said between three people who, frankly,

31:53.400 --> 31:57.000
don't give a damn if I'm included or excluded, diversity wise.

31:57.640 --> 32:01.240
What I wanted these segment to be was about the gnashing and nine of teeth,

32:02.040 --> 32:05.640
the splinting of bites, and having discipline!

32:07.000 --> 32:08.760
It was the correct answer that I wanted to hear.

32:08.760 --> 32:09.240
Okay.

32:09.240 --> 32:10.840
Discorrect answer that I want to do.

32:10.840 --> 32:12.040
What have you do to your sleep?

32:12.040 --> 32:14.040
You can't discipline yourself and your sleep.

32:14.040 --> 32:14.840
You got to do it.

32:14.840 --> 32:18.520
I'm really trying to bring logic to Jeff's world is really,

32:18.520 --> 32:19.400
it's frustrating.

32:19.400 --> 32:19.880
I can tell.

32:19.880 --> 32:20.520
Yeah.

32:20.520 --> 32:21.720
Well, it's hard, you know?

32:21.720 --> 32:22.040
Again.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.560
For me, like a risk without water.

32:23.560 --> 32:25.640
This is a walk in the park for me.

32:27.640 --> 32:28.360
Tell him to be.

32:32.360 --> 32:32.840
That was it?

32:35.400 --> 32:37.000
I got, we each got five bucks.

32:39.160 --> 32:41.400
You guys have now entered the MASH cab.

32:42.200 --> 32:43.720
We're starting over every minute.

32:45.720 --> 32:46.360
Just to get in.

32:46.360 --> 32:48.280
That was just a fucking practice.

32:48.280 --> 32:50.280
No, we've been in the MASH cab.

32:50.280 --> 32:50.680
Sorry.

32:50.680 --> 32:51.880
I don't interrupt you.

32:51.880 --> 32:52.440
Yes, you.

32:52.440 --> 32:52.680
Yes, you.

32:52.680 --> 32:53.320
Yes, you.

32:53.320 --> 32:53.880
Really?

32:53.880 --> 32:54.280
Yes.

32:54.280 --> 32:55.640
Hard to have a fresh set out.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.000
Oh, it's a new year.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.520
Anyhow, uh...

33:00.520 --> 33:02.360
Anyhow, um...

33:02.360 --> 33:03.000
Go on.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.360
On cash cab.

33:04.360 --> 33:06.040
They have something called the Red Light Challenge.

33:06.040 --> 33:06.360
Yep.

33:06.360 --> 33:07.960
Which is where they kind of stop.

33:07.960 --> 33:11.480
And they kind of do this 30 second, uh, power round.

33:12.680 --> 33:15.320
Where they try to name as many blank things that fall into a category.

33:15.320 --> 33:15.640
Got it.

33:15.640 --> 33:17.400
It's going to be the John Disgum's Challenge.

33:18.040 --> 33:18.680
Challenge.

33:25.960 --> 33:34.520
So basically...

33:38.760 --> 33:41.560
This is going to be the John Disgum's Challenge.

33:42.760 --> 33:46.440
So basically, on the show, it's the Red Light Challenge.

33:46.440 --> 33:47.080
Okay.

33:47.080 --> 33:50.120
On this show, it's going to be the John Disgum's Challenge.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.720
Yeah, challenge.

33:51.720 --> 33:52.520
Okay.

33:52.520 --> 33:54.520
So, challenge or challenge.

33:54.520 --> 33:55.160
Challenge.

33:55.720 --> 33:56.600
Okay.

33:56.600 --> 33:57.160
Challenge.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.200
Winner gets a challenge.

33:59.160 --> 33:59.480
Okay.

34:03.400 --> 34:04.680
You're each going to have 30 seconds.

34:04.680 --> 34:08.440
Today, my name is many things about John Disgum's as boss.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.040
How are you all on the same team?

34:11.080 --> 34:11.880
You are well...

34:12.920 --> 34:13.240
No.

34:16.040 --> 34:17.160
I'm so tired.

34:17.160 --> 34:17.800
I know.

34:17.800 --> 34:18.360
Me too.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.360
Good thing you're under a duvet.

34:22.040 --> 34:22.840
Why is...

34:22.840 --> 34:24.680
When I said it, you said you crossed the line.

34:24.760 --> 34:25.880
It's funny when I'm real.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.200
It's kind of charming and nice when she's...

34:28.200 --> 34:29.480
When I do it, it's disarming.

34:29.880 --> 34:30.600
It's charming.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.400
It's alarming how charming it feels.

34:34.040 --> 34:34.600
Yeah.

34:34.600 --> 34:35.080
Okay.

34:35.080 --> 34:36.760
I don't know what a John Disgum is.

34:36.760 --> 34:38.360
Okay, we can fucking zoom out.

34:38.360 --> 34:39.000
Is that yellow?

34:39.000 --> 34:39.640
You can make pictures.

34:39.640 --> 34:40.440
Yellow gums?

34:40.440 --> 34:43.880
Yeah, it's like a vitamin deficiency that creates like a yellow wing.

34:43.880 --> 34:44.840
But I forget what it is.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.120
In gums instead of them.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.160
No, in your skin.

34:47.160 --> 34:48.440
That I know, but gums...

34:48.440 --> 34:49.480
That wouldn't happen to your gums.

34:49.480 --> 34:49.800
Yeah.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.320
Maybe he's like a bi-elegant.

34:51.320 --> 34:52.120
Can you say yellow?

34:52.200 --> 34:53.240
It's a bi-elegant.

34:53.240 --> 34:54.680
Yeah, it's tracked to a liver issue.

34:54.680 --> 34:56.360
It doesn't have to be John Disgums.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.600
But it can be just about gnashing to you.

34:58.600 --> 34:59.080
Okay.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.360
So completely different than what you said.

35:00.360 --> 35:01.800
Dental anything would be good.

35:01.800 --> 35:06.200
So there's 30 seconds to name the most terms.

35:06.200 --> 35:06.840
Okay.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.360
About dental issues.

35:08.360 --> 35:09.000
Okay, got it.

35:10.280 --> 35:12.280
I have Soviet teeth, so I have a lot of those.

35:12.280 --> 35:13.880
Let's just say you guys are all in the same team.

35:13.880 --> 35:16.680
And let's see if you can get to 30 terms in 30 seconds.

35:16.680 --> 35:17.080
Okay.

35:17.080 --> 35:18.040
That's so many.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.080
Have we got 20?

35:19.080 --> 35:19.720
20?

35:19.720 --> 35:20.440
20?

35:20.440 --> 35:20.600
20?

35:20.600 --> 35:21.400
30 seconds.

35:21.400 --> 35:22.040
30 seconds.

35:22.040 --> 35:22.680
Okay.

35:22.680 --> 35:23.480
Okay.

35:23.480 --> 35:24.200
Let's do it in 30.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.480
18 terms in 30 seconds.

35:25.480 --> 35:27.480
Meaning each are responsible for six, ready?

35:27.480 --> 35:28.480
Okay.

35:28.480 --> 35:29.480
But what if we say the same ones?

35:31.160 --> 35:31.880
Those don't count.

35:31.880 --> 35:32.600
No duplicates.

35:32.600 --> 35:33.480
That's kind of the challenge.

35:33.480 --> 35:35.000
Okay, so we'll go around like this.

35:35.000 --> 35:35.320
Okay.

35:35.320 --> 35:36.120
I'll start, ready?

35:36.120 --> 35:36.360
All right.

35:36.360 --> 35:36.840
Well, hang on.

35:36.840 --> 35:39.480
Let's get our, uh, uh, let's get our ducks out.

35:40.280 --> 35:40.680
Hour.

35:41.480 --> 35:42.680
My ducks aren't all at yours.

35:44.680 --> 35:45.160
I think so.

35:46.520 --> 35:46.920
Okay.

35:47.560 --> 35:52.920
Is there makeup all over my face from crying?

35:54.920 --> 35:55.640
I'm sorry.

35:55.640 --> 35:58.680
Is there makeup all over my face from crying?

35:58.680 --> 35:59.080
Waffing?

35:59.080 --> 35:59.480
Oh, no.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.880
I was, tears.

36:01.880 --> 36:02.760
All right, ready?

36:02.760 --> 36:03.160
Yep.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.360
30 seconds in the board.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.600
Three, two, one.

36:06.600 --> 36:07.320
Nashka!

36:08.280 --> 36:09.160
Cavities.

36:09.560 --> 36:10.760
Gum recession.

36:10.760 --> 36:11.640
Rocksism.

36:12.440 --> 36:13.480
Kanker source.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.000
Plack.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.040
Hallitosis.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.040
Gumb disease.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.560
Rook, rook, rook, now.

36:25.560 --> 36:30.600
What's the one where you have the little stuff in your tonsils?

36:30.600 --> 36:32.040
I can't hear tonsils, tonsils, tonsils.

36:32.040 --> 36:33.000
How many have you gotten?

36:33.000 --> 36:34.360
I can't really read them, sorry.

36:34.360 --> 36:34.920
I'm total.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.040
Paper cut on your tongue.

36:38.040 --> 36:38.680
What?

36:38.680 --> 36:39.640
Paper cut on your tongue?

36:39.640 --> 36:40.440
Paper cut?

36:40.440 --> 36:41.000
Yeah.

36:41.000 --> 36:41.880
Kanker source.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.360
Uh, your, your two falls out.

36:45.240 --> 36:45.800
That's good.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.800
Um, you need a crown.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.480
Oh, yeah, crown or screw?

36:49.480 --> 36:50.040
It's over.

36:50.040 --> 36:50.600
That was it.

36:50.600 --> 36:51.400
Uh, two.

36:51.400 --> 36:51.800
You get nine.

36:52.520 --> 36:53.560
Uh, we got 10.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.640
We got 18, we hit it.

36:55.640 --> 36:56.280
I think we got 18.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.480
I think we got 18.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.320
I think we got 18 because we said Kanker source twice.

36:59.320 --> 36:59.800
That's right.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.080
So, that doesn't make sense.

37:01.080 --> 37:02.360
That doesn't make sense on your hands.

37:02.360 --> 37:03.080
On your, you had five.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.520
No, I just, you didn't see them here.

37:04.520 --> 37:05.160
I'm really didn't know.

37:05.160 --> 37:06.280
I don't raise toes.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.760
No, like down here, my head won't hand down.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.880
I had four on your head five, and then Amelia had nine.

37:12.840 --> 37:13.400
No way.

37:13.400 --> 37:14.280
Yeah, true.

37:14.280 --> 37:14.920
That's what happened.

37:14.920 --> 37:15.800
The tapes.

37:15.800 --> 37:16.760
It's being recorded.

37:17.640 --> 37:18.600
Grace run it back.

37:18.600 --> 37:19.560
And it's being recorded.

37:19.560 --> 37:20.760
If you're watching this on YouTube.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.360
And you're going to jail.

37:22.360 --> 37:23.160
Where's our Nash?

37:24.760 --> 37:26.280
You owe us five, Dad.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.120
Um, oh, yeah, okay.

37:35.400 --> 37:37.800
Up the sound of his grinding.

37:37.800 --> 37:38.600
Really proud.

37:38.600 --> 37:39.320
Oh, it's like horrible.

37:39.640 --> 37:42.840
Oh, it's awful, awful, horrific.

37:44.040 --> 37:44.840
You hear that?

37:44.840 --> 37:46.280
Yeah, oh, yeah, I'm listening.

37:46.280 --> 37:47.000
Disgusting.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.280
You know that there's at least one guy jerking off to that.

37:50.280 --> 37:53.000
You guys put my health at risk,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.480
dentally, and I'll never forget that.

37:55.480 --> 37:56.520
Dental dams.

37:56.520 --> 37:57.240
That's one more.

37:57.880 --> 37:58.680
Yeah.

37:58.680 --> 37:59.880
Is that a, yeah.

37:59.880 --> 38:00.680
Dental thing.

38:02.120 --> 38:03.640
That's the word dental, right in it.

38:04.280 --> 38:09.960
What is this one?

38:09.960 --> 38:11.640
And we're back as a TikTok song.

38:11.640 --> 38:12.760
Here's what we're going to do next to me.

38:12.760 --> 38:14.040
Who's the most famous person in your phone?

38:16.040 --> 38:17.080
Ben shorts.

38:17.080 --> 38:18.760
That's can't be the most famous person.

38:21.320 --> 38:22.040

38:23.880 --> 38:24.760
Call on a who that is.

38:25.880 --> 38:26.760

38:26.760 --> 38:27.560
Yeah.

38:27.560 --> 38:28.360

38:28.360 --> 38:29.000
Call Ben.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.640
He's in the UK.

38:31.640 --> 38:32.520
Okay, call Rick.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.000
It's supposed to be yours.

38:35.000 --> 38:35.800
Who's the next most famous?

38:36.840 --> 38:37.560
Jake.

38:37.560 --> 38:38.040
Call Jake.

38:38.920 --> 38:39.720
Call Jake up.

38:41.240 --> 38:41.640
Harwoods?

38:42.920 --> 38:44.040
Call Jake, Harwoods.

38:44.040 --> 38:44.680
Call Jake.

38:44.680 --> 38:45.320
Harwoods.

38:47.480 --> 38:51.480
He might be doing like bath time for himself.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.280
Bath time can wait.

38:53.880 --> 38:54.360
Gemma.

39:03.640 --> 39:10.600
Hey, Jake, leave a message.

39:11.800 --> 39:15.800
Hey, I'm on the headgum podcast and Jeff wanted me to do this.

39:18.360 --> 39:19.720
Not quite a message.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.320
Yes, it was.

39:22.920 --> 39:23.960
What was the message?

39:23.960 --> 39:25.960
You were in prison here.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.640
After Jake, who's the most famous person in your phone?

39:31.560 --> 39:32.200
God.

39:32.280 --> 39:33.160
I mean me.

39:33.160 --> 39:34.040
Onya?

39:34.040 --> 39:34.440
Call her.

39:36.280 --> 39:37.880
You're not listening to me at all.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.160
I'm not listening to you at all.

39:41.160 --> 39:45.240
All right, you really want me to call the most the fourth most famous person I've owned.

39:45.240 --> 39:46.120
You said it was on you.

39:46.120 --> 39:46.600
Call on you.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.560
Taylor Joy.

39:49.560 --> 39:49.960
Yes.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.360
Hey, you've reached your prison.

39:54.360 --> 39:56.120
I'm unable to come to the phone right now.

39:56.120 --> 39:58.200
But if you leave a message with your name, then you

39:58.360 --> 39:59.720
I'll get a few to the account.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.560
Hey, sounds awful.

40:01.560 --> 40:02.440
Hey, Jeff, it's me.

40:04.280 --> 40:05.400
Call me back when you get a chance.

40:06.600 --> 40:10.520
Well, I leave a message because there wasn't any messages in there.

40:10.520 --> 40:11.720
The message was calling me back.

40:13.560 --> 40:14.440
That is a message.

40:15.160 --> 40:17.000
Just want to let you know to hit me back.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.040
Just chat.

40:18.040 --> 40:18.760
Truly yours.

40:18.760 --> 40:19.560
You're biggest fan.

40:19.560 --> 40:20.120
This is me.

40:21.400 --> 40:24.920
The weird thing is, um, so I'm an M reference.

40:24.920 --> 40:25.320
Correct.

40:25.320 --> 40:25.880
Okay.

40:25.880 --> 40:26.680
Next most famous.

40:27.320 --> 40:27.800
Eminem.

40:28.840 --> 40:29.800
Nick Wager.

40:29.800 --> 40:30.440
Call him.

40:31.480 --> 40:32.280
No, he was just here.

40:32.280 --> 40:33.080
He's busy.

40:33.080 --> 40:33.480
All right.

40:33.480 --> 40:34.200
Next most famous.

40:36.200 --> 40:39.160
What's the goal of the game for me to call someone

40:39.160 --> 40:40.920
to them to pick up and then what?

40:40.920 --> 40:42.760
We kind of have another guest on the show.

40:42.760 --> 40:46.360
I, you know, at the real owners of this was was like,

40:46.360 --> 40:47.800
let's get a fucking clip.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.200
Let's get a social clip.

40:50.200 --> 40:51.720
So maybe we don't need the call.

40:51.720 --> 40:54.280
But we have to put the four of our heads together and be like,

40:54.280 --> 40:55.720
what's going to go viral?

40:55.800 --> 41:00.920
We've never used a clip from this show and made like a vertical video

41:00.920 --> 41:01.960
asset out of it.

41:01.960 --> 41:05.240
And we, it's because we haven't done what we're doing right now,

41:05.240 --> 41:09.480
which is gaming the system forcing something that's viral.

41:09.480 --> 41:10.440
Exactly right.

41:11.880 --> 41:13.080
You should call Jake Johnson.

41:13.080 --> 41:13.800
I don't know.

41:13.800 --> 41:14.440
I'll take this one number.

41:15.160 --> 41:15.880
No idea.

41:15.880 --> 41:18.040
Google me, you should ask,

41:18.040 --> 41:19.400
on you with the most famous person.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.240
On you, who's the most famous person?

41:21.240 --> 41:22.280
Jake Johnson.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.080
Call him.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.040
Please busy.

41:24.040 --> 41:25.080
Who's the next most famous?

41:26.360 --> 41:27.080
What?

41:29.080 --> 41:30.120
I'm going to just do this all day.

41:30.120 --> 41:30.200
I'm going to just do this all day.

41:30.200 --> 41:31.320
I'm going to just do this all day.

41:31.320 --> 41:31.960
Yeah.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.720
Well, he, he's,

41:33.720 --> 41:35.320
what if he picked you up?

41:35.320 --> 41:37.640
And then he fucking ghosted me.

41:37.640 --> 41:38.360
That'd be crazy.

41:38.360 --> 41:39.000
That'd be crazy.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.760
I think if I like to call Jake,

41:40.760 --> 41:42.760
which either of them.

41:42.760 --> 41:43.160
Okay.

41:43.160 --> 41:43.800
You know what?

41:43.800 --> 41:44.600
And it's the goal too.

41:44.600 --> 41:45.640
Who's the next most famous?

41:46.840 --> 41:47.640
Mike Mitchell.

41:47.640 --> 41:48.280
Call him.

41:48.280 --> 41:49.240
Right.

41:50.680 --> 41:52.520
So why grew you didn't want to bother?

41:52.520 --> 41:54.200
Mitch, you also was just here.

41:54.280 --> 41:56.680
Well, Mitch, you have the Massachusetts connection.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.600
Yeah, you're allowed to bother people from Massachusetts.

41:58.600 --> 42:00.120
So you're also from Massachusetts.

42:00.120 --> 42:02.040
South, they bother us.

42:02.040 --> 42:03.080
He's not going to like this.

42:03.080 --> 42:05.480
He's not going to, I don't think he's not going to like this.

42:05.480 --> 42:07.160
He's going to like, oh, hi.

42:07.160 --> 42:08.440
Also, you don't have to call Mitch.

42:08.440 --> 42:08.840
He'll be back.

42:08.840 --> 42:09.480
I'm not going to.

42:09.480 --> 42:09.640
Okay.

42:09.640 --> 42:10.840
Who's the next most famous person?

42:10.840 --> 42:12.040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.600
I feel like we barely got to do the job.

42:14.600 --> 42:15.240
Just come, shall.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.400
Let's go back to that.

42:17.400 --> 42:18.200
That's mine.

42:18.200 --> 42:21.000
Let's go back to talking about you.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.600
Whatever you want to talk about diversity.

42:22.600 --> 42:23.640
Let's circle back.

42:23.640 --> 42:25.320
I don't think we should include that.

42:25.320 --> 42:26.600
Nice.

42:26.600 --> 42:29.480
Amelia, who would you say is the most famous person in your phone?

42:29.480 --> 42:30.840
Just for the social clip.

42:30.840 --> 42:32.040
Don't worry about it.

42:32.040 --> 42:32.840
That's awesome.

42:32.840 --> 42:33.640
On your business.

42:33.640 --> 42:34.040
She fucks up.

42:34.040 --> 42:34.840
On your business.

42:34.840 --> 42:35.960
It's Dan Reno.

42:35.960 --> 42:37.800
It's hard pop up.

42:43.160 --> 42:44.200
Guess what?

42:44.280 --> 42:45.480
Amelia's dad's name is.

42:46.520 --> 42:47.240
You guess.

42:47.240 --> 42:47.960
10 Amelia.

42:47.960 --> 42:49.160
You have five guesses.

42:49.160 --> 42:49.960
10.

42:49.960 --> 42:51.240
No.

42:51.240 --> 42:51.800
Sam?

42:51.800 --> 42:53.320
No.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.280
Short for Sanford.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.400
Don't think that that's not a person.

42:57.800 --> 42:58.360
Traveling?

42:58.360 --> 42:58.520
No.

43:01.960 --> 43:02.840
Bo?

43:02.840 --> 43:04.360
No.

43:04.360 --> 43:05.080
Onya.

43:05.080 --> 43:05.800
No.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.800
Tony Zero.

43:07.800 --> 43:08.840
It's Scorpion.

43:10.840 --> 43:11.560
Can you believe?

43:12.520 --> 43:15.000
Your dad's name is Scorpion Marino.

43:15.000 --> 43:15.800
Yeah.

43:15.800 --> 43:16.600
No.

43:16.600 --> 43:17.800
No.

43:17.800 --> 43:18.600
Wait.

43:18.600 --> 43:19.640
That's three.

43:19.640 --> 43:20.600
What do you mean?

43:20.600 --> 43:21.720
I heard he's in my phone.

43:21.720 --> 43:22.680
It's Scorpion.

43:22.680 --> 43:23.000
OK.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.680
So it's just what he's isn't your phone.

43:25.320 --> 43:26.120
Well, I mean, no.

43:26.120 --> 43:27.480
He came home one day and was like,

43:27.480 --> 43:29.000
I go by Scorpion now.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.200
So then we all leave.

43:30.200 --> 43:33.480
Legally or just like socially, I guess.

43:33.480 --> 43:36.440
Oh, what's his real name?

43:36.440 --> 43:38.440
A letter to you.

43:38.440 --> 43:39.160
Oh, I'm really glad.

43:39.160 --> 43:39.800
He's Leonard.

43:40.760 --> 43:41.800
He wants to go by Scorpion.

43:41.800 --> 43:44.840
Yeah, he came home with a giant scorpion tattoo on his hand.

43:44.840 --> 43:45.800
And when was his birthday?

43:45.800 --> 43:47.400
And vice versa.

43:47.400 --> 43:48.600
Yeah, he's a Scorpio.

43:48.600 --> 43:49.400
Just remember.

43:49.400 --> 43:49.960
Yeah.

43:49.960 --> 43:51.160
Remember what?

43:51.160 --> 43:51.800
Second.

43:51.800 --> 43:53.080
We got a figure this shit out.

43:53.080 --> 43:55.160
Because I feel like we didn't quite get a social clip.

43:55.160 --> 43:56.920
And that was my only goal from this episode.

43:56.920 --> 43:59.720
Really us naming incredibly famous people that we

43:59.720 --> 44:00.520
call this.

44:00.520 --> 44:03.720
I think it's one you said challenge.

44:03.720 --> 44:04.920
That was good because we're all laughing.

44:04.920 --> 44:06.040
Yeah, because I don't do well.

44:06.040 --> 44:07.640
The social clip doesn't mean to be as laughing.

44:07.640 --> 44:09.720
And that's to be us, like teaching people shit.

44:09.720 --> 44:11.960
Yeah, how to say the word challenge?

44:13.960 --> 44:17.800
I guess learning what not to do is also valuable in terms of it.

44:17.800 --> 44:19.640
It's the do's and don't say challenge.

44:20.440 --> 44:22.040
It's the challenge challenge.

44:22.040 --> 44:23.800
It's the challenge challenge.

44:24.840 --> 44:26.040
See who could say the word.

44:26.040 --> 44:27.640
So you can say the word challenge.

44:29.480 --> 44:31.000
Plugs, what do you guys have going on?

44:31.000 --> 44:33.240
How long was that?

44:33.240 --> 44:34.040
45.

44:34.040 --> 44:34.600
No way.

44:34.600 --> 44:35.240
45.

44:36.200 --> 44:37.000
47 actually.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.640
I just, um, most guys don't really work.

44:39.640 --> 44:40.840
So I'm sorry, this was your first one.

44:40.840 --> 44:42.280
Amelia, but I thought it went really well.

44:42.280 --> 44:44.280
I'm honored to be a part of the filler episode.

44:44.280 --> 44:45.480
Just come on another time.

44:45.480 --> 44:47.080
I just have to come on another time.

44:47.080 --> 44:48.120
Ideally, the two of that episode.

44:48.920 --> 44:49.960
Oh, yeah, what do we do for that?

44:49.960 --> 44:51.320
Yeah, I'm a secret.

44:52.120 --> 44:52.920
So it is a secret.

44:52.920 --> 44:53.480
You haven't told them.

44:54.440 --> 44:55.400
I've told him.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.560
I haven't told everybody else who's listening.

45:00.280 --> 45:03.640

45:03.800 --> 45:06.200

45:06.200 --> 45:07.080
And that's all I have.

45:07.080 --> 45:07.800

45:07.800 --> 45:10.760

Yeah.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.720
It's all video.

45:50.440 --> 45:51.800
They haven't asked me to be on weirdly.

45:51.800 --> 45:52.440
They don't want me on.

45:53.080 --> 45:53.640

46:33.000 --> 46:36.600
squatted on a mirror doesn't use the account ever, we can give it to you.

46:36.600 --> 46:39.160
And like, some person squatted on the name.

46:39.160 --> 46:40.200
Like, it was amazing.

46:40.200 --> 46:41.000
Didn't use it for, yeah.

46:42.360 --> 46:43.320
And they like, that's what I mean.

46:43.320 --> 46:44.840
He didn't respond to like, he just had it.

46:44.840 --> 46:47.720
Can they help me get skinmark on Instagram?

46:47.720 --> 46:48.840

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
music

00:48.000 --> 00:49.080
I'm going to stop the video.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.520
We're going to be audio only for a second.

00:50.520 --> 00:51.520
It's so unreal.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.720
I don't even have way to stop the video.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.560
If we can't hear ourselves, does that mean that our levels are set?

00:56.560 --> 00:57.560
Right.

00:57.560 --> 00:58.560
Your levels are great.

00:58.560 --> 01:03.000
You guys are coming through in stereo just so good to me.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Good what?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Well, the audio is good.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.400
Good set of videos running.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.400
No way.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.400
Really?

01:09.400 --> 01:11.000
I would never cheat you with that reference.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.640
Well, because I saw this video that was like about how Obama can give someone four

01:14.640 --> 01:17.000
compliments in 10 seconds.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
One of the compliments is like treating the person as a higher up because it kind of

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
puts one second.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Sure.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
So you're treating who is it?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Did you text?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I did just get a text.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Got it.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
So your computer is picking up all the sound effects that are built into

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
the video.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
And what I'll do is I'll do, do not disturb.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
And we should say that people are not seeing any video right now.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Even on YouTube.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Why?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Because I need to clear space on the SSD.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
And so do you.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
What you showed did not do for me?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
I see.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
So it's not being recorded video wise yet.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
It was and now will not be.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Okay.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
For a couple minutes.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Well, you're probably in record of log style.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
No, well, what I'm going to do.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Okay.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
So you want me to like.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yes.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
You pull out your phone and that will be the video to have.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Okay.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
While you're clearing the space vertical.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Why vertical, right?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Because it has to be on YouTube.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Because like that's the premium property.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
There we go.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
So we're mostly seeing Ali and Miles.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
We should also say that we even have Miles on the show.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Today on the show.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
One second.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
It's one of those shows where like the host's talk before the guests.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
You've been talking a lot.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Also, Ali hasn't said anything.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Really, you shouldn't choose Ali.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Please welcome the show, Ali Khan.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Still no video there, right?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
No video yet.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Just a little bit.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Just a little bit.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Like can we get rid of this factually thing?

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
I know we can get rid of the heavy and podcast episode that came out today.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
You're just deleting files that might be neat.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
I might have just deleted.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Yeah.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
They last the factually episode that just really cool.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Because I just, by the way, I tuned this morning.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
I said you pushed an episode.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Sure.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Came of my YouTube Algo.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Okay.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
You're on there.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
And people were complaining that.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
So we're being deleted.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Things are not being recorded.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
And so now you're sort of carplunch.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Just deleting the hard drive.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Just thinking.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I really don't know what to delete.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
What's going on?

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
I just cleared space and now it's saying we still only have six minutes.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I actually wanted to cut you off there.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Did you?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Did you have to do a trash?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Because if you put something in the trash,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
that doesn't mean that it's gone.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
And so what you need is just sort of take a deep breath.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Realize who you are and what you're up to.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
What's happening is that on the drive.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
There is no longer the headgum podcast episode from Tuesday.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
That came out today.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
But did you empty the trash?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Well, it's now it's just in the trash on my left.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Yes.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Which doesn't matter.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Oh, we heard it.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
But you.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
So when the drive is plugged in.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Sure.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
While the drive is plugged in, if you empty the trash.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Okay.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Technically, the drive has a trash.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
All right.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
This says, if I were you ads.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Is that fine?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
I would keep those just because they might not have been released yet.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
All right.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
And then this says.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Yeah.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
It's interesting.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
So you have ads that are coming out on the show that does not release.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
So in the back catalog.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Back catalog.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
And what we're going to try now is that there's another drive.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
And we're going to see what.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
One second.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Sure.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
This is all pre-production that should have been handled.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Way, way, way before we got here, let alone started recording.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
In fact, we had a little bit of time where we were chitchatting.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
We're sort of enjoying our conversation.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
For example.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
For example.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Let me cut you off.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Yeah.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Jeff said, let's get into.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Let's go save it.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Let's go save it.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Let's go.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
He rushed us into this room that wasn't built yet.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Yeah.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
You rushed us to get here.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
And there is no here here.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Well, because I don't want to waste your guys' time.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
But you have.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
You this is wasting your time.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
I'm wasting the list.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
No, it's getting recorded.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
This is all going in the episode.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
So it's not wasted time.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Okay.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Well, going off of what Jeff said earlier,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Andre, the giant used to call everybody the boss.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Used to say, hey, boss.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
That's a quick one compliment.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
She's a deafening loudness that's ever been.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I'm wondering if I can sort of just have the headphones here.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Sure.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
I can probably hear it from your headphones.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Yeah.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
What I have to let you guys know is that we were fine the whole time.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
What?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I interpreted it.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
No.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
What I interpreted as.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Was the secret?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
No.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Was six hours.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Was six hours.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
A free disk space.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Okay.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
So have you never, and I don't know how this company runs.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
But if you never done sort of a, someone says, hey, Jeff,

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
here's how the things work.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Yeah.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm also realizing is that miles is off camera on all three of these cameras.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
What we're going to need is that.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I'm going to need to just hang on.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
We have the vlog.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
We have this one going still, but I might have to end it right now because we don't

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
need it anymore.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
I don't want to take up the space, right?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Sure.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
So it's been recording this whole time.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
What you guys aren't failing to understand is that we are good to go.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Okay.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Y'all are still.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Sorry.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
We'll just go over.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Yeah.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
I like kind of.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
The wireless keyboard, and yeah, ultimately the audition session as well.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
What we're going to need to do is.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Well, no, because then.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
What the fuck's the whole thing out?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
We put it on camera.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
No, you're, you're not on any camera.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Right.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
You said over here.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
You come the vlog on my phone, which is often.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Which is off now and not a good frame to be in.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
But what if you move that camera over a little bit?

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
What I'm going to do in mere seconds when you guys wax a bunch of

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
yourselves is I'm going to shift this camera towards miles.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Just the why?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
No.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Also, this is a fucking single.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
The double.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Right.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
So that's a single on alley right now.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Right.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Now that is ultimately a close up on alley with a little bit of it's dirty on

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
miles.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Yeah.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
It is dirty on miles.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
And on the, the, the love seat that I'm on.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Are we getting a two shot of me sitting next to it?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
So let me go to that one.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
That's going to be a lot of him.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
That's going to be out of the miles.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
You're sitting here.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Right.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Go over there.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Well, do you, be my guest?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Be my guest.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
See if the microphone's even on.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
This microphone's on because you told me, I didn't even need to hear myself.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Yeah.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
I didn't even need to hear.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
And I actually had headphones this year.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
I actually came into your studio.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
And I said, can I hear myself?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
And you said, you don't need to hear yourself.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Can I hear myself?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Think?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Thank God.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
What else is here?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
What do you mean?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
What is your producer?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
What if I was Jake Johnson?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
What if I was in the amateur hour?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Or is it Tomek?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
You would have rolled his eyes and walked out.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
If you think that I wouldn't have shown up in our half early to Tome.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
What?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
What?

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
So you think that my time is not as important as restaurant to a nice.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Your time is objectively not as important as Marika Tomek.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
That's really nice.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
That's just a combination of two different names that don't have anything to do with each other.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
What we are going to need to do is I'm going to need to fix the camera.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
And you want me to move.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Ali, why don't you talk about dating in LA while I affect these cameras?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Unbelievable.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
And so I shouldn't be moving.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Let me just.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Seems like he's going to move.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
He's going to move the camera.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
It's all you have.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Okay.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I was off the grid for a couple months now.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
I'm back on the grid.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
So far it's not going well.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Grid wise.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
That's yeah.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
That's about that's my dating update.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
That was.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
App wise.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I took a couple months off and it was like what if I just

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
meet someone out in the wild or

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
ganically old school?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
That's preferred.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
I don't mean to cut you off.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
I just want to let you guys know that I'm going to have to stand up.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
And affect the other cameras.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
You said that.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Okay.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
And long story short.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
I didn't meet anybody.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
You didn't go any dates.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
No.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
I didn't meet anybody out in the wild.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
To know I'm back on the apps.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Doing chitchat fodder.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
I actually do a lot of people ask me questions about this on my show.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Really?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Perfect person.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Huge shout out.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
You might as well plug it now.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Because Jeff love even get to it.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
We might even have audio at the end.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Exactly.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
We're currently.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
We're creating towards a cliff.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
It's like we have about four.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
We should get it all done at about six minutes of

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Fayette footage space six hours.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Yeah.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Who knows right.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
I have to tell people if they have an interest to go to the location where that interest is.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
And then that's how you maybe meet somebody which like if you take all of L.A.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
And you boil it down to like your geolocation.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Percent is why you probably have less in common than if you're like I like

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Dice and you go to a Dungeons and Dragons store.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
No totally.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I ran it to yesterday out in the wild.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
That's true.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Organic.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
That's never happened to us before.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Clear way.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Clear way.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Yeah.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Crazy.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I was.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
It was after work.

09:15.000 --> 09:23.000
And I was getting a burrito by the Mexican food pop up stand in front of the grocery store by my house.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
And it's gonna stand that's like permanently there permanently there.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
You got to wonder what the legality of that.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Yeah.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
I'm not sure, but it is my favorite.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
It's really great.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
It's really good.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I agree all the way in Hollywood.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Well, that's what I thought was confusing.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
It was because all of a sudden I look and I see a mirror of a tall and then two of their

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
other friends there.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Famous?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
No.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Okay.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
And I was just like this is so strange.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
And also I just want to note like my outfit was like postwork.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
I like walked there feeling very confident that I wouldn't see anybody that I know.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
So I was just like Christmas.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Yeah.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
I was wearing like a red sweatshirt, bright green pants.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
Like I was very sure I wasn't gonna see anybody and then I see a mirror.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Like laundry day clothing.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Like I was not prepared for a run-in.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
And then I was like, oh, I was like, this is so weird that you're here.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I'm getting food here at the stand.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
I got a burrito.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
And then she said we're getting food.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
And I that stopped at the point of my brain.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
And I was like, that's so weird that you'd come all the way to my neighborhood.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
This burrito.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
To real, to go to the stand in front of the grocery store by my house.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
So I can't believe that the word spread.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
That's amazing.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
And then I was like, no, we're like walking to a restaurant.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Yeah.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
We're going to a ramen place nearby that stand.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Yeah.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Although the stand was probably better.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
It's all great.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
And I mean, that made way more sense.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
I like was so I couldn't believe it.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
But yeah.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Wow.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Yeah.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
It's funny because after you recorded it for the last time, I ran into you five minutes later

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
at the Whole Foods.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Yeah.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Imagine recording a podcast.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
And then five minutes later running into that first.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Yeah.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
It was everywhere.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
I don't know.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
It was like, hey.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
That was my bond of the week.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Because we were having so much fun.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
We were like, I feel like, actually, it was funny.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
It was funny.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
It was funny.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
It was like a good time talking.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Yeah.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
See?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
It didn't even seem like it was slowing down either.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
No.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
We were ramping up.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Yeah.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
It was getting good.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Don.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Murray.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Saltis.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Oh.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Um.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Who is that?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Glad you asked.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Um.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
That's probably.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
It's probably.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
I don't know.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Yeah.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Yeah.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Why not?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Whatever.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
It doesn't matter.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I'm going to go Addison Ray.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
And sort of a bond girl became bond.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Yeah.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I'm going to go Mandi Patinken.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
That is really good, actually.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Like a retiree.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Like sort of a Logan style.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Um.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Next man.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
But make it clear.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Mm-hm.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Let's go back to you guys running into that.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Yeah.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Yeah.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
I'm going to go Mandi Patinken.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
That is really good, actually.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Like a retiree.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Mm-hm.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Let's go back to you guys running into each other.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I feel like that was.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Well, now a little bit more fun.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
I'm up again.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
That's where to get grinded us to a halt.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Now you're like, get back to 60 miles per hour.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
You know, that's not really how conversation works.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
That's how cars work though.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
They stop and start all the time and nobody complains about it.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
But you start getting a little car sick when it's like so fast.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
So slow and fast.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
So fast.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
So fast.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
By the way, you have a question for you, Jeff.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Um.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Oh, God.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I guess I was just wondering.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
If you could explain to me just sort of the year that trembled,

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
you played Phil.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
What's that?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
This is sort of like, I guess I just had a couple.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
This is Jeff's resume.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
This is Zach after I fully email full website.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Where did you get that?

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Just Google.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Like this was sort of just available for me.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Yeah, but that's like a really old resume.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Well, I just was curious that you put your high school theatre

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
productions on it.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Right.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Because that's like, that's I think the first resume I ever made.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Yeah.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
So you thought that like I'm a casting director.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Can you show that to the camera?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Yeah.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
So this is Jeff.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Yeah.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
I'm looking at this.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I didn't help you do any of this.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Were you tag after at the time?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Yeah.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
I've been done only high school musicals.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I did lonely and horny.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
That's on there.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
That wasn't.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
So it was.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Oh, yes.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Yeah.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Supporting.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Yeah.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Lonely and horny.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And then I did the hosting job with college humor, right?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Yeah.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
I don't think that's even on.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Head gum live is on there.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Beat the queue is on there.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Yeah.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
That's how I got into sag was lonely and horny and beat the queue.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Jesus.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
So basically I'm here got you into sag.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Yeah.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
I didn't even know I was in sag.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I can't believe you're in it because of me.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
You might not be in sag.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
But it was a sag production.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
You listed three six high school theatre credits.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Ooh.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
What are they?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Six.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
It will.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
He played.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
The year that troubled we should say, by the way, was a really, really bad play.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Yeah.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
About a local guy in.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Kyohoga Falls, a rid of her.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
About the Vietnam War and drafting anxiety.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Mm.

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
I was depressed that semester because every night I had to cry over my dead body from

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Vietnam in player of the store.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Six to nine PM.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
And I'm having to like,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
induced ears.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
About a veteran.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
I guess.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
So you're just a six.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
You're not ready to lie.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Yeah.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Yeah.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
You're like going home to play video games or whatever.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
To do homework.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Okay.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
All right.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
I guess.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Yeah.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
But yeah.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I just thought it like, I guess what, what did you feel that a casting director

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
would be impressed by to see on the resume.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Theatre wise high school style.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Right.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
So what you have to understand is that I had no idea what they wanted to see.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Right.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
How would I, when I was, I think, 19.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Oh, you would move to LA.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Sure.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
How are you, like, you had an understanding that like the stuff you didn't

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
had to go probably didn't matter.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Yeah.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Because, but you didn't do any other theater.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
So why don't you look at that and then take that whole section off.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
And then tell me whether or not it would be too far.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
It would be too far.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
It would be just fine.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
You wouldn't film it.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Even.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Yeah.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
It's borderline, Lauren.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
It's some dummy tech.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Exactly.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Yeah.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Is it even a resume without the high school theater credits?

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Well, I guess I also have a couple of concerns.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
Oh, he accents listed.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Okay.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Let's just say Brooklyn Indian.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
What British.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
What is that?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Well, let's go one by one.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Yeah, Brooklyn, I guess.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Okay.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
I took a dialect class to do Brooklyn,

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
he's.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
He took a dialect class in high school.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
In high school for one of the theater productions you're talking about.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Okay.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
What's the next one?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
In high school for one of the theater productions you're talking about.

15:50.000 --> 15:50.500
Okay.

15:50.500 --> 15:58.100
Indian. I don't know. I got me lost that. I used to be able to do it. Yeah, maybe a little offensive too

15:58.100 --> 16:03.380
I think yeah, the East Indian accent that I knew how to do was just like a poo

16:03.940 --> 16:06.660
God yeah, and you were yeah, and you thought

16:08.500 --> 16:11.140
I think you know if you if I can't do it who can

16:12.020 --> 16:15.620
In terms of like yeah brown paper bag testing it and British

16:16.340 --> 16:18.340
Of course

16:18.340 --> 16:20.900
Sounded like the Brooklyn one again

16:22.900 --> 16:24.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah

16:27.140 --> 16:32.260
I feel like that's what you sound like normal. Yeah, you know this accent's looked good on a resume

16:32.260 --> 16:38.420
I thought oh, it doesn't matter whether you can do them or not well British is just right post and center underneath

16:38.420 --> 16:40.420
Right house in center

16:40.420 --> 16:42.420
You play the you of course

16:42.420 --> 16:43.420
Yeah

16:43.900 --> 16:48.460
I'm peaking and I'm seeing professional yo-yo player. You didn't know that about me? No

16:48.460 --> 16:54.140
Oh, that's not like a funny ad lib that you thought like oh he just gets funny like the like a casting director would be

16:54.620 --> 16:59.500
Casting for new girl. Yeah, they'd see professional yo-yo player and think like what a funny guy like he put

16:59.500 --> 17:03.820
Professional yo-yo. I've had some insane yo-yo videos on youtube really he's a teenager

17:05.180 --> 17:10.380
National competition level yo-yo. That's so cool. That's really cool never made a dime off of it

17:10.460 --> 17:14.860
So you can do the trick where you make like the string a triangle and then the the yo-yo goes

17:15.740 --> 17:17.740
Ally, that's child's play

17:25.340 --> 17:28.140
Rock the baby or something you get to a level

17:29.420 --> 17:33.900
Where you're gonna have names for the shits real you rake yeah, you make up your own

17:34.380 --> 17:39.900
Right, so we'll click the standard ones like walk the dog is a classic. Yeah, now it's not about standard ones

17:40.380 --> 17:48.220
I don't know that's like yeah, you guys go to like a professional dance recital right

17:49.420 --> 17:54.700
You're not seeing if someone can do up your wet, you know what I mean. Yeah, it's like

17:56.780 --> 18:00.940
Yeah, he's like a whole routine so it's sort of

18:02.380 --> 18:04.220
Miles are you familiar with poetry and motion?

18:05.180 --> 18:07.180
um

18:08.620 --> 18:11.660
I don't know that was sort of my whole thing

18:13.100 --> 18:16.300
But with a children's play thing

18:17.340 --> 18:23.260
So you were doing sort of a live live theater man one man show you with the yo-yo

18:23.260 --> 18:26.700
Mike was that what's that you can ask but I was wondering how it started yeah

18:27.020 --> 18:29.020
Hmm

18:29.500 --> 18:34.300
Why are you looking at me? He said you can ask and then you didn't ask but he asked you a question first

18:34.300 --> 18:35.900
So I just thought you'd answer that and then I'd go

18:37.340 --> 18:44.220
What was the origin story you got a yo-yo for I saw this guy on the island show and it was incredible

18:45.020 --> 18:50.540
Yeah, two yo-yo is one of each and it was going like crazy on there. I mean they were going nuts middle-aged women were

18:51.180 --> 18:56.460
Fonding over this tween how old were you what's that how old were you when you watched that? Yeah

18:56.940 --> 19:02.540
I was probably like 10 and then you're like can I get a yo-yo to your parents correct

19:03.660 --> 19:07.100
Yeah, that was before you were playing Joe Pendleton and heaven can wait

19:12.060 --> 19:14.060
Here's before yeah

19:17.260 --> 19:23.580
I get some muscle like you can yo-yo really well sure. I'm surprised that you have a skill that you haven't

19:24.540 --> 19:27.180
Used for content make-up stocks you haven't

19:29.020 --> 19:36.380
We did a whole sketch we did a Jeffrey the dumbass yo-yo episode it was one of the first ones we ever did you really time to bring it back

19:36.380 --> 19:38.380
Yeah, I just think it would be good tiktok

19:39.740 --> 19:44.540
There are a bunch of yo-yoers that are famous on tiktok now and they're all people that I knew from the

19:44.540 --> 19:49.820

German accent

21:40.220 --> 21:45.740
The last time I yo-yoed in general or like competitively in general like the last time you went

21:46.620 --> 21:48.620
Oh, here's a good story actually

21:49.180 --> 21:52.940
I did an episode of the the that CBS sitcom the neighborhood

21:53.580 --> 21:59.660
And they had who is the oh god what's the case Marks and Drowsky was the director and he's apparently I I didn't know who he was

21:59.660 --> 22:04.140
But apparently he's this big time multi-cam director because there's only like four multi-cam directors in Hollywood

22:04.540 --> 22:08.380
And he did something because his last week of the show every season

22:08.380 --> 22:10.780
He does something called the syndrausky challenge

22:11.820 --> 22:18.860
Which is just a cast and crew talent show so it's like the whole the everyone who works on the show

22:19.820 --> 22:24.700
And the cast all brought in a talent and I had already wrapped but the AD was like

22:25.660 --> 22:29.580
We were doing a talent show tomorrow. You should come back and do something. Do you have a talent and I was like

22:30.300 --> 22:32.620
I used to yo-yo and he's like you have to do that

22:33.180 --> 22:37.820
So what's already wrapped like you already did a wrap for him. He's like this is really good for the talent show

22:37.820 --> 22:43.180
You already like wrapped like all right. That's a wrap on Jeff and he's it doesn't have to shoot anything anymore. Yeah

22:49.500 --> 22:51.500
Sometimes it's just like flops

22:51.980 --> 22:53.500
You know what I mean? I thought that was fun

22:53.500 --> 22:57.900
You remember like Ferris cut that out or whatever? Yeah, that's like an example of like

22:58.620 --> 23:06.220
I'm just gonna cut it out because it was like not I think it was fine. He was just saying something like double on tangerine

23:06.220 --> 23:10.300
Yeah, like it sort of like oh wouldn't it be funny if he wrapped instead

23:10.300 --> 23:16.780
He's finished. I had already wrapped but he's like come back and do it as a talent. Yeah, I'd finished the job got it

23:17.580 --> 23:18.940
And

23:18.940 --> 23:22.060
And you said not I want a yo-yo in front of all these strangers. That's not really fun

23:22.060 --> 23:25.740
I'm not gonna come back. I've already wrapped. I'm not gonna come back with a fucking yo-yo

23:27.260 --> 23:31.180
I said you know when and where to be were you close to anybody on the

23:31.180 --> 23:36.380
Were you close to anybody on the guest or were you just sort of a day player with like no connection

23:36.620 --> 23:40.620
And you're gonna come back and yo-yo for a group like gentleman Jeffrey who?

23:47.740 --> 23:49.740
People are going to crafty eating

23:51.020 --> 23:53.020
You actually had someone oh

23:53.020 --> 23:55.500
Sorry about that. It's fine. Just stop

23:56.860 --> 23:58.060
Um

23:58.060 --> 24:03.100
But that was the last time I yo-yo had was in the talent show and how you do third place. Wow. Yeah. Well, oh

24:03.420 --> 24:04.940
Did you can you do two at a time?

24:05.500 --> 24:09.820
I can but not impressive like impressive to you fuckers sure

24:10.300 --> 24:14.940
But not to the yo-yo community, right? I couldn't place at all in any competition

24:15.020 --> 24:19.340
But the fact you're like so much better than a non-yo-yo were sure even still yeah

24:19.900 --> 24:22.700
And you still have multiple yo-yo's at your house. I think I have three

24:23.340 --> 24:27.340
What kind of I have a yo-yo factory north star

24:27.980 --> 24:29.980
Jensen commit sort of

24:30.460 --> 24:31.980
Main stay

24:31.980 --> 24:33.420
I have a

24:33.420 --> 24:37.980
Caribulage yo-yo works something I forget what it's called and then I have a

24:39.020 --> 24:41.020
Plastic yo-yo that I

24:41.580 --> 24:44.060
Got for free in which to how much do they cost?

24:45.020 --> 24:45.980
They're like 80

24:47.020 --> 24:50.220
Is there like one that's considered the gold standard like a thousand dollar yo-yo?

24:50.220 --> 24:55.420
Is there like one skateboard that's the best to have? No, it's like how do you like to ride?

24:55.420 --> 24:58.860
How do you like to fucking throw? Yeah, so how do you like to throw?

24:59.340 --> 25:05.100
I like it to have a certain bounce to it, right? I like it to be a little bit counterweighted on both sides

25:05.100 --> 25:12.140
So that there's some stability in the dish that way when you're doing all these little fucking things with the string and the weight and then

25:12.140 --> 25:16.380
It's going all around either into their popping up and out. You're like jumping over the shit, right? Yeah

25:18.140 --> 25:21.340
I was under the impression that every yo-yo was five dollars

25:22.220 --> 25:26.860
Yes, I mean, did you say already? I wasn't really listening to 80 dollars 80 really

25:33.340 --> 25:38.140
Sorry that I didn't mean to hit and either those I meant to just do this

25:42.780 --> 25:47.340
But yeah, I got third place and then Max Greenfield came out to him. He was like

25:47.900 --> 25:50.620
He's smoke weed. Well, he asked Max

25:53.180 --> 25:56.540
While he was yo-yoing he actually got in the way

25:57.500 --> 26:03.100
I was walking the dog and he walked up to me. It hit his ankle. He boxed me out physically

26:04.300 --> 26:06.220
To see the last smoke weed

26:06.220 --> 26:11.660
Train as citizens arrest as like a performance enhancing drug why did he ask that like you want to get you in trouble

26:11.740 --> 26:16.380
No, he wanted to hang out. Well, no, he did not. No, he asked it in the way where it's like you smoke weed

26:16.380 --> 26:22.140
We should hang out really. Yeah, and you say you actually mean it. I also thought that gillian Jacobs was just in the lobby

26:22.140 --> 26:24.140
And I thought it was Beth Bears

26:24.380 --> 26:26.380
Who's also at the town show?

26:26.780 --> 26:29.260
What is this? I don't know who Beth Bears

26:36.380 --> 26:38.380
Beth Bears

26:39.020 --> 26:41.020
Okay

26:41.020 --> 26:43.020
Why bring that up now? Yeah, discuss

26:44.300 --> 26:50.220
It is the seventh week of the WGA strike. Did you get anything for third place?

26:51.020 --> 26:51.660
I

26:51.660 --> 26:55.100
Prize. Yeah, I guess Max Greenfield coming up to you is maybe the purpose

26:55.820 --> 27:01.100
I got this is true third place or first place the prize was a thousand dollars and you know

27:01.100 --> 27:05.900
My god, I made Aaron make up department with like eight people so they didn't end up leaving with that much

27:05.980 --> 27:09.100
They did like a whole coordinated dance to blow the whistle

27:12.140 --> 27:16.220
Was it good or was it like hey, let's fucking give it to it. It was like kind of really good

27:16.780 --> 27:18.780
They all wore fedoras and they were like

27:20.540 --> 27:27.500
And like everybody is like yeah into it. What was sad if you beat them and then the my thing was a 30 second nothing burger

27:27.900 --> 27:31.100
Second place I think was like some kind of health care benefit

27:31.420 --> 27:50.060
And then I got this sort of a plastic participation trophy. Nice. Yeah

27:51.740 --> 27:56.380

28:54.300 --> 28:59.180
I'll probably have him clean himself 14. That's old. You don't think like nine

29:07.740 --> 29:09.340
Asked an answered

29:09.340 --> 29:11.980

29:12.860 --> 29:19.580
Allie no, I like Allo. Allivara. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, do you have an allo plant in your home? No, but I you've

29:19.580 --> 29:21.580
Improved a sunburn

29:21.580 --> 29:26.060
So I'm familiar growing up. We had a lot out of my parents were really slicing it off and

29:26.620 --> 29:32.460
Doing the little squeeze thing on us. Yeah, I think my dad used to call me Allo vera is like a joke nickname when I was a baby

29:32.460 --> 29:35.420
It's good. Allie vera. Allie. Allo is cute. Yeah. That's good

29:36.300 --> 29:39.500
What's the name of your kid? Julian Julian. Hey, Jude

29:40.380 --> 29:41.740
Allie

29:41.740 --> 29:43.340
Julian. Sorry. I don't know if you miss her

29:44.780 --> 29:49.100
You've heard him me or but we call him Jude use sometimes. That's funny

29:49.180 --> 29:52.140
There's like baby Jude you have you taught him Jude you're on that beat

29:54.460 --> 29:56.460
No, but I think that's a great idea

29:56.460 --> 29:58.460
What if he becomes like a dick?

29:58.460 --> 30:01.420
So I've thought about this and I think that um he won't

30:02.540 --> 30:04.220
I actually met like a detective

30:04.940 --> 30:07.100
Because then it would be Jude you on that beat

30:09.740 --> 30:14.540
Oh like I guess it would be becomes like I'll probably be like hey like

30:15.500 --> 30:17.500
A lot of course it could be tricky

30:18.540 --> 30:22.140
Why I feel like I ask interesting questions

30:22.140 --> 30:25.580
But you know like one so quick because you guys don't give me anything

30:25.580 --> 30:29.660
I'm confused. I have a question do people call detectives a dick?

30:29.660 --> 30:33.020
Yeah small town dicks private eyes, you know private dick

30:33.020 --> 30:37.340
Scalded never heard of that dick Tracy well that I know but that's his name

30:38.220 --> 30:39.420
Interesting

30:39.500 --> 30:47.100
Can I we we had Hollywood handbook on this show on today's episode so last week when people are hearing this and I did

30:47.100 --> 30:49.900
One of my rice parodies and I feel like I didn't get anything from them

30:49.900 --> 30:52.540
You guys want to hear it. You thought that you would get

30:53.740 --> 30:57.100
Like a big reaction from those guys about your rice parodies

30:59.820 --> 31:01.820
Do you want to hear it

31:02.780 --> 31:06.780
Yeah, it just mind it ended and they gave him a standing up

31:06.780 --> 31:09.660
Yeah, like what if those guys really give it a big area

31:09.660 --> 31:13.660
But just drew us to absolutely want to stand and praise you

31:13.660 --> 31:14.860
Yeah

31:14.860 --> 31:17.180
So you don't want to hear it. I guess I do yeah

31:23.740 --> 31:26.220
Are you finding it or what?

31:27.180 --> 31:32.700
As we're loving up our casting oh, you're not going to be on the line. Why lost the lyrics because I deleted

31:32.700 --> 31:37.420
So you're trying to play the clip from last week or like is that not interesting?

31:37.820 --> 31:39.820
Well, yes

31:39.820 --> 31:42.460
You're scanning through the episode. Okay. Here we go

31:43.260 --> 31:45.260
Something that

31:46.460 --> 31:48.460
All right

31:52.460 --> 31:54.460
This is new

31:55.180 --> 31:57.180
There's something to get the energy out. Yeah

32:00.460 --> 32:02.220
I see you rise

32:02.220 --> 32:04.220
Consistency

32:05.180 --> 32:11.500
of sand when you're charting old grains. Oh, girl. You've got to scald

32:12.860 --> 32:17.580
Till the rice over cooks the poison will glob to my hands

32:18.780 --> 32:20.460
When you're burning the rice

32:21.260 --> 32:23.260
Cautorized grains. See your buzz

32:24.220 --> 32:26.220
Scalded

32:28.220 --> 32:30.460
Scraping up or stomp his right

32:31.020 --> 32:33.900
Yeah, like the idea of doing this at all is it feels

32:35.100 --> 32:37.580
People who are liking the story is sweet

32:38.860 --> 32:42.380
Not going to react at the same of the searing the

32:50.780 --> 32:53.020
Album coming well we've got

32:54.540 --> 32:56.940
rhythm of the rice we've got

32:58.220 --> 33:02.460
We're gonna fuck up some rice. We've got the rice all of the rice

33:03.260 --> 33:05.020
We've got

33:05.020 --> 33:11.740
Scalded rice, which is what this one was and then there's one more than I'm forgetting that might not have made the cut and I guess the like oh

33:11.820 --> 33:18.460
Rice burn so you latched onto this type of joke in brand how many years ago and you started

33:18.460 --> 33:22.540
Then milking it dry since by five five years too

33:23.020 --> 33:28.620
No, it's a free no rhythm of the rice was December 20 when did they exactly rice shirt come out

33:28.620 --> 33:31.580
That's the predecessor to that yeah, that was years and years ago

33:31.580 --> 33:33.580
This has been sort of playing the same drum

33:34.060 --> 33:39.580
Yeah, is the joke is just replacing the word right with the rice. Yeah, that's the whole but joke. That's rice

33:39.980 --> 33:45.580
That's it just for that shirt though because this one has like it's a little bit just been that over and over

33:45.580 --> 33:50.220
No, because this one had a layer cotterized grains seared thus

33:50.220 --> 33:53.660
I feel like that's sort of the natural evolution the elevation of

33:54.460 --> 33:58.300
Exactly rice, which yeah, it's just like rice instead of right but

33:58.700 --> 34:01.740
Cotterized grains seared thus. It's tell the whole story

34:02.780 --> 34:09.420
It's baby shoes never used yeah the saddest story in six words or less. Yeah, is you

34:09.660 --> 34:13.900
So tell me about Dino

34:14.540 --> 34:19.500
What year was that it was well is again a university high school and then in parentheses Hs

34:20.140 --> 34:22.140
favorite oil go

34:24.460 --> 34:26.460
Olive

34:26.860 --> 34:30.620
I'll also go olive but avocado I think I want to give a special

34:30.860 --> 34:35.900
Mentioned to been using avocado oil spray

34:37.660 --> 34:42.780
The spray is nice. Yeah, it's very futuristic something I just sometimes I do worry about having a

34:43.340 --> 34:50.700
Pressurized spray can like near the stove because I can blow up or something. I give it over. Yeah, but that's never happened right

34:51.500 --> 34:53.500
You think that's ever happened

34:53.500 --> 35:01.980
Oh my god, that was the biggest burp. It was awful

35:02.860 --> 35:09.100
What did you eat for breakfast was deep fish in a diet coke? I think I want to be sick

35:10.140 --> 35:16.700
Did you know that was coming? That was awful. Don't be mad at him. You mean it was an angry grin?

35:16.860 --> 35:25.500
That wasn't even carbonated. That's cold brew. I think you just got to say excuse me and move on. Yeah, excuse me

35:26.860 --> 35:28.860
Don't be dismissive

35:29.100 --> 35:31.100
Welcome to so what

35:31.500 --> 35:35.980
This is a segment about the least important news headlines of the day

35:37.420 --> 35:41.180
Discoffee go bad the answer is complicated

35:42.380 --> 35:46.300
I think it's so what oh yeah, so what I think it does

35:47.660 --> 35:55.260
Lake or a bill is a hundred percent full as California reservoirs are revived by historic rain and snow melt

35:57.420 --> 35:59.420
So what that's really good actually

36:01.180 --> 36:04.860
Well, you're not giving us time we're supposed to all say it at once

36:04.860 --> 36:10.780
So what oh, it's really really it's not really a segment. It's just a color response. Yeah, it's sort of a chant like temple

36:11.180 --> 36:16.460
Walt Disney's former LA home is now renting for $40,000 a month

36:16.780 --> 36:24.060
So what so what it's pretty cool. It's in low spielas you get it's pretty big yeah, would you move soon we've talked about this a little bit

36:24.060 --> 36:27.740
Or would you consider moving soon selling your place maybe you make a hat? Yeah, it's not a good time

36:28.300 --> 36:31.420
It's not a great time to sell but your your place is sort of yeah, it's sort of a hut

36:35.500 --> 36:37.500
Used to be a weenerson. That's lea

36:40.300 --> 36:44.140
Hasn't changed much though because you didn't really get you didn't get the home equity line of credit

36:44.220 --> 36:49.340
You didn't put in the work that it would take to sort of personalize it thus from it was turn key

36:57.340 --> 36:59.340
So what

37:01.340 --> 37:07.660
Anchor brewing ceases national distribution discontinues beloved Christmas ale

37:09.180 --> 37:11.180
so what

37:12.140 --> 37:15.420
Oracle lays off hundreds

37:16.700 --> 37:25.420
And resins job offers in healthy unit so what is it all pretty important the drought the economy?

37:25.740 --> 37:32.220
Yeah, you think you've coffee grounds go bad. I don't have someone interesting. Yeah, I don't

37:32.220 --> 37:34.220
Me too

37:34.620 --> 37:38.620
Um

37:38.620 --> 37:41.820
What I don't know the fucking dissonance

37:42.700 --> 37:49.900
Cognitive or otherwise between what I think would make for interesting conversation and what you guys end up responding to or not

37:50.780 --> 37:55.580
Yeah, nutrition conversation you read headlines that you expect us to say so what yeah

37:55.580 --> 37:59.900
It was interesting conversation time for us to conversation. Yeah, all right, so new shoes

38:00.860 --> 38:07.660
Yeah, I knew sneakers and yeah, this is a nice. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, I've actually gotten a lot of compliments on these

38:08.220 --> 38:14.460
Oh, they're cool. You're sort of a big short-swear, huh? I like shorts with a sweatshirt when it's like in the 60s out

38:14.780 --> 38:17.420
I often am self-conscious about my legs

38:17.820 --> 38:23.660
Yeah, especially this is the most I'm self-conscious is because the cameras really are picking up a lot of leg

38:24.300 --> 38:30.060
So I had a pillow like this earlier. You were hiding your leg a little I was doing a little hide and then I'm like, you know what?

38:30.060 --> 38:33.820
I can't fucking do this anymore. I should show the world who I am

38:35.340 --> 38:43.100
Jeffrey, do you wear shorts? No, I feel like shorts. I I historically never wear shorts because I don't think they look good on anyone

38:43.500 --> 38:48.860
But I recently found this guy his name is Alessandro Quartzi and he's this like

38:48.860 --> 38:55.340
70 year old dude, and he has the coolest style ever, right? And he does this thing where he does white short-bermuda shorts

38:55.820 --> 39:03.980
White tea light jacket, and it's a really cool look. You know where it shorts because your legs are pencil thin and you look top of it

39:04.540 --> 39:11.820
It's noticeably bizarre so even if it's 100 degrees out and we're in a heat wave you'll wear jeans

39:12.300 --> 39:15.340
And it's because you have ankles you have thin ankles

39:15.980 --> 39:23.660
Sorry, thank you. Yeah, so he calls them thin ankles. Yeah, it's it's really hard because the diameter of my ankles is

39:24.140 --> 39:30.060
less than that of my wrist. I can see because you're you're sort of cuffed. I can see your ankles from here, right?

39:30.060 --> 39:32.300
And I see what you mean. It's they're pretty

39:32.860 --> 39:35.740
Yeah, do you want to get an arrow a DIY angle of that

39:36.380 --> 39:40.860
With your phone? Yeah, and we can splice it in here. I mean, I like it all sort of looks like

39:41.420 --> 39:47.660
Like a yes straw coming out of a glass. It's a hard style. Yeah, that's how skinny or like dug funny style

39:48.940 --> 39:52.620
Bones coming out of a wide opening great dug reference. Yeah

39:54.860 --> 39:56.860
Ali shorts oh

39:57.420 --> 40:00.700
It's complicated. I'm the same. I get self-conscious

40:00.780 --> 40:04.300
But I just bought a pair of new shorts that I'm gonna try to wear in the summer

40:04.300 --> 40:06.860
I got them from Amazon. I'm looking first which I don't

40:07.340 --> 40:13.100
want to do but I've been looking for a specific style of short and it's a very very hard to find

40:13.500 --> 40:17.740
So I went with a cheap pair and I'm like, this is an interesting

40:18.060 --> 40:21.740
But yes, I have two pairs of shorts as of last week. Oh my gosh

40:21.740 --> 40:27.100
But from zero. What's going on? Jeff is moving so he's clanking around with something he's looking for something

40:27.900 --> 40:31.260
He's turning on it. He's turning on the TV for the first time

40:31.900 --> 40:33.900
He's just bored and he's gonna watch

40:34.460 --> 40:37.260
Crisis right while we record or something to be here

40:39.340 --> 40:47.340
I just downloaded to be for the first time. Oh, what's what do you think I'm watching stars on Mars and I'm having the time of my life. What is that it's a show

40:49.580 --> 40:56.220
You're loving it. I love how you live. I came to life. Yeah. Okay, so it's a bunch of celebrities

40:56.780 --> 41:02.940
And they are all fake living on Mars in a space shuttle and the reality shows

41:04.460 --> 41:11.500
But it's not just like it's Martian lynches on there. Well, I love Martian Lance Armstrong

41:11.900 --> 41:19.900
Jesus one girl. I'm not gonna say thought he was Neil Neil Armstrong. Yeah, and was like I cannot believe like it's he has such a

41:19.900 --> 41:21.900
So confused

41:21.900 --> 41:23.900
He's in touch of Mars

41:25.420 --> 41:27.420
You were just here, right?

41:27.420 --> 41:29.420
Oh

41:31.900 --> 41:35.180
We were we were actually we like alle kind of

41:37.580 --> 41:43.020
Allie kind of lit up and we were like having discussing a pretty funny. We're discussing something so good alley was really

41:43.420 --> 41:49.020
Kind of like lighting up it for the I've never seen alley like that. Yeah, but yeah, let's talk about this picture

41:49.020 --> 41:53.180
They yeah, that's gonna cut off man sitting down drop really poorly

41:53.900 --> 41:56.780
It's horribly yeah, why isn't the middle of the screen?

41:58.620 --> 42:04.300
Welcome to dad core or sad core. Okay, okay, um, so

42:05.180 --> 42:10.300
Miles your father. Yeah, I'm your you're like a pod father as they call you

42:10.700 --> 42:14.700
I haven't quite seen the evidence of that. I would say that's more like a Jake and Marty thing, but yeah

42:15.500 --> 42:19.500
Why a pod father like you're the podcast godfather like a godfather, but for podcast

42:19.820 --> 42:25.660
That's always to me been Jake because he's sort of a content. I know we know what you think you already said it

42:26.860 --> 42:33.820
You said it doesn't really bring true for you. I always think of it as a Jake and Marty thing

42:34.220 --> 42:37.820
And then he brought it up again. You said yeah, I don't consider

42:39.820 --> 42:43.020
So yeah, you're opinion is noted. Yeah, I

42:43.980 --> 42:48.060
Was just gonna see that. I know you're just

42:49.100 --> 42:53.100
It's that you think of Jake is more of the pod father. Yeah, right?

42:53.740 --> 42:57.420
Not quite pod father. I was gonna say he's sort of the content king

42:57.740 --> 43:02.940
Which to me is more important than even if you were the pod father because content is king. Yeah

43:03.580 --> 43:05.580
This is dad core sad core

43:06.140 --> 43:10.940
Miles you are a father. Yeah, um, have a six month old. Do you feel like it has

43:11.900 --> 43:15.660
Changed your style of doing things. No

43:16.300 --> 43:18.300
Really, I feel like it's good of

43:21.100 --> 43:25.100
All right, forget it then let's talk about get out low again

43:26.380 --> 43:31.420
No, do you feel like it's changed your like physical style your a fashion your aesthetic? Oh no

43:31.420 --> 43:36.620
I mean, I want to dress more fashionably. I think it's like because I am so tired and

43:36.620 --> 43:42.060
Yeah, okay, I don't when I go out into the world. I do that much less. Yeah, and so when I go out

43:42.060 --> 43:47.420
I actually do want to have a better sense of style. So I think I'm trying to take fashion risks in a way I didn't before

43:47.660 --> 43:53.740
Yeah, because maybe and maybe that's because I have a more determined sense of self same shoes of ever seeing you are a same

43:53.740 --> 43:59.900
Gene same socks same class is the shirt might be a no, but it's pretty pretty it's one of my wife Sarah's maternity shirt

44:00.860 --> 44:08.860
I'm actually kind of a fashion risk. I know and I think I'm I mean I guess I'll let you decide if I'm pulling it off

44:08.860 --> 44:15.500
There's no right answer to these. I just want to get your guys as opinions on whether these following outfits are

44:15.980 --> 44:23.020
Dad core or sad core. Yeah, took the note from Hayes and Sean that I need to have more actual space for participation

44:23.020 --> 44:28.860
So there's no right answer. I don't have an agenda with these. Let's fucking use them as a springboard

44:29.500 --> 44:33.260
for fun conversation between the four of us. Okay

44:34.460 --> 44:40.620
Is this a celebrity or is this just a man? That's actually Ryan Reynolds body if it matters, but I feel like that

44:41.180 --> 44:44.460
That's right in Reynolds. Yeah, that's him and free guy

44:46.700 --> 44:48.700
Now I can see it

44:48.700 --> 44:50.700
Ha

45:10.300 --> 45:12.300
Yeah

45:12.300 --> 45:14.300
Dad core

45:15.180 --> 45:17.180
Miles yeah, all right

45:17.820 --> 45:23.980
I mean, I mean, again, it's not like a guessing game. It's like, oh, I think this is Dad core because of the loafers or because

45:24.220 --> 45:31.580
You know, the loafers make me think of his my dad because you know, you didn't always used to be around when I was until I was probably 14 and then he was around too much

45:32.300 --> 45:34.300
Wow when you were doing

45:34.940 --> 45:39.260
The you were doing Saturday night you're playing Dino or was that hidden in this picture you're playing great

45:41.420 --> 45:44.220
When you were 14. Oh, and if you remember it's the name of the car

45:44.860 --> 45:49.020
Another break. There's no way. There's too many ads pretty break

45:52.860 --> 45:54.860
So this first one was dad core

45:57.260 --> 46:03.180
Dad core or sad core will I feel like it's quite fashionable, but I want to say sad core

46:03.820 --> 46:11.100
Because the man on the right looking at him looks pretty pretty sad and you know what I know who that is that's actually I didn't see this before

46:11.180 --> 46:17.420
But that's way co of the rake in the revolution magazine. He's a he's a watch influencer. That's actually kind of cool

46:18.700 --> 46:23.660
He dresses really he has a great watch collection. He actually made a car DA made him a piece unique

46:24.540 --> 46:30.620
Tonks and tray. I'm gonna go with sad core because if the top was red and the bottom was green

46:30.620 --> 46:34.620
That's what I wore when I ran into a mirror at the taco stand in front of the grocery store by my house

46:35.180 --> 46:37.180
I

46:37.180 --> 46:40.220
Sweater in big bed and that was my reaction

46:43.660 --> 46:45.660
Confused

46:49.180 --> 46:51.980
I just like to flag to that the one actual

46:52.700 --> 46:56.060
Passion that I fear just now with steam rolled by a mirror

46:58.460 --> 47:01.500
I guess like maybe it was steamer, but it wasn't I am here

47:02.460 --> 47:07.980
If anything it was alley, but I don't think that that's like a dad core or sad core

47:09.180 --> 47:16.220
I actually really like that sweatshirt jeans combo and the shoes are cool too. I mean this guy seems pretty fucking cool

47:16.700 --> 47:18.700
Is there a blue jacket too?

47:19.020 --> 47:21.020
My dad wouldn't wear this sad core

47:21.900 --> 47:26.380
Yes, I probably think it's really not where I think it's really a fucking awesome actually

47:26.380 --> 47:29.340
Yeah, I think it's really cool. I've also heard that jeans are kind of out

47:29.820 --> 47:33.900
Yeah, and I'm wearing that cut of jeans. I don't know like but you're kind of wearing the same cut

47:33.900 --> 47:38.940
No, I know it's but these are jeans. I need to kind of throw away this one's interesting because the posture is also bad

47:38.940 --> 47:43.180
I think he's sort of standing up right standing up right and do you want to just grab because audio listeners

47:43.180 --> 47:46.140
You're thinking they don't can't see the they'll see this. Oh, it's just a guy

47:46.460 --> 47:48.460
Sorry audio listeners will see this

47:49.660 --> 47:51.660
They have anesthesia

47:52.460 --> 47:55.420
Yeah, that's really dad core or sad core

47:56.060 --> 48:01.740
Okay, so I'm gonna do sort of Jeff's job. I guess, but this is someone wearing a tan jacket. That's a woman, right?

48:01.740 --> 48:03.180
Yeah, yeah

48:03.180 --> 48:07.740
Someone wearing tan jacket. Grace wetter brown pants with little checkers on them kind of and

48:07.740 --> 48:09.740
Like shoes

48:09.980 --> 48:11.980
Tired of you

48:19.340 --> 48:22.860
This one is a little sad to me. Yes dad beige and gray

48:23.100 --> 48:28.060
Yeah, kind of standing by a lake the under armor sneakers are not ideal

48:29.500 --> 48:31.500
Sad core

48:31.500 --> 48:33.500
Dad core or sad core

48:33.500 --> 48:37.980
That's pretty cool. That's sad core. I think yeah mustache good jeans again jeans because you're

48:37.980 --> 48:40.700
He's not really saying anything jeans gray shirt. We sure

48:41.420 --> 48:47.660
My dad would not wear this but it's that dad core. My dad might wear this accident deadly. Yeah, you know

48:47.660 --> 48:50.220
I mean like you sort of be like oh, which was what was available

48:51.180 --> 48:56.940
This is kind of like an updated Jerry sign filled style. I was gonna say like an updated Jerry. Yeah. I was gonna say that

48:56.940 --> 48:59.100
Jerry was a layer like an updated Jerry

48:59.980 --> 49:01.980
sign filled stiller yeah

49:02.540 --> 49:04.540
Garcia no

49:04.780 --> 49:11.580
Just for era no war like I can you guys fucking help me out. I feel like I was just trying to

49:12.780 --> 49:14.780
You said updated Jerry sign filled

49:15.340 --> 49:20.060
He's kind of wanted to take credit for it or something. That's not no. I was like oh yeah, me too

49:20.060 --> 49:24.940
I thought of that first gonna say that yeah, yeah, I'm having a nice time. I am too

49:24.940 --> 49:26.940
Said I am too

49:27.340 --> 49:30.300
Dad core or sad core and the last

49:31.180 --> 49:33.180
Yeah, that one's me

49:33.180 --> 49:37.580
Because I remember thinking that blue bottle coffee looked like how I was dressed

49:38.140 --> 49:43.420
Yeah, oh, yeah, that's people then when I posted this on the internet everyone's like wow you have really wide hips

49:44.860 --> 49:47.340
And I was like I've never been body-shinged before

49:48.540 --> 49:52.780
And it was I'm sorry. Yeah, it was sort of an interesting insight

49:53.340 --> 49:57.100
People say you had wide hips. Yeah, it was not just like one. I was like white hips white hips

49:57.100 --> 50:01.340
Yeah, I could see that oh my god. Why are his hips so I'm like I didn't even consider that I guess

50:01.820 --> 50:08.220
Now that I look at it from a fresh angle a new eyes the waist is wider than like the torso

50:08.220 --> 50:10.380
I think it's a little long some people like that

50:10.380 --> 50:12.380
Let me think because let me excuse me

50:15.580 --> 50:19.500
I think it's because it's a long shirt. Yeah, and it's like getting pushed out by the pants

50:19.500 --> 50:25.020
I do like the blue and brown and I still think it does resemble the coffee and an interesting fashion

50:25.020 --> 50:29.180
Yeah, do you think that's because of the audience you've cultivated that those are people that are going to call you out

50:29.180 --> 50:30.220
Private wide hips

50:30.220 --> 50:31.820
Yeah, because I think if I posted a photo

50:31.820 --> 50:35.180
I don't know that people would say I had wide hips, but I don't think that's because of my hips

50:35.580 --> 50:40.460
Interesting because I when I posted that I didn't think that either but I think it just took one to open the floodgates

50:40.460 --> 50:42.140
Yeah, and now this is

50:42.140 --> 50:44.140
Known to me as the wide hip photo

50:47.420 --> 50:49.420
Hey Jeff

50:51.900 --> 50:55.580
He's not that's Obama throwing out the first pitch at a white socks game

50:57.100 --> 50:59.580
You recognize the photo that where you've seen it for

51:01.980 --> 51:03.980
Jeff, what do you think

51:05.260 --> 51:07.260
Now I can speak oh

51:08.220 --> 51:10.620
So again, he interrupts everybody

51:11.820 --> 51:18.380
He can dish it out and he literally cannot take one one a hundred of it back. It's not thin skin. It's just just said I shouldn't talk. So

51:24.220 --> 51:26.220
What I heard was

51:26.620 --> 51:30.140
Jeff wanted to shut the fuck up. I didn't say that but I heard Jeff

51:30.860 --> 51:33.340
Nothing you ever have to say is interesting for a show

51:34.300 --> 51:37.980
That is true, but we'd never would say that first show

51:39.820 --> 51:41.820
For this

51:42.540 --> 51:46.700
Dad core yeah, that's one dad car because it looks like the jacket is tucked into the jeans

51:46.700 --> 51:49.340
Yeah, yeah, that's cool, but it's a good pass

51:49.900 --> 51:54.220
Is that a bank see that's also me. Oh, that's you some me dad core or sad core

51:54.460 --> 51:58.460
This is what I'm telling you. It's the it's the hoodie with the shorts sort of my

51:59.340 --> 52:04.140
Let me in spring aesthetic is it also I and I don't I'm not trying to say that your hips are wide in this

52:04.140 --> 52:06.140
But I just think your shirt is a little long

52:06.940 --> 52:09.820
Just let you it just shirt feels the same length of long

52:10.380 --> 52:14.300
Do you find that because sometimes my issue and maybe that's a choice of things my torso is very long

52:14.940 --> 52:19.980
When I raise my arms I often show my belly button. Yeah, yeah, do you ever does that happen to you?

52:19.980 --> 52:27.020
It used to happen more because shirts used to be smaller and shorts used to be baggier now shorts are smaller and shirts are baggier

52:27.500 --> 52:35.660
Across the board fashion is like steering more towards shoes look at that. It looks like I have two knees on my right knee

52:36.860 --> 52:42.140
I have a double knee thing going on, but even my shorts now are shorter than those shorts

52:42.140 --> 52:48.380
And I was like a year or two ago. You can see I'm wearing a mask. Yeah, yeah, I my only criticism what what you just said was

52:48.620 --> 52:50.620
You

52:53.660 --> 52:58.780
Sort of pointing at it and you were like this is what I'm saying, you know like shorts and hoodie

52:59.740 --> 53:05.020
But it doesn't look good. Yeah, so that would be like a contractor being like hey

53:05.020 --> 53:11.020
Here's the wrong way to screw in a nail. This is what I meant. Why was this picture taken?

53:11.020 --> 53:16.060
You're just showing it and that's a really good question. I think it's always a very big bright wall

53:16.460 --> 53:19.260
And I was wearing a bright outfit

53:19.820 --> 53:25.580
So, who took the party took the photo? I thought you were wearing a mask showing your trick

53:25.580 --> 53:32.460
Yeah, if you show the whole photo, it makes it a little more sense. And what I do have to point out is that this is the whole photo

53:32.460 --> 53:38.140
It's not. No, that's the screenshot from your Instagram. Yeah, that's the whole photo that you have

53:38.300 --> 53:42.380
But the photo that Marty took was a wide shot of a very colorful mural. No, it was a troll

53:42.380 --> 53:48.940
That's funny that Marty took it. Oh, I think I got almost your face. It was not more of the wall. I

53:48.940 --> 53:55.340
stare at him too. I took a picture of her kid for the first day of kindergarten. I did frame out the head. Your left hand

53:56.140 --> 54:01.580
You left hand feels so awkwardly. That's a dummy hand. You can tell I'm wearing a white glove

54:03.180 --> 54:08.380
Would you feel arm is sort of touching my my dick, but you can't see it because I have a dummy arm

54:09.340 --> 54:16.460
That's being extended way too long. I like basically touching my dick, and this is my way of like hiding that fact during a photo

54:17.020 --> 54:19.020
That's so cool

54:19.020 --> 54:26.460
So me so which is it it's fucking fine. That was it was 21 degrees below zero in Winnipeg

54:26.460 --> 54:29.020
I'm wearing jeans in a fucking jacket

54:29.100 --> 54:31.100
You

54:37.100 --> 54:42.780
Jake, but this was again like 2018 and again, you're holding a drink a love it's crazy

54:43.740 --> 54:49.100
Yeah, why I don't know why I'm constantly I'm not really constantly three times in the last five years

54:49.100 --> 54:53.740
But like when you cherry picked the moment they do all really very similar

54:54.380 --> 54:58.460
What I will say is that these are just the first couple photos of you on your timeline

54:59.020 --> 55:05.740
That show the full outfit. So it's I don't know if it's cherry picking full fit. Yeah, I don't usually do it

55:05.740 --> 55:10.700
But I guess if you if you're talking about the last five years you can find a couple for sure

55:10.940 --> 55:16.460
Yeah, I do still have that jacket. It's very warm or at least the warmest jacket. I have it. It's a good jacket. It's all a jacket

55:17.740 --> 55:18.940
Not me

55:19.340 --> 55:21.340
Dad core or sad core

55:21.340 --> 55:23.340
Is that what's that?

55:23.340 --> 55:26.860
Is that a famous person? No, this is like an LL being at or something

55:26.940 --> 55:30.940
I'm gonna go secret third option, which is this outfit is really gay

55:31.420 --> 55:36.380
It's very gay because of the mock turtle neck the mock turtle neck the red jacket

55:36.380 --> 55:40.140
It's giving like lesbian rebel without a cause. Oh, it's a very cool outfit

55:40.140 --> 55:44.620
I'm subject to body shaming it. I'm here has anybody ever mocked your turtle neck

55:47.980 --> 55:49.980
Let's see that neck

55:49.980 --> 55:51.980
Another one here

55:51.980 --> 55:53.980
Yeah, yeah

55:53.980 --> 55:55.980
Then do that head roll, but do it at

55:56.380 --> 55:58.380
0.25% speed

55:58.620 --> 56:00.140
0.25%

56:00.140 --> 56:03.740
0.25x. So one 40 a speed one fourth

56:05.020 --> 56:07.020
The two my five percent

56:08.140 --> 56:10.780
25% one fourth we were both wrong

56:24.940 --> 56:30.140
What happened? He was moving his neck like you know what happened to the like the energy and joy in the room. I think

56:30.140 --> 56:33.340
Holds me the fucking model my bad neck

56:33.340 --> 56:35.340
Slowly twice

56:36.860 --> 56:39.900
If I had to pinpoint it, it probably had something to do with that

56:42.140 --> 56:44.140
It's just it was a joke

56:44.140 --> 56:52.300
Yeah, I might expand so I took it personally and you kind of have been um like kind of like sabotaging a mirror

56:52.380 --> 56:58.140
Because you put a bunch of photos. I'm having in this secretly to see you guys have made fun of me without knowing sorry

56:58.140 --> 57:03.580
Like so discord between yeah, yeah, yeah, and maybe this is a good time to plug pad gum discord

57:06.860 --> 57:08.860
I think it's

57:08.860 --> 57:11.100
chord dot com slash headgum or headgum dot com slash discord

57:12.140 --> 57:18.140
It's one of those dude. Are you what goes on on the discord dad core said for awesome me

57:19.100 --> 57:21.100
That is

57:21.100 --> 57:26.060
This was me and we should say that the short say crunch. Yeah, they were actually for short

57:26.060 --> 57:29.740
Given to me by Jake's little brother once when I needed shorts. I think you can just keep them

57:30.460 --> 57:33.340
I just think learning how that's a hand me out by the way

57:33.900 --> 57:36.300
Because Mike is 12 years your junior

57:37.100 --> 57:39.820
You were given free athletic shorts and

57:40.620 --> 57:46.140
Capt them and wear them a lot. I think that's a good shorts. They just don't have pockets. Yeah, I guess I'm just curious

57:46.220 --> 57:49.900
Did you think that this was a like a good photo and a post when you pushed it?

57:51.180 --> 57:56.780
Well, was this a picture a video and they picture this is so this has been learning how to write a bike

57:56.780 --> 58:02.300
I don't know how to write a bike. Oh, really. Yeah, so that was the story behind this picture. It's like sad core the first time

58:03.020 --> 58:04.540
I'll ever long it was

58:04.540 --> 58:06.540
Two years ago. That's great. I'm

58:07.020 --> 58:15.020
Trying to figure out for the first time how to write a bike and this is me sort of moving yeah, and what what's the saying the saying is it's like learning how to write a bike

58:15.500 --> 58:19.500
Meaning it's really fucking easy. No, it's like oh, it's like the meaning of that like you know

58:19.500 --> 58:22.860
No, no memory. Yeah, yeah, you never forget it. I don't think it was that was easy to make a picture

58:26.540 --> 58:31.180
That's just the dad core sad. Yeah, so that's the save the date to my wedding

58:31.180 --> 58:33.980
Which you obviously can't show slash have

58:35.420 --> 58:36.380
The

58:36.380 --> 58:38.780
Really personal information

58:38.780 --> 58:40.780
You know

58:40.780 --> 58:42.780
Pictures

58:42.780 --> 58:48.380
Just everything here. I don't want out there at all. Yeah, the picture is on your Instagram as well

58:48.780 --> 58:53.500
That picture is fine. The picture is fine. I don't want literally any in for me

58:53.500 --> 58:57.740
I don't even want this part of it in it because it's such private

58:58.860 --> 59:04.700
Laundry that's being aired basically. I mean I feel like it's fine for people to know that you're getting married people already know that sure

59:04.700 --> 59:08.300
But not necessarily the the information. I don't want any of this out

59:08.300 --> 59:12.300
You don't want them to know yeah this happened on real housewives and it did cause a big problem

59:13.340 --> 59:15.340
Real quick to that

59:15.340 --> 59:18.060

Unusable this whole part

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:23.100
I

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:30.620
No, I don't think over a hundred, but it's slow. Yeah, I liked my Venmo on the tripod that I produced for the try guys and you still do that?

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.620
I do yeah, even after the scandal

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:42.060
I just feel like you have your own engine you have your own vehicle. I mean this is a really good point cold burning

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:47.660
But I do still produce it even after the scandal and I did plug by Venmo on once and I did get

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:54.940
If you know what's it for producing how much do you have a 15 hour you think I could pay it an hourly you're salaried

Amir

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:00.540

This fucking show I also produce three shows there. I

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:09.420
Yeah, sure man, you're an amateur you by the way you think you're gonna give you a salary

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:14.220
You can even figure out the tech you know you recorded in a dummy episode earlier

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:20.620
Zero you're less than a zero. You're lucky you're getting paid at all all fucking doxing guests

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:22.620
Bring up private information

01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:26.140
Amir wait for a raise doxing the guests is that's a host

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:31.500
I mean hourly is a host, but as a producer what do you produce?

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:36.140
This first six minutes of the show was you setting up for the show yeah

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:39.660
Miles did half of it

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:41.660
You should be paying miles

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:47.260
By the way, oh, I was gonna say is my Venmo I people would Venmo me and then I would send it to the requests

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.220
Yeah

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:54.460
So people would also request me so it was just a fun thing to defend my honor here sure without telling me

01:02:54.780 --> 01:03:01.340
Casey and Kevin and Rochelle switched the entire zoom setup to recording live into an audition

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:07.900
Fucking session okay. I didn't know that was gonna happen so I sit down and I'm ready to do what I do know how to do and now

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:10.380
It's like okay, this is audition. Let me know make sure I know how to do

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.420
You just press a red button which is fair. Yeah

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:22.380
What's that yeah, so I got that down yeah in the video the video I was kind of sabotaged because you know it

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:28.620
Shout out to Chef Kevin, but he did say let me start a new session for you. Yeah, and you know what he actually did because he was talking about audition

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:31.660
Yeah, because then you session will the video make sure you just record something to an SSD

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.900
Yeah, and then I just didn't know what was going on

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:35.660
Miles, what do you got?

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:40.940

I've got a bunch of different stuff. You have a hat. I don't give a house. I hate rent

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:52.140
That

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:55.980
It is okay to lease a hat

01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:57.980
But I

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:00.380
Said that before yeah, that's actually a shirt

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:11.740
It says that it's a true neck. I did a whole thing is a little promo thing I worked hard on that's very like Colty and weird

01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:16.460

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.820
Because it's not 2003

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.740
You're a fucking joke

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:40.540

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:06.220
I made the thing talk about how my nose is big and I can't drink out of a champagne glass

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:09.660
I got a lot of really horny comment like stops the glass

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:13.660
And then all the comments were really kind of thirsty because that's like a kink people

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:17.580
Seeing those big people said he was my seat

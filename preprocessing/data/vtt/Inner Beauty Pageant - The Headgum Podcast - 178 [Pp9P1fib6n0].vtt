00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
The door?

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
No, that doesn't work.

00:15.000 --> 00:26.000
The moment I close the door, we can't hear computer audio in the room.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
Everything's connected to the door.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
One of the worst setups for the show ever.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
It's AP podcasting.

00:37.000 --> 00:49.000
This is advanced placement shit because it's zoom plus studio plus you all being recorded video and audio and your soundboard.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
It doesn't get harder than this.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
There's just a lot of live podcasts.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
I was just saying to Brad and Will, who unfortunately are joining us today, that KC agrees with me.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
This is a really difficult, what's that?

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Unfortunately, we've been patient little boys.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
So, doesn't mean that we have to bond?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
We're doing this because you did me a favor.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Doesn't mean I'm happy.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
But I came.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Is my camera on?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Are we just using the webcam video?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
They can see you through the webcam.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Through the webcam.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Why?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Why?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Are we on this episode?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I'll tell you why we're making episodes.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
We're making episodes.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
But then for the output show or watching, is it cool?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
That camera or is it still the watch?

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
They're going to be seeing you through the cinema cameras.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
That can be seeing me through the GoPro.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
And then there's going to be two little guys.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Let's say it's Will and it's Brad.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
And it's going to be a four little quattro.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
And it's going to be a four, a minute episode.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Because we all have hard hours.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
It's been 30 minutes.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
It's been 30 minutes.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
It's been 30 minutes.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
And by the way, they were good jokes when we were setting up.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
What?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Like the fucking Brad.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
You did the thing about the bread bowl.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Or the fucking Brad, Braddy Cooper or whatever.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Instead of Daddy Cooper.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
It's Brad Cooper.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Yeah, let's not rehash that.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Let's not have half.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Let's not come in having had half.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Because guess what?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
That's a heavy breakfast.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
That is a heavy breakfast.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
You don't have that on Thursday before it worked day.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
You have needle for lunch.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Where you have the chewing fund.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Everybody turned fun to.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Brad will.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Let's say how.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Sorry.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Let me get that sound in first.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
I guess.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Basically, I wanted to talk to y'all about.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
How you guys feel about living in Portland and New York,

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
respectively.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
And then see if you would maybe do like a parent trap,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
like sort of a pea trap.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Like, you know what?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Like when plumbing.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
There's the pea trap that goes right under the sink vanity.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Yeah.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Yeah.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
So what are we doing?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Is it like, yeah.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Or is it like, yeah.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
It's like a trying to follow.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
And I'm struggling to follow.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Yeah.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I don't know what it's about the way I conduct these.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
For lack of better German interviews.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
That's confusing to others.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
The energy shift.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
I love you, Brad.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
That there is being really frustrated to whatever is going on right now.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I'm just genuinely frustrated.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
I did get genuinely frustrated.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
We're getting out of it.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
I don't want to start this whole thing with the energy of me being like,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I'm going, I might take the show to your wolf.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
You think?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Why?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
I don't like that.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
I don't like that.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Wouldn't that be the funniest thing to do on this show, though?

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
If I took this to like, I don't know.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Spotify.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
I think it might be big enough.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I don't think it's a big show.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
No, they're shedding shows.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Why would they add you?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Yeah.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I didn't know that.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I might take it to eye heart.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
And I do eye heart.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
I heart.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
I heart.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I don't think you have it to take it.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Really?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Yeah.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Nor do they want to have it.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
I don't own the rights, but where did you earn the rights?

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
We have like a host virus relationship where we sort of both need each other

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
but you're killing us.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
You're killing me softly.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.500
With your hurt.

04:16.500 --> 04:17.500
The rads pod.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.000
YoKing's podcast.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
Let's talk about it.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.500
Let's talk about it.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.000
Let's start with the why now?

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Why do this show ever?

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
It's a king of the Hill podcast, is that fair?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Yeah, they're rebooting the show.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I didn't know that.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
That's your problem.

04:48.000 --> 04:57.000
Well, actually, they actually may not be because Johnny Hardwick, voice of Dale recently, tragically passed away.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
So, and then you started a show.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Well, we started the show before he passed.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
If you listen to the show, we talk about it.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
I didn't realize that sound effect is literally called fart with extra reverb.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
And that's the other issue, is that he can see the sound board.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
I don't want him to know.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Here we go.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
That was easy.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Right?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Because of the setup.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Yeah.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Let's talk about sex, baby.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
The dating and everything is rolling by the lens.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Oh, shit.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Getting.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
So.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
And see, I can't even go like this because of the way that this is wrangled.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
This is not supposed to be like this.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
And I didn't do it.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Can you see?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I can't get things set up.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
No.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
It's not my fault.

05:46.000 --> 05:52.000
And I think it's important that I internalize that.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
What were we talking about?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
My podcast.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
We're talking about the Hitchens podcast.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Brad, do you want to plug it?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Kind of say what it is.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Again, why now slash.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Why ever?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
And I'm not.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Why now?

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Because it's one of the greatest Americans.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
It comes of all time.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
It's.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
It comes.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
Me and a buddy of mine who is a professional juggler.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Slash.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Daddy.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
From Edwin.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
And Oklahoma.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
We go through each episode of King of the Hill.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
We have a segment every week where we talk about current events from the day that the episode dropped.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
So we talk about the 90s.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
We talk about the show.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
We crown the King of each episode's Hill.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
So every episode has kind of a game to it in a way.

06:43.000 --> 06:50.000
We're trying to hit 100,000 subscribers by the end of the month.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
I think that's a reasonable.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Goal to hit.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
So if y'all could go subscribe.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Hilt King's podcast.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
YouTube.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Apple.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Spotify.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
We're on TikTok.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Jeff's gonna come to an episode.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Soon.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Yeah.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Yo, this beat goes mad hard.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Yeah, drop a rhyme.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
I'm here.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Come on.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
So.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Yeah.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
It's like, I don't know what to come in.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
But like a quiz show.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
It makes me riso.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
I can't.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
What the fuck are you talking about?

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
What was that Casey?

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
You have Casey on your soundboard.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
I have Casey on your soundboard.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Interesting.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Yeah.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
On your right.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
On your right.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
On your right.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
On your right.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
But that's the whole King's podcast.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Plug.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Do you feel like you got it all?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Sure, man.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Sure, man.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Or you feel like you're going to point people to it.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
I mean, it kind of felt like the music was drowning me out.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
You were down and out, but you weren't drowning out.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
I can guarantee you'll be mixed perfectly.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
So people can hear both the music and the plug because some people will only be interested in the music.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Some people will only be interested in the plug.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
And so here's a little bit something for everyone should be in land.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
It's kind of like Disney land.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Everyone's watching.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Walt Disney's an original vision for the theme park.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Was that adults and kids could have fun alike?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
That's really cool.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Who was that.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Who was that?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
That's a wild cat.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
It's just a cat or something.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
It's just a cat or something.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
It's just a cat or a demon.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
What are you going to be on?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
It's a fun show to be a part of.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
People love this shit.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Yeah.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
The Hilt King's.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Uh, and that is fun.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
I'll be about that.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
But maybe Hilt King can follow you.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Just kind of like when you're walking stand behind somebody,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Well.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
You came here you had three cold brews, but I only see one.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
This is the hood.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
You've had three to the roof.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I met two and a half.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
You've had three cold breads to have all for yourself.

09:06.000 --> 09:06.940
No.

09:06.940 --> 09:09.780
because I'm gonna have two, and then I'm gonna take the other one home.

09:09.780 --> 09:11.700
So you, but you, this is your second, that you finish.

09:11.700 --> 09:12.740
This is the first.

09:12.740 --> 09:13.580
So where's the second?

09:13.580 --> 09:14.420
The second one's in the fridge.

09:14.420 --> 09:15.740
The third one's in the fridge, right?

09:15.740 --> 09:17.300
And I think we're getting a little bit too far away

09:17.300 --> 09:18.740
from the Hulking spot, guess.

09:18.740 --> 09:22.820
And it's like, finished the over, yeah.

09:22.820 --> 09:23.980
The plug's done, man.

09:23.980 --> 09:24.820
Plug's done.

09:24.820 --> 09:26.460
We'll go somewhere, man.

09:26.460 --> 09:27.900
Besides, quarter away.

09:27.900 --> 09:28.740
Hulking.

09:28.740 --> 09:29.620
Every time I see this fucker, he's in quarter away.

09:29.620 --> 09:30.620
That's not quarter away.

09:30.620 --> 09:31.620
That is really quarter away.

09:31.620 --> 09:32.900
That's possible, huh?

09:32.900 --> 09:34.700
That's gonna be a washed out cotton.

09:35.660 --> 09:36.660
Oh, it's cute.

09:36.660 --> 09:37.460
Like a weird denim.

09:37.460 --> 09:38.300
Denemy.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.140
I have a denim.

09:39.140 --> 09:40.420
I was gonna say kind of a denim.

09:40.420 --> 09:43.860
And if I can add an end to this whole thing,

09:43.860 --> 09:45.100
we need new producers.

09:45.100 --> 09:46.460
We need additional producers.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.260
We're not putting our fucking salary money

09:48.260 --> 09:49.420
towards the right things.

09:49.420 --> 09:50.260
Yeah.

09:50.260 --> 09:53.580
Well, I think this show is such a low priority

09:53.580 --> 09:56.180
that unless you literally do all of it,

09:56.180 --> 10:00.020
we would just let it go by the wayside.

10:00.020 --> 10:00.940
Really?

10:00.940 --> 10:01.940
Yeah.

10:01.940 --> 10:02.780
Obviously.

10:02.780 --> 10:04.460
What about the fucking $600?

10:04.460 --> 10:06.420
See, the thing it, I think is that.

10:06.420 --> 10:11.100
That's not necessarily necessary to keep the lights on.

10:11.100 --> 10:12.100
But it's not necessarily,

10:12.100 --> 10:14.380
basically gonna keep the show, this show of float.

10:14.380 --> 10:17.260
Yeah, that's kind of hanging by a thread.

10:17.260 --> 10:20.220
Ice, so thin, it's practically water.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.060
I get that.

10:21.060 --> 10:22.380
And is that cause of, yeah?

10:22.380 --> 10:24.020
It's because of your ship's life.

10:24.020 --> 10:24.860
I'm at change.

10:24.860 --> 10:26.700
You've had gum, or is it like a spot-

10:26.700 --> 10:30.700
You're not steering this program in the right direction.

10:30.700 --> 10:32.100
We're treading water.

10:32.660 --> 10:35.340
I mean, you know what happens when you tread water for a while.

10:35.340 --> 10:36.500
You drown.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.900
Get revengeously.

10:37.900 --> 10:39.060
You get rid of it.

10:39.060 --> 10:41.260
I think it's like 250 pounds an hour.

10:41.260 --> 10:42.260
It's a lot.

10:42.260 --> 10:43.100
It's a lot.

10:43.100 --> 10:43.940
It's a lot.

10:43.940 --> 10:44.940
It's not a lot at all.

10:44.940 --> 10:45.940
I don't know.

10:45.940 --> 10:46.940
Yeah.

10:46.940 --> 10:48.940
And what do you 150?

10:48.940 --> 10:52.500
You're an asshole, I think.

10:52.500 --> 10:55.140
Uh, why?

10:55.140 --> 11:10.420
I'm so sick of this, sick of this, sick of this, sick of this, sick of this, sick, man.

11:10.420 --> 11:15.220
Barbara Brockley said she is not even close to a decision.

11:15.220 --> 11:21.900
I said, I've been feeling the brunt of your lack of decision making on a weekly basis

11:21.900 --> 11:22.900
on the show.

11:22.900 --> 11:23.900
Yeah.

11:23.980 --> 11:24.900
Right?

11:24.900 --> 11:28.860
And it definitely shouldn't be air-intailer Johnson.

11:28.860 --> 11:32.100
But I'm just like, fucking, what's the guy, Renée Jean Page?

11:32.100 --> 11:35.100
The guy from Richardson, I almost said, Pendleton.

11:35.100 --> 11:36.100
Yeah.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.100
I don't know what that is.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.100
But.

11:38.100 --> 11:39.100
Yeah.

11:39.100 --> 11:40.100
Yeah.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.540
Yeah, no, but this is straight from SUNY and Barbara Brockley.

11:43.540 --> 11:46.420
They haven't even discussed the new bond, is what they're saying.

11:46.420 --> 11:50.020
You think that movies are written just without the actor, or they need the actor involved

11:50.020 --> 11:51.020
and then all right the movie?

11:51.020 --> 11:53.140
I think they're on a long vacation.

11:53.140 --> 11:57.860
And I think they don't mind the strike, because Barbara doesn't want to be on set in

11:57.860 --> 11:59.860
fucking Portofino.

11:59.860 --> 12:00.860
Right?

12:00.860 --> 12:02.820
She doesn't want to be in London.

12:02.820 --> 12:08.420
She wants to be in the Maldives with a fucking malt with Reeves.

12:08.420 --> 12:09.420
Yeah.

12:09.420 --> 12:10.420
And who's the new bond?

12:10.420 --> 12:14.540
And he is my bond to the Reeves.

12:14.540 --> 12:18.460
My bond to the week is getting on Reeves because I think that Barbara Brockley drinks

12:18.460 --> 12:19.460
Maldives.

12:19.460 --> 12:20.460
Got it.

12:20.460 --> 12:21.460
Yeah.

12:21.460 --> 12:22.460
Will?

12:23.100 --> 12:25.300
Travis Kelsey.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.300
He's hot?

12:26.300 --> 12:27.300
No.

12:27.300 --> 12:28.300
Yeah.

12:28.300 --> 12:29.300
Famous.

12:29.300 --> 12:30.300
What the god?

12:30.300 --> 12:34.700
This is the worst segment and every time I listen, I skip it.

12:34.700 --> 12:35.700
Wow.

12:35.700 --> 12:36.700
Oh.

12:36.700 --> 12:37.700
Oh.

12:37.700 --> 12:38.700
Oh.

12:38.700 --> 12:39.700
Oh.

12:39.700 --> 12:40.700
The jail code.

12:40.700 --> 12:41.700
Oh.

12:41.700 --> 12:42.700
Oh.

12:42.700 --> 12:43.700
Oh.

12:43.700 --> 12:44.700
Oh.

12:44.700 --> 12:45.700
Oh.

12:45.700 --> 12:46.700
Oh.

12:46.700 --> 12:47.700
Oh.

12:47.700 --> 12:48.700
Oh.

12:49.420 --> 12:50.380
Acal.

12:50.380 --> 12:51.380
Oh waste.

12:51.380 --> 12:54.340
Oh, I saw that, I just I'd always said no.

12:54.340 --> 12:55.340
AC.

12:55.340 --> 12:56.340
baby.

12:56.340 --> 12:59.100
I've appeared with a meal.

12:59.100 --> 12:59.500
Yeah.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.500
Um.

13:00.500 --> 13:03.160
Have you guys ever used ails to treat your ails?

13:03.160 --> 13:04.160
No.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.640
We got to take a break.

13:05.640 --> 13:06.160
Um.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.880
I didn't get.

13:07.880 --> 13:08.140
I did.

13:08.140 --> 13:08.880
OK.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.980
I didn't.

13:10.980 --> 13:11.980
I didn't.

13:11.980 --> 13:14.760
Are you a millennial in miss's what life was like in the 2000s?

13:14.760 --> 13:16.220
The odds?

13:16.220 --> 13:20.120
Do you have a hard time finding new or curated music?

13:20.120 --> 13:22.340
Are you interested in multiple perspectives

13:22.340 --> 13:25.260
on relationships dating and music?

13:25.260 --> 13:26.940
Then you're gonna love see the thing is,

13:26.940 --> 13:29.260
a podcast hosted by Grammy Award winning

13:29.260 --> 13:30.900
R&B artist Bridget Kelly

13:30.900 --> 13:34.940
and media personality and podcast trailblazer, Mandibee.

13:34.940 --> 13:38.020
Twice a week, Bridget and Mandi have nostalgic conversations

13:38.020 --> 13:41.140
in their grown segments, political pop culture conversations

13:41.140 --> 13:42.700
in their honest segments,

13:42.700 --> 13:46.540
and relationship, hot take conversations

13:46.540 --> 13:48.940
in their slightly toxic segment.

13:48.940 --> 13:50.900
The opinions on the show are real

13:50.900 --> 13:53.060
and brought to you by the genuine connections

13:53.060 --> 13:54.780
that the ladies have with their guests.

13:54.780 --> 13:56.820
Who they like to call their friends with benefits?

13:56.820 --> 13:59.100
Each week you'll leave with some new music wrecks

13:59.100 --> 14:00.780
or a full curated playlist

14:00.780 --> 14:01.740
that you didn't even know you needed

14:01.740 --> 14:04.180
in their freshly squeezed music segment.

14:04.180 --> 14:05.660
Most recently, the ladies have sat down

14:05.660 --> 14:08.540
with Ari Lennox, Big Fridia, Remy Ma,

14:08.540 --> 14:11.660
and Van Lathen, so the star power keeps coming

14:11.660 --> 14:14.460
and keeps going each and every week.

14:14.460 --> 14:16.740
So follow and subscribe to see the thing is

14:16.740 --> 14:19.460
on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, or on YouTube.

14:19.460 --> 14:21.940
New audio episodes drop every Tuesday and Friday

14:21.940 --> 14:23.700
and visuals are available the next day

14:23.700 --> 14:25.820

14:25.820 --> 14:26.660
Check it out.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.620
This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.

14:28.620 --> 14:31.580
Guys, sometimes you're not quite sure

14:31.580 --> 14:34.900
how to feel about the end of year season, right?

14:34.900 --> 14:36.780
Do I mean, are you looking forward to the holidays

14:36.780 --> 14:38.500
or are you anxious about them?

14:38.500 --> 14:41.620
Maybe you struggle with seasonal blues, I know I do, right?

14:41.700 --> 14:44.460
I mean, the sun is setting at 4.45

14:44.460 --> 14:49.460
and I can't help but have that exterior darkness

14:50.100 --> 14:53.700
in view itself unto me, kind of show itself

14:53.700 --> 14:56.740
from the inside out like an infrared sauna,

14:56.740 --> 14:59.020
but no matter how you experience the end of the year,

14:59.020 --> 14:59.860
it can be a lot, right?

14:59.860 --> 15:03.340
And it can be natural to feel some sadness or anxiety about it.

15:03.340 --> 15:05.460
But adding something new and positive to your life

15:05.460 --> 15:07.220
can counteract some of those feelings

15:07.220 --> 15:09.900
and therapy can be that bright spot

15:09.900 --> 15:11.740
amongst all the stress and change.

15:11.740 --> 15:14.060
Something to look forward to, make you feel grounded

15:14.060 --> 15:18.140
and give you the tools to manage everything that's going on.

15:18.140 --> 15:21.380
I definitely get sad, that's seasonal effect of disorder, right?

15:21.380 --> 15:23.260
And daylight savings was this week.

15:23.260 --> 15:25.660
So I'm up in therapy to twice a week

15:25.660 --> 15:27.100
and we'll see if that works,

15:27.100 --> 15:28.540
but I know that at least once a week

15:28.540 --> 15:30.180
when it's bright is good to go

15:30.180 --> 15:32.500
and maybe twice a week when it's dark,

15:32.500 --> 15:34.300
we'll keep the darkness at bay.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.460
So if you're thinking of starting therapy,

15:36.460 --> 15:37.820
give BetterHelp a try.

Thanks, BetterHelp.

16:00.420 --> 16:05.180
Go back, here's the thing,

16:05.180 --> 16:08.540
I think the energy in this room and the Zoom is sour,

16:08.540 --> 16:10.020
but this is a good episode so far.

16:10.020 --> 16:11.020
It's sloppy.

16:11.020 --> 16:14.180
It's, I hope you like it extra sloppy.

16:14.180 --> 16:15.500
What's that?

16:15.500 --> 16:18.420
It's like a lunch lady, Adam Sandler,

16:18.420 --> 16:19.260
care of her.

16:19.260 --> 16:20.100
Okay.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.420
I like it extra slippery,

16:21.420 --> 16:22.780
that that really matters to her.

16:22.780 --> 16:23.940
Yes, exactly.

16:23.940 --> 16:25.460
What about silly bradisons?

16:25.460 --> 16:26.660
So it's sort of like,

16:26.660 --> 16:29.500
brad is feeling joy with his friend.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.660
That's just one second, brad.

16:31.660 --> 16:33.060
With his friend Madison.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.660
Is that the jug, Liffa, Oklahoma?

16:34.660 --> 16:37.940
Is that the difference in the room with the ownership?

16:37.940 --> 16:39.060
Hopefully not.

16:39.060 --> 16:39.900
Really?

16:39.900 --> 16:40.740
Yeah.

16:40.740 --> 16:43.580
That will go win in all of that.

16:43.580 --> 16:48.860
We covered Hill King's podcast.

16:48.860 --> 16:50.980
We covered my gripes with the network in the studio set up,

16:50.980 --> 16:51.780
which I'm not my fault,

16:51.780 --> 16:54.180
and not the reason to show us off the rails.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.380
The reason to show us off the rails

16:55.380 --> 16:57.900
and maybe why the content isn't quality

16:57.900 --> 17:00.900
is the way I host.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.460
Yeah.

17:02.460 --> 17:03.140
Really?

17:03.140 --> 17:06.260
I think you're just not doing anything to bring in new listeners.

17:06.260 --> 17:06.780
Right.

17:06.780 --> 17:07.700
And how do we do that?

17:07.700 --> 17:10.900
You're still catering towards the audience

17:10.900 --> 17:11.660
that it already has.

17:11.660 --> 17:13.620
So what should I do?

17:13.620 --> 17:16.020
You can get famous people to be on the show,

17:16.020 --> 17:17.980
which brings their fans over.

17:17.980 --> 17:22.020
You can, you'll definitely get a Hill King's bump.

17:22.020 --> 17:22.540
Yeah.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.660
That's warm our fans.

17:24.660 --> 17:28.620
And then promotion on Twitter and Instagram and TikTok.

17:28.620 --> 17:30.300
So you think that the fact that I never

17:30.300 --> 17:33.220
post about this on Instagram, TikTok or Twitter

17:33.220 --> 17:37.020
is hurting the show's chances.

17:37.020 --> 17:38.060
At growth.

17:38.060 --> 17:40.580
Yeah.

17:40.580 --> 17:43.380
So if I clipped out things from the episodes,

17:43.380 --> 17:44.900
we would post it to the Adcom TikTok.

17:44.900 --> 17:45.900
Exactly.

17:45.900 --> 17:48.700
See, this is the first good note I've ever received for this.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.700
You should know that already.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.900
I don't care.

17:52.900 --> 17:54.060
You don't know or don't care.

17:54.060 --> 17:55.060
I don't care.

17:55.060 --> 17:57.060
I knew that I should do that.

17:57.060 --> 17:58.060
I didn't care.

17:58.060 --> 17:59.060
No.

17:59.060 --> 18:00.060
No.

18:00.060 --> 18:01.060
I cared.

18:01.060 --> 18:02.060
I didn't know I should care.

18:02.060 --> 18:03.060
I say that.

18:03.060 --> 18:04.060
But you did care.

18:04.060 --> 18:05.060
It's hard.

18:05.060 --> 18:07.060
Because it's like, if you're growing up,

18:07.060 --> 18:10.060
if somebody doesn't show you that they care,

18:10.060 --> 18:13.060
if a paternal figure doesn't show you that,

18:13.060 --> 18:16.060
hey, you could really be anything you set your mind to.

18:16.060 --> 18:17.060
Yeah.

18:17.060 --> 18:19.060
It's hard to believe that in yourself.

18:19.060 --> 18:23.060
So to feel from the network that they don't give a shit about the show,

18:23.060 --> 18:27.060
because I don't have the money to promote it on my own.

18:27.060 --> 18:31.060
And when we have a better help ad on this episode,

18:31.060 --> 18:36.060
do you get to know a bit of therapy?

18:36.060 --> 18:37.060
We have a segment.

18:37.060 --> 18:39.060
Does anybody want to do it?

18:39.060 --> 18:40.060
Oh, sure.

18:40.060 --> 18:41.060
Kind of feel really?

18:41.060 --> 18:42.060
Yeah.

18:42.060 --> 18:44.060
I mean, as well.

18:44.060 --> 18:46.060
Why wouldn't we?

18:46.060 --> 18:47.060
I don't know.

18:47.060 --> 18:50.060
I feel like everybody's pissed at me.

18:51.060 --> 18:55.060
I feel like that's something you've got to figure out for you, man.

18:55.060 --> 18:57.060
I was going to, first of all,

18:57.060 --> 18:59.060
there was other parts of the wax I want to talk about.

18:59.060 --> 19:01.060
New name for me.

19:01.060 --> 19:03.060
What do you guys think about Lance?

19:03.060 --> 19:05.060
Last name?

19:05.060 --> 19:06.060
James.

19:06.060 --> 19:08.060
I'm Lance.

19:08.060 --> 19:09.060
James.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.060
Good to meet you.

19:11.060 --> 19:13.060
Just kind of a rebrand, because then people,

19:13.060 --> 19:14.060
that might bring in new listeners.

19:14.060 --> 19:15.060
If they're like, holy shit,

19:15.060 --> 19:17.060
the heck of a podcast got a new host.

19:17.060 --> 19:18.060
Yeah.

19:19.060 --> 19:21.060
What about Lance?

19:21.060 --> 19:23.060
Lance isn't bad.

19:23.060 --> 19:26.060
I'm just worried it's short for Lance.

19:26.060 --> 19:30.060
Alright.

19:30.060 --> 19:33.060
This is a segment I like to call.

19:44.060 --> 19:47.060
Inner beauty pageant.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.060
Right.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.060
And then.

19:53.060 --> 19:54.060
Wait, what was that?

19:54.060 --> 19:55.060
Was that pile?

19:55.060 --> 19:58.060
That was a pile from the pit wall choking on his own throat.

19:58.060 --> 19:59.060
Was he actually choking?

19:59.060 --> 20:00.060
Was he pretending to?

20:00.060 --> 20:01.060
That I don't know.

20:01.060 --> 20:03.060
God, I clicked out of the context.

20:03.060 --> 20:04.060
Yeah.

20:04.060 --> 20:06.060
Sounded real.

20:06.060 --> 20:08.060
Good.

20:08.060 --> 20:09.060
Um.

20:09.060 --> 20:12.060
I don't know a lot about beauty pageants,

20:12.060 --> 20:13.060
but we're going to learn.

20:13.060 --> 20:16.060
And I learned enough for the segment.

20:17.060 --> 20:19.060
I don't know about you guys.

20:19.060 --> 20:20.060
Okay.

20:20.060 --> 20:22.060
Let me start the whole segment by asking you as this.

20:22.060 --> 20:25.060
How much do you value beauty?

20:25.060 --> 20:27.060
Let's start with the mirror.

20:27.060 --> 20:33.060
I value it, but I don't prioritize it over more important things.

20:33.060 --> 20:36.060
Like, comfort, cash, family.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.060
Exactly.

20:37.060 --> 20:38.060
Those are the big three.

20:38.060 --> 20:40.060
And then I'll throw beauty on there.

20:40.060 --> 20:43.060
And that's why I'm out rush more of being a good man.

20:43.060 --> 20:44.060
Yeah.

20:44.060 --> 20:45.060
I love that.

20:46.060 --> 20:49.060
Let's get your mouth rush more for being a man.

20:51.060 --> 20:53.060
Do you mean like physical beauty?

20:53.060 --> 20:55.060
Uh, yeah.

20:55.060 --> 20:57.060
How much do you value aesthetic beauty?

20:57.060 --> 20:58.060
aesthetic beauty.

20:58.060 --> 21:01.060
Uh, not really a lot.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.060
Huh.

21:02.060 --> 21:03.060
It wouldn't be on my mouth rush more.

21:03.060 --> 21:05.060
I'd say my mouth rush more would be

21:05.060 --> 21:08.060
cleanliness, punctuality.

21:08.060 --> 21:12.060
Uh, the hill king to podcast.

21:12.060 --> 21:13.060
Yeah.

21:13.060 --> 21:16.060
He was podcasting with third of being a person.

21:16.060 --> 21:17.060
Yeah.

21:17.060 --> 21:22.060
And then probably a green curry with rice.

21:22.060 --> 21:24.060
The fourth ones of food.

21:24.060 --> 21:25.060
All right.

21:25.060 --> 21:26.060
Will.

21:26.060 --> 21:27.060
What do you got?

21:27.060 --> 21:29.060
Mount Rushmore of you.

21:29.060 --> 21:30.060
Beauty.

21:30.060 --> 21:31.060
Beauty.

21:31.060 --> 21:32.060
Beauty.

21:32.060 --> 21:33.060
Beauty.

21:33.060 --> 21:34.060
Beauty.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.060
Benjamin Franklin.

21:36.060 --> 21:37.060
Connover.

21:37.060 --> 21:38.060
Connover.

21:38.060 --> 21:40.060
Connover.

21:40.060 --> 21:41.060
Connover.

21:41.060 --> 21:42.060
Connover.

21:42.060 --> 21:43.060
The other room.

21:43.060 --> 21:45.060
Ah, that's really good.

21:45.060 --> 21:47.060
Um, not a joke.

21:47.060 --> 21:49.060
The host studio starts chatting.

21:49.060 --> 21:50.060
Unlike a film.

21:50.060 --> 21:55.060
I tend to look towards more substantive things in life.

21:55.060 --> 21:57.060
More like you, more like Brad.

21:57.060 --> 21:58.060
Like punctuality.

21:58.060 --> 22:00.060
Just like a mirror then.

22:02.060 --> 22:03.060
Wisdom.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.060
Joy.

22:04.060 --> 22:05.060
Faith.

22:05.060 --> 22:06.060
Faith.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.060
Faith.

22:07.060 --> 22:08.060
Faith.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.060
Faith.

22:09.060 --> 22:10.060

22:10.060 --> 22:11.060

22:11.060 --> 22:12.060

22:12.060 --> 22:13.060

22:13.060 --> 22:14.060
Faith.

22:14.060 --> 22:15.060
Faith.

22:15.060 --> 22:16.060
Faith.

22:16.060 --> 22:17.060
Faith.

22:17.060 --> 22:19.060
Faith.

22:19.060 --> 22:20.060
Faith.

22:20.060 --> 22:21.060
Faith.

22:21.060 --> 22:22.060
Faith.

22:22.060 --> 22:23.060
Faith.

22:23.060 --> 22:25.060
Faith.

22:25.060 --> 22:27.060
Faith.

22:27.060 --> 22:28.060
Faith.

22:28.060 --> 22:29.060
Faith.

22:29.060 --> 22:30.060
Faith.

22:30.060 --> 22:31.060
Faith.

22:31.060 --> 22:32.060
Faith.

22:32.060 --> 22:33.060
Faith.

22:35.060 --> 22:36.060
Faith.

22:36.060 --> 22:37.060
Faith.

22:37.060 --> 22:38.060
Faith.

22:38.060 --> 22:41.820
ask you, the 10 best thoughtful and philosophical

22:41.820 --> 22:45.300
page and questions, we're going to get to the end

22:45.300 --> 22:50.140
and to the core of if y'all have inner beauty.

22:50.140 --> 22:52.020
Let's start with number one.

22:52.020 --> 22:55.940
If you were God for a day, how would you change the world?

23:00.060 --> 23:01.300
Let's start with a will.

23:01.300 --> 23:03.020
I didn't know we were in third grade,

23:03.020 --> 23:04.980
and I needed to point to you guys.

23:04.980 --> 23:07.020
I didn't appreciate it.

23:07.020 --> 23:08.700
I didn't want to cut anyone off.

23:08.700 --> 23:10.140
OK.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.620
Suffering no more.

23:12.620 --> 23:13.540
No more suffering.

23:13.540 --> 23:14.940
No more suffering.

23:14.940 --> 23:16.340
And suffering.

23:16.340 --> 23:16.780
OK.

23:16.780 --> 23:17.540
That's pretty good.

23:17.540 --> 23:19.380
Hard to follow, Amir.

23:19.380 --> 23:22.300
Yeah, I mean, stuff to be at world peace.

23:22.300 --> 23:26.340
But ultimately, I want to create a joyful existence

23:26.340 --> 23:30.060
for everybody on earth where people aren't motivated

23:30.060 --> 23:32.860
by any negative external factors.

23:32.860 --> 23:34.500
What about negative feedback?

23:34.500 --> 23:35.980
Can I just piggyback?

23:35.980 --> 23:36.820
No.

23:36.820 --> 23:37.620
OK.

23:37.620 --> 23:46.820
And everybody to have equal joy and access to the things

23:46.820 --> 23:48.860
that make them happy.

23:48.860 --> 23:50.220
Yeah.

23:50.220 --> 24:00.020
Brad, less traffic would help folks to get more punctual, I think.

24:00.020 --> 24:02.420
Are you on time?

24:02.420 --> 24:06.380
I usually am.

24:06.380 --> 24:08.020
I guess I'm the judge.

24:08.020 --> 24:09.180
OK.

24:09.180 --> 24:11.900
I'm trying to think of which of those answers was most beautiful.

24:11.900 --> 24:15.100
I would probably say, sorry, well, what did you say again?

24:15.100 --> 24:18.580
He said suffering and suffering.

24:18.580 --> 24:20.780
I'm not have to go with Amir.

24:20.780 --> 24:24.660
Suffering can be beautiful.

24:24.660 --> 24:25.740
You can find joy.

24:25.740 --> 24:26.340
Sorry.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.020
I barely said anything.

24:28.020 --> 24:30.420
You can find joy in the little moments of like,

24:30.420 --> 24:33.020
ah, I'm stuck in traffic, right?

24:33.020 --> 24:35.820
And if you can do that, I think you have drew in our beauty

24:35.820 --> 24:40.460
because you have the wisdom to let things come and go as they

24:40.460 --> 24:44.540
please as opposed to how you please because control.

24:44.540 --> 24:45.940
You never have it.

24:45.940 --> 24:50.500
I'm sitting in front of control boards and couldn't even make

24:50.500 --> 24:51.820
them work.

24:51.820 --> 24:53.460
So you free associating?

24:53.460 --> 24:54.980
This is.

24:54.980 --> 24:56.300
Please.

24:56.300 --> 24:58.780
I'm trying to steal the show.

24:58.780 --> 25:01.660
The judge's question shouldn't be part of the contest.

25:01.660 --> 25:07.340
It's first question goes to Amir.

25:17.340 --> 25:24.140
Number two, how different would the world be if it was a matriarchy?

25:29.780 --> 25:31.260
Grace cut this one out.

25:31.260 --> 25:38.580
Question number two, what steps or measures need to be taken

25:38.580 --> 25:40.140
to eradicate poverty?

25:44.700 --> 25:58.340
Uh, give people access to jobs, more jobs.

25:58.340 --> 26:01.540
So that people can create more capital.

26:01.540 --> 26:02.540
Wow.

26:02.540 --> 26:04.380
Wow.

26:04.380 --> 26:10.460
To be further exploited by those in power.

26:10.460 --> 26:14.140
That's how we eradicate poverty.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.220
That feels like how we enforce it.

26:16.220 --> 26:18.420
Food straps bet brand.

26:18.420 --> 26:19.460
That's not bad.

26:19.460 --> 26:21.420
Food straps are empty.

26:21.420 --> 26:32.940
I mean, he got to start with an equal distribution of wealth.

26:32.940 --> 26:38.700
I would begin by taxing every dollar over $1 billion at 98%.

26:38.700 --> 26:42.420
We don't need to be racing towards the world's first trillion air.

26:42.420 --> 26:45.740
If you have a thousand million dollars, that's more than enough.

26:45.740 --> 26:53.980
Especially I'm not even close to being done.

26:53.980 --> 26:59.180
With a third of all Americans living below the poverty line, it feels very counterproductive

26:59.180 --> 27:06.620
to have the 1% of wealth being owned by the top 16 richest people in America.

27:06.620 --> 27:09.020
So I would start with that.

27:09.020 --> 27:12.180
Secondly, raise the minimum wage.

27:12.180 --> 27:17.780
The price of goods sold have gone up since COVID, but the minimum wage has barely

27:17.780 --> 27:20.100
kept up with inflation.

27:20.100 --> 27:24.180
I mean, this is an unsustainable cliff or hurtling towards.

27:24.180 --> 27:30.700
I shouldn't we just instead of raising the minimum wage just gave people more jobs.

27:30.700 --> 27:33.940
So for example, instead of one job, you would have three.

27:33.940 --> 27:34.940
Yeah.

27:34.940 --> 27:38.180
And then you'd be making $24 an hour because it's eight times.

27:38.420 --> 27:40.940
You did, Emily.

27:40.940 --> 27:42.420
How would you do three jobs at the same?

27:42.420 --> 27:46.340
Well, and then the rich folks could stay rich.

27:46.340 --> 27:47.620
Are you rich?

27:47.620 --> 27:49.900
Why, so why are you fighting for this?

27:49.900 --> 27:53.300
I just think it's cool.

27:53.300 --> 27:55.940
Up, go, Bob, decided.

27:55.940 --> 28:00.100
Well, that's a really big take.

28:00.140 --> 28:01.100
Oh, man.

28:01.100 --> 28:12.420
And why the real, the person answers, and then they're like, that was a, awesome.

28:12.420 --> 28:14.820
That was a really, really beast.

28:14.820 --> 28:19.220
It was like, I have to do something else, and then I started putting together my new vacuum.

28:19.220 --> 28:25.020
Um, will you say that we will pleaded the fifth on this one?

28:25.020 --> 28:26.020
He said the bottom first.

28:26.260 --> 28:27.020
Yeah.

28:31.020 --> 28:32.020
Okay, here we go.

28:32.020 --> 28:36.020
If you could break one rule, what would that rule be and when?

28:37.020 --> 28:38.020
Let's start with it.

28:38.020 --> 28:40.020
Don't break because he's about to fall asleep.

28:40.020 --> 28:44.020
Um, I would pay.

28:44.020 --> 28:48.020
Um, less taxes.

28:48.020 --> 28:50.020
Okay.

28:50.020 --> 28:51.020
Why?

28:51.020 --> 28:54.020
Because I came up with the tax and the billionaires more rule.

28:54.020 --> 28:55.020
I'm not saying you're in a tax prime.

28:55.020 --> 28:57.020
It goes down just your taxes.

28:57.020 --> 28:58.020
Correct.

28:58.020 --> 29:02.020
I have more than made up for my share by urging others to do that.

29:02.020 --> 29:03.020
Yeah, I get that.

29:03.020 --> 29:04.020
Yeah.

29:04.020 --> 29:05.020
Bread.

29:05.020 --> 29:10.020
I'd like to do shrumes more.

29:10.020 --> 29:11.020
That's a rule.

29:11.020 --> 29:13.020
You can't do shrumes legally, so.

29:13.020 --> 29:15.020
You can't in Oregon, I thought.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.020
Oh, yeah, that's right.

29:16.020 --> 29:17.020
Everyone.

29:17.020 --> 29:18.020
Quill.

29:19.020 --> 29:23.020
J-walking.

29:23.020 --> 29:25.020
Don't believe me.

29:25.020 --> 29:26.020
J-walk.

29:26.020 --> 29:28.020
Don't believe me.

29:28.020 --> 29:29.020
Don't believe me.

29:29.020 --> 29:30.020
J-walk.

29:30.020 --> 29:32.020
Because you had a bad.

29:34.020 --> 29:35.020
Wonderful.

29:35.020 --> 29:37.020
Pick one.

29:37.020 --> 29:38.020
Uh.

29:38.020 --> 29:40.020
Okay.

29:40.020 --> 29:41.020
Here we go.

29:41.020 --> 29:44.020
This is maybe the best question so far for the interview to page it.

29:45.020 --> 29:48.020
I would say that so far the person with the most interviews.

29:48.020 --> 29:50.020
It's neck and neck with them here in Will.

29:50.020 --> 29:51.020
Bread.

29:51.020 --> 29:53.020
You might as well just be a judge.

29:53.020 --> 29:56.020
You might as well be a judge.

29:56.020 --> 29:57.020
You might as well be a judge.

29:57.020 --> 29:59.020
I only care about outer beauty.

29:59.020 --> 30:09.020
So if you had a chance to discuss a social issue with world leaders, would you or not?

30:09.020 --> 30:12.020
Yes, this is a yes or no.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.020
No.

30:14.020 --> 30:17.020
Yes.

30:17.020 --> 30:18.020
Yes.

30:18.020 --> 30:19.020
Yes.

30:19.020 --> 30:20.020
Okay.

30:20.020 --> 30:21.020
Yeah.

30:21.020 --> 30:24.020
That one is going to have to go to Will.

30:24.020 --> 30:26.020
I said yes, too.

30:26.020 --> 30:28.020
Are we not enjoying the interview?

30:28.020 --> 30:30.020
I was.

30:30.020 --> 30:34.020
Until what answer question until you said I was a huge thing, man.

30:34.020 --> 30:36.020
I said I didn't have any interview.

30:36.020 --> 30:37.020
Mean that you didn't have an interview.

30:37.020 --> 30:40.020
I just meant that you weren't responding in a way that it exhibited it.

30:41.020 --> 30:42.020
You called him out of Italy.

30:42.020 --> 30:50.020
I didn't say that, but that was my inner monologue of the inner uglyness of Brad Lee.

30:50.020 --> 30:53.020
But that doesn't mean you don't aesthetically look fine.

30:53.020 --> 30:54.020
Thank you.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.020
Well, thank you to you or to Brad.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.020
Oh, I was just saying thank you in general.

30:58.020 --> 30:59.020
Gratitude.

30:59.020 --> 31:02.020
We're just expressing ambient gratitude.

31:02.020 --> 31:03.020
Bad gratitude.

31:03.020 --> 31:05.020
My gratitude.

31:05.020 --> 31:06.020
Cafe gratitude.

31:06.020 --> 31:08.020
That's really good.

31:09.020 --> 31:10.020
Okay, so.

31:10.020 --> 31:12.020
Can I have the I am in a hat?

31:16.020 --> 31:18.020
What?

31:18.020 --> 31:20.020
You were looking at.

31:20.020 --> 31:21.020
Yeah.

31:21.020 --> 31:22.020
Never mind.

31:22.020 --> 31:24.020
I was about to give you the inner beauty pageant.

31:24.020 --> 31:28.020
No, but then you said can I have the I am in a hat?

31:28.020 --> 31:29.020
Yeah, that's like.

31:29.020 --> 31:30.020
Which is it?

31:30.020 --> 31:31.020
It's a secret order.

31:31.020 --> 31:32.020
It's a cafe.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.020
Yeah.

31:33.020 --> 31:35.020
So when you go to this cafe gratitude place in Los Angeles,

31:35.020 --> 31:37.020
you're like, I am grateful.

31:38.020 --> 31:39.020
Can I have the I am?

31:39.020 --> 31:41.020
Instead of saying a salad bowl,

31:41.020 --> 31:44.020
it's like, it's called I am content.

31:44.020 --> 31:46.020
And you have to tell the waiter.

31:46.020 --> 31:48.020
Can I have I am content?

31:48.020 --> 31:51.020
You're supposed to just say I am content.

31:51.020 --> 31:52.020
Yeah.

31:52.020 --> 31:54.020
I see you don't say can I have.

31:54.020 --> 31:55.020
Yeah, you don't say can I have.

31:55.020 --> 31:57.020
I can have the I am fine.

31:57.020 --> 31:58.020
Burger.

31:58.020 --> 32:00.020
I mean I have sugar.

32:03.020 --> 32:04.020
Can I have?

32:04.020 --> 32:06.020
I have Nirvana Burger.

32:06.020 --> 32:07.020
I'm sorry.

32:07.020 --> 32:09.020
I don't get long enough.

32:09.020 --> 32:11.020
Do you think anybody's ever been broken up with

32:11.020 --> 32:14.020
at cafe gratitude before they ordered?

32:14.020 --> 32:16.020
So like how would that look?

32:16.020 --> 32:17.020
Let's do this.

32:17.020 --> 32:19.020
So it's like, yeah, I'm not.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.020
I just don't think it's going to work out.

32:20.020 --> 32:22.020
Just because like we're so different.

32:22.020 --> 32:24.020
You know, I like we view the way differently.

32:24.020 --> 32:25.020
And I could not.

32:25.020 --> 32:27.020
I am disappointed.

32:27.020 --> 32:28.020
Burger.

32:28.020 --> 32:30.020
Yes.

32:30.020 --> 32:35.020
The problem is I also.

32:35.020 --> 32:40.020
No, how long we've been going because all the shit started recording before we were ready.

32:40.020 --> 32:41.020
Yeah.

32:41.020 --> 32:45.020
I've been recording for an hour and two minutes.

32:45.020 --> 32:48.020
It's definitely not that.

32:48.020 --> 32:50.020
I get like a half hour.

32:50.020 --> 32:51.020
That's it.

32:51.020 --> 32:52.020
Yeah.

32:52.020 --> 32:54.020
Let's start it at 10.

32:54.020 --> 32:55.020
30.

32:55.020 --> 32:56.020
All right.

32:56.020 --> 32:59.020
Oh, you know, it's been 35.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.020
It's been 35 minutes.

33:00.020 --> 33:03.020
And I'm wondering if you guys want to move on from the

33:03.020 --> 33:06.020
internet community pageant because I thought it was a fun segment and everybody looks pissed.

33:06.020 --> 33:07.020
I'm into it.

33:07.020 --> 33:08.020
You're into it.

33:08.020 --> 33:10.020
I think I'm going to turn it around.

33:10.020 --> 33:14.020
I don't know, man.

33:14.020 --> 33:15.020
When will smiles?

33:15.020 --> 33:17.020
It looks like he's angry.

33:17.020 --> 33:18.020
I don't think so.

33:18.020 --> 33:21.020
I think it looks like he's like smiling with vitriol.

33:21.020 --> 33:22.020
Does that make sense?

33:22.020 --> 33:24.020
I mean, you can see it right here in my frame.

33:24.020 --> 33:25.020
Look at this.

33:25.020 --> 33:26.020
I think he's a cutie.

33:26.020 --> 33:27.020
That's what I was going to say.

33:27.020 --> 33:29.020
Hey, you see.

33:29.020 --> 33:30.020
Sorry.

33:31.020 --> 33:32.020
You're saying the opposite.

33:32.020 --> 33:34.020
You're saying that my smile has vitriol.

33:34.020 --> 33:35.020
And now I'm cute.

33:35.020 --> 33:36.020
All right.

33:36.020 --> 33:39.020
Let's just figure out this beauty pageant thing.

33:39.020 --> 33:41.020
What's your favorite memory?

33:41.020 --> 33:42.020
Oh, we're still doing that.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.020
Yep.

33:43.020 --> 33:44.020
Ah.

33:50.020 --> 33:51.020
Favorite memory guys.

33:51.020 --> 33:52.020
Come on.

33:52.020 --> 33:55.020
The pause is not good for inner beauty.

33:55.020 --> 33:59.020
That's not an easy question to just pull out of nowhere.

34:00.020 --> 34:03.020
Oh, okay.

34:03.020 --> 34:08.020
Now my favorite memories probably...

34:08.020 --> 34:13.020
First episode of the Hill King's podcast.

34:13.020 --> 34:14.020
Very recent.

34:14.020 --> 34:16.020
Did it go that well?

34:16.020 --> 34:18.020
Yeah.

34:18.020 --> 34:21.020
The internet's a buzz about it.

34:21.020 --> 34:23.020
Who are your co-hosts?

34:23.020 --> 34:24.020
And why?

34:24.020 --> 34:25.020
Oh, co-host.

34:25.020 --> 34:29.020
He's a professional juggler slash daddy from Edmund Oklahoma.

34:29.020 --> 34:32.020
Like a father or he's like a dumb.

34:32.020 --> 34:33.020
Exactly.

34:33.020 --> 34:34.020
Not an answer.

34:38.020 --> 34:40.020
If you say that at a traffic stop,

34:40.020 --> 34:42.020
you get a ticket for sure.

34:42.020 --> 34:43.020
Well, I don't stop.

34:43.020 --> 34:46.020
Do you know why I feed you over today?

34:46.020 --> 34:52.020
I think you're getting drunk tanked for that.

34:52.020 --> 34:54.020
We'll style.

34:54.020 --> 34:56.020
Oh, my God.

34:57.020 --> 34:58.020
He's so drunk.

34:58.020 --> 34:59.020
What?

35:11.020 --> 35:14.020
He still makes me happy like a years later.

35:14.020 --> 35:16.020
I always think it's you.

35:16.020 --> 35:19.020
It has been sounds like he was going to be.

35:19.020 --> 35:21.020
Are you out to play it?

35:21.020 --> 35:25.020
Uh, what is your favorite thing about Austin?

35:26.020 --> 35:31.020
The next question in the inner beauty pageant.

35:31.020 --> 35:33.020
And you can take that.

35:33.020 --> 35:36.020
It can be the city or it can be your buddy.

35:36.020 --> 35:37.020
Fold it free.

35:37.020 --> 35:38.020
Cafe.

35:38.020 --> 35:39.020
Okay.

35:39.020 --> 35:44.020
And it's Austin someone you would consider a role model and wear.

35:44.020 --> 35:46.020
So not the city.

35:50.020 --> 35:52.020
Wrap it up, I think.

35:52.020 --> 35:56.020
That is up her.

35:56.020 --> 36:01.020
Now you're not even saying a joke.

36:01.020 --> 36:03.020
Complete this sentence.

36:03.020 --> 36:10.020
I want to win this inner beauty pageant because I want it to end.

36:10.020 --> 36:13.020
Well, not sure if you heard.

36:13.020 --> 36:20.020
Well, I'd like to wear crown.

36:21.020 --> 36:38.020
I don't know if that's a crown because that would be outer beauty is to wear something.

36:38.020 --> 36:45.020
How would your parents describe your inner beauty pageant experience?

36:45.020 --> 36:48.020
They'd be confused for sure.

36:48.020 --> 36:51.020
Is because, yeah, they don't know what this is.

36:51.020 --> 36:53.020
How did your parents read?

36:53.020 --> 36:54.020
This is an on-secreter.

36:54.020 --> 36:56.020
Don't relate it to the pageant.

36:56.020 --> 36:58.020
How did they feel about your wedding?

36:58.020 --> 37:00.020
They enjoyed it very much.

37:00.020 --> 37:01.020
Back to the pageant.

37:01.020 --> 37:02.020
Okay.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.020
Do you have to speak it in assembly?

37:04.020 --> 37:10.020
What topic would you want to address and when?

37:10.020 --> 37:12.020
After lunch.

37:12.020 --> 37:13.020
Yep.

37:13.020 --> 37:16.020
Definitely on on chicken finger.

37:16.020 --> 37:18.020
And then you said school.

37:18.020 --> 37:21.020
Did I say, well, you said in assembly of people.

37:21.020 --> 37:23.020
It also doesn't have to be school.

37:23.020 --> 37:26.020
Other places have lunch.

37:26.020 --> 37:29.020
Let's go to point.

37:29.020 --> 37:32.020
I don't know if anger is indicative of inner beauty.

37:32.020 --> 37:33.020
Angers aside.

37:33.020 --> 37:34.020
Very emotions.

37:34.020 --> 37:35.020
Not anger.

37:35.020 --> 37:36.020
You're just bad.

37:36.020 --> 37:38.020
You're just interpreting emotion.

37:38.020 --> 37:39.020
Yeah.

37:39.020 --> 37:40.020
I didn't even raise my voice.

37:40.020 --> 37:45.020
I'm completely calm.

37:45.020 --> 37:46.020
We're so back.

37:46.020 --> 37:48.020
That was all I'm awake.

37:48.020 --> 37:49.020
No, not from a break.

37:49.020 --> 37:52.020
I meant like energetically we're back.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.020
Hmm.

37:54.020 --> 37:55.020
Here's a good one.

37:55.020 --> 37:57.020
If you could open a vineyard.

37:57.020 --> 37:58.020
Where would it be?

37:58.020 --> 38:03.020
And with whom?

38:03.020 --> 38:07.020
Francis Ford Coppola, Northern California.

38:07.020 --> 38:09.020
A established brand.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.020
Correct.

38:10.020 --> 38:11.020
Thank you.

38:11.020 --> 38:12.020
Thank you.

38:12.020 --> 38:15.020
Wow.

38:15.020 --> 38:18.020
All we had to do was follow the damn train.

38:18.020 --> 38:19.020
CJ.

38:19.020 --> 38:21.020
If you could be on a train.

38:21.020 --> 38:22.020
Let the unsenders.

38:22.020 --> 38:26.020
I don't know what that is.

38:26.020 --> 38:29.020
I think it's from Grint of D'Auto.

38:29.020 --> 38:32.020
It's from Grint of D'Auto.

38:32.020 --> 38:34.020
Oh, this is great.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.820
Do you think parents should be punished for crimes committed by

38:36.820 --> 38:38.820
their children?

38:38.820 --> 38:39.820
Immediately.

38:39.820 --> 38:40.820
Right.

38:40.820 --> 38:41.820
In one word.

38:41.820 --> 38:42.820
In one word.

38:42.820 --> 38:43.820
Lock them up.

38:43.820 --> 38:44.820
Style.

38:44.820 --> 38:45.820
Lock them up.

38:45.820 --> 38:46.820
Lock them up.

38:46.820 --> 38:47.820
Lock.

38:47.820 --> 38:49.820
Lock dads up.

38:49.820 --> 38:52.820
This is really good.

38:52.820 --> 38:56.820
What emotion do you experience most both in general and on this show?

38:56.820 --> 39:01.820
Oh.

39:01.820 --> 39:04.820
Vitriol.

39:04.820 --> 39:05.820
And that's in general.

39:05.820 --> 39:06.820
I'm assuming.

39:06.820 --> 39:07.820
Yeah.

39:07.820 --> 39:11.820
And then towards the show.

39:11.820 --> 39:13.820
Horny.

39:13.820 --> 39:14.820
Horny.

39:14.820 --> 39:18.820
I don't think he can say that to me.

39:18.820 --> 39:19.820
Yeah.

39:19.820 --> 39:20.820
He can.

39:20.820 --> 39:21.820
I don't think.

39:21.820 --> 39:23.820
What about that?

39:23.820 --> 39:24.820
To will.

39:24.820 --> 39:29.820
Just to be.

39:29.820 --> 39:30.820
How would you describe your interview?

39:30.820 --> 39:32.820
This is the last question.

39:32.820 --> 39:34.820
How do you would you describe your interview?

39:34.820 --> 39:36.820
Page experience.

39:36.820 --> 39:37.820
Horny.

39:37.820 --> 39:45.820
I mean, we're about to crown a winner, but we have to wrap this up and not end it.

39:45.820 --> 39:46.820
Wait.

39:46.820 --> 39:47.820
There's a crown.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.820
Is there a crown or isn't there a crown?

39:49.820 --> 39:53.820
Metaphorically very, you're being very obsessed with crowns.

39:53.820 --> 39:59.820
And even if I had the crown here, you wouldn't be able to wear the crown near.

39:59.820 --> 40:00.820
Right?

40:01.820 --> 40:03.820
Well, it's just qualified.

40:03.820 --> 40:04.820
It's just qualified.

40:04.820 --> 40:06.820
I'm sick of the crown top.

40:06.820 --> 40:07.820
And you know what?

40:07.820 --> 40:11.420
It's indicative of somebody with only outer beauty.

40:11.420 --> 40:13.420
And I honestly love to do this.

40:13.420 --> 40:15.120
I love to do this.

40:15.120 --> 40:18.320
But I don't think that you've earned the right for the crown.

40:18.320 --> 40:26.620
I don't think that you've shown anything other than frankly disregard for inner monologues.

40:26.620 --> 40:28.420
Let alone beauty.

40:28.420 --> 40:38.420
I've earned thought processes weren't good for anyone who has knees.

40:38.420 --> 40:40.420
Got it.

40:40.420 --> 40:41.420
Now I'm free of associate.

40:41.420 --> 40:42.420
I resign.

40:42.420 --> 40:50.420
I'm gonna say that the inner beauty page and queen of the year is please don't give it to me.

40:50.420 --> 41:05.420
I'll be there.

41:05.420 --> 41:06.420
I didn't want that.

41:06.420 --> 41:08.420
I didn't want that title.

41:08.420 --> 41:11.420
I don't think the audience wanted you to have it either.

41:11.420 --> 41:12.420
Right.

41:12.420 --> 41:13.420
But you know what?

41:13.420 --> 41:17.420
You gave some thought-provoking answers about finance.

41:17.420 --> 41:25.420
You fired a shoot out of beauty in terms of wisdom.

41:25.420 --> 41:36.420
And you took the whole thing with a reverence that I haven't seen out of you in quite some time.

41:36.420 --> 41:38.420
It's like you was gonna fall asleep.

41:38.420 --> 41:41.420
Yeah.

41:41.420 --> 41:43.420
I have a question for you.

41:43.420 --> 41:44.420
Yes.

41:44.420 --> 41:45.420
When did you?

41:45.420 --> 41:46.420
Sure.

41:46.420 --> 41:50.420
From what hours till when did you sleep last night?

41:50.420 --> 41:53.420
Just last night.

41:53.420 --> 41:55.420
I guess last two nights.

41:55.420 --> 41:59.420
Last night was a belief 315 a.m. to 915 a.m.

41:59.420 --> 42:00.420
Okay.

42:00.420 --> 42:01.420
And then I horrible.

42:01.420 --> 42:02.420
Yeah.

42:02.420 --> 42:03.420
Pretty bad.

42:03.420 --> 42:05.420
But I've been before.

42:05.420 --> 42:06.420
All night.

42:06.420 --> 42:07.420
All night.

42:07.420 --> 42:08.420
Yeah.

42:08.420 --> 42:10.420
Because there aren't enough hours in the day.

42:10.420 --> 42:13.420
And then what do you do from 115 to 315?

42:13.420 --> 42:17.420
What's that last two hours of the night like for you?

42:17.420 --> 42:19.420
I don't want to be crass or blue.

42:19.420 --> 42:20.420
Yeah.

42:20.420 --> 42:23.420
But it's a lot of self-completion.

42:23.420 --> 42:25.420
Ah.

42:25.420 --> 42:27.420
Automotive.

42:27.420 --> 42:35.420
Automotive Felicia, which is when you go down on a Mazda.

42:35.420 --> 42:41.420
And meditation.

42:42.420 --> 42:44.420
At Jeffrey James on Instagram.

42:44.420 --> 42:47.420
At Jeff Boyardy on Twitter.

42:47.420 --> 42:50.420
And that's to hear more of that.

42:50.420 --> 42:53.420
You said I need to promote the show.

42:53.420 --> 42:55.420
So maybe I clip this out.

42:55.420 --> 42:56.420
Post it to the head.

42:56.420 --> 42:58.420
I don't know who says no to that.

42:58.420 --> 42:59.420
Yeah.

42:59.420 --> 43:00.420
That could be a good clip.

43:00.420 --> 43:02.420
Try to find one where we're laughing though.

43:02.420 --> 43:05.420
That might be tough in this one.

43:05.420 --> 43:09.420
Will, what do you got going on?

43:09.420 --> 43:12.420
I think people towards and don't just say your apartment in Brooklyn.

43:12.420 --> 43:16.420
Nothing crazy.

43:16.420 --> 43:17.420
That's it.

43:17.420 --> 43:18.420
Just have a good day.

43:18.420 --> 43:19.420
Thanks for having me on Jeff.

43:19.420 --> 43:21.420
I really love to be here.

43:21.420 --> 43:24.420
Honestly, and genuinely, have me back any time.

43:24.420 --> 43:27.420
It doesn't interrupt my day at all.

43:27.420 --> 43:30.420
Wow.

43:30.420 --> 43:36.420
I've never been so unsure if someone's being facetious or not.

43:37.420 --> 43:40.420
Really?

43:40.420 --> 43:42.420
Look at the joy on this face.

43:42.420 --> 43:43.420
You can't mean that.

43:43.420 --> 43:46.420
I don't know if you're.

43:46.420 --> 43:51.420
I'm trying to, well, you're not originally from California.

43:51.420 --> 43:53.420
Oh, shit.

43:53.420 --> 43:56.420
Turn out like that.

43:56.420 --> 43:59.420
And that's what pissed you off.

43:59.420 --> 44:00.420
Brad.

44:00.420 --> 44:01.420
Brad.

44:01.420 --> 44:03.420
Brad.

44:03.420 --> 44:05.420
I'm looking spot cast on YouTube.

44:05.420 --> 44:06.420
Apple Spotify.

44:06.420 --> 44:07.420
Subscribe on Instagram.

44:07.420 --> 44:10.420
Try to get to a hundred K by the way.

44:10.420 --> 44:11.420
Really fast.

44:11.420 --> 44:13.420
Just started to show you want to get to a hundred K.

44:13.420 --> 44:15.420
I'm here.

44:15.420 --> 44:17.420
Think about getting a Pfizer.

44:17.420 --> 44:21.420
Think about getting a Pfizer.

44:21.420 --> 44:25.420
Think about getting Pfizer.

44:25.420 --> 44:29.420
Pretty good.

44:30.420 --> 44:32.420
What is then?

44:32.420 --> 44:35.420
Another hour or more.

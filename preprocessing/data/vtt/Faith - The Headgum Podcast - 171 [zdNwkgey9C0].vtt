00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
What happened last half hour?

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Just a series of unfortunate mistakes.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Honestly, it's a miracle that I'm here, but you guys will never know the real reason.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
You could tell us?

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
No, because it's like oddly personal.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Really?

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
So I'd write it up.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
I'd write it up.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
I'd write it up.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
But it's like, oh my god, if you guys knew the real story,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
you're like, holy shit, you've gots.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Can you give us any hint?

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
What do you mean like incredibly private?

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
More than just private?

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Yeah, oh yeah, that's like globally private.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
That'd be like my personal account.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
It's personal and it's private.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
If that makes it.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
But it's global.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
It only lasted 18 minutes though.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
No, no way longer than that.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
That's the crazy part.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
That's the crazy part.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
How much longer before 10 am?

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Like my day started at like eight.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
And like the five.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Whatever happened happened in two hours and 18 minutes.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
It's probably a world record.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
How?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
And you don't want us to know or you don't want it to be reported.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
I can't tell you.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
What does that mean?

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Just everything got pushed and pushed, pushed.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
It sounds like you just.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Don't want to explain why you relate.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
And Lucas outside after bringing back it.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
I'm not even done.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Like whatever it is, I'm not done.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
The dog.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Oh.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Sounds like that.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Like needed to let it go.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I can still hear you.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
What's funny, too, is that he was like my day started at like,

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
and he thought of the earliest possible time.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
And he said, Jim, eight.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Oh my god.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
He's been up for so long.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Oh my god.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Oh my god.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Oh my god.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Oh my god.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Oh my god.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Oh my god.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Oh my god.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Oh my god.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Oh my god.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Oh my god.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Oh my god.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Oh my god.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Oh my god.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Oh my god.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Oh my god.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh my god.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Oh my god.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Oh my god.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Oh my god.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Oh my god.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Oh my god.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Oh my god.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Oh my god.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Oh my god.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Oh my god.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Oh my god.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Oh my god.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Oh my god.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Is that so, that's to go out tomorrow?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Oh.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Are we acknowledging how early it is and how different all of this sounds

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
first thing in the morning?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Yeah.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Eight AM.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Eight AM.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Day after Christmas.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Oh.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Um.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
It is earlier than normal but that's why we got to bring that

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
certain faith?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Not energy.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Faith.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.160
The next 40 minutes or so, we'll go well.

02:56.160 --> 02:59.760
Against all odds, against all Brad's efforts.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.400
Did you know that the song you played?

03:03.400 --> 03:05.120
I was just gonna say.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.120
And faith.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.880
George Michael.

03:08.880 --> 03:09.720
That's right.

03:09.720 --> 03:10.560
I saw it.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.560
I guess he could say, let's wait.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.360
Let's wait.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.200
Let's wait.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.200
Let's wait.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.040
Nice.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.200
Yeah, nice.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.520
We're gonna get into some shit.

03:19.520 --> 03:20.360
All right.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.960
Use what I realized over the holiday.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.960
How are we gonna holiday?

03:23.960 --> 03:24.960
holiday.

03:24.960 --> 03:25.960
We can't.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.960
Any week ends a holiday if you take Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday off.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.960
Are you traveling?

03:31.960 --> 03:34.960
I was fucking floundering is what I was doing.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.960
More than traveling my text.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.960
That's one text.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.960
You also texted me at 5.10 a.m.

03:41.960 --> 03:42.960
Where were you?

03:42.960 --> 03:45.960
I was in fucking New York, who's eight, ten.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.960
Where are you just in New York?

03:47.960 --> 03:49.960
Then you flew back, and then you flew back to New York?

03:49.960 --> 03:52.960
You wanted to have a personal matter.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.960
It was for personal matter.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.960
Well, love to know.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.960
It is.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.960
It's for Moril.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.960
Right, sorry about that.

04:03.960 --> 04:04.960
Oh man.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.960
Four minutes back.

04:10.960 --> 04:11.960
Got it.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.960
I woke up in a notebook.

04:13.960 --> 04:18.960
10 a.m.

04:18.960 --> 04:22.960
It's 6.30 in the goddamn morning.

04:22.960 --> 04:23.960
It's not.

04:23.960 --> 04:24.960
Really?

04:24.960 --> 04:26.960
Yeah, it's 10.21.

04:26.960 --> 04:27.960
It's still early for the show.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.960
Usually this is really an afternoon show.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.960
This is like four p.m.

04:31.960 --> 04:33.960
So that everybody can go have a drink afterwards.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.960
All right, Brad.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.960
All right, Brad.

04:41.960 --> 04:42.960
How many cold brews have you had today?

04:43.960 --> 04:47.960
I had a leftover one, and it's from here to here.

04:47.960 --> 04:48.960
That's it.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.960
I will say, I'm here.

04:50.960 --> 04:51.960
This isn't.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.960
It's not a big deal, but I feel like if you were on time,

04:54.960 --> 04:56.960
his energy would have been completely different.

04:56.960 --> 04:57.960
I think it would have been like.

04:57.960 --> 04:58.960
It would have been sour.

04:58.960 --> 04:59.960
It would have been sour.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.960
He's acting out.

05:01.960 --> 05:02.960
He's acting out.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.960
And I don't know if he's hangry or cranberry,

05:05.960 --> 05:09.960
which is cranky and hangry, but something is not correct.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.960
I thought it was cranberry and hangry.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.960
So I'm a hangry and four.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.960
Cragu, which is cranberry, ragu.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.960
And you have a UTI.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.960
That's absolutely correct.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.960
So that's why I'm having red sauce Italian,

05:23.960 --> 05:25.960
but the red is cran.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.960
Yeah.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.960
Oh, the red is crayon.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.960
And my shirt is crayon.

05:33.960 --> 05:37.960
Oh, that's good.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.960
Would you guys do the last weekend for the holiday?

05:40.960 --> 05:41.960
Or not?

05:41.960 --> 05:43.960
Because it could have been normal.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.960
It could have been you having faith, the faith, the faith.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.960
That this was the last weekend was.

05:49.960 --> 05:50.960
Oh, fuck.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.960
There was no holiday weekend.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.960
It was like so long ago, also.

05:54.960 --> 05:55.960
It was a dream.

05:55.960 --> 05:57.960
It was a fucking dance.

05:57.960 --> 05:58.960
Dance.

05:58.960 --> 05:59.960
Fourth.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.960
It was a delicate balance.

06:01.960 --> 06:02.960
No.

06:02.960 --> 06:03.960
September.

06:03.960 --> 06:07.960
But the 15th, 16th and 17th.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.960
And 18th, 19th, 20th.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.960
If you took those days off, I didn't take those days.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.960
What if we, yeah, what if we didn't?

06:15.960 --> 06:18.960
Then how is your fucking normal ass weekend?

06:18.960 --> 06:20.960
Which is less interesting, by the way.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.960
It's way more interesting to say why weren't you in work

06:22.960 --> 06:23.960
from Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.960
Didn't Limbisket cover that song?

06:26.960 --> 06:28.960
Cragu, got a happy day.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.960
Cragu, got a happy day.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.960
That's enough.

06:35.960 --> 06:40.960
If you don't like me at my best, you won't like me at Fred Durst.

06:40.960 --> 06:41.960
What?

06:41.960 --> 06:43.960
Are you?

06:43.960 --> 06:44.960
Basically.

06:44.960 --> 06:45.960
No, not you.

06:45.960 --> 06:46.960
Basically.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.960
What are you?

06:48.960 --> 06:51.960
Because it's not normal.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.960
That was pretty.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.960
Pire for the course.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.960
Yeah, pun about, like, I'm a biscuit.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.960
Seems like it's sort of like in line.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.960
Like if you were in a right for the show.

07:02.960 --> 07:03.960
Yeah, exactly.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.960
Because you have to admit it, the host's voice.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.960
Yeah.

07:07.960 --> 07:08.960
Yeah.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.960
Sorry, the dog's going.

07:10.960 --> 07:11.960
Barbara Durst.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.960
That's, I don't know what that means.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.960
That's part of, like, the worst.

07:15.960 --> 07:16.960
We're now back on a zoom back.

07:16.960 --> 07:21.960
Because what it would be in the style is a fucking rabbit.

07:21.960 --> 07:22.960
Brought.

07:22.960 --> 07:23.960
Worst.

07:23.960 --> 07:24.960
Okay.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.960
Do we have to translate to everyone who doesn't live near downtown LA now

07:27.960 --> 07:30.960
or we just leave that reference for everybody to not understand.

07:30.960 --> 07:31.960
No, I got it.

07:31.960 --> 07:32.960
On you.

07:32.960 --> 07:33.960
Okay.

07:33.960 --> 07:34.960
I literally don't got it.

07:34.960 --> 07:35.960
And she lives in LA.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.960
So, I mean, that's not the people won't get it.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.960
I have no idea what he's talking about.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.960
It's a miracle that Brad knew what he was like about.

07:42.960 --> 07:43.960
This is fun, huh?

07:43.960 --> 07:44.960
Not really.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.960
It's a fun thought place called Worst Cooch in downtown.

07:47.960 --> 07:52.960
And they sell, like, weird or exotic animals as sausages.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.960
For example, rattlesnake and rabbit.

07:54.960 --> 07:58.960
So Jeff said Durst Cooch, which is Fred Durst.

07:58.960 --> 07:59.960
Right.

08:00.960 --> 08:01.960
This part I've now got.

08:01.960 --> 08:02.960
Yeah.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.960
But the sausages are Brad.

08:05.960 --> 08:08.960
What is on in your old CRT TV?

08:08.960 --> 08:10.960
Uh, it's the haunted mask.

08:10.960 --> 08:11.960
Goose bumps.

08:11.960 --> 08:12.960
Okay.

08:12.960 --> 08:13.960
And that's not just that.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.960
Brad is living a lifestyle.

08:15.960 --> 08:17.960
None of us could ever touch.

08:17.960 --> 08:18.960
Not really.

08:18.960 --> 08:21.960
I mean, he has that shelf for my key that everyone owns.

08:21.960 --> 08:22.960
Wow.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.960
Yeah.

08:23.960 --> 08:26.960
I mean, it is for my key.

08:26.960 --> 08:27.960
Everyone owns it.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.960
It's a low cost and decent craftsmanship.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.960
It's for sure.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.960
But I'm just to do, which is holding stuff on it.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.960
It's always talking about it's a great.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.960
The background itself is that it's time.

08:41.960 --> 08:42.960
I want this show.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.960
You bring it up.

08:44.960 --> 08:45.960
I think it better.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.960
On you said Brad is living a life.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.960
None of us can understand or imagine the background.

08:50.960 --> 08:51.960
I said.

08:51.960 --> 08:52.960
I can have that.

08:52.960 --> 08:53.960
I can make it a little less.

08:53.960 --> 08:54.960
I can have that background in a week.

08:54.960 --> 08:55.960
And.

08:56.960 --> 08:57.960
My defense.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.960
I was mostly talking about like waking up in the morning.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.960
Choosing a VHS.

09:01.960 --> 09:02.960
Popping it in.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.960
You want to talk about an unattainable life.

09:04.960 --> 09:05.960
I think that's not.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.960
I might want to talk to Tory.

09:07.960 --> 09:08.960
That's 40 dollars.

09:08.960 --> 09:09.960
It's.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.960
But what I want to talk about is on your attainable.

09:11.960 --> 09:12.960
Which is actually unattainable.

09:12.960 --> 09:13.960
Because.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.960
Look how many can't allow her.

09:15.960 --> 09:16.960
She has.

09:16.960 --> 09:17.960
I only have three.

09:17.960 --> 09:18.960
Right.

09:18.960 --> 09:19.960
She's fucking.

09:19.960 --> 09:20.960
He's still.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.960
That's three is still.

09:22.960 --> 09:23.960
Original painting.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.960
She said from a gun store.

09:25.960 --> 09:26.960
We should be there.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.960
It's also sells money.

09:28.960 --> 09:29.960
Yeah.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.960
I used to live in the country.

09:31.960 --> 09:32.960
That's.

09:32.960 --> 09:33.960
That's a new.

09:33.960 --> 09:34.960
That's a new background for Jeff.

09:34.960 --> 09:35.960
Are you at home?

09:35.960 --> 09:36.960
Or are you somewhere else?

09:36.960 --> 09:37.960
It's not a new background.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.960
I put up art between the last time you were on the show.

09:39.960 --> 09:40.960
And now.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.960
You haven't been on the zoom episodes that we've done.

09:42.960 --> 09:43.960
You haven't watched the episodes.

09:43.960 --> 09:44.960
Thanks a lot.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.960
By the way, because in all the ad reads.

09:46.960 --> 09:47.960
You've seen the gallery well that I put up.

09:47.960 --> 09:48.960
It's all fine.

09:48.960 --> 09:49.960
It's all there.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.960
So this is your place in LA.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.960
Because you gotta have faith.

09:55.960 --> 09:56.960
Hey.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.960
Hey.

09:58.960 --> 09:59.960
Hey.

09:59.960 --> 10:00.960
Hey.

10:00.960 --> 10:01.960
Hey.

10:01.960 --> 10:02.960
Hey.

10:02.960 --> 10:03.960
Hey.

10:03.960 --> 10:04.960
Brad was.

10:04.960 --> 10:05.960
Hey.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.960
Hey.

10:07.960 --> 10:13.960
That was the careless, careless, rice paper.

10:13.960 --> 10:14.960
That's got legs.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.960
So you're like me.

10:16.960 --> 10:17.960
I don't know.

10:17.960 --> 10:18.960
That's got legs.

10:19.960 --> 10:25.960
I want to say that as your subordinate.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.960
By the way.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.960
That it has legs.

10:29.960 --> 10:30.960
Yeah.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.960
I'm is sub.

10:32.960 --> 10:36.960
It's careless, rice paper.

10:36.960 --> 10:37.960
Let's work on it.

10:37.960 --> 10:38.960
Let's workshop it.

10:38.960 --> 10:39.960
There are no bad ideas.

10:39.960 --> 10:40.960
No idea.

10:40.960 --> 10:41.960
What else?

10:41.960 --> 10:42.960
Yeah.

10:42.960 --> 10:43.960
Look how we use rice paper.

10:43.960 --> 10:44.960
Jeff.

10:44.960 --> 10:45.960
Jeff.

10:45.960 --> 10:46.960
This is an A and B.

10:46.960 --> 10:47.960
Amir and Brad.

10:47.960 --> 10:48.960
Comprehensive.

10:48.960 --> 10:49.960
Yeah.

10:49.960 --> 10:50.960
It's not on yet.

10:50.960 --> 10:51.960
And on yet.

10:51.960 --> 10:52.960
So yeah.

10:52.960 --> 10:53.960
She got it.

10:53.960 --> 10:54.960
Why don't you G.

10:54.960 --> 10:55.960
She got your way out.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.960
G. Why don't you get out of here, based G.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.960
C.

10:59.960 --> 11:00.960
Yes.

11:00.960 --> 11:01.960
Exactly.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.960
I would propose you've got to have rice.

11:04.960 --> 11:05.960
Is easy.

11:05.960 --> 11:06.960
That's good.

11:06.960 --> 11:07.960
That's good.

11:07.960 --> 11:08.960
It's an easier win.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.960
Because you've got to have rice.

11:10.960 --> 11:11.960
Rice.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.960
It would be.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.960
Because you've got to burn rice.

11:16.960 --> 11:17.960
I just started to hop in here.

11:17.960 --> 11:18.960
Yeah.

11:18.960 --> 11:19.960
Yes.

11:19.960 --> 11:20.960
Car.

11:20.960 --> 11:21.960
Rice.

11:21.960 --> 11:22.960
Rice.

11:22.960 --> 11:23.960
Yeah.

11:23.960 --> 11:24.960
That's great.

11:24.960 --> 11:25.960
Great.

11:25.960 --> 11:26.960
I did.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.960
I was looking at like a.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.960
A cereal.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.960
Box ingredients.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.960
And it said the first ingredient was parboiled rice.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.960
Parboiled brown rice.

11:39.960 --> 11:40.960
No.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.960
And I left about an hour and a half.

11:43.960 --> 11:44.960
What cereal?

11:44.960 --> 11:46.960
Or maybe it wasn't cereal.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.960
It was like rice chips or something.

11:49.960 --> 11:50.960
Yeah.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.960
Maybe actually just a bag of rice.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.960
It was actually just parboiled brown rice.

11:56.960 --> 11:57.960
Yeah.

11:57.960 --> 11:58.960
That was didn't ingredient.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.960
It didn't say that on there.

12:00.960 --> 12:01.960
Anyone.

12:01.960 --> 12:02.960
Kind of was.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.960
No.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.960
I do want to get to something.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.960
I feel like this.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.960
This show is straight.

12:14.960 --> 12:20.960
Maybe too far away from what it was originally, which was like an in-house.

12:20.960 --> 12:26.960
Movement in a way of like the inner workings of the network.

12:26.960 --> 12:31.960
You know, like asking people how things were going from the inside out.

12:31.960 --> 12:36.960
Whether or not they were being turned to us.

12:36.960 --> 12:40.960
So I thought we could all talk about what's going on at the network for real.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.960
Right.

12:43.960 --> 12:47.960
Energy just took such a nose dive.

12:47.960 --> 12:49.960
Does anyone here actually know?

12:49.960 --> 12:51.960
I feel like we're not really involved.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.960
In the news video.

12:53.960 --> 12:54.960
For sure.

12:54.960 --> 12:57.960
It's a big, new-ish thing.

12:57.960 --> 12:58.960
Yeah.

12:58.960 --> 13:03.960
It's sort of a thrown together piece together.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.960
thread bear.

13:06.960 --> 13:07.960
Vizage.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.960
It's a desert morage.

13:09.960 --> 13:14.960
I think God Agnes not on the zoom because she would be really upset that you said that.

13:14.960 --> 13:15.960
I would be.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.960
I didn't know you were that wrong.

13:17.960 --> 13:21.960
Instead we have on your zero on her ultra personality.

13:21.960 --> 13:22.960
Yeah.

13:22.960 --> 13:23.960
Who loves Jeff and doesn't.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.960
And it's fine with everything he says.

13:25.960 --> 13:26.960
Dark.

13:26.960 --> 13:27.960
Yeah.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.960
Yeah.

13:29.960 --> 13:30.960
Blonde.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.960
Dark Brandon.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.960
On yes, thanks.

13:36.960 --> 13:40.960
I really didn't know you were involved with that studio.

13:40.960 --> 13:41.960
Why?

13:41.960 --> 13:42.960
Deep.

13:42.960 --> 13:43.960
What's my title?

13:43.960 --> 13:44.960
Producer.

13:44.960 --> 13:45.960
Studio manager.

13:45.960 --> 13:46.960
Yeah.

13:46.960 --> 13:47.960
Exactly.

13:47.960 --> 13:48.960
Yeah.

13:48.960 --> 13:49.960
Because you think wasn't involved.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.960
Fucking a producer on the.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.960
Rook and show.

13:53.960 --> 13:54.960
Peter.

13:54.960 --> 13:55.960
Who?

13:55.960 --> 13:56.960
I don't know.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.960
Someone unknown to me.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.960
It looks fine.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.960
I just wanted to like say it looked bad.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.960
Because that feels better than giving praise.

14:06.960 --> 14:07.960
It's always easier.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.960
Did you prepare questions about this?

14:09.960 --> 14:10.960
Yes.

14:10.960 --> 14:11.960
I did.

14:11.960 --> 14:12.960
Let's hear.

14:12.960 --> 14:16.960
It's more like based on y'all's individual performance.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.960
But I thought it would be a springboard to talk about further issues.

14:20.960 --> 14:21.960
Fair.

14:21.960 --> 14:22.960
Fine with me.

14:22.960 --> 14:29.960
What goals slash deliverables are y'all least proud of?

14:29.960 --> 14:32.960
What goals am I least proud of?

14:33.960 --> 14:36.960
Probably growing and monetizing the network.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.960
Because it's very shallow.

14:39.960 --> 14:40.960
Okay.

14:40.960 --> 14:41.960
Okay.

14:41.960 --> 14:42.960
Now we're getting somewhere.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.960
So the goal is to grow the network.

14:44.960 --> 14:45.960
Yes.

14:45.960 --> 14:46.960
But he's not proud of that.

14:46.960 --> 14:51.960
I just haven't quite seen that happening from your ass in the last year.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.960
2021 was great.

14:53.960 --> 14:54.960
Pretty big shows.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.960
Yeah.

14:56.960 --> 14:57.960
Yeah.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.960
Brad, what are your goals?

15:00.960 --> 15:03.960
Deliverables are you least proud of?

15:03.960 --> 15:04.960
I don't know.

15:04.960 --> 15:08.960
Increasing ad revenue.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.960
You should be proud of that though.

15:10.960 --> 15:11.960
Yeah.

15:11.960 --> 15:12.960
I should be proud of that.

15:12.960 --> 15:13.960
We are doing well.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.960
I guess I do have a lot to be proud of.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.960
Really good answer from Brad on you.

15:18.960 --> 15:19.960
Thanks, man.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.960
I'm going to go with deliverable.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.960
I'm least proud of.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.960
I bought.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.960
I decided to save the company money and I bought a less good.

15:29.960 --> 15:32.960
Yeah.

15:32.960 --> 15:38.960
You know what I mean?

15:38.960 --> 15:49.960
It's worth keeping up onlyable dates.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.960
Okay.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.960
People didn't fight.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.960
I would pay him.

15:57.960 --> 16:04.360
So they answer your question, kind of saving the company money buying a lesser quality

16:04.360 --> 16:05.360
tape.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.840
That's my big accumulation, 20, 20, 30.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.640
Would you say that your biggest gap?

16:10.640 --> 16:13.200
I, I would.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.600
I should have said.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.600
Yeah.

16:16.600 --> 16:21.840
Is that the kind of stuff you wanted to hear about?

16:21.840 --> 16:31.080
Moving on, moving on you?

16:31.080 --> 16:36.840
What can I do to help so much, okay, so better meet your goals?

16:36.840 --> 16:37.840
Yeah.

16:37.840 --> 16:38.840
We don't really have to ask.

16:38.840 --> 16:39.840
This is the real, right?

16:39.840 --> 16:44.640
This is a real crux of the episode at this point.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.200
Don't ask us about our goals and stuff.

16:47.200 --> 16:51.640
It's mostly just, it's only question two, you're saying it's the crux of the whole fucking

16:51.640 --> 16:52.640
thing.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.640
Yeah, that's like a big one.

16:53.640 --> 16:54.640
This is a warm up.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.280
And this is my favorite game of momma.

16:56.280 --> 17:00.440
We could stop recording and kind of like really get into it.

17:00.440 --> 17:10.600
If that's, if you're opening the door for that, baby, I, I really, we gotta take

17:10.600 --> 17:11.600
a break.

17:11.600 --> 17:12.600
Just kidding.

17:12.600 --> 17:13.600
Just kidding.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.600
Just kidding.

17:14.600 --> 17:15.600
Just kidding.

17:15.600 --> 17:16.600
Just kidding.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.600
Just kidding.

17:17.600 --> 17:18.600
Just kidding.

17:18.600 --> 17:19.600
Just kidding.

17:19.600 --> 17:20.600
Just kidding.

17:20.600 --> 17:21.600
Just kidding.

17:21.720 --> 17:25.840
Like, Grammy Award-winning R&B artist Bridget Kelly and Media personality.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.840
Mandi B.

17:27.840 --> 17:33.220
Every week, Bridget and Mandi offer grown, honest, and slightly toxic perspectives on all

17:33.220 --> 17:36.720
things Music, Bob culture and, of course, dating in relationships.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.620
Ideally, dating in LA.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.280
Do you have a hard time finding your music?

17:41.280 --> 17:44.560
Are you a millennial who misses what life was like in the odds?

17:44.560 --> 17:49.100
Are you interested in multiple perspectives on relationships in dating?

17:49.100 --> 17:56.660
Are you interested in a non-male bashing podcast that holds all sex as accountable?

17:56.660 --> 18:01.540
See the thing is, is a podcast that allows space for a wide range of thoughts and emotions?

18:01.540 --> 18:07.220
Most recently, the ladies have sat down with Ari Lennox, Big Fridia, Remi Ma, and Neo.

18:07.220 --> 18:10.580
So I would recommend checking out the Neo episode.

18:10.580 --> 18:13.900
Join Bridget and Mandy every week as they update you on everything going on in the world

18:13.900 --> 18:15.900
with their polarizing hot takes.

18:15.900 --> 18:20.460
Subscribe to see the thing is on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, or on YouTube.

18:20.460 --> 18:22.540
New episodes drop every Tuesday and Friday.

18:22.540 --> 18:23.540
Check it out!

18:45.900 --> 18:54.980
Jesus man, we are back, we're so back, the show is on the level all of a sudden.

18:54.980 --> 18:57.140
I have a little bit of a talent taste in my mouth.

18:57.140 --> 18:58.140
Really?

18:58.140 --> 18:59.620
Yeah, like I feel like I'm dying.

18:59.620 --> 19:05.340
I'm not taste metal.

19:05.340 --> 19:08.900
We have new sounds, we have new energy.

19:08.900 --> 19:10.460
Why are they turned up so high?

19:10.460 --> 19:15.140
That's it, they're not turned up to any degree, that's just what they're mixed at.

19:15.180 --> 19:18.100
You can't watch their exported levels on them.

19:18.100 --> 19:22.940
I, would you want me to, no, because if I download the sounds and then I bring them down,

19:22.940 --> 19:26.580
it'll still be peaking just at negative 6 dB, right?

19:26.580 --> 19:29.940
So it'll still be grading the here, it'll still be, it won't take us.

19:29.940 --> 19:32.180
Yeah, but it won't be as loud.

19:32.180 --> 19:33.180
So what?

19:33.180 --> 19:36.660
Grace is going to mix it down at some point.

19:36.660 --> 19:39.460
That's actually worse because I feel like people don't understand why we're having

19:39.460 --> 19:40.460
the reaction.

19:40.460 --> 19:41.460
They're having.

19:41.460 --> 19:45.100
I watched an episode recently where we all like, you know, and everyone must be

19:45.100 --> 19:48.900
like, what is wrong with these people that they can't handle?

19:48.900 --> 19:54.700
You got to talk to Ferris Vanche, I mean, he revolutionized the bringing down of the levels

19:54.700 --> 19:57.180
that were high when that was recorded.

19:57.180 --> 19:59.900
He left because he didn't want to work on your show anymore.

19:59.900 --> 20:00.900
Really?

20:00.900 --> 20:01.900
Yes.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.900
That's what he said.

20:03.900 --> 20:04.900
Yeah.

20:04.900 --> 20:08.700
Was it because I made a song parody about pegging him?

20:08.700 --> 20:09.700
I didn't help.

20:09.700 --> 20:10.700
They didn't know.

20:10.700 --> 20:15.060
But actually to answer your question from earlier, you shouldn't do things like that.

20:15.460 --> 20:29.860
I shouldn't, yeah, talk about having or halving other employees.

20:29.860 --> 20:33.460
Next segment.

20:33.460 --> 20:36.060
I think next segment time.

20:36.060 --> 20:40.060
Just because there's two ads.

20:40.060 --> 20:41.060
Yeah.

20:41.060 --> 21:04.660
What jobs responsibilities and tasks do you guys enjoy most?

21:04.660 --> 21:09.660
And what do you least enjoy?

21:10.260 --> 21:15.660
You're looking at it, baby.

21:15.660 --> 21:16.660
But you're all.

21:16.660 --> 21:20.260
And for least enjoy?

21:20.260 --> 21:22.660
It's just going to be so hard to go back to work.

21:22.660 --> 21:27.060
No one's going to understand why the three of us are the way we are for the rest of the day.

21:27.060 --> 21:31.460
I go into the office and people are going to think something bad happened to me.

21:31.460 --> 21:34.660
I think if you just say, I did the head come podcast this morning.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.460
It will be like, oh, God.

21:36.460 --> 21:37.660
I did the head come podcast this morning.

21:37.660 --> 21:38.860
I'm here with 10 minutes late.

21:38.860 --> 21:42.460
And that set jet off in a way that I've never.

21:42.460 --> 21:46.460
I knew you were going to go to the office.

21:46.460 --> 21:47.860
I mean, it's free lunch day.

21:47.860 --> 21:49.460
What am I going to not go in?

21:49.460 --> 21:50.460
No, that's good.

21:50.460 --> 21:51.460
What are we thinking?

21:51.460 --> 21:53.460
Has there been a slack message about it?

21:53.460 --> 21:55.460
No, it always happens like where did the last minute.

21:55.460 --> 21:59.460
And usually I'm kind of like driving in at that moment hoping to get the free lunch.

21:59.460 --> 22:00.460
Hope yeah.

22:00.460 --> 22:01.460
Needle.

22:01.460 --> 22:02.460
Oh, God.

22:02.460 --> 22:03.460
Needle.

22:03.460 --> 22:07.460
I'd be leaving this fucking podcast instantly.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.460
I'd be early.

22:08.460 --> 22:11.460
I'd be on a fucking plane today.

22:11.460 --> 22:12.460
Sure.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.460
Fun.

22:14.460 --> 22:15.460
Sorry.

22:15.460 --> 22:16.460
Sorry.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.460
Sure.

22:17.460 --> 22:18.460
Fun.

22:18.460 --> 22:19.460
Sorry.

22:19.460 --> 22:20.460
One second.

22:20.460 --> 22:21.460
Okay.

22:21.460 --> 22:23.460
He said that twice.

22:23.460 --> 22:26.460
Now a monster made out of a new show.

22:26.460 --> 22:31.460
What do you think we should have, Brad?

22:32.460 --> 22:33.460
It's never up to me.

22:33.460 --> 22:34.460
My choice is good.

22:34.460 --> 22:35.460
I don't know.

22:35.460 --> 22:37.460
It seems like everyone is thrown out a lot.

22:37.460 --> 22:41.460
I've never been to an air wand before, but it just seems overpriced.

22:41.460 --> 22:42.460
It's not even.

22:42.460 --> 22:44.460
I really liked.

22:44.460 --> 22:48.460
I did stop at Needle last time I was in.

22:48.460 --> 22:49.460
I enjoyed it.

22:49.460 --> 22:50.460
You had to.

22:50.460 --> 22:52.460
Because you were like, why is the mayor talking about this all the time?

22:52.460 --> 22:53.460
Yeah.

22:53.460 --> 22:54.460
But it's hard to eat there by yourself.

22:54.460 --> 22:57.460
Because you want to get a bunch of stuff and share.

22:57.460 --> 22:58.460
Yeah.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.460
We just get one dish.

22:59.460 --> 23:00.460
There's a food truck, right?

23:01.460 --> 23:02.460
Oh, Simone.

23:02.460 --> 23:03.460
Oh, yeah.

23:03.460 --> 23:04.460
That's what I stopped at.

23:04.460 --> 23:05.460
I didn't stop at Needle.

23:05.460 --> 23:06.460
That's right.

23:06.460 --> 23:07.460
You got it from the news.

23:07.460 --> 23:08.460
You got a fish taco.

23:08.460 --> 23:09.460
Yeah.

23:09.460 --> 23:10.460
I got a fish taco.

23:10.460 --> 23:11.460
Yeah.

23:11.460 --> 23:12.460
Those are great, right?

23:12.460 --> 23:13.460
I got ceviche, actually.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.460
It was awesome.

23:14.460 --> 23:15.460
That's our good.

23:15.460 --> 23:19.460
And so this is all in response to what responsibilities and tasks you enjoy most.

23:19.460 --> 23:22.460
No, the answer is like a noodle, dim sum, please.

23:22.460 --> 23:23.460
Sorry.

23:23.460 --> 23:24.460
Wait for that.

23:24.460 --> 23:25.460
Why were you?

23:25.460 --> 23:26.460
What's up?

23:26.460 --> 23:27.460
Where'd you go?

23:28.460 --> 23:30.460
The management company of this building is trends.

23:30.460 --> 23:32.460
I think they're trying to sell the building.

23:32.460 --> 23:35.460
So they're doing inspection follow up.

23:35.460 --> 23:36.460
Actually.

23:36.460 --> 23:37.460
You're getting infected.

23:37.460 --> 23:38.460
Right.

23:38.460 --> 23:39.460
You put up a gallery.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.460
Now that's viral content.

23:42.460 --> 23:43.460
Here's the thing.

23:43.460 --> 23:46.460
If they sell the building, they have to pay us to leave.

23:46.460 --> 23:48.460
So you just got in.

23:48.460 --> 23:49.460
That's what I'm going to do.

23:49.460 --> 23:52.460
And I'm going to make out with a bunch of cash.

23:52.460 --> 23:54.460
Ideally, 12 gram.

23:54.460 --> 23:56.460
I would take 12 gram for sure.

23:56.460 --> 23:59.460
But I'll take as high as 500.

23:59.460 --> 24:00.460
Do you guys sell that?

24:00.460 --> 24:01.460
As high as 500?

24:01.460 --> 24:02.460
That was it.

24:02.460 --> 24:03.460
What's that?

24:03.460 --> 24:05.460
Do you guys know about cars?

24:05.460 --> 24:06.460
Like no.

24:06.460 --> 24:08.460
Is he picks our movie?

24:08.460 --> 24:09.460
Or the cops.

24:09.460 --> 24:11.460
Like cars in the shop and their text can be bad.

24:11.460 --> 24:13.460
But I don't know how to respond.

24:13.460 --> 24:14.460
You say nice.

24:14.460 --> 24:15.460
Excuse me.

24:15.460 --> 24:18.460
That's awesome.

24:18.460 --> 24:20.460
But the greatest to the wheel brother.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.460
They have questions for me.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.460
And I definitely look exactly.

24:22.460 --> 24:23.460
Okay.

24:23.460 --> 24:25.460
So like read out the questions that they've asked.

24:26.460 --> 24:27.460
Hey, I'm here.

24:27.460 --> 24:29.460
I was just told by the production manager.

24:29.460 --> 24:31.460
That it looks like it's time to place the mate.

24:31.460 --> 24:33.460
That's my job.

24:33.460 --> 24:34.460
We have the same job.

24:34.460 --> 24:35.460
That's crazy.

24:35.460 --> 24:36.460
Yeah.

24:36.460 --> 24:37.460
I'm being you.

24:37.460 --> 24:39.460
I'm being you is what you should text them back.

24:39.460 --> 24:41.460
So I haven't started with the.

24:41.460 --> 24:44.460
I was just told by the production manager.

24:44.460 --> 24:47.460
That it looks like it's time to replace the main battery.

24:47.460 --> 24:48.460
Looks like not enough.

24:48.460 --> 24:49.460
Yeah.

24:49.460 --> 24:51.460
Not enough juice to learn.

24:51.460 --> 24:52.460
Not enough juice to run the.

24:52.460 --> 24:54.460
Well, calibration on your card.

24:54.460 --> 24:55.460
You want to realize that.

24:55.460 --> 24:57.460
You want to talk about a pocket.

24:57.460 --> 25:00.460
And if you want dealer battery or after market.

25:00.460 --> 25:01.460
Please advise.

25:01.460 --> 25:05.460
Let's go top of the line after market.

25:05.460 --> 25:09.460
And can daddy get a discount?

25:09.460 --> 25:12.460
The dealer battery is 275 after market.

25:12.460 --> 25:14.460
Battery is 195.

25:14.460 --> 25:17.460
Who would say 275 in this world?

25:17.460 --> 25:18.460
I don't know.

25:18.460 --> 25:19.460
Because like maybe.

25:19.460 --> 25:20.460
I guess Marty.

25:20.460 --> 25:21.460
Sorry.

25:21.460 --> 25:22.460
Good.

25:22.460 --> 25:24.460
Just.

25:24.460 --> 25:25.460
Marty would definitely get there.

25:25.460 --> 25:27.460
Go with the cheaper option.

25:27.460 --> 25:28.460
Battery is a battery.

25:28.460 --> 25:29.460
Yeah.

25:29.460 --> 25:33.460
Battery is not the thing you need to be built by the fucking manufacturer.

25:33.460 --> 25:34.460
There's a lot of other stuff.

25:34.460 --> 25:35.460
They're giving it.

25:35.460 --> 25:36.460
This is like actual advice.

25:36.460 --> 25:37.460
No one's even making jokes.

25:37.460 --> 25:38.460
Yeah.

25:38.460 --> 25:39.460
I'm going.

25:39.460 --> 25:41.460
I was pouring at the same.

25:41.460 --> 25:42.460
What's that?

25:42.460 --> 25:43.460
Most boring.

25:43.460 --> 25:44.460
Sorry.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.460
We've ever done.

25:45.460 --> 25:46.460
Well, it's actually helpful.

25:46.460 --> 25:47.460
For you.

25:47.460 --> 25:48.460
Yeah.

25:48.460 --> 25:49.460
All right.

25:49.460 --> 25:50.460
Let's move on.

25:50.460 --> 25:55.460
I asked if it was going to be done on the same timeline or like the ones in stock.

25:55.460 --> 25:56.460
Yeah.

25:56.460 --> 25:57.460
No.

25:57.460 --> 25:58.460
Because you see what happens here is like.

25:58.460 --> 26:00.460
This is why I'm always like it's a fucking sophisticated task.

26:00.460 --> 26:01.460
I mean the show.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.460
People like to think it's a sophisticated task to guess.

26:03.460 --> 26:06.460
But I'm like working up against your guys' asses.

26:06.460 --> 26:07.460
Right?

26:07.460 --> 26:08.460
Because you.

26:08.460 --> 26:09.460
You were like.

26:09.460 --> 26:10.460
I.

26:10.460 --> 26:12.460
You're pushing up.

26:12.460 --> 26:14.460
I was up by our asses.

26:14.460 --> 26:15.460
Up.

26:15.460 --> 26:18.460
Like, I'm here with like, oh, like, do you guys know anything about cars?

26:18.460 --> 26:20.460
And it's like, oh, here's a new topic.

26:20.460 --> 26:21.460
And then he's like.

26:21.460 --> 26:23.460
And then I try to turn it into a bit.

26:23.460 --> 26:24.460
I try to be like.

26:24.460 --> 26:28.460
Read out the texts from the dealer and I'll respond as you.

26:28.460 --> 26:30.460
And I try to make it funny.

26:30.460 --> 26:33.460
And then instead, Brad responds honestly on your response.

26:33.460 --> 26:38.460
Honestly, a mirror just powers through doesn't respond it all in a funny way.

26:38.460 --> 26:39.460
Like, this is a comedy podcast.

26:39.460 --> 26:41.460
Or is this an advice podcast?

26:41.460 --> 26:44.460
Because I have a lot of advice to do a lot to other people on how to be good.

26:45.460 --> 26:46.460
How to be good.

26:48.460 --> 26:51.460
I think it's a comedy podcast, not an advice podcast.

26:51.460 --> 26:54.460
So why don't you give me something to fucking work with?

26:54.460 --> 26:57.460
Let's give me something to talk about.

26:57.460 --> 26:58.460
He did.

26:58.460 --> 27:00.460
He did.

27:00.460 --> 27:02.460
Faith.

27:02.460 --> 27:05.460
What do you like least about your current role and when?

27:05.460 --> 27:07.460
I'm here.

27:07.460 --> 27:08.460
Is that your answer?

27:08.460 --> 27:10.460
Are you telling me to talk?

27:10.460 --> 27:11.460
Both.

27:11.460 --> 27:12.460
Both.

27:12.460 --> 27:13.460
That's your answer.

27:13.460 --> 27:15.460
Moving on to you.

27:15.460 --> 27:20.460
I guess I don't like administrative Zoom meetings where I'm not being as creative

27:20.460 --> 27:22.460
I'm being more like managerial.

27:22.460 --> 27:27.460
He's talking about this one.

27:27.460 --> 27:32.460
I also don't like telling people know if they're like, we want to be on head

27:32.460 --> 27:33.460
gun.

27:33.460 --> 27:34.460
This is our show.

27:34.460 --> 27:37.460
And we obviously can't take everybody's podcasts.

27:37.460 --> 27:38.460
So a lot of times.

27:38.460 --> 27:39.460
Not me personal.

27:39.460 --> 27:41.460
But yeah, we have to like, as a diver.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.460
Have to let people down.

27:42.460 --> 27:45.460
We should divert as many resources as possible to this show.

27:45.460 --> 27:48.460
So it's like we have to say no to people with.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.460
I was going to say dead battery.

27:50.460 --> 27:53.460
This show is basically training us.

27:53.460 --> 27:58.460
You're a dead battery of a man.

27:58.460 --> 28:01.460
You're at it.

28:01.460 --> 28:04.460
Like I'm holding Jeff.

28:04.460 --> 28:07.460
Oh, another Jeff.

28:08.460 --> 28:11.460
Guys, I'm holding two Jeffs.

28:11.460 --> 28:12.460
I'm not.

28:12.460 --> 28:13.460
I'm possible.

28:13.460 --> 28:15.460
I'm one of a kind.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.460
Just joking.

28:17.460 --> 28:18.460
Yeah.

28:18.460 --> 28:19.460
Yeah.

28:19.460 --> 28:20.460
Well, I didn't land as a joke.

28:20.460 --> 28:23.460
It landed as that's how you really feel.

28:23.460 --> 28:24.460
And that's not bad.

28:24.460 --> 28:26.460
Brad just went second.

28:26.460 --> 28:27.460
I appreciate your support in this room.

28:27.460 --> 28:28.460
I'm not.

28:28.460 --> 28:30.460
That's the view at all.

28:30.460 --> 28:31.460
A mirror.

28:31.460 --> 28:34.460
That hit me in my archetypal center.

28:34.460 --> 28:36.460
I know I might not recover from.

28:36.460 --> 28:38.460
I don't think you're using that word correctly.

28:38.460 --> 28:39.460
I don't think so either.

28:39.460 --> 28:43.460
I think I appreciate the support from you on.

28:43.460 --> 28:44.460
Yeah.

28:44.460 --> 28:47.460
But it wasn't me in this moment.

28:47.460 --> 28:50.460
That wasn't all right with me.

28:50.460 --> 28:54.460
I don't care about you, dude.

28:54.460 --> 28:57.460
I don't care about you, dude.

28:57.460 --> 28:59.460
I like it when you've got a smile.

28:59.460 --> 29:01.460
But like you bring that to the podcast.

29:01.460 --> 29:02.460
And it's not happy.

29:02.460 --> 29:04.460
That's what I'm doing right now.

29:04.460 --> 29:05.460
Yeah.

29:05.460 --> 29:12.460
I'm sacrificing you for the better good at the show.

29:12.460 --> 29:18.460
My least favorite thing about my role is that I don't get to be there with you guys.

29:18.460 --> 29:19.460
Then move.

29:19.460 --> 29:21.460
He can't look at all that stuff.

29:21.460 --> 29:22.460
Yeah.

29:22.460 --> 29:23.460
I got all this shit.

29:23.460 --> 29:25.460
I won't go win it.

29:25.460 --> 29:26.460
Um.

29:26.460 --> 29:34.460
What are two to three things I could do to differently slash better manage.

29:34.460 --> 29:36.460
You.

29:36.460 --> 29:38.460
You don't.

29:38.460 --> 29:41.460
Say that again.

29:41.460 --> 29:43.460
On you said.

29:43.460 --> 29:46.460
Speak to that a little more.

29:46.460 --> 29:49.460
Can you guys sort of ask about that?

29:49.460 --> 29:50.460
Speak on again.

29:50.460 --> 29:54.460
So that would actually explain a lot if you thought you were our manager the whole time.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.460
Is that what it's like?

29:55.460 --> 29:56.460
Is that what it's like?

29:56.460 --> 29:57.460
That's true.

29:57.460 --> 29:58.460
It's not true.

29:58.460 --> 30:02.460
And it would explain why you think it's okay not to respond to like our slacks and text.

30:02.460 --> 30:03.460
Yeah.

30:03.460 --> 30:04.460
You know, hosts.

30:04.460 --> 30:05.460
Right?

30:05.460 --> 30:09.460
They're usually like the fucking boss.

30:09.460 --> 30:10.460
No.

30:10.460 --> 30:13.460
She me fall and paying all of his writers.

30:13.460 --> 30:14.460
Right?

30:14.460 --> 30:15.460
Drew Barry.

30:15.460 --> 30:18.460
You are that you are making good.

30:18.460 --> 30:19.460
Connections.

30:19.460 --> 30:21.460
Like if you're like anyone.

30:21.460 --> 30:22.460
At head gum.

30:22.460 --> 30:28.460
You're the Jimmy Fallon of this place.

30:28.460 --> 30:31.460
They're the Jimmy Fallon of head gum.

30:31.460 --> 30:32.460
Yeah.

30:33.460 --> 30:34.460
Yeah.

30:34.460 --> 30:35.460
People are saying good.

30:35.460 --> 30:40.460
I sort of bring joy instead of like alcoholism.

30:40.460 --> 30:43.460
You're like the sober Jimmy Fallon.

30:43.460 --> 30:44.460
That's worse.

30:44.460 --> 30:45.460
That's worse.

30:45.460 --> 30:49.460
He adds that, you know, he's struggling with something.

30:49.460 --> 30:50.460
You're saying, I'm fine.

30:50.460 --> 30:53.460
And I still create a toxic environment.

30:53.460 --> 30:56.460
Well, we didn't find.

30:57.460 --> 31:02.460
Amir, I really appreciate the support.

31:02.460 --> 31:03.460
Why?

31:03.460 --> 31:05.460
I haven't said anything to support you.

31:05.460 --> 31:08.460
Silence is complicity.

31:08.460 --> 31:11.460
Sacrifice is fate.

31:11.460 --> 31:13.460
Silence is fullicity.

31:13.460 --> 31:14.460
That's good.

31:14.460 --> 31:17.460
But we're not all the way to know what that is.

31:17.460 --> 31:23.460
Do you even remember how big of a deal it was when fullicity cut our hair

31:23.460 --> 31:25.460
or were you like four at the time?

31:25.460 --> 31:27.460
I don't know what you're that was.

31:27.460 --> 31:28.460
Exactly.

31:28.460 --> 31:29.460
I don't know what that was.

31:29.460 --> 31:30.460
I tell us ass.

31:30.460 --> 31:34.460
And he was like season three of fullicity.

31:34.460 --> 31:35.460
So when was that?

31:35.460 --> 31:37.460
Carry Russell cut her hair.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.460
Her hair kind of looked like Jeff's and then she cut it.

31:39.460 --> 31:40.460
And she looked bad.

31:40.460 --> 31:41.460
It was a big deal.

31:41.460 --> 31:42.460
Wasn't there what I think?

31:42.460 --> 31:43.460
That would have been 2001.

31:43.460 --> 31:45.460
So I would have been, yeah, four.

31:45.460 --> 31:47.460
You guys remember the Rachel?

31:47.460 --> 31:48.460
Oh, my God.

31:48.460 --> 31:50.460
I had that.

31:50.460 --> 31:54.460
I had a Bob with layers.

31:55.460 --> 31:58.460
From my barber Bob.

31:58.460 --> 32:01.460
And he basically gave me the Rachel.

32:01.460 --> 32:03.460
Before he really laid.

32:03.460 --> 32:06.460
He opened up over years.

32:06.460 --> 32:08.460
Last years.

32:08.460 --> 32:14.460
Can I get the Rachel?

32:14.460 --> 32:16.460
Says a mirror.

32:16.460 --> 32:19.460
Um.

32:19.460 --> 32:22.460
Or would we beat who are we on friends?

32:23.460 --> 32:24.460
On friends?

32:24.460 --> 32:27.460
I mean, I'm obviously Chandler, right?

32:27.460 --> 32:28.460
No.

32:28.460 --> 32:29.460
No.

32:29.460 --> 32:30.460
No.

32:30.460 --> 32:31.460
Joey.

32:31.460 --> 32:32.460
Because you're a fucking idiot.

32:32.460 --> 32:34.460
A lady's mom.

32:34.460 --> 32:35.460
He's a lot.

32:35.460 --> 32:37.460
Yeah, you're housing.

32:37.460 --> 32:38.460
Cran.

32:38.460 --> 32:39.460
Everything's on Ross.

32:39.460 --> 32:41.460
But I'm probably Chandler.

32:41.460 --> 32:44.460
You're like a Ross Chandler, hybrid.

32:44.460 --> 32:45.460
I think you're Joey.

32:45.460 --> 32:46.460
Wait.

32:46.460 --> 32:47.460
Who's Joey?

32:47.460 --> 32:48.460
Jeff is Joey.

32:48.460 --> 32:49.460
He's a dumb ass.

32:49.460 --> 32:50.460
No, you're a dumb ass.

32:51.460 --> 32:55.460
Joey would think someone's the Joey when he's the Joey.

32:55.460 --> 32:56.460
Jeff, honestly.

32:56.460 --> 32:58.460
You even show up to the record.

32:58.460 --> 32:59.460
Jeff.

32:59.460 --> 33:00.460
I missed her heckles.

33:00.460 --> 33:01.460
The neighborhood.

33:01.460 --> 33:04.460
He's ugly naked guy.

33:04.460 --> 33:06.460
I mean, this.

33:06.460 --> 33:07.460
Since really not even making a joke.

33:07.460 --> 33:09.460
Jeff, you would be Phoebe.

33:09.460 --> 33:10.460
No, I'm that sucks.

33:10.460 --> 33:12.460
No, Phoebe's great.

33:12.460 --> 33:13.460
You know.

33:13.460 --> 33:15.460
I don't think that's.

33:15.460 --> 33:18.460
This is not that I had no negative or positive connotations.

33:19.460 --> 33:20.460
Yeah.

33:20.460 --> 33:21.460
Listen.

33:21.460 --> 33:24.460
Because he's spiritual.

33:24.460 --> 33:29.460
Don't ever speak on me or my faith, the faith, the faith.

33:29.460 --> 33:32.460
Uh, it's not really faith.

33:32.460 --> 33:34.460
I have a question.

33:34.460 --> 33:35.460
Why?

33:35.460 --> 33:40.460
How come you haven't done any of your regular segments today?

33:40.460 --> 33:42.460
That's fine.

33:42.460 --> 33:44.460
Can go bond to the week.

33:44.460 --> 33:45.460
Do you want to do bond to the week?

33:45.460 --> 33:47.460
We can fucking make it up as we go.

33:47.460 --> 33:50.460
But usually we have, we play in the cell.

33:50.460 --> 33:55.460
I just feel like sometimes like you need a disruptor week where we don't do any of the

33:55.460 --> 33:56.460
normal stuff.

33:56.460 --> 34:00.460
Truly, I was laying awake nights this weekend, this holiday weekend,

34:00.460 --> 34:05.460
being like, we haven't actually talked about the network for years.

34:05.460 --> 34:06.460
Right?

34:06.460 --> 34:07.460
We haven't done a state of the gum.

34:07.460 --> 34:08.460
We haven't done a.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.460
Is that a thing you used to do?

34:10.460 --> 34:13.460
Yeah, you don't even know what it is because if we stop doing it before

34:13.460 --> 34:15.460
you started here two years ago.

34:16.460 --> 34:17.460
So let's.

34:17.460 --> 34:21.460
Are people asking for it back, though?

34:21.460 --> 34:23.460
People within the network specifically Marie.

34:23.460 --> 34:26.460
Sound off below.

34:26.460 --> 34:28.460
Do you want state of the gum back?

34:28.460 --> 34:31.460
And smash that like button while you're at it.

34:31.460 --> 34:32.460
That's a good point.

34:32.460 --> 34:33.460
Oh, subscribe.

34:33.460 --> 34:35.460
What's actually happening in the front?

34:35.460 --> 34:36.460
Sure, with a front, with a front.

34:36.460 --> 34:38.460
We're not allowed to talk about the fucking recapture, sorry.

34:38.460 --> 34:41.460
We're completely not allowed to talk about it.

34:41.460 --> 34:42.460
What does that mean?

34:42.460 --> 34:43.460
It's out.

34:43.460 --> 34:44.460
It's all out.

34:44.460 --> 34:47.460
So then what's there to talk about?

34:47.460 --> 34:50.460
Yeah, let's talk about another show on this podcast.

34:50.460 --> 34:52.460
Yeah, I just, I guess.

34:52.460 --> 34:56.460
Just fucking plugging other things with the network, trying to like foster cash.

34:56.460 --> 34:58.460
Well, technically that's not a head-ghost.

34:58.460 --> 34:59.460
Foster cash.

34:59.460 --> 35:02.460
It's what I heard for reading.

35:02.460 --> 35:05.460
So what's the most exciting signing recently?

35:05.460 --> 35:10.460
Two head-gum and not some bullshit that Katie put together.

35:10.460 --> 35:12.460
Bullshit.

35:12.460 --> 35:15.460
She could pull the plug on you so fast.

35:15.460 --> 35:16.460
Really?

35:16.460 --> 35:18.460
She signs your checks, babe.

35:18.460 --> 35:19.460
You can't be doing that.

35:19.460 --> 35:22.460
You'll never hear that because she doesn't listen to the show.

35:22.460 --> 35:23.460
True.

35:23.460 --> 35:25.460
But I'll play it for her.

35:25.460 --> 35:28.460
No, because she sort of holds my feet to the fire on a weekly basis.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.460
Yeah.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.460
Yeah.

35:30.460 --> 35:31.460
Whether she reaches out or not.

35:31.460 --> 35:32.460
Because when she doesn't.

35:32.460 --> 35:33.460
She wants nothing to do with you.

35:33.460 --> 35:35.460
So I'd say, add her it's harder.

35:35.460 --> 35:42.460
We got some exciting new developments happening in October.

35:42.460 --> 35:43.460
But I don't want to say them yet.

35:43.460 --> 35:46.460
Because this episode comes out Friday, September 22nd.

35:46.460 --> 35:49.460
Was that in 12 hours?

35:49.460 --> 35:52.460
Anything happening in the next 12 hours?

35:52.460 --> 35:53.460
Yeah.

35:53.460 --> 35:56.460
We have for you to have a busy time editing this, right?

35:56.460 --> 35:57.460
As soon as the sense.

35:57.460 --> 35:59.460
I don't think anything's going to get cut so far.

35:59.460 --> 36:01.460
It's all been at the very least bronze.

36:01.460 --> 36:03.460
What about that one thing you said?

36:03.460 --> 36:05.460
That's gone.

36:05.460 --> 36:06.460
The other thing you said.

36:06.460 --> 36:08.460
No, nothing is going to get cut.

36:08.460 --> 36:09.460
No.

36:09.460 --> 36:12.460
Um, we have a new show called Fusballs.

36:12.460 --> 36:13.460
Oh, yeah.

36:13.460 --> 36:15.460
The fantasy football podcast.

36:15.460 --> 36:16.460
Yes.

36:16.460 --> 36:18.460
The fantasy football.

36:18.460 --> 36:19.460
Bending on sports.

36:19.460 --> 36:21.460
Sounds awful.

36:21.460 --> 36:23.460
I have to come on, man.

36:23.460 --> 36:24.460
No.

36:24.460 --> 36:25.460
I appreciate it.

36:25.460 --> 36:27.460
But it's a great show.

36:27.460 --> 36:29.460
If you're into betting on sports.

36:30.460 --> 36:31.460
Amir likes that.

36:31.460 --> 36:33.460
That's why this show that has probably.

36:33.460 --> 36:35.460
I mean, how many listeners does it have?

36:35.460 --> 36:36.460
400.

36:36.460 --> 36:37.460
This show?

36:37.460 --> 36:38.460
Yeah.

36:38.460 --> 36:40.460
The Hedigan podcast?

36:40.460 --> 36:41.460
No.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.460
Fusball.

36:42.460 --> 36:43.460
Oh.

36:43.460 --> 36:44.460
Balls.

36:44.460 --> 36:46.460
Probably more than the Hedigan podcast.

36:46.460 --> 36:47.460
Yeah.

36:47.460 --> 36:48.460
Definitely.

36:48.460 --> 36:51.460
Because they like funny hosts and famous guests and stuff like that.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.460
Add to Paul Shear was on this episode.

36:53.460 --> 36:54.460
Yeah.

36:54.460 --> 36:56.460
I get to share on this show.

36:56.460 --> 36:58.460
Can you imagine wasting Paul Shear's time with this show?

36:58.460 --> 37:01.460
I could easily describe.

37:01.460 --> 37:02.460
I couldn't live with myself.

37:02.460 --> 37:04.460
You can't live with yourself now.

37:04.460 --> 37:08.460
You said that there was like a two and a half hour ordeal from 8 a.m.

37:08.460 --> 37:09.460
To the start of this show.

37:09.460 --> 37:12.460
It seemed house related or not.

37:12.460 --> 37:14.460
I think it was for sure.

37:14.460 --> 37:17.460
I think it was crafting a text to the mechanic.

37:17.460 --> 37:20.460
I haven't heard back about.

37:20.460 --> 37:21.460
Should we call him?

37:21.460 --> 37:22.460
Did you send it?

37:22.460 --> 37:23.460
I can't believe it.

37:23.460 --> 37:25.460
Which mechanic did you get given to?

37:25.460 --> 37:27.460
A caliber collision.

37:27.460 --> 37:28.460
Oh.

37:28.460 --> 37:29.460
They're good.

37:29.460 --> 37:30.460
Are they?

37:30.460 --> 37:33.460
I really need to take my truck into the shop because it's been falling apart at the

37:33.460 --> 37:36.460
seas because people keep bumping into the bombs.

37:36.460 --> 37:39.460
It's funny.

37:39.460 --> 37:40.460
It's funny.

37:40.460 --> 37:41.460
No one knows about the car.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.460
It's like a car.

37:42.460 --> 37:46.460
It's like that is like fucked up.

37:46.460 --> 37:47.460
It's so fucking hot.

37:47.460 --> 37:48.460
True.

37:48.460 --> 37:50.460
I really tried.

37:50.460 --> 37:51.460
I really tried.

37:51.460 --> 37:56.460
I thought we had 33 minutes of good shit.

37:56.460 --> 38:01.460
And then the last six minutes has been nonsense.

38:01.460 --> 38:02.460
Nothing else.

38:02.460 --> 38:07.460
Why don't you have a mic stand?

38:07.460 --> 38:08.460
I did.

38:08.460 --> 38:11.460
I had a mic arm but it doesn't attach to this table.

38:11.460 --> 38:17.460
It attached to my old desk that I had to sell because I don't have the space for it anymore.

38:17.460 --> 38:21.460
Well, there's no possible way to fix that problem.

38:21.460 --> 38:25.460
So I guess you just got to hold the mic forever now.

38:26.460 --> 38:29.460
It's kind of a cool.

38:29.460 --> 38:31.460
It's kind of a cool look.

38:31.460 --> 38:35.460
It's just surprising choice.

38:35.460 --> 38:41.460
For someone that like has a comedy podcast network to like, you know, we have mic

38:41.460 --> 38:42.460
arms and mic sounds.

38:42.460 --> 38:47.460
You ain't him.

38:47.460 --> 38:52.460
You're not that guy.

38:52.460 --> 38:56.460
I don't want you to love it.

38:56.460 --> 39:02.460
Everyone look guys.

39:02.460 --> 39:06.460
You're a dead double A.

39:06.460 --> 39:09.460
You're a dead double A and hard bark.

39:09.460 --> 39:11.460
Assid.

39:11.460 --> 39:14.460
You're battery acid.

39:14.460 --> 39:20.460
What else do I got to hear?

39:20.460 --> 39:27.460
It's a prop comic now.

39:27.460 --> 39:30.460
Another battery which you've already done.

39:30.460 --> 39:35.460
No, that's for it's bees.

39:35.460 --> 39:38.460
Battery.

39:38.460 --> 39:40.460
Oh my god.

39:40.460 --> 39:43.460
Everything tubular is energy to you.

39:43.460 --> 39:45.460
That's a problem.

39:45.460 --> 39:48.460
That's the problem.

39:49.460 --> 39:51.460
Why do you hold that up when we were waxing?

39:51.460 --> 39:55.460
If you're a prop comic, it's pretty good actually.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.460
What if that were later?

39:57.460 --> 39:59.460
Nope, because we already did it.

39:59.460 --> 40:00.460
We already said it.

40:00.460 --> 40:01.460
Here we go.

40:01.460 --> 40:04.460
Last couple of questions.

40:04.460 --> 40:09.460
Usually there's like different segments and like they're fun.

40:09.460 --> 40:12.460
You never do segments when I'm on the show.

40:12.460 --> 40:14.460
You think you can't handle it.

40:14.460 --> 40:16.460
I've never gotten to play Jeff Erdy.

40:16.460 --> 40:20.460
To be honest, I give segments to people who need it.

40:20.460 --> 40:24.460
And I'm sorry for assuming that you could carry the show without a segment.

40:24.460 --> 40:26.460
I mean, I think I'll stop doing that.

40:26.460 --> 40:27.460
I'll stop.

40:27.460 --> 40:29.460
I'll stop you doing.

40:29.460 --> 40:30.460
Maybe you that surface.

40:30.460 --> 40:32.460
I'll stop doing you that honor.

40:32.460 --> 40:34.460
I'll start bringing my life for Jeff Erdy.

40:34.460 --> 40:37.460
Which I usually do for guests who don't know the show.

40:37.460 --> 40:38.460
So that they have a way.

40:38.460 --> 40:41.460
You can dox them as efficiently as possible.

40:41.460 --> 40:42.460
Hey.

40:42.460 --> 40:45.460
The star of the show is here.

40:46.460 --> 40:49.460
Look at the little guy.

40:49.460 --> 40:53.460
Under by missing 40 every other tooth is gone.

40:53.460 --> 40:55.460
He's beautiful.

40:55.460 --> 40:57.460
He's he's good.

40:57.460 --> 40:58.460
He's a good dog.

40:58.460 --> 41:00.460
I really couldn't even make a joke.

41:00.460 --> 41:01.460
I tried to.

41:01.460 --> 41:02.460
But I can't.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.460
There's no problem that I have.

41:03.460 --> 41:04.460
I don't have any problem with Luke.

41:04.460 --> 41:06.460
Well, he's been working the whole time.

41:06.460 --> 41:07.460
So I thought if I brought him in here.

41:07.460 --> 41:09.460
No, I can't hear the microphone.

41:09.460 --> 41:10.460
Can you?

41:10.460 --> 41:13.460
Imagine if you had a problem with his show.

41:13.460 --> 41:16.460
What would that be?

41:16.460 --> 41:17.460
What would that be?

41:17.460 --> 41:19.460
What would that be?

41:19.460 --> 41:24.460
He sniffed my crotch in front of a crowd.

41:24.460 --> 41:28.460
Making it a fear like I hadn't shoured.

41:28.460 --> 41:31.460
And that was fine with me.

41:31.460 --> 41:34.460
I had.

41:34.460 --> 41:35.460
Fucking.

41:35.460 --> 41:38.460
How do you think your role helps the company succeed?

41:38.460 --> 41:39.460
And then we'll go.

41:39.460 --> 41:41.460
We got to just because it's 11.

41:41.460 --> 41:42.460
We got to.

41:42.460 --> 41:44.460
It's only been three minutes.

41:44.460 --> 41:45.460
Fine.

41:45.460 --> 41:46.460
That's unbelievable.

41:46.460 --> 41:47.460
That's unbelievable.

41:47.460 --> 41:48.460
Yeah.

41:48.460 --> 41:49.460
Going on.

41:49.460 --> 41:50.460
Let's fucking get this over with this.

41:50.460 --> 41:51.460
What about all that stuff?

41:51.460 --> 41:52.460
Why don't you cut?

41:55.460 --> 41:56.460
Brass.

41:56.460 --> 41:57.460
Fucking.

41:57.460 --> 41:59.460
What are you got?

41:59.460 --> 42:00.460
Fuck this.

42:00.460 --> 42:02.460
It's a TikTok song.

42:02.460 --> 42:03.460
All right.

42:03.460 --> 42:05.460
I'm trying to get younger.

42:05.460 --> 42:06.460
You know, it's a TikTok song.

42:06.460 --> 42:09.460
I really like is the Doja cat paint the town red song.

42:09.460 --> 42:10.460
Doja.

42:11.460 --> 42:12.460
Doja.

42:12.460 --> 42:13.460
Beautiful.

42:13.460 --> 42:14.460
Yeah.

42:14.460 --> 42:15.460
Exactly.

42:15.460 --> 42:17.460
I said what I said.

42:17.460 --> 42:18.460
I bet.

42:18.460 --> 42:19.460
Debbie.

42:19.460 --> 42:20.460
Famous.

42:20.460 --> 42:21.460
Yes.

42:21.460 --> 42:24.460
I feel like the way you put down Doja.

42:24.460 --> 42:25.460
It was like D.O.

42:25.460 --> 42:27.460
C.H.

42:27.460 --> 42:28.460
Oh, Doja.

42:28.460 --> 42:30.460
But just not how you pronounce her name.

42:30.460 --> 42:31.460
I don't think.

42:31.460 --> 42:32.460
Am I wrong?

42:32.460 --> 42:34.460
Oh, he's muted.

42:34.460 --> 42:36.460
I'm muted him to get through plugs.

42:36.460 --> 42:38.460
But then Brad said we aren't plugging.

42:38.460 --> 42:41.460
This is the first time I've ever felt like I'm not the one hosting the show.

42:41.460 --> 42:42.460
It seems like Brad is.

42:42.460 --> 42:43.460
So take it away.

42:43.460 --> 42:44.460
Brad.

42:44.460 --> 42:46.460
Okay.

42:46.460 --> 42:48.460
Welcome back to the headgun podcast.

42:48.460 --> 42:49.460
It's not a radio show.

42:49.460 --> 42:50.460
Sorry.

42:50.460 --> 42:51.460
One second.

42:51.460 --> 42:52.460
On the internet.

42:52.460 --> 42:55.460
Hosted by Get Free Jane.

42:55.460 --> 42:58.460
I'm going to show this week.

42:58.460 --> 42:59.460
We got it.

42:59.460 --> 43:01.460
Don't get me.

43:01.460 --> 43:03.460
Don't let her.

43:03.460 --> 43:05.460
Don't get lost in the dust.

43:05.460 --> 43:06.460
Don't.

43:06.460 --> 43:08.460
Don't get off you because we got on.

43:08.460 --> 43:09.460
Yeah.

43:09.460 --> 43:10.460
That's pretty good.

43:10.460 --> 43:11.460
Bring it up.

43:11.460 --> 43:12.460
The frontal.

43:12.460 --> 43:14.460
We've got it.

43:14.460 --> 43:15.460
Yeah.

43:15.460 --> 43:18.460
Let's start it off with everyone's favorite segment.

43:18.460 --> 43:21.460
Should we start a quarter of the week?

43:21.460 --> 43:23.460
What's that we're going to do?

43:23.460 --> 43:24.460
Of course.

43:24.460 --> 43:31.460
It's a segment where I'm talking about who is going to be cast as the new Harry Potter in the

43:32.460 --> 43:34.460
Age of the Nation of Harry Potter.

43:34.460 --> 43:35.460
Amir.

43:35.460 --> 43:37.460
Who do you have for Potter of the week?

43:37.460 --> 43:38.460
Ooh.

43:38.460 --> 43:40.460
I'm going to go with.

43:40.460 --> 43:41.460
Daniel.

43:41.460 --> 43:42.460
Dale Lewis.

43:42.460 --> 43:43.460
Why.

43:43.460 --> 43:44.460
Sound by.

43:44.460 --> 43:45.460
Yeah.

43:45.460 --> 43:46.460
I connect to my Soundboard actually.

43:46.460 --> 43:47.460
Jeff.

43:47.460 --> 43:48.460
Can you have one?

43:48.460 --> 43:49.460
I don't fucking know.

43:49.460 --> 43:50.460
Do you have that?

43:50.460 --> 43:51.460
Fine.

43:51.460 --> 43:53.460
Soundboard for my podcast.

43:53.460 --> 43:55.460
You don't do a podcast?

43:55.460 --> 43:56.460
Yeah.

43:56.460 --> 43:57.460
It's called podcast.

43:57.460 --> 43:59.460
Launching soon.

43:59.460 --> 44:00.460
Why is it not on headgun?

44:01.460 --> 44:02.460
Because I am nobody.

44:02.460 --> 44:04.460
Because we're busy making this show.

44:04.460 --> 44:05.460
Yeah.

44:05.460 --> 44:08.460
Well, now that I'm hosting this show, headgun podcast.

44:08.460 --> 44:15.460
It's as I can't do screen sharing.

44:15.460 --> 44:17.460
I'm going to do it right there.

44:30.460 --> 44:35.460
That was a hit dumb original.

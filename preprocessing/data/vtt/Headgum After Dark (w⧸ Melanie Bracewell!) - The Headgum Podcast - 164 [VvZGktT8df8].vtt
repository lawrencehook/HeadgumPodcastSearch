00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
You guys ready?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
I see all like this stuff.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
I'm not listening.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Is it that bad?

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
Why don't you do it?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Give it that's the same thing.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
That's the same thing.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
What do you mean by taking it up here in the room?

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Oh no, it's more balanced.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
It's better.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
It's like, alright.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
That's fine.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
It's even fucking weird.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
He says you're going to wear a necklace.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
No, he's kind of...

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
He's kind of...

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
I don't think I can do this in here.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
It's always been similar.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
It's always been similar.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
This is a little bit coming in the right.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
He's scared.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
He's scared.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I was about to hear about you and play me.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm going after a dark.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I was going that time.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
I was going that time.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I was going that time.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I said that when I walked in.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
You walked in with a spin-drip.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
That's what you meant to say.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
I didn't walk in with a spin-drip.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
He did say he had him after dark.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
So I don't know if that was like you quoting him or like...

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
That was me saying it for the first time or like...

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
I said it on the way in.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Yeah.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
And I said it at the same time.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
I thought it.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Melanie Bracewell on the show all the way from New Zealand.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
I was...

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I was just for this which is crazy.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
I want a bed trip.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
The genuinely feels like it because I'm staying in Santa Monica.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
And I had to take an hour and a half.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
But again.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Oh my god.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
I forget how big L.I. is.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Oh my god.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Oh my god.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
It's fine.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
That is...

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
It's like...

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Worth it.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Worth it.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Ladies.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Don't ever.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Sorry.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
I'm still soaring off of the powerhouse women episode.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
We...

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
You heard.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
What's that?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Yeah.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
I didn't say anything.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
I mean I started to say...

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I had to go back after dark.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Right?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
So?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
So the energy's got a fun.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Is it not...

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
So it's like when you're recording during daylight.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Well...

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Seriously.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
All business and working hours.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
So this is fun you.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Which is...

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Yeah.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
What is happening before?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Because you was like a mess before too.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
It already feels worse.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Really?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Plug your guys and stuff up top.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
We'll get up.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Do you all have a lot going on?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
We haven't proven ourselves.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
I'm serious too.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
All right.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I'm editing this crazy too because it's...

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Oh.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
I had gone after dark.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Say it with me.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Obviously.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
What do you want?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Like what gets us out of the room the fastest.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
There are only 57 minutes of joy and sort of an aspirational hour of wisdom.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
I'm...

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I'm very...

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
I've recorded my Uber.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
I think I was going to...

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
I was going to ask you to get back at the hour and a half just to think about this.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Why is everybody already soured on the idea of the podcast?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
No, I'm excited to see what you've got in store.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah, okay.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
I've literally told Daniel as I was getting ready to come here.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I'm like, I don't have to do any more.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.200
have to do anything. I don't have to prep anything. This isn't my show. Yeah. I don't have to

03:24.200 --> 03:29.680
try. You didn't bring anything? There's like 20 minutes that I was like, oh, Riley will

03:29.680 --> 03:37.080
fill that. I wish I wouldn't know. I mean, I can do it. I have something. What do you have

03:37.080 --> 03:40.680
a little something? You always bring something. You don't need to do it today. I've also

03:40.680 --> 03:43.920
saying plug your shit because Melanie doesn't know who you guys, well, she knows Riley. I

03:43.920 --> 03:47.520
don't know who the fuck you are. It's nice to meet you by the way. I have a podcast called

03:47.520 --> 03:53.480
Perfect Person. It's calling my god. I said you didn't want to plug. It has a lot of

03:53.480 --> 03:57.480
listeners. So you're actually sitting with podcast royalty. I don't know about that. I mean,

03:57.480 --> 04:04.200
yeah, we do. Okay, listen, nice. That one is like doing very well. So if someone goes, now we do

04:04.200 --> 04:11.560
okay. It's like 100 million listeners to pop. That's too many. So many listeners that you

04:11.560 --> 04:18.320
get rolled up on by the pops. Yeah, and that was a pop. So watch the level. Melanie's

04:18.320 --> 04:24.040
like the most famous Kiwi in the world though. That's not true at all. Who is? Don't say

04:24.040 --> 04:28.720
the prime minister. Can you do this all service? I didn't. Would be pretty high up there. Do

04:28.720 --> 04:33.000
you want to do your Jacinda? Rose McIver, you know Rose McIver, she's doing pretty well.

04:33.000 --> 04:39.520
She's a hardcore citizen. I thought. Why what makes you think that? I don't fucking care.

04:39.520 --> 04:46.040
You can be a citizen of somewhere else but like be originally from a different place. Don't

04:46.040 --> 04:52.240
ex-confuse. Don't. I have a question for you. So Miles is like a billionaire with a million

04:52.240 --> 04:57.280
listeners. Sorry, 100 million listeners. 100 million pop. Melanie is the most famous Kiwi

04:57.280 --> 05:02.440
ever. What's my thing? Riley also has a really successful podcast. No, no, no, no. It's like

05:02.440 --> 05:06.600
it has to be different than Miles. Yes. It just got into that. Well, I know one big

05:06.600 --> 05:11.560
town to the actor producer. Well, you're missing the thing. You're going to be like super

05:11.560 --> 05:16.680
model of the world. Yeah, so you wanted me to be really excited. You don't do those things.

05:16.680 --> 05:22.400
I was going to say, oh, you were just having fun. The curtain bangs didn't come up. That's fine.

05:22.400 --> 05:26.400
We don't have to talk about it. Why would that be offensive if I talked about your hair? No,

05:26.400 --> 05:32.800
it's just shows to offer that Riley is really excited. You just got the curtain bangs. I got

05:33.040 --> 05:39.800
a couple months ago, but honestly Miles, I got them turned recently. Yeah. That's damn right.

05:39.800 --> 05:45.040
Yeah. Yeah. I can't. You're just got into the New York comedy festival. We're talking

05:45.040 --> 05:50.680
about your bangs. I described my bangs as an accessory that I have all the time. That's

05:50.680 --> 05:54.440
what I'm going to show there. What do you want to put? You're doing what is it? A charity

05:54.440 --> 06:01.480
fundraiser? That's what this feels like. Yeah. Yeah. I was going to say that. I'm

06:01.480 --> 06:13.400
sure. So what do you guys up to later? So I actually have just some stuff I wanted. So fast.

06:13.400 --> 06:18.000
So fast that he's bringing this up. Well, I guess I just wanted to all say it will do

06:18.000 --> 06:21.640
a little thing where I'll say a quote. Okay. And you guys tell me what you think. I got

06:21.640 --> 06:28.680
you actually brought a little something. I did bring a little something. I think it is just

06:28.680 --> 06:38.400
leaving you. He's the camera not squared up on me. Oh my God. This is an outrage. This

06:38.400 --> 06:42.000
is an outrage. You just talk like normal on the show. Like if you didn't acknowledge that

06:42.000 --> 06:45.600
I was up, people wouldn't have seen me up and it wouldn't have been the rest of the show. His

06:45.600 --> 06:49.600
island would have moved. And people would have been like, why is this island moving? Let's

06:49.600 --> 06:57.480
correct. I don't, though. But if I did, I would have taken a fence. Wait, you're changing

06:57.480 --> 07:05.800
every camera. That's crazy. And one of the chances. If you just like randomly adjusted

07:05.800 --> 07:09.200
it, they would be like, these are enough cameras that one of them should be in focus.

07:09.200 --> 07:14.320
It's just like why would they ever be out of focus? The producer can was fine. I think

07:14.320 --> 07:20.640
a great comedian is someone who can play a language like an instrument. Jeffrey Jane. We're

07:20.800 --> 07:29.160
honest. We're obviously cutting this. We're cutting this. Why? Why? Because he also said

07:29.160 --> 07:35.160
a couple other choice things in here. Oh my, please, what's from Jeff? This is an interview

07:35.160 --> 07:45.640
with Jeff from who gives a shit. This is the earliest we've ever cut to break. No way.

07:45.880 --> 07:57.240
I want to get more. This show is sponsored by BetterHelp. Guys, sometimes you feel uncertain

07:57.240 --> 08:00.760
about where you're going in life, right? You don't know what the right path is or how

08:00.760 --> 08:05.200
you're going to get through it. But that's true of all of life. We're always faced with

08:05.200 --> 08:09.200
tough choices and the path is not always clear. You know, whether you're dealing with

08:09.200 --> 08:14.480
decisions around career, relationships or anything else, therapy helps you stay connected

08:14.560 --> 08:18.160
to what you really want while you navigate life so that you can move forward with confidence

08:18.160 --> 08:22.560
and excitement. Trusting yourself to make decisions that align with your values is like

08:22.560 --> 08:26.720
anything. The more you practice it, the easier it gets. I'm in therapy every week, you know,

08:26.720 --> 08:32.880
I hope it shows. And I do it because I want to better myself. I want to constantly be evolving

08:32.880 --> 08:37.440
hopefully towards a better, more evolved version of myself. And that's why I'm in therapy.

08:37.440 --> 08:41.040
That's why therapy is worth giving a try. And if you're not going to do it for you,

08:41.120 --> 08:45.120
at least do it for the people around you so that you can show up as the best version of yourself.

08:45.120 --> 08:49.040
So if you're thinking of starting therapy, give better help a try. It's entirely online,

09:07.760 --> 09:11.360
Thanks, better help. This is a point in any of this.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.520
Let's figure out what the point of it is. We're not doing this.

09:26.240 --> 09:29.520
I do an interview with my sister's magazine.

09:29.520 --> 09:34.640
But you made that genuinely? Kind of because it was a really earnest, it's an earnest publication.

09:34.640 --> 09:39.680
So I gave her an answer. But you didn't say what the question was. It wasn't unpromptious.

09:45.680 --> 09:51.680
I'm writing so much worse because of what I'm going to have this afternoon.

09:53.680 --> 09:59.280
I guess I'm Jeffrey James. I look at Los Angeles and I guess I think of my comedy,

09:59.280 --> 10:09.200
like a multi-passed entity. Yeah. I'm like an orchestra at the moment. You can be conductor

10:09.200 --> 10:14.800
and first chair violin at the same time. Did you have a play in the instruments, Jeff?

10:14.800 --> 10:19.680
Are you a musician of sorts? I played the clarinet because I was forced to do it in school.

10:21.680 --> 10:27.280
I played clarinet as well and then I would forget to break this and I was the fan.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.800
That seems unrelated to you because you're doing so much error. That's too much error by the way to play the clarinet.

10:42.800 --> 10:47.040
No, my clarinet teacher like seemed me to the school counselor because I kept

10:47.040 --> 10:51.680
trying to do clarinet practice and because I wasn't eating enough food and just blowing a lot of it.

10:51.680 --> 10:56.160
Yeah, I think I was scared. I just you have to stand and blow for so long. It's crazy.

10:59.680 --> 11:08.640
No, I guess I had breakfast. It was fun. I was bad at the clarinet. I did play it because of

11:08.640 --> 11:13.840
Squidward. You played Squidward because you liked the Squidward. I played a woodwind because of Squidward.

11:13.840 --> 11:23.040
Well, it's interesting you bring music. It's interesting. It didn't even have the same vowel sound.

11:23.040 --> 11:27.920
It's interesting because you have talking about music there because I take a lot of inspiration from music.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.680
When I write, I usually hop back and forth between my laptop and my guitar.

11:41.680 --> 11:47.600
All right, I'm ready. I'm ready to hear if it may consider for me now.

11:47.600 --> 11:55.120
Oh, I'm going to just sit cool. I'm just feeling it. It's so funny because I did so

11:55.120 --> 12:04.240
little prep for this. Anyway, it's wonderful. I grew up with Jeffrey James interview in the first

12:04.240 --> 12:08.880
thing that came up. He hasn't been brought up to you in a silly context before, which is so surprising.

12:13.920 --> 12:22.880
My sister runs it. She runs this like very serious cool online magazine and she was like, I'd love

12:22.880 --> 12:27.040
to interview you for it. And I was like, what the fuck am I supposed to say? So I kind of was

12:27.040 --> 12:34.560
I was trying to do something more. I was so pretentious to a sibling. Like, she

12:34.560 --> 12:40.560
because it was published. You like, you type a couple lines of was scripted into your

12:40.720 --> 12:49.680
funny, but it makes me think of it. I just have to let a see and that's actually a court.

12:51.680 --> 12:59.600
I've really raised the night with. I got to play as well again. I'm only playing sting.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.600
I'm not like a son. He's not trying to write an email on the camera.

13:06.560 --> 13:10.800
To get out of your system. It was really long. I mean, I'll bring up some later, but you don't

13:10.800 --> 13:15.680
can move. No, I can't be a theory why. I think I'm going to throw up. It's like I'm doing

13:15.680 --> 13:23.200
your working. They call it a keyboard. And we've begun it. I'm going to keyboard just another instrument.

13:27.520 --> 13:31.280
I mean, there's some quotes in here. I'm not even comfortable saying because they're so intimate.

13:31.600 --> 13:37.120
But I, yes, of course. I don't say any of the interview. It's really special. I need to

13:37.120 --> 13:41.120
him more. Oh, man. I mean, let me just sort of.

13:48.240 --> 13:54.800
Bond of the week. Basically every week until the next 007 is cast, we're lobbying up our casting

13:54.800 --> 13:59.680
options for the next James. What happens when is this? Will the segment just be gone?

13:59.680 --> 14:06.480
No, it'll just be over. Okay. That makes sense. My pick this week is Steven Sondheim.

14:07.680 --> 14:12.720
Sondheim. Steven Bondheim. You think he? Oh, it just has to sort of sound? No,

14:12.720 --> 14:17.680
freight night. It could be anything you want, but so it's instead of like, so what can you do?

14:17.680 --> 14:25.680
Want to Saturday night alone? It'll be. There's the only sign I've referenced you everything.

14:25.680 --> 14:29.040
So what can you do with a boss named him as Bond?

14:31.040 --> 14:36.880
Fuck you guys, right? Because I got for a lot of effort into the shit. Did you? He Googles one thing.

14:36.880 --> 14:42.560
Clicked on the first result. He says everybody's dying. Everybody's in shit. How much time? And also what

14:42.720 --> 14:51.280
I want to fighting that. Did you go? And what song are you playing? I'm writing that. I'm going to go with Harry Styles.

14:51.280 --> 14:59.280
Fine. Mel. We go with Lin men well Miranda. Oh, women will bond right. Right.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.480
I was double a little seven.

15:02.480 --> 15:16.320
Oh, my god. I'm going to go with a barista at this coffee shop near where I live.

15:16.320 --> 15:22.720
Name drop. I only know the first name. His first name is Cam. And it's crazy because James one often

15:22.720 --> 15:32.320
stops with the last name. Yes. The whole point. This is for visual. Cam gave me like a

15:32.320 --> 15:36.800
very knowing look when I'm like, can I get like 2% milk in that? Do you have that? And Cam's kind of like looks

15:36.800 --> 15:45.920
back to like. Oh, yeah. I think we can make that work. And I was fine. Where is she? He was fine with you

15:45.920 --> 15:52.640
having dairy. And now you think he should be the next double. Yes. And I don't mean this to her feelings.

15:52.640 --> 15:58.000
That might be the worst spot of the week we've ever done. I think Cam is going to do great.

15:58.960 --> 16:05.440
You think his name was Cam? It was Cam. I would not live faster than him for that. Can bond.

16:06.160 --> 16:12.400
You're going to change the name. It's like you make Cam. What?

16:14.160 --> 16:27.200
I do that again. The name's bond. Can bond. Oh. And it's a family name. Your first name.

16:27.200 --> 16:36.480
So, can Junior? Yeah. Got it. Let me ask you guys this. How many idiots does it take to rob

16:36.480 --> 16:43.680
the Gucci store? Done. It's like you. Have this prepared. You looked at your laptop. I mean, you went

16:45.040 --> 16:52.720
where you saw you raided. I'm just wondering how many dumbasses would it take to rob a Gucci store?

16:53.680 --> 17:03.440
How many? Nine. Nine, maybe it's. What is a letter? A letter here today. The Gucci store in

17:03.440 --> 17:09.840
century city at the century city mall was robbed by nine fools. That was today. Maybe yesterday.

17:10.880 --> 17:17.600
And I just I wanted to know. I wanted you guys to guess it was. I was just how many

17:17.600 --> 17:21.200
does it take? I think you're going to be like one to watch the door. One to the door. One to the

17:21.200 --> 17:26.720
minute. Did you just guess the number? I thought it was a conversation starter. You thought.

17:27.440 --> 17:33.280
So, did you want us to be like, whoa, that's crazy. And you call them idiots. So, like, you're

17:33.280 --> 17:41.680
just like quite upset by the story. I think that the horseman loathies are all right. Yeah. Stole from

17:41.760 --> 17:48.880
the rich and gave to themselves. Mr. Beast is reportedly suing his ghost kitchen partner who

17:48.880 --> 17:55.840
makes the Mr. Beast burger. Wow. Because due to reports that the burgers are according to

17:55.840 --> 18:04.480
customers, disgusting and quote revolting. So, my question to y'all is what would your ghost kitchen be?

18:05.360 --> 18:10.560
Sorry. Yeah. So, the question is not like, you know, Mr. Beast has a Mr. Beast burger. What would your

18:10.640 --> 18:17.760
burger be? The question is what would your ghost kitchen be? That your celebrity? And

18:18.800 --> 18:30.320
I'm not talking about you. Wow. My name's Ken Bricewell. I was saying like in this

18:30.320 --> 18:35.360
in the event that you guys are like a really famous rich celebrity. Yeah. Humboldt. Tom Holland.

18:35.360 --> 18:40.400
No, I'm not saying which celebrity would you be or who you would fuck. Oh, James Cameron.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.680
Wow. I don't know if you're not hearing me or you just don't understand.

18:43.680 --> 18:50.720
You're a ghost kitchen. Cameron Diaz. James Cameron Diaz kitchen. No, all these celebrities

18:50.720 --> 18:54.720
are pairing up with like fucking door to Ash affiliates and making like ghost kitchens where they

18:54.720 --> 18:59.360
don't have a storefront, but they make a product. Oh, that's what a ghost kitchen. Yeah.

18:59.360 --> 19:02.000
Yeah. No, what do you think a ghost kitchen was?

19:02.960 --> 19:10.320
Haunted alpha. I was worried about and that's what I was worried about.

19:11.440 --> 19:15.840
We rarely do this, but I'm going to take another break. What are you talking about? No way.

19:15.840 --> 19:19.760

20:49.040 --> 20:57.360
I have a question. I have a question. What? I'm sure I've asked this in the past but it's been

20:57.360 --> 21:04.960
a while since I've been on the show and I'm wondering what is it? What is it? I was actually

21:04.960 --> 21:09.520
also wondering that. Because it's like we're getting news segment jokes like kind of like a week

21:09.520 --> 21:14.640
end of date type of vibe but then we're also getting bond of the I'm just I guess like what like

21:15.520 --> 21:20.720
the why, like the why of the show. Yeah and it takes away some of your end just to pile on.

21:22.720 --> 21:29.520
Take your hat. It takes just to add insult to insult. It takes away some of your sort of

21:30.480 --> 21:37.120
evil power to be behind the desk while we're all of it. Yes completely. I thought it was sort of like

21:38.080 --> 21:43.680
no. I can barely see you because there's like a camera and another camera. Like you're

21:43.680 --> 21:47.280
behind. You want to take a picture of it on your phone and we'll put it in. You're behind two

21:47.280 --> 21:54.080
tripods. It's difficult to kind of render you. Yeah. Sort of a sex pod. Sorry. Double try.

21:54.080 --> 22:03.600
Don't look at me after you say something like that. I have that one in my shirt. I know who's

22:03.920 --> 22:09.040
I added that one the week before I would guess it on perfect person and then it was the first sound

22:09.040 --> 22:15.040
you played and I was like holy ship. This is an honor. Yeah. Three months. Guys, let's fucking

22:16.240 --> 22:20.240
let's rain it in. Right. Let's figure out what you're going to have to touch a moment.

22:20.240 --> 22:25.920
Silence. We didn't know nothing to rain it. Can I say this? This is now picked a bone with me that

22:25.920 --> 22:30.720
I've been picking with the guests for years. She said that the show is what did you say? It was kind

22:30.720 --> 22:36.880
of uncomfortable to listen to. I mean, that's like nothing that no one hasn't said before. It's just

22:36.880 --> 22:42.160
the voice and I'm just being so comfortable in silence. What I see. I'm not comfortable with it.

22:42.160 --> 22:48.480
This is what I want to talk about because I'm constantly preaching overlapping dialogue. But

22:48.480 --> 22:54.880
everything that I say seems to pause everyone, stop everybody in their tracks. I want it to be like

22:54.880 --> 22:58.640
radio. I want it to be like miles is kind of interrupting the tail end into some of my sentence.

22:59.280 --> 23:05.680
You want it to be like radio? There's one. I mean, sorry, you're about to say something.

23:05.680 --> 23:10.800
I was just going to say, are you still working radio? And if there was a long enough pause,

23:10.800 --> 23:18.240
the station would start playing a song because it would be like something's wrong. That

23:18.240 --> 23:23.440
something doesn't play correctly. And if it was like, it had to be ridiculously long at 30 seconds.

23:24.080 --> 23:31.120
And one time, there was a minute silence that was, I can't remember what it was for, but then about

23:31.120 --> 23:36.960
halfway through, it's Brittany Bitch. And it was just like a moment of silence for someone who had passed.

23:40.640 --> 23:45.520
Whoa. Okay, so let's try it out. Let's do 30 seconds of silence right now. No, let's just do it.

23:45.520 --> 23:49.200
Let's not be able to handle it. Let's just do it and see how it goes.

23:49.280 --> 23:55.040
Let's just do it. All right. That's how long you can go. I'm going to set a 30 second time. This is the worst statement.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.040
Starting now.

24:19.520 --> 24:20.560
Hey.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.360
Don't cook rice wine.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.620
Singing rice likes it.

24:23.800 --> 24:24.780
Even emotions will destroy the harmony.

24:25.000 --> 24:25.500
Don't cook rice wine.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.320
You saw my aunt, she just passed away and gave me the dance.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.580
You're right mother's daughter back then.

24:30.200 --> 24:42.840
I'm like a group of

24:43.120 --> 24:44.880
LinkedIn, Street, Group of Colours,

24:44.880 --> 24:46.080
December 16.

24:46.080 --> 24:46.480
Like and share your enjoys.

24:46.660 --> 24:47.480
Like, share your delivers.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.400
If you continue to write sweet guys,

24:49.400 --> 25:09.040
Don't cook rice wine, burn rice like cans, no one should ever steam their rice

25:09.040 --> 25:22.400
sell dente, you should scorch it, torch the grains, and if somebody serves you rice

25:22.400 --> 25:37.800
sell dente, don't feel pressured, trash that rice, don't owe my coffee, so long,

25:37.800 --> 25:59.440
don't trust the chef, shes don't no rice, trash right from shes, I'm in love with

26:00.400 --> 26:13.800
the whole fucking thing, it's so serious, it's that or cast, it's a rice that feels like sand,

26:14.720 --> 26:36.320
you made it out, when you hold it in your hands, don't undercharge rice, don't cook rice fine,

26:36.320 --> 26:55.240
go every bite of rice, or eat a pair, so many rice will be used from, let me name some,

26:55.240 --> 26:58.240
oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

26:58.240 --> 27:10.460
That's it, long grain white rice, brown rice, black rice and red rice, okay, tie jasmine rice, tons of

27:10.460 --> 27:37.380
grits, grits, grits, grits, grits count as rice, you should think grits, hoysin, don't sorry,

27:40.460 --> 27:57.780
fish sauce, flame to green, there's a lot of sauce, well, don't good rice fine, these

27:57.780 --> 28:08.620
dishes, I can't you dig it, don't cook rice fine, don't cook rice fine, and that was a

28:08.620 --> 28:22.180
moment of silence, I want to talk to the lyrics and get notes on them, I mean I have a lot

28:22.180 --> 28:27.940
of notes, firstly, so long, I've never had a full song, you came in and sort of like a secondary

28:27.940 --> 28:35.820
voice, being like, what kind of rice, it's like a call in response portion, basically at the

28:35.820 --> 28:40.140
same time you said it, where he's like, don't let me down, I mean where to start, one, I just,

28:40.140 --> 28:43.660
the reason I was raising my hand, the moment of silence, I just want to double back really quick,

28:43.660 --> 28:47.980
is that I would like to see a 30 second moment of silence where you don't have another

28:47.980 --> 28:52.380
task to do, where you actually have to sit in the moment of silence without like, oh, I got

28:52.380 --> 28:57.020
to pull up, don't cook rice fine, you know, you have to music, I get the lyrics, it's like

28:57.020 --> 29:01.660
that took up the 30 seconds for you, and so I, the reason I was like, hey, cut that shit out,

29:01.740 --> 29:05.820
it's like literally be in this, yeah, be in the moment, yeah, no, I'm just going to say, I need to focus

29:05.820 --> 29:13.260
out, but I think sometimes, yeah, you're teeing something up, and you're being here right now,

29:13.260 --> 29:16.620
that's what I was going to say, be here now, were you going to say, what was like, Ramdas, yeah,

29:16.620 --> 29:28.380
he was so good. Elyrica enjoyed, this is maybe really nice, was don't trust shifts, yeah, I felt like

29:28.460 --> 29:33.420
he was making a political point, I like that, and I really, I felt like he believed that when you

29:33.420 --> 29:37.580
sit on a costaire, like, don't, we're going to talk to the lyrics, we don't need to do the whole thing,

29:37.580 --> 29:41.020
we'll do the whole thing, we'll do the whole thing, we'll do the whole thing, I think we can sort of give

29:41.020 --> 29:46.220
our bullet points, and then maybe, I think I just talked through, you know, real quick, and you

29:46.220 --> 29:49.980
got to talk a whole song, you got to basically just do the whole, I'm not going to sing, I don't know,

29:49.980 --> 29:54.140
is that what you're worried about? That's not what I'm worried about. Don't cook rice fine,

29:54.540 --> 30:02.940
send rice like sand, and again, I just want to, and I hate to, this is a bit from, how many,

30:02.940 --> 30:09.900
seven years ago? It was last fall. No, we did do it right, but it's for, you know, I'm

30:09.900 --> 30:15.500
sorry, I was talking about, I don't, whatever the rice situation, three and a half years,

30:15.500 --> 30:23.500
no, no more. It's been longer. Oh, the exactly rice. Yes. So five years, yeah. So they

30:23.500 --> 30:29.660
was five years ago to the day that that sort of came in your life, and then we're sort of here,

30:29.660 --> 30:36.460
rehashing. I don't like endings. Yeah. Don't cook rice fine, burn grains from cans.

30:38.140 --> 30:45.420
Just, do you think rice comes in a can? There's no way you couldn't find a variety of

30:45.420 --> 30:50.860
rice that comes in. And it would be cum-jell sand by the way. That's a great story,

30:50.860 --> 30:59.100
because then all you have to do is chart it. I want, for like a special episode, I want you to

30:59.100 --> 31:04.300
cook rice the way you describe it in your music, creating scraps and just sand. Like,

31:04.300 --> 31:09.180
sing to the sand, you know, whatever the fuck you talk about, and I want you to eat it,

31:09.180 --> 31:15.980
and I want you to put it hoisin, dark soy fish sauce, the whole shabang. It's a lot of stuff.

31:16.380 --> 31:23.260
A lot of stuff. Don't trust ships. Yeah. Yeah. You're beautiful like performance art piece.

31:23.260 --> 31:27.660
Yeah, that's the thing. I mean, because you're not going to get that chart. You're not going to get

31:27.660 --> 31:34.940
those grits unless you use a ton of sauce with a lot of sweets. Sorry. Sort of foreshadowing,

31:34.940 --> 31:40.300
because the next one we do might be also incorporating sugar. The next one we do. We do.

31:40.300 --> 31:44.540
You mean the song that you're saying on this? No one should ever steam their rice,

31:44.540 --> 31:57.340
Alden, too. That's crazy. I have that tissue. That's so weird that you mentioned them.

31:58.060 --> 32:04.380
You should scorch it, torch the grains. Again, you are pausing, I guess, press the

32:04.380 --> 32:09.900
egg and jump. I've had something caught in my throat for a while. It's not COVID.

32:10.700 --> 32:15.900
Very back. I'm going to go just like finger this out really quick. Yeah. And you're sure you don't just

32:15.900 --> 32:20.860
like need a break. No, I'm pausing it. You can really do it. She says it's not kind of that. And she says

32:20.860 --> 32:27.180
it's just because we're just trying to get that wrong. Yep. Got it. So sorry, your cam, your Jeff is now in the dark.

32:28.220 --> 32:32.540
Because he's sort of alone. No more seeing me, I guess. No, the other cameras are on.

32:32.540 --> 32:36.140
Yep. Because I need to make sure that yeah, I'm on.

32:38.140 --> 32:43.740
And if somebody just certainly blurry, it's just like, they were all at a focus, which makes no sense.

32:43.740 --> 32:49.500
No one is ever sitting in an area that's not these chairs. So it should probably never be out of focus.

32:49.500 --> 32:54.540
Exactly. That's like, you were gone for like, you're going to say, so brief a moment.

32:55.340 --> 32:58.140
Did you hear that? Clear your throat. Yeah.

33:03.500 --> 33:06.940
That's fine to be on mine. It's okay to clear it throat.

33:07.980 --> 33:10.700
And if somebody wasn't here, that one, that was a,

33:10.700 --> 33:15.740
that was just going to be like a seven minute song about burning rice. I don't think I need to

33:15.740 --> 33:21.020
worry. And if somebody serves you rice, you said you weren't going to say that. You said you

33:21.020 --> 33:25.900
weren't going to say that was toxic. That was toxic. That's halfway, but not all the way. No, that's

33:25.900 --> 33:31.580
what you were doing. The song you talk saying. If I say that I'm abstaining from sex for a

33:32.300 --> 33:37.500
summer. I feel like I guess people. Sorry. I what the fuck is wrong with you?

33:39.820 --> 33:44.860
Don't, if somebody serves your rice, I'll then tell you, don't feel pressured, trash that rice.

33:44.860 --> 33:50.460
What are we doing right now? We heard the fucking song. We don't have anything to say about it.

33:50.460 --> 33:53.820
Other than what we've already said, I just this the last segment.

33:55.420 --> 33:59.900
Are you trying to pad time until the end of that time? Yeah.

33:59.900 --> 34:05.100
You've got there. Don't, don't, don't. But your camera's still off. We don't need to see. We

34:05.100 --> 34:11.420
are absolutely, you're the main character. Don't, oh my, Kasey. There's no way you don't trust this

34:11.420 --> 34:18.300
chef. Chef, as a, as a, a, a, a biggest producer. Yes. Take out your phone cannot can't, can't, can't,

34:18.300 --> 34:24.620
can't bond won't. No, because the file's going to be like 18 gigabytes turn on the camera on the

34:24.620 --> 34:28.780
camera. Oh, because you, you guys weren't here with Melanie saw that I was like trying to set

34:28.780 --> 34:31.980
this camera up, and it was like a fucking headache. We're already recording. I just want to push

34:31.980 --> 34:36.460
through them. They don't need to see me. We did a bunch of these without a producer camera as

34:36.460 --> 34:41.500
behind the desk. It was fine. Don't, oh my, Kasey. Don't trust the chef. Chefs don't know

34:41.500 --> 34:48.940
rice. Trash, right, chef. Right, right, chef. Hearing it after you've sung it is like you kind of

34:48.940 --> 34:56.060
putting like a slam poetry angle of it. Right, right, right. Yeah. Yeah, it's one of the

34:56.060 --> 35:03.980
activities waiting for this. I'm in love with Bosmati. Seared in skillets that are cast. It's a

35:03.980 --> 35:15.260
rice that feels like sand when you hold it in your hands. Don't under char rice. What's the

35:15.260 --> 35:19.980
point of this segment of this speaking it after you sung it? I'm putting together an album

35:19.980 --> 35:26.060
of these songs. So I'm premiering them as demos and trying to get notes on the lyrics.

35:27.340 --> 35:31.020
You guys aren't giving many, which I'm assuming means it was perfect. When you hit

35:31.020 --> 35:40.220
poison, I got chills in a good way. I thought that was like if you get at more of that energy.

35:40.220 --> 35:44.220
Okay, so you want me to really go for it. I thought that was really good. Don't under char

35:44.300 --> 35:53.980
rice. Don't cook rice fine. Scald every bite of rice or eat a pair. Okay. I guess like for you.

35:53.980 --> 35:57.740
So it's you're cooking the way you want. I'm cooking. That's exactly what I'm cooking. No,

35:57.740 --> 36:03.180
the way you want the rice to be cooked is to your taste. Exactly right. And that's just burnt.

36:03.900 --> 36:09.580
Charity, yeah, carbonized. Okay. Carbonized. Basically, I want the grains to be

36:09.660 --> 36:17.900
cotterized to those. That fair to say now. There are so many grains of rice to choose from.

36:17.900 --> 36:26.460
Let me name some bomba rice. Long grain white, long grain white, rice brown rice, black rice and red

36:26.460 --> 36:34.220
rice, Thai Jasmine rice, tons of grass. I think that's right. That's my favorite bit. That's a favorite

36:34.220 --> 36:41.820
runner. That's a favorite runner. It's all of that and ending with tons of grits. Just a lot of

36:41.820 --> 36:48.060
good ones. One of the other ones had any volume metric measurement. Yeah. Grits count as rice.

36:49.260 --> 36:50.860
You should sing grits.

36:51.660 --> 37:00.380
Oh, yes. Yes. See that. I really like the eerie nature of that.

37:00.380 --> 37:10.140
Really hot. Yes. Flamed grains. I feel like we're not like we're the judges on the voice.

37:10.140 --> 37:15.580
But we can't do that. Actually, everything else was behind the desk. I'm still looking.

37:16.540 --> 37:20.620
Yeah, I agree. Don't cook rice. I don't cook rice. I don't cook rice.

37:20.620 --> 37:26.860
I don't all of our teams are really cheap. Can you dig it? Don't cook rice. Fine.

37:27.740 --> 37:32.300
Great. What's next? How long does it get all right? That was like an hour.

37:36.300 --> 37:40.620
It feels like a appropriate amount. Yeah, it seems about right. About right. Yeah, exactly.

37:41.260 --> 37:46.220
Um, wax. What do you guys want to talk about? Well, the energy spoiled. The energy spoiled.

37:46.220 --> 37:52.460
I just sang for you. That was exhausting. Because I feel like we did it twice. I feel like I'm

37:52.460 --> 37:58.300
very mean. Okay. Do you guys this after the first after I sang it? Yeah. The energy was

37:59.260 --> 38:03.340
maybe still there. Yeah. Please and brought me back. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually,

38:03.340 --> 38:08.300
have like you don't have a bad boy. No, you should do it. You're hitting those nuts. And then we

38:08.380 --> 38:13.580
talked through the lyrics and now the energy is sucked. 100%. Okay, so should I sing it again? No,

38:13.580 --> 38:28.380
I get it from back now. Okay. Uh, cute. Every. She's one. Oh, we've really gotten somewhere,

38:28.380 --> 38:32.540
but it's hanging on by a thread. I really need you guys to come through from it. We come through

38:32.540 --> 38:38.140
for me right now with the overlapping dialogue, the radio style, so that there isn't those

38:38.220 --> 38:42.700
long pregnant pauses for no reason where we're not getting anywhere. Right. So like let's talk

38:42.700 --> 38:48.300
about some shit. Let's dive into some earnest topics. I almost had fish gotten dated. Trump got

38:48.300 --> 38:55.260
undated. I want to hear about this fish. Fish get it. It feels like you're pretty good at this.

38:55.260 --> 39:03.740
The band. Yeah, the band is all in jail. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Well, I. Sure. Oh, yeah. So Trump

39:03.740 --> 39:08.140
got, when does this, does this come out on Friday or just come on next Friday? Yeah, it's a little

39:08.140 --> 39:14.300
sort of be stale. Yeah, stale. You're not even from the talk. Talking about those Gucci bags. It was

39:14.300 --> 39:21.500
still. Yeah. That was yeah. People. Big news. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's the night winding down because

39:21.500 --> 39:27.740
it is like 840. Like, are we like getting into like a night cap territory? Is this you hitting

39:27.740 --> 39:39.580
on someone in the book? Do we still we want to do a night cap territory? Okay, so let's do that.

39:39.580 --> 39:44.380
We'll do three different scenarios. It's a fun little game. A little improv game. We're like,

39:44.380 --> 39:48.380
I'm hitting on each of you guys individually at a bar and we just see how it goes. All right,

39:48.380 --> 39:53.020
sure. Let's start with miles. Okay. But you have to start with that and then screw it goes

39:53.980 --> 39:58.140
I think they all have to be organically blank. Okay, sure. Blank him is starting from scratch.

39:58.140 --> 40:03.420
Do we know each other? Or is this we we've we I'm walking up to you. We have not talked yet. Okay,

40:05.420 --> 40:18.460
is that a dirty is that a dirty Shirley? I'm trying to get to the bottom of your drink.

40:19.420 --> 40:25.980
Because you my friend are sort of a tall drink of water. Is it a dirty? That's so nice. That's

40:25.980 --> 40:32.140
really nice of you. Or is it a whirling dervish? What is your drinking you're talking when I'm talking

40:32.140 --> 40:37.020
I don't know what you're saying, but I'm just waiting for some friends. I'm kind of wondering

40:38.380 --> 40:44.300
if you're drink, that's all I'm wondering. You okay? He's black out drunk. Is it a is it a

40:44.620 --> 40:51.980
dervish or is it a Shirley? I don't know because we can spike that up real nice. I definitely want you

40:51.980 --> 40:58.140
to spike my drink. No, not without the hall with the mood of our conversation. Okay,

40:58.140 --> 41:05.660
shoot your shot. You're buck. I'm nervous as hell. Don't believe that. It makes you so unattractive to me.

41:05.660 --> 41:11.660
I don't live close. What say you and I take it all the way back to Marina Del Rey? I don't want

41:11.660 --> 41:16.140
to go to Marina Del Rey tonight. I have dance in the morning. We can meet in the middle at a hotel

41:16.140 --> 41:27.100
that I'll pay for. That is really, really too much. You're kidding. I'm kidding. This has been fun,

41:27.100 --> 41:34.060
but I'm just going to close out. I'm married sweetheart. Nice shot though. Nice try. I didn't.

41:35.020 --> 41:46.780
Same. That was awesome. It was beautiful. I think that was PTA. And I don't mean the filmmaker.

41:46.780 --> 41:54.860
I mean pair of jeans. Yeah, Mel. Now's your chance. You're my child. It's correct.

41:54.860 --> 41:59.340
How'd you like this? I'm going to go to the double on you that I can crop down to a single.

41:59.420 --> 42:06.060
This is real footage. This is real footage. Okay. Wait. What are you talking about? We're doing

42:06.060 --> 42:10.220
a scene. The cameras on you. If it goes well, add it to your real. Well, here's the problem.

42:10.220 --> 42:20.940
Is that you. We don't have. It's a sample. It's a fucking monologue sample with dialogue.

42:20.940 --> 42:25.420
I'd like to just, I'd like to before I start the scene. So Miles and Jeff are strangers. Sure.

42:25.420 --> 42:30.460
This scenario, you have like, you're both like seeing each other around this place before.

42:31.340 --> 42:34.540
And it's like, you've caught each other's eye. This is the first time speaking. It's like someone added.

42:34.540 --> 42:39.820
It's not like fully out of the blue. It's like, okay. Like maybe I could this be a little something. Let's find out.

42:39.820 --> 42:46.060
Sure. Okay. Um, Bailey. Sorry. I'm so good. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean that.

42:46.060 --> 42:54.220
Do you want me to talk with you guys? No, that's right. No. It's just, I'm just enjoying my drink. Sorry. I'll leave you.

42:55.820 --> 43:02.220
And see. I've never been more good at that. That was great.

43:03.980 --> 43:12.220
That was beautiful. Yeah. And then that's just really empty. Okay. And now, Riley, you and I are good friends.

43:13.180 --> 43:20.380
And I don't know. What's, was this, is this something? Nothing. Work. I feel like it works better.

43:20.380 --> 43:25.580
You're trying to like reassure yourself. I was just, that positive affirmation. We're good friends.

43:26.540 --> 43:31.180
Tim, is that the same? That was because we just, that was some context to nothing.

43:31.180 --> 43:35.980
Can we just agree on that? Yeah. I think you guys are strange. Miles, you set up the scene.

43:35.980 --> 43:40.620
But I do want the, uh, the kicker to be that Melanie and the same character that you were just as.

43:41.020 --> 43:50.140
You have to come in and interrupt us. It's 10 p.m. at a natural wine mixer at a heavy natural wine mixer.

43:51.100 --> 43:58.940
Like a young Hollywood mixer. We've tried a network. Sure. Yeah. So it's an industry moment. But you think the moment might be that you're going to hook up.

43:58.940 --> 44:06.460
Okay. I want you to start the scene. Okay. That's a great pick-up line. Actually I'm changing my mind.

44:06.460 --> 44:10.140
Yeah. I want you to start the scene. I'm making it. Just start the scene.

44:11.340 --> 44:17.420
Oh, I get it because I'm an actor. And yeah. And so it's it. Um, no, I have a good night. Have a good night.

44:17.660 --> 44:26.220
What, uh, have I seen you or anything? You approached me. And that's where you start a scene.

44:26.220 --> 44:34.220
Start a scene. Um, yeah. I mean, I'm normally more modest in this, but you probably see me in a couple of things.

44:34.940 --> 44:43.340
I'm like all over HBO. Sorry, Max, right now. Um, what do you do? What do you do?

44:44.300 --> 44:53.820
Oh, um, I don't know. I actually- Because this is- You don't know. No, I do. I just- This is a young Hollywood mixer.

44:53.820 --> 44:59.020
And you're like the 19th actor. I've talked to some directors and producer, some writers.

44:59.020 --> 45:05.740
And so what do you do? I'm a union man. What's union? PGA, DGA, sag. CGA.

45:06.540 --> 45:12.220
What is that? Call of girls in America? That's cool. Yeah. So

45:13.980 --> 45:18.220
I've been told that my voice could get even the most

45:19.180 --> 45:21.180
arid woman stopping.

45:27.580 --> 45:31.180
What do you guys have going on? What do you want to point the people to the floor?

45:31.180 --> 45:34.780
Let's start with calling this episode by the way. Um,

45:36.860 --> 45:40.060
I had good math or dark probably. Okay. That's really good.

45:40.140 --> 45:43.180
I'm like- Unless you guys want to like pitch up. No, I was just curious.

45:44.540 --> 45:54.860
I think that's cool. Yeah. You can watch perfect person wherever you get podcast. You can watch it on

45:54.860 --> 45:59.900
YouTube. Um, and you can follow me at Miles Bond. Sorry. I'm just realizing how much head space you have

46:00.460 --> 46:03.900
in this brand. Is it- Tell me what to stop. Stop.

46:04.860 --> 46:10.460
That's so hot. No, what? You've been sitting in the middle of a whole time and like you're behind

46:10.460 --> 46:14.540
the day of skill directing this. Yeah. Why does everything I'm directing this? Because you

46:14.540 --> 46:21.020
do like work. We're dissipating and a share of joy. You're the technical director, man.

46:21.740 --> 46:24.780
You're on set. I was like, where Jeff hasn't left his trailer?

46:26.780 --> 46:31.340
If you're the director, we're participating in a shared joy. You're not your

46:31.340 --> 46:37.660
trailer, and we can see by the way it's shaking that you're wanking. Melanie, plug your stuff.

46:40.220 --> 46:46.380
I'm on Instagram and TikTok and what I- I'm either mellow doodle or Melanie Bracewell on everything.

46:46.380 --> 46:57.020
So try them both. You want? Violence. I'm Riley Antspa, Instagram, Riley Coyote on Twitter, and I

46:57.900 --> 47:03.900
review review on the headgum network. It's an improv. Comedy podcast. Don't know if you could tell

47:03.900 --> 47:08.380
for my amazing improvisational comedy. I did on this show this evening, but uh-

47:08.380 --> 47:14.620
No, TikTok. I honestly, I mostly use my TikTok to watch violence with TikTok.

47:21.820 --> 47:25.660
Now what? Such a long pause. That was for you to take. Yeah.

47:26.540 --> 47:30.540
Take the- Be shy. I don't know. Listen to this. I think I already follows me so that I don't- there's

47:30.540 --> 47:35.020
nothing to plug. I just- I thought you were making TikTok. I was going to get a drink. Yeah.

47:35.020 --> 47:37.020
That's so arrogant.

47:55.660 --> 48:00.540
Was a headgum original.

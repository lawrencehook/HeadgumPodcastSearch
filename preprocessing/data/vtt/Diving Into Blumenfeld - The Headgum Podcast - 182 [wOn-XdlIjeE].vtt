WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
We can all call it.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
Not only friendship, but also in terms of technology.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Right, so the episode has started, but if you can notice,

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Emma and Joel are still setting up.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Mostly Emma, because Joel is not really lifting finger

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
in terms of the technology.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
I don't know if he thinks that, you know, he doesn't have to

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
go on the text side of things.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Was it fine that it's a David Cross's name on that TV?

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
It's not fine.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
It's not fine.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
It should say that had gumbagos.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Yeah.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Because, well, actually, it could be good promotion.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
You're not going to see it.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Do you see it?

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
I can see it on the webcam.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Yeah.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
But it's good.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
It's a good cross promotion.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Because like, that's what I feel like we've gotten away

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
from on this show is using it as a vehicle for cross promo.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
David Cross promo.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
That's really good.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Everybody.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Everybody.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Get to it.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Get stupid.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Get stupid.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Get started.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Get started.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Let's get it started.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Let's get it started.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Let's get it started.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Let's get it started.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Here.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Yep.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
It's hard, because I'm wearing this giant ass gumball hat

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
that Marty gave me.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
He said, where this?

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
He spat on me when he said, where this by the way.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
It looks like you're on the phone right now.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Sorry.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
It sounds like it.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
This one's like, yeah.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
No, the address.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Sorry.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
I've never seen someone wear something that looks like more like a choice

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
that they personally made.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Then we're going to have a lot.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
I walked in.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Well, first of all, I walked into the L.A. studio.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
I saw a Mercedes-Benz courtesy car in the marking lot.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Which, and then I went in and immediately

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Razz Marty, because I was like the Jewag and already

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
broke down.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
He's only had it for like two months.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
It's already in the fucking shop.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
And you said it's a car that often breaks down or something.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Of course.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
If you're not having the Toyota, if you're not having the Mazderati,

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
then you're going with the European Beamer,

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
which doesn't mean quality on the engine side.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
That just means quality on the interiors.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
So he can have the leather,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
but it doesn't mean that he's not going to be in the shop twice a year.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
I see.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Do you see or are you going to get the fucking bends?

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Because I feel like stick with the Mazderati for now, right?

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
I've actually saved a lot of money by not caring about cars.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Really?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Yeah.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
If I liked that Audi stuff,

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
if I would have been like,

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
I would have had like 30,000 less dollars.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Would you call yourself when it comes to cars in Amy?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Meaning?

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
Because you're either in any year you have an Audi.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Emma and Joel are with us.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
I've got those two muppets that are always up in the balcony.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Which ones are they?

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
balcony or that's us in the balcony?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Because they haven't said anything yet.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
That was the first movie I ever saw in theaters.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Muppets in outer space.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Was the Muppets movie starring Jason Siggle?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I don't know who to start.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I was like Stephen Siggle.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Jason lives in Ohio, by the way.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
And, uh, Ohio.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Welcome to the headgum podcast.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Look at that.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
What a cold open.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
It's like an opening monologue.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
You know how to keep it ice cold in your job.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
The rising starts early.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Yeah.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
And it gets to me early.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
How dare you, Emma?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Sorry.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I know if I'm going to host this show.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I have to let like thicker skin because I've already come for me.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
And if you can't dish it out, can't take it.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Don't take it.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
If you can't dish it out, don't give it.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
What is it?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Like you can't take it.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Don't teach it out.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Don't teach it out.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
That's totally not the same.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Don't dish it out.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
You can't take it.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yeah.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Right?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
That's what you do.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Anything I say in this hat sounds a little more intelligent, I think.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
It's alright to like have converse.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Like none of you guys are adding to the conversation.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
How do you imagine this working?

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
One frame on them, one frame on us, or is it like individual shots?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
It's dual time.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Just two and two.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Two and two.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Two shots.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
I think that works.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
So none of this specific to camera stuff.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
We might go specific to camera for in terms of punching up jokes.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Yeah.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Well, don't just say, yeah, like you're the active listening sometimes puts me off because

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
I feel like you're not actually listening.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
You're just waiting for your next turn to speak.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Does that make sense?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Mm-hmm.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
So Marty's only on the G-Wagon for one, two months and it's already in the show.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Curtis Eagle.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
I walk into the studio.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
I look up and he's wearing this.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
I'm wearing the gumball hat.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
It's a big hat.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
It's like a 20 and 5-8 hat.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Like the hat makes it look like Jeff is one and a half feet tall.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Exactly.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Yeah.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
It's like one of those old popcorn bucket hats that you get at the baseball stadium.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
But it's the opposite.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Those were two small to fit on your head.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
With your mustache and that hat, you've gone full video game avatar mode.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Yeah, Mario.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Yeah.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
The success got to him because he got a big head.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Chuckle funny jokes so far.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Nothing truly laugh out loud.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I will laugh out loud.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Sponsored by audible.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Sponsored by...

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Gumball.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Bond of the week.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
We got some commentary.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Pretty much similar to...

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
What we do on this show.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
From the world's favorite celebrity at the moment right now, Jeremy Allen White.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
What's in this?

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
That's the W7 fan and I don't want that for me.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
In fact, an American shouldn't play a W7 in general.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Even if it is me, in my opinion.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
But that's very flattering.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
The Sean Connery was definitely my James Bond.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Although, I mean, the thought Daniel Craig was so great.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
And I love all the recent films.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
I feel like it's been a really long time.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Like guys pick a month.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
We want to know.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
That's funny.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
It's funny because he is jacked.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
So anything.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
He said a little bit of funny.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
That's why people think Ryan Reynolds is funny.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Do people think that?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Is he jacked?

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
Both questions and two things I just said.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
I said people think Ryan Reynolds is funny because he's jacked.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
And she was like, is he funny?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
And then it's like, is he jacked?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
I'm not an unreliable narrator to them.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
I don't know if it's the coastal difference.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
The time difference.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
If something gets lost in translation across continent.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
I think nobody trusts you.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Nobody asks.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Nobody trusts you.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
I didn't say ask or jeeps.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
What is it about me?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
You think I'm being facetious all the time?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Because of the way that my face looks and what I say?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Yeah.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
And you're kind of dumb.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
That's true.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Also Ryan has his own helping.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
That's not helping trustworthy.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
I feel like somebody who wears this really has their wits about them.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Don't just say, mmm, agree or don't.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I disagree that.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Thanksgiving.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Let's talk about it.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
To me, there's four categories here to get to four bullet points.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Number one is obviously gratitude.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Number two is family.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Number three is stuffing.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
And number four is food.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
So stuffing just should be a part of food, right?

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Well, stuffing is a food that might fall onto the food category.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
I don't mean stuffing.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
By stuffing.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Sorry.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Maybe I shouldn't have named it that.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
By stuffing.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
I don't mean the side.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
You mean jamming side.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I think inside something else.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Exactly right.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Basically when you go home to your hometown.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
The Wednesday before Thanksgiving.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Everybody goes to that bar.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
You know, that's certain hometown bar.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
And are you sort of consummating a high school crush years later?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
No.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
But I go to my end.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
So I don't go away with high school.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
How is this not a company show anymore?

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
How are we talking about Thanksgiving and gratitude?

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
We're bringing everything up.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Let's just start gratitude then.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I am grateful to the network.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Right?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
I don't know.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
I don't fucking care.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
See the thing is, up to their ad package.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Really?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
I appreciate that.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
And I appreciate the ad sales team for getting us there.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
It's cool.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
We had to kind of touch our way through some problematic copy to get to the point where, you know,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
we're almost leaving every week with a G.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Uh-huh.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
E-O-F-F-R-E-Y.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Right?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Let's talk about gratitude.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
What do you guys think before?

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
I went.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
I was a little bit zealous by saying I was thankful to the network.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Because before this, I mean, we started 20 minutes late because

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
David Cross gets special treatment.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
The L.A. Studio never set up.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
And then on, you're like, you're interrupting my meetings.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I'm like, well, that's because the studio never works.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Right?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
The logic tech adapter?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Not plugged in.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
You're off the grateful thing.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
So quick.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
That's right.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
What are you guys grateful for?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Let's start with Joel.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
I am grateful for my voice.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
I only become grateful about things after I've lost them temporarily.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
And last week, I couldn't talk for two days.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
So now it feels great to vocalize.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
What happened?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I don't really know.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
You just woke up one day and you couldn't talk.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Yeah.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
So I don't really get sick.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
And I wasn't sick.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I also don't like admitting being sick.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
You weren't.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
You were.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
He was sick.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I was a little bit sick, but mostly just couldn't talk.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Emma?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
What I'm grateful for?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Yeah.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Um.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Sasha also, if you lost your voice last week.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
No.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I was sick, but I didn't lose my voice.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Um, and I'm still sick.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
But I get sick.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
I do kind of like a two weeks off one week on being sick.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
And then it's like that.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
I'm sorry.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
I get sick.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
I get sick.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I'm not familiar.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Well, they say I get sad.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I've never heard of.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
This is.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
But anyway.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
I want to start the episode.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
I feel like we got to the studio a bunch of energy.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
And then just because of how long we took to set up everything.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
I started to get pissed.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
And then it's like.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
So I'm trying to.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Yeah.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Take it.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
We're trying to.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
With this.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Well, it's.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
I'm here on his phone.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I appreciate your guys.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
It's full attention.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
But what are you grateful for?

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
Uh, I'm grateful for the moments in which I get people's full attention.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
I'm grateful for my family.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
But that's a different category of this.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
So I almost don't want to say it.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I'm grateful for my friend for you.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Yeah.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I'm grateful for my friend.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Hey, I'm grateful for all my fallen enemies.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
That we may defeat them once again.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Is that from something?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
That's a.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
That's from what I just said.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
I'm grateful for the audience.

11:06.000 --> 11:15.000
They've stuck with us through the buy and buy through the gloaming.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Our audience has stuck with us through the thin and thinner.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
You write.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
So not thick and thin.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
There was no thick.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
There wasn't density.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Of course.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Then and it got even more thin.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
Would you say it was density of mistakes that thinned the rest?

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
For anyone to be listening to this at all is sort of a.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
A huge sort of family.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Yeah.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
And I'm grieving.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Sure.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
To the family category.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Yeah.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
What are your.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Let's start here.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
What's your relationship like with your dad, Joel?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Fantastic.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Okay.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
What about Mrs. Joel?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
That's my mom.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
No, your wife.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Yeah, your mom.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Don't say it like that.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
I forgot Joel's last name was Joel.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
It's like bull bull, but it's Joel Joel.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
When it's Joel, it passed me around Joel.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
A fruit ball.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Because I was born right before I was a shana.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
That's not bad at all.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I don't mind that from Joel.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Joel.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
A bull bull for Joel.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Exactly.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
Did you ever get bulled over or maybe Joel'd over?

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
No, but I did get my haircut in a bowl for a while.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Is that true?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Yeah.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
How would you get a bowl?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Really.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Well, you can still put a bowl on top and cut around it.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
It doesn't matter what.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Well, I'm sorry.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
You got to keep up.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
You got to keep up today.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Come on.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
You can put a bowl around anything.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Yeah.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Emma, what about you?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
What's your relationship like with your siblings?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Do you have any siblings?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Yes.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
I have two younger sisters.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
Are you sort of a second mother to them?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Or did you kind of leave them out to dry?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
To one of them not to the other.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Okay.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Because you chose favorites.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
So there's two big of an age gap.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Yeah.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
You have an age gap thing.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Okay.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
How old is she?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Four?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Twenty one?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Twenty one?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Eight years younger than I am.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
That's a little too young.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Have a good relationship with.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Wouldn't you say me?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
No.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Well, you're the youngest, right?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Yeah.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
And my older brothers.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Eight years older than me.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
We have a great relationship.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
So I wouldn't say it's too young.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
I have a good relationship with her.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Okay.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
I don't know why you're getting mad at me.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Because I'm the one who said it.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
What's your relationship like with your two brothers?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Obviously you're closer with Ben.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
The other one's sort of dead meat chopliver to you.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
No.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Close to both of them.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
What's the difference?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
What do you think the difference is?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Like, one's more fraternal.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
The other one's more.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
I don't know.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
One is just eight years older than me.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
One is four years older than me.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
I don't know.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
It's like kids every four years.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
But weirdly the four year?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
You're not as close with.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Because it was almost like competition.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
Which younger blue and so is it going to be the next doctor?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
We only have one doctor.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
That's true.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
No.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
My oldest brother's a doctor as well.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Don't say no like you're getting frustrated.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
You're not being clear with me about your family tree.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
I'm being really sick.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I'm being my oldest brother's a doctor.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
And your eldest brother works in law.

14:04.000 --> 14:11.000
My eldest brother is the doctor.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
But the middle brother is so let's move on to stuffing.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Okay.

14:16.000 --> 14:22.000
Then let's get stuff with information about your brother's working back to family.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
We'll just one's a doctor.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Middle one is sort of runs.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
It was a designer.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
For what?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Graphic designer.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Facebook.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Got it.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Moving on to stuffing.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Do you guys tend to stuff yourselves on Thanksgiving?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Yes.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
In terms of, I don't want to move too quickly on to food.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
So.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
So then what is this?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
It's well, the category is stuffing.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Yeah.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
What do you mean by that?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
I don't know.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Do you love something that?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Speaking of family.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
That was my sister.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Face time auto doing me.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
Because he doesn't get great service where she lives.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
He lives with my parents.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
In Ohio?

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
That's a little bit too much information.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Well, my brother does for a living.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
I'm just saying what state your sister lives in.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Yeah.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
What you're asking for is for me to give a view for vendetta and as per Sarah.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
You're going to you're asking me to put her on blast and lambast myself.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
You said she lives with her parents.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
What else are you saying?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
She lives with my parents.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
I didn't mean to offer up either of this in pieces of information.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I was the only one who has my back.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
In the studio handout.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Mm-hmm.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Stuffing.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
I'm here.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Yeah.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Sometimes I'll eat too much.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
The food's good.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
All right.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I don't know why I was pointing to you to just get that out of you.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Joel, what do you think about stuffing in terms of Thanksgiving?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
My...

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
I've never known what stuffing is.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I will tell you completely honestly that...

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
Chopped bread with a bunch of spices baked to a crispy thing.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Is that real?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
There's no way that's what stuffing is.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Because stuffing goes inside turkey.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Why would you put bread inside turkey?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
It is bread.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Okay.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Then it sounds bad.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Sorry.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
I do think it's bad.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I don't like stuffing.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
It sounds bread.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Moving on to food.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
We already have.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
What's your favorite side?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
What's your favorite Thanksgiving side?

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
This by the way, this doesn't come out of the summer of eighth.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
I feel like me and Joel love stuffing the most,

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
but that might just be the one thing we have in common.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
My...

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Emma?

16:32.000 --> 16:38.000
On to make a nice, light chocolate cake.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
What's her name, Mavis?

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
No.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Does she keep typing?

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Does she teach typing?

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
Because she made this cake.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
I was.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
If I had said that, you would have stared me with the eggors.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
But Joel says it.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Joel, sorry, says it.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
And then you can't get enough of his shit.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Yeah.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
I give him the benefit of the doubt.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
And I'll give you the benefit of the gout.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Meaning?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
I assume you have some sort of arthritis condition.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Rumatoid, yeah.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
I don't prove it.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Otherwise.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
I don't have to read it until proving guilty.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Moving on to pickle ball.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
What?

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
That was us discussing Thanksgiving.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
I just played pickle ball for the first time last weekend.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Had that go for you.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
It was fast.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Okay.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
We won Best 3 out of 5.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Who's the...

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
So, I played doubles.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Did you play with two other people who also didn't play before?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Correct.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Nobody had played before.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
See, you went from zero to zero.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Of the game.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
You didn't even know that you played a crackling.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
What's that?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Do you have any way of knowing that you played correctly?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
You have zero way of knowing.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
All I know is that you can only win points when it's your serve.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
What I don't understand is the 331332.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
Please devastatingly pissed at me.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
You guys aren't in the room.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
You can't feel the anger.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I don't know what I've ever said.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
I've never said from all the way over.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
I've never said from all the way over.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
I've never said it's palpable.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Moving on from pickle ball.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
What did I ever do?

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
What did I ever do?

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
To make you this angered of me to have.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
Well, we went from stuffing to food to pickle ball.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
And this is the Thanksgiving episode that's coming out in early December.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Well, pickle ball could be a sign.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Pickle ball was by the way.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Because nobody has with my favorite Thanksgiving side.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Pickle ball.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Pickle balls.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Meaning?

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
You just understand how the points work.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
It's a romantic cucumber just rolled into a sack.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
All right, here we go.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
If you broke your bone and if you broke a bone as an adult, what color cast would you have?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Green.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
We're hopping all over the place.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
You're going to find all over the place.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
You're recording an episode after this when it feels like you're already scraping the bottom of the bear.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I'm saving up all my juice for that one.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
I see.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Who's on that one?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Onya Sage and Murika.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
The big four.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Also the four ingredients to my pickle balls.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
If you broke a bone as an adult, what color cast would you have?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Green.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Green is good.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
I don't mind green.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Why?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
And you better believe I'm having all my friends sign up.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Okay.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
I'm here.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Pink, hot pink.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Pretty cool.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Thank you.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
All right.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
If you got adult braces, what color would you have?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Let's start with your old orange.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I would never do that, shit.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Okay.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Holy shit.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Okay.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
I'm here.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
I'm trying to go invisible.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Okay.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Yep.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
If you could redefine your eyes, what color would you have?

19:45.000 --> 19:51.000
If I could redefine them, I'd make them like see through shit.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Okay.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
That's not what I meant.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
If you could redefine your eyes, what color eyes would you have?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Green.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
All right.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
You're here.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Also green.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Okay.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
If you wanted to change your ethnicity, why would you feel the need to do that?

20:05.000 --> 20:15.000
Also green.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Circling back to food.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Slash things I tried this weekend.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Have you guys ever had grape nuts?

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Is that enough?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
What kind of wild weekend did you have?

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Yeah.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Pickable and ripe grapes nuts?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
I'm trying to get healthy.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
You're trying to be 70.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Yeah.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
That's the craziest cereal I've been playing.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Yeah.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I'm having a whole brand and I'm running less.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Yeah.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I'm wondering what's headgums grape nuts?

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
Because grape nuts is post the cereal brands grape nuts.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
I'm wondering if headgum had sort of a flagship product.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Would it be the headgum podcast?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Would it be segments?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Oh.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
Haha.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
If anybody says factually, I'm going to get up and leave the room.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Because it's not factually.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
I guess if I say it, will you leave?

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
Well, hang on.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
I would say snacks sixes are flagship products.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Kind of a bummer.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
All right.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Here we go.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
This is our first second.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Well, actually, we should take a quick break.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Do you guys mind?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Please.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
For better for worse.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Are you a millennial and Mrs.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
With life was like in the 2000s?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Right?

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
Hard time finding curated or new music.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
Are you interested in multiple perspectives on relationships dating and music?

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Then you're going to love to see the things.

21:41.000 --> 21:48.000
See, the thing is, it's a podcast hosted by Grammy Award winning R&B artist Bridget Kelly

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
and podcast Trailblazer, Mandy B.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Twice a week.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
Bridget and Mandy have nostalgic conversations in their grown segments.

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
Critical pop culture conversations in their honest segments and relationship hot take

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
conversations in their slightly toxic segment.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
The opinions on the show are real and brought to you by the genuine connections that the ladies

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
have with the guests who they like to call their friends with benefits.

22:12.000 --> 22:18.000
Each week, you'll leave with some new music recommendations or a curated playlist that you didn't even know you needed

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
in their freshly squeezed music segment.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
Most recently, the ladies have sat down with Van Lathen, Robert Glasper and Durema Kessen.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
So be sure to stay up and see the thing is catch some of these new episodes that are coming out.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Check it out.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
Guys, I don't know about you, but it's 5 p.m. in the sun is setting right there, Ryan.

22:47.000 --> 22:53.000
And that can't help but put me into impressive state, right?

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
It's seasonal or otherwise.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
I mean, not everyone looks forward to the Hollywood season.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
That's all the time.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
The holiday season, rather.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
Maybe people do struggle with seasonal blues.

23:07.000 --> 23:13.000
Maybe, you know, it's hard to go home and see family or maybe you're not going home to see family.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
And that's hard in a different way.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
But in any case, this time a year can be a lot.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
And it's natural to feel some sadness or anxiety surrounding it.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Of course, right?

23:24.000 --> 23:29.000
But adding something new and positive to your life can be,

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
I don't know, sort of counteractive to those feelings.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
And therapy can be that thing.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
It can be a bright spot amid all the stress and change.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
Something to look forward to and to make you feel grounded.

23:42.000 --> 23:47.000
Something that gives you the tools you need to manage everything that's going on, right?

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
I'm in therapy every week twice a week now, actually.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
So that's where I'm at.

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
And it's very helpful to have like a forum to talk about, you know, things that you're anxious about,

23:57.000 --> 24:04.000
afraid of stressed about whether it's career, family, friends, relationships, et cetera.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
And I wouldn't, I can't recommend it enough.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
So if you're thinking of starting therapy, did better help a try?

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000

Welcome to diving into Blumenfeld.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Oh, god.

24:43.000 --> 24:50.000
My mind, I'm like, oh, finally a segment I can take some mental rest while other people talk.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
And then you went straight into diving into Blumenfeld.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
You can still take some rest.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
We're going to be commenting on your younger self.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Here we go.

24:59.000 --> 25:04.000
This is an interview from 2008, I think.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Yeah.

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
It says the title of the video is a mirror Blumenfeld interview that 2008.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
My name is Amir Blumenfeld.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
I am 25 years old.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
This is when I was 8.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
By the time you see this, I may be 26.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
That's also part of why I brought it up.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
You start the interview by saying, my name is a mirror.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Sorry, let me do my mirror.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
My name is Amir Blumenfeld, and I'm 25.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
You guys even see this or like, because we got two people.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Two people.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
It's really small.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Can you hear any of it?

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I doubt that you definitely can't hear now.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Yeah, I can't hear.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
I'm going to edit the audio just for a second here.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Yeah, for Joel and Emma to weigh in.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Yeah.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
For Joel.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Well, let me start.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Because now they can manage, right?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Yes.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
That you heard.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Okay.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
So this is, yeah, this is this.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
You start the video by saying, you think you'll keep that part in?

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Nope.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
My name is Amir Blumenfeld.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
I am 25 years old.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Though by the time you see this, I may be 26.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
I'm in the exact same part of my life right now.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
I'm 25, but by the time this episode comes out, I'll be 26.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Oh, interesting.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
It's kind of amazing.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
But will I live to see 24?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
What's that?

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
It's a coolios song.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Okay.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
Anyway, I thought that we could sort of go through a green sweater.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
In a way, that's a hood of you, not a sweater, but yeah.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
Basically, I thought that we...

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
I thought we could go through the interview.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
It's like 20 minutes long.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Criticize your answers.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Wow.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
And then I would also answer suit.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
And then in terms of Joel and Emma.

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
They can sort of dive into Blumenfeld.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Take that off.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Yeah.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Yeah.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
All right.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
Here we go.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Are you guys ready for diving into Blumenfeld,

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Do you understand the segment?

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
I understand.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Okay.

26:52.000 --> 27:00.000
I was born in Israel, moved to California at H2, moved to New York at H22.

27:00.000 --> 27:11.000
And now I work for collegehemer.com, which is a humor website that is responsible for producing

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
original content in terms of video articles and pictures.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
And I work with CHTV specifically, which is our original video department.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Here's what I'll say about that answer.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I feel like you answered it.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
Like you were trying to embellish an answer on a test.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Hmm.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
You could just say what you do.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
You don't think like you.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
You don't even?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Yeah.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
It was like for a call.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
This guy was like a college humor intern.

27:35.000 --> 27:41.000
And he's like, I need to do a three camera set up interview as part of my class.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Can I interview you?

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
And then I'll submit it as like a homework for the class.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
So I'm like, okay, sure.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
And he's like, I'll just ask you questions.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
You answer and I'll edit them later.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Okay.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Well, I don't know why you put it on YouTube though.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Yeah.

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
It is for me to give really like mundane answers to stuff with like three different cameras.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Bopping on the different lines.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
As if you're saying something really dramatic.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Yeah.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Jeff, you're answering?

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
My answer is that I was born in Cleveland in Ohio, moved to Los Angeles, California,

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
when I was 17.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
I've lived 200%.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Um.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Okay.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
What do I do?

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
I host a podcast on the podcast network.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
And I, uh, so a lot of like sort of similarities.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
No, because let's try my own college humor.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Yeah.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Yeah.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I'm just saying where we are in our lives.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
Do you think a green hoodie would be the green sweater of your day?

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
Uh, no, I wasn't like super stylish.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
I still wear hoodies.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
I'm currently wearing a hoodie.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Yeah, but that's a good hoodie.

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
That's a hoodie that you could give down to your, um, future wife.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
And what do you think about, um,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
What do I think about what?

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
I don't know what's going on.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
So what do you mean what do I do?

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
The hoodie, the question.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Yes.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
All of it.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
All of the above.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Interview.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
I wasn't really looking at the.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.000
The hoodie, but, um, we, I don't want it.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
It's not bothering you.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
I just don't know what I'm being asked.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
I first realized that was funny at a young age.

29:18.000 --> 29:28.000
Um, I remember reading just recently a letter that my third grade teacher wrote to me saying that I had a very good sense of humor and that I should keep it up.

29:28.000 --> 29:36.000
I remember in 10th grade, one of my friends went away for a year and came back and said that I was all the sudden like a class clown character,

29:36.000 --> 29:43.000
a jokester in class where usually that I guess previous to that that wasn't the case.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
So maybe I realized that was funny at an early age.

29:46.000 --> 29:54.000
I realized that I can make people laugh at a later age and then by college time I was sort of trying to make jokes in terms of writing.

29:54.000 --> 30:02.000
So I would spend time thinking of funny articles or, uh, funny videos that I could make that could make a wider audience laugh.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Not, not bad.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
We're totally shit.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
You ace that one.

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
I'm going to talk about their elementary school teacher though, telling them they like can't do something.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Actually, I think you're pretty funny.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Eight-year-olds keep it up.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
I remember that letter.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
Like, she wrote everyone a letter at the end of the year.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
It was like, I'm here at the very same thing on everyone's keep it up.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
And we all turned out to be successful comedian.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
It was incredible.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
It was me and Michael Sarah and Jonah Hill.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
We all attended the same third grade.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Which was on in Hill.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
What's that?

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
And Cohen.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
And Cohen, yeah.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Who might have kept it up a bit too much.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Very good.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
You're fired for that, but very funny.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Keep it up.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
I loved that answer from you.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
I thought it was concise.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
I thought it was descriptive.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
I thought that it was worthy of the age.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Oh, word.

31:02.000 --> 31:08.000
My third grade teacher's son ended up being my first theatrical agent.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Very senseless.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Third grade teacher's son.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Yeah.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Is he older or younger than you?

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
He's older.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
And then you moved to LA.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
And he was like, oh, my mom is your third grade teacher.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
No, we discovered it in the meeting.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Where are you from?

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Oh, oh, me too.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Where in Ohio?

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
So sugar and falls.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Oh, where'd you go to school?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Told to my high school or my school.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
My mom was like, my mom taught there.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
I said, who's your mom?

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
And she said, Mrs. Davis.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
And I was like, there's no way.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
I knew it was your teacher.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Well.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
Who was from Baltimore, actually?

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
I'm Belly's the famous last story.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
No, yeah.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Do you guys remember your third grade teacher's name?

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Yeah.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Yeah.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
You do?

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Yeah.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I remember all of my elementary school teachers do.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
All of them first grade.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Second grade.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
You remember their names?

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Yeah.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Why?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Why?

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Why?

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Why?

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Why?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Why?

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Yeah.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
That was my fourth grade teacher.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Joel, are you in the same boat?

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
You remember their name?

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
For some reason, the third grade is drawing a blank.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
But first grade.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Second grade.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Second grade.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
Second grade.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Miss Denzel.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Fourth grade.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Miss Rothrock.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Fifth grade.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Doctor.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
Former.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Oh, my god.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Yeah.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Doctors.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Teaching.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Over quality.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Yeah.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Do you know what else does that mean?

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Were you like up in their calling or doctor?

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
She insisted on being called doctor.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Whoa.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
So.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
See, this is why I do these segments.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
No.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
No.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
We didn't try to rescue them.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
You know what else?

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Because you get interesting.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
We get into stuff.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
We have because I asked them.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
We learned one of them.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
We just fucking get embarrassed.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
We're going to get back to that.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
It's not about embarrassment, by the way.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
I just congratulated you asked on a second question.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Moving on.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
Of course, a lot of the first ones are terrible, but that's how it goes when you

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
make stuff.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
The first anything you make is going to be awful.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
And then you gradually get better until you die.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
I get my ideas.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
I wouldn't say it's a specific place.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
That it's always from the front page of the New York Times.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
It's just joking.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
I get my ideas.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
I think I'm influenced comedically by lots of the television that I watch growing up.

33:25.000 --> 33:30.000
Simpson, Seinfeld, sort of mid-90s Saturday Night Live.

33:30.000 --> 33:39.000
It taught me how to think sort of absurdly and creatively and originally about jokes that people

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
were making.

33:40.000 --> 33:47.000
So rather than thinking of basic jokes, which I was into as like a six, seven, eight year old,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
you know, 101 ghost jokes.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
I was learning to make jokes on jokes.

33:52.000 --> 33:58.000
So trying to take my comedy to a non-expected punchline.

33:58.000 --> 34:04.000
I forgot the question, but I hope that there's an answer somewhere in there.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Can I ask?

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
Do you ever yearn for this time in your life?

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
BB-25.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Yeah.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
I romanticized living in New York and working for college humor.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
But in my mind, it's my current age.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Not like this version of myself.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Okay.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
So you romanticized it, but you want to go back now.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Yes, exactly.

34:22.000 --> 34:28.000
I want to be the version of myself that I know and am currently, but living as a 22 year old in New York.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Got it.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
Joel, how do you feel about the way that I'm your answer to this question?

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
And then we'll move on to the next segment, obviously.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
I meant this.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
I don't even need to start.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
I don't even need to start.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
So like if you say pass, we'll just move on to the next segment.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
So I accept there's a lot of stuff we need to dive into in that answer.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
Pass.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
All right.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Nine times out of ten.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
They're not the ones getting their skulls cracked open.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
So they, like, as well.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Thank you.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Listen.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
You can watch TV.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
The activists.

35:02.000 --> 35:07.000
They love a massive police tape that knows whether or not you order plans

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Seapills online.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
So never forget that guys.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
You can serve it around with that.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
I've never heard a plan see.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Yeah.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Same.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
Interesting.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Oh, yeah.

35:26.000 --> 35:35.000
Come back with a gun.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
Pass, I said.

35:39.000 --> 35:44.000
This is Jeferty.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Right.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Let's talk about the new show.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Monchi.

35:48.000 --> 35:54.000
Monchi style.

35:54.000 --> 35:59.000
I just wanted to give you an option slash opportunity to promote the show.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Right.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
To maybe get some of our listeners to listen to your show.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
Yeah.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Which I feel like cross promo.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
We were talking about.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
This is that David Cross promo.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Because I feel like it's the head gun podcast.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Yeah.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
And then it's like segments.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
So like every segments listener listens to the head gun podcast.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
But I just wanted to lend some of our audience to you.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Does that make sense?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
Yeah.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
I don't think that's true.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
I understand what you're saying.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Tell us what the show is.

36:26.000 --> 36:32.000
Why it aired when it did and who hosted and who.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
So to answer your last question first.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Yes.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Who is me?

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Okay.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
And Jake.

36:40.000 --> 36:46.000
When it aired when it does is every Monday after Jake's paternity leave expired.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
So we're back.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
And what the show is is segments, which is like a show kind of like.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Not unlike the head gun podcast.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
There's different segments.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
But we're a little more structured.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
And to that end, I thought that we could play a game from segments.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Okay.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
That's cool.

37:01.000 --> 37:06.000
Which is the only recurring segment so far on segments, which is poetry or poems.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
It's poetry or no, it's true.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Poetry or no, it's true.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
So I thought that we could all play this.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Have you guys heard about this?

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
This is also central and I must start listening to this.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
But it's hard because it requires writing a poem.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Well, I've done that.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
I've played the game here.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
I see.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
So this is three.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I've written one of them.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
And I really don't think you're going to be able to figure out which one it is.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
Wow.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Okay.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Let's try.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
All right.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
So here we go.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
You guys have to come to a consensus too.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
This is called clown.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Yours.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Next.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Fool in my.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Oh my.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
I really wanted to say it's yours right away.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
The amusement of the masses.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
They're stupid laughter pushes me here.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
This is the.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
The more absurd my play equals grimace.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
The equals the more I rumble resentfully.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
The shrieks grow shriller.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
I feel as the dog does the lash.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
That weaponless tugs on his leash.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
Agony convulses with suffering.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
My soul weeps and death in morning.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Pral.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Got it.

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
So just to clarify, are the other two poems award-winning poems

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
or just anything anyone published or one ones?

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
They are poems written by poets.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
I don't know if they were award-winning.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
A little more profession.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Yeah.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
Also, I could just because Emma, you're also produced one of the last episodes of

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
the segments.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
What's the difference between the energy and that room versus the energy in this room?

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Why is it so much more dull?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Wait, wait.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Which ones more dull?

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
You're saying segments is dull?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
This is dull.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
LA.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
I don't I mean think of the one.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
It's a factor.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
That was not present that it's now, I mean.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
All right.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
All right.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Very good.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
This one's called this room, which I think is pertinent to what you just said.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Grimmace equals joy.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
It was Grimmace equals the more I rumble.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Okay.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
This room.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
The room I entered was a dream of this room.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
Surely all those feet on the sofa were mine.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
The oval portrait of a dog was me at an early age.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
The oval portrait of a dog.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
Something shimmers, something is hushed up.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
We had macaroni for lunch every day, except Sunday.

39:37.000 --> 39:42.000
When a small quail was induced to be served to us.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Why do I tell you these things?

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
You're not even here.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
I definitely don't think you wrote that one.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
And I don't think you wrote the first one either.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
You don't think I wrote the first one?

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
I don't.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I think the most reason one might have been you.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Really?

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
I want to hear the third one.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Yeah.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
They did talk about inducing a quail to eat it.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
Yeah.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
To have it thus.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
All right.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
This is proximity to dull.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
You wrote all three.

40:14.000 --> 40:19.000
That's definitely in play.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
That I wrote all three.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
Bombastic socks adorn this manji crack.

40:27.000 --> 40:36.000
Oh, already.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
Or rather dork.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Or rather dorky husband.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
Seeing urologist nuspim.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
Seeing urologist nuspim.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Like the nuspim.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
The guy's name?

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
No.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
Or yeah.

40:55.000 --> 41:02.000
Depression ought to be set him or at least he'd be in debt vim.

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
Mazda's oils good to have.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Yeah.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
So that is my address.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
I will say probably wrote the last one.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
If not all three of them quite frankly.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
Joel.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
Do you think that you wrote the third one?

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
And you made some edits to the first two.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
That's really good.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Emma?

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
I was going to say the third, but then you're thus found thing for me off.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
You seemingly not knowing if it was a name or not.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
No, he knew.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
He knew.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Yeah.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
There's also my address in it.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Kind of a dead giveaway.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
I don't think a mirror knows any other poets.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Okay.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Not that would write about me.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Third is correct.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
The first one is clown by Fritz Asher,

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
which is just Cohen's son, but like on the Fritz.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Yeah.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
And then this room was written by John Ashbury.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
A lot of ash.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Proximity to dull.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Proximity to dull is by me.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
You liked the second one, Emma?

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
I did.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
I loved John Ashbury though.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
Oh, you know him.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
I thought all of them were written.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
I think he's like the best.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Um, or he's like considered the best.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
Poet.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
The last like hundred years or something.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Oh, wow.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
I think I agree.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
And I think all three were amazing.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Yeah.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Do you think he's read Proximity to dull?

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
You want to read through those?

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Which one?

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
So you can understand what it's about.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
You over the wall.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Proximity to dull.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Okay.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
It's called Proximity to dull.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Uh, this is this poem.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Bombastic socks.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Adorn this mangy crack.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
Or rather, dorky husband.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Seeing urologist, nuspum.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Hmm.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Depression ought to be set him.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Or at least he'd be in debt with him.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
What's them?

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Like them or bigger?

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
What's nuspum?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
That's a doctor or urologist.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
But if you're making him up, shouldn't it rhyme with husband?

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
It's nothing rhymes with husband that would work for the poem other than nuspum.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
No, it could be any name that you choose because you made up the name.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Yeah, but nuspum is a real word.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
It's a real name.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
It's a real surname.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
It's a real surname.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Is that urologist?

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
That's Samir's urologist.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
That's Samir's urologist.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
I have to assume.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Mazda's oil.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
Good to have.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Yeah.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
My address again.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
So you're going to have to want to bleep it both of those times.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
Yeah.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Can you just say for the record though that it does rhyme?

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
It does.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
That part read.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
So bombastic socks.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
Are you wearing bombas?

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
No.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
But you're often do.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
Why should have asked what he got socks are loud?

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
What do you guys think this poem's about?

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Me?

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
Pretty good.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
I think you're diving into Blumenfeld.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
Oh, I have about to dive dull.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
In that way, one segment kind of weaves into the net.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
Exactly.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
A tapestry worn and shorn.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
Loven forever.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
Yeah.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
It's really giving like fridge poem.

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
Like it's really giving like poetry foundation for the day.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
Like the words that are left and you're kind of.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Yeah.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
It's kind of just like front page of the New York Times.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
Holy shit.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
He's the best seller.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
You even make the same joke that I'm here main in the video.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
But I'm best actually.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Because you often wear bombas.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
I wear balaga socks actually.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
A door in this mangy crack.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
You've already read the poem.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Yeah.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
I know, but none of you guys are applying it to a mirror.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Or rather a door.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
About his ass crack?

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
Yeah.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
It's like plumbers crack in a way.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Yeah.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
And you think I put socks there?

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
I.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
I would like to put a bombas suck there.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
Kind of plug it.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Not your ass.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Just like the plumbers crack part of it.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
Speaking of plugs.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Joel, what do you got going on?

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
What do you want to point the people towards the four zeros?

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
Everyone should listen to David Cross's new show.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000

When is the next census?

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
And can I not be counted?

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
Because I want to go ghost mode.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
No.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
I don't think it will work for me.

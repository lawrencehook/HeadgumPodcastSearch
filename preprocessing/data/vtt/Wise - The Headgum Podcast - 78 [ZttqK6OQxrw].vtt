00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
Thank you to ManScape for sponsoring this episode of our show.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
Oh, gentlemen, the holidays came early here at ManScape.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
The leading men's hygiene brand.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
ManScape just launched new products, including their all-new, ultra premium

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
body wash, and a two-in-one shampoo and conditioner.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Time to kill yourself or someone who needs it.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
The gift of beautiful skin, hair, and balls this holiday season.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Go to ManScape.com and use code.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
What's that?

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Jingle balls to the walls fellas.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Listen up.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Untrimmed cubes are a thing of the past.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
And it's possible you have sand as peered in your pants.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
It's time to leave your significant others.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Some cookies and milk at the bottom of your chimney.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm done.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
That's horrible.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
I'm talking about the ManScape.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
Performance package for point-o.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
Before I started using ManScape, I used to slice and dice my package.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
But now, I use the Performance package for point-o from ManScape.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
Where it's literally impossible to cut your balls.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Think to their skin-save technology.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Inside the Performance package for point-o.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
You'll find the signature lawn more for point-o.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
This electric trimmer has proprietary skin-save technology

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
to reduce cuts on your nuts.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
It's also waterproof so you can use it in the shower.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
And it's like a gift to your partner with less mess.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
This hygiene bundle also comes with a pair of ManScape,

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
Daint-I-Jething Boxers that'll keep your junk feeling fresh all day.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
The perfect package for your perfect package.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
They also just launched their two-in-one shampoo and conditioner

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
which has key ingredients with benefits that include

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
hydrating nourishing, conditioning the scalp,

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
and strengthening your hair at the same time.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Tis the season to load up on ManScape products.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
So get yourself your dad, your brother and friends.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
The best gift of all.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Clean up your nuts and make sense to proud this.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Was it belated?

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Was the show belated?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
What?

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Was the show you hasn't stopped?

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Belated.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Belated?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
That's the same as happening.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
You can't already come in the hot and angry.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
During the opening number.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
That should be the biggest highest energy positive moment.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
And you were yelling at Billy during it.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Oh, because you know what?

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
We get on the Zoom and Billy's like, oh, I have to pass on an audition.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Which you shouldn't do by the way.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Because all work you can by the way.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
And don't tell me no.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Because that is what happened.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
That's what happened.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
You can do it.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
I'm not saying it's not.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Yes.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Yes.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
You can't tell me no.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I said don't yell during it.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
You said no.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Because.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
So the no part meant nothing.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Bang on a bomber.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Right on the gates.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Hit me Johnny.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
All right.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
I mean, it just came out of nowhere.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
That kind of you are already bringing the show down.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
It seemed like you and a mirror were already in a little tizzy.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
And I felt a little awkward about it.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
It's not a tizzy.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
It's just a conversation.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Conversation can be tense and still be there.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I mean, you're not wrong.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
But this is a comedy podcast.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
You should probably probably be a little bit nicer.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Did you pass on untitled legal project?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Oh, no.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I didn't pass on that.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Did you read for untitled legal project?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Yeah.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
Well, it was more of a deposition than an audition.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Right.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
No.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
You had jury duty.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
And you didn't show up or something?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Yeah.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I had jury duty.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
And I didn't show because it's called passing on untitled legal project.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
That's a little Hollywood joke for you guys.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
That's a classic singer.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
You can tell it.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
A West Hollywood eatery.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
Like a sweet greens or a tender greens or an era Juan.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Like a classic L.A. style,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
participery,

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
Delhi, Katessa, and restaurant style cafeteria.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Any of these greens?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Yeah.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
That's right.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Any of the things you just said.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
They're not Delhi's or bakeries.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Okay.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Yeah.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Yeah.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
You can call me daddy.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Thank you.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Bill, you just cut your hair.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yeah.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
I did.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
And we do these over video now.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
I don't know if you know that.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I did not.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
You didn't warn me of that.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
But I did know that.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Okay.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
You should have told me that.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
But I did know that I was going to.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
You're saying as a producer.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Yeah.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Yeah.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
As a friend.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Yeah.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Just let me know.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Hey, we're going to be recording this as a video.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
But I was aware of that.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Major Keeler.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Catch people off guard.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
To find them at their worst.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
You're terrible.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
So you don't learn your lesson.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
You learn the opposite lesson.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
That's worse than not learning a lesson.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
You messed up and then you doubled down to turn into a life hack.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
That was easy.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Johnny last night.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
That was a hit.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Yeah.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Boom.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Yeah.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Yeah.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
The comments don't lie.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Yeah.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
It's a good ending.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Which is great.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
It feels good.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
The Camilla commending you.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
Or should we should have been Sean commendas.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Camilla commending their relationship.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Because they are a split spell.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
I don't know.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Yeah.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
They just covered that spell.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
They broke that.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Did they decide to call it split spell at squaresville?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Probably.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Who niche dumb?

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
What do you mean?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
What do you mean?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
She's a vintage store on Vermont.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Yeah.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
A single store.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
It's a vintage store in Vermont that you recommend me go to.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
And it was close twice when I went.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
They had two separate COVID outbreaks.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
That's true.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
I don't know why you did recommend it.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
I did apologize to them for bringing it there.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
But I got a shirt that was for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
So who's really laughing now?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Nobody.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Yeah.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
No one's laughing.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
So losing game for everybody.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
I'm just reading about last week's last week's episode.

07:34.000 --> 07:42.000
Headgums newest hired Gianna joins Johnny Marie can Jeff to discuss rice wine.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
I've spent that wrong actually.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
We're supposed to be rice wine.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
So it's like you feed a cow.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
A ton of pumpernical.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Okay.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
What is this?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
This is an animal.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Us.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
You know what you just said, right?

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
What did you imagine to happen when you made the rice wine?

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Feeding itself on vernical.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
You wanted the fucking standing ovation.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
You have to play the audio clip then.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
I was going to come.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
I was going to come.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Billy.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
What's new in the life in times of brick?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Not much.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
I bought my best game yesterday.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
200.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Not even closed.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
70.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Yeah.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
No.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
151.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
It was my best game of liking.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
It was okay.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
I kind of blew it at the end.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
But I got after really hot start.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
I don't know.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
I'm going back to Canada soon.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Why?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I see a movie tonight.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
I don't know.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
I don't.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I'm not loving it in Los Angeles.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
And I'm going to be there just for the holidays.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
And then figure out where I'm going to go after that.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
So LA was semi permanent.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
It wasn't like a.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
You weren't moving here for real for good.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
No.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
This was me like just testing it out.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Kind of.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
And then maybe longer term.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Depending on.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Yeah.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Well, thanks for giving us confidential information.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
So we had to.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
If I can edit that out.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
You're going to cut your hair soon, Jeff.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
No.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
I don't think so.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Let's see it.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Oh.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Oh.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Oh my god.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Holy shit.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
It's so long.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
And you have no end in sight.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
We're doing these video podcasts.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
So you're like playing it up for audio.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
But most people are going to be watching it.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And it's not that long.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
It's pretty long.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Oh my god.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
It's flowing in the woods.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
It's crazy.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
It's crazy.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Kind of just clipping it perfectly.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
A rim light from behind you.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Yeah.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Yeah.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Fabio style length.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
And girth girth.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Yeah.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
So the plan is to just keep it going down past your shoulders.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
TBD.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
I think so.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
They'll probably come a day where I'm sick of it.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Because it is kind of a lot of maintenance.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
But I like being able to do things with it.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
And women love it, Billy.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Do that.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Yeah.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
They like running their dirty little grabbers through it.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Gross.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
That tells your problem.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
It's awful.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
And that's the reaction I earned by them.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
You don't get to play God and decide with the action for shit.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
To each of your days.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Johnny, what's new in the Times of Villa?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Not the life.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Just the Times.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
The Times?

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
It's 543.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
It's kind of darker in New York a lot earlier now.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Because of daylight savings, which is interesting.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
It's like a darker, gritty or tan.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
I know.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
You know your work man.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
I can tell.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Welcome to New York.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Welcome to New York.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
We've been waiting for you.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
So.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Yeah.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
Billy, you should live in New York because like if you're like at the beginning of where you're going to decide to live.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
If I could go back and do it over again, I think I would do New York first.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Because eventually you probably have to move daily.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Jeff, you're like 23 years old.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
I know.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
But like came here for college.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
And then I'm going to abandon all my close friends who care about me a lot.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
And do things for me even when they forget my birthday.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Was it your birthday recently?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
No.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
It was your birthday recently.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Recent enough.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Yeah.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Two weeks, three weeks.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Three weeks.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Yeah.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Um.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Are you moving to New York in like three days?

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Yes.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
You just said you're not going to abandon all your friends.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
And I decided you are moving in like three days.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Okay.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
All right.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
This is that William and Richard.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
This is that Nicholas style.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
My email.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Yeah.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Yeah.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Again, don't dox yourself.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
I don't like them.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
They don't care.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
No one's going to email me about this.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Now they will.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
And guess what else?

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
The fucking out of context Twitter thing is probably going to blast your email.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
It's not only the Twitter spheres.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
But deviant art Johnny style.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
So you like deviant art.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Yeah, and also we can believe that.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
It mirrors right it.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
No.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
No.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
No.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I made my bed.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
I made my hand.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
It's in good faith.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Ask you to delete my email for sure.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
I need to deal with the repercussions here.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
I need to learn about that.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
There needs to be consequences to my actions.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Um.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
I respect that.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
We talked about this briefly over text.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
But I've been trying to get wise recently.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
And that manifests in various modes of communication.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
Not only verbal, but non non verbal and non violent.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
And I thought that maybe we could just take a couple minutes to be wise.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
What's that in jail?

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
That's not enough of an icebreaker.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
That's not a leaping off point.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Let's go to the New York Times.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
And we'll talk about one of these articles.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Okay.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
House narrowly passes Biden's social safety net and climate bill.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Let's not act like this is progressive legislation.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Now this is them, by the way.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Yeah.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
You're giving us knowledge, I guess.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
With it's not really.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Yeah.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Yeah.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
If you want to bring your headlines at us.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
This news is wise.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
News is wise.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
News is wise.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
News is how you get wise.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Because you know the facts.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Ass.

13:52.000 --> 14:01.000
I would argue that wisdom is more about the ability to absorb information.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
It's almost like intelligence versus knowledge.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
You're just giving us the answers.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
But you're not really enlightening us in a way that lets us enjoy the journey.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
If that makes sense.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Okay.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
And riddle me this.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
My GPA was 4.12 on a 4.33 scale in high school.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
So it's at 4.33 scale.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
That's A plus.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
So anything like 97 and up was an A plus and that gave you a 433.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Yes.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Yes.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
So you got looks.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
It's just generally half A plus is in half A's.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Correct.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Impressive.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
I got a V plus once.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Nice.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Still not wisdom.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
I don't think.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
Think you're just good at taking tests or something.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Yes.

14:52.000 --> 14:59.000
And that's what I was bringing it up to say is that knowing just the answers is wisdom and vice versa.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Right.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
The fact that you think that is not what?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Yeah.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Exactly opposite.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
I'm opposite.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
I don't know what.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
You guys always wait for me to fucking facilitate joy.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I'm wondering if you guys bring your own shit in.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Right.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Last week on a camera really prepared.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I'm not saying segments this year.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
I'm just saying not this week.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
But I'm saying contribute to the conversation.

15:21.000 --> 15:29.000
Don't wait for me to kind of quarterback it because you're a key alert.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Do you have one?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
No.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
Sound like he just fucking said one don't facilitate.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
No.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
It wasn't a major killer.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
It was a minor note alert.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
It was a major bag alert.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Not to read the receipt of the food.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
I said no.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I did not read the receipt.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
You know why?

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Because it was covered with fucking ants in a swirl of raccoon got to it.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
There was debris all over my front porch.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
So I didn't read the receipt.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I didn't get the joke because he sent it to me.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Nobody touched the food.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
$40 worth of fast food chicken and fries.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
Delivered to my door left for animals to have.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I couldn't even enjoy it.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
I would have liked to eat chicken.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
But Jeff doesn't tell me that it's coming.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
She just orders it.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
It stays on my front porch.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
And the joke is that I find it a day or two later.

16:19.000 --> 16:25.000
I have to clean it up because of course there's fucking sauce and fries all over my front yard.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
And then I throw it away.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
And then I text Jeff.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Nice.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
You got me.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
Animals $8.40 worth of food that you sent me and didn't tell me about.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
And he goes major bag alert.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Did you read the receipt?

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
No, I didn't read the receipt.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Just text me a fucking joke.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
You don't have to spend $40 to write it on a car that someone delivers to me.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
And I never read.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
What was the receipt?

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Major bag alert.

16:57.000 --> 17:08.000
It was um, so you know, post made sometimes does like a branded deals for like TV

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
shows or major media personalities.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Okay.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
No.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Sure.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Like the Travis Scott burger or something.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
It was so DJ Khaled has a as a post made partnership right now.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
And it's another wing.

17:24.000 --> 17:31.000
And so I got you the major bag alert, which is, let me just, I really want to cite my sources here.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
So why don't you tell me that it was coming?

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
I thought they were going to knock on your door.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
And then you thought I got it and ate it and didn't tell you anything.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
No, when I didn't hear from you, I assumed it was at your door.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
And then I didn't text you.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Major bag alert.

17:49.000 --> 17:56.000
30 piece classic boneless wings with choice of two flavors regular fries and dips wasted.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
And I did it with, I got the um, you loyal lemon pepper sauce.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
And they don't want you to win truffle.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
So just take a screen grab of that send it to me.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
You don't actually order it.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Have people prepare and drive it over.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
For absolutely nothing.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Did you tip the driver Jeff?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Uh, yeah.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I tip them 15%.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Nice.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Yeah.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Yeah.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
They told him to keep the food.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
That's got to waste.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Yeah.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
It wasn't great.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Absolutely.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Yeah.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
But then we wouldn't have had this conversation.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Let me see if I could pull it.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
It would have been like someone gave me the major bag alert at work.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
I was having a tough day.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Yeah.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
A long day.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
And my air conditioning wasn't working in my car.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
And then I just got this amazing.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Um, notification that said I could keep the food.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Mm.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
It'd been great.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Yeah.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
It would have been much better than this.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
This is like a 10 not even.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
This is like a 25th of the of the podcast.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
This is what I saw the next morning at 9 a.m.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
After walking my dog.

19:03.000 --> 19:09.000
I just want to mention that some of their other sauces were suffering from success,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
sweet, sesueteriyaki.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
I ain't regular ranch.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Ugh.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Yeah.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I can't be held accountable.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
It's your doing you did this.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
You had been in guilt.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
Jeff is just admitting a different problem that he has.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
I'm the lead into this.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
I mean, capable of being held accountable for shit.

19:34.000 --> 19:41.000
Um, no, but it is time for, uh, a seminal segment that we've been doing every week, Billy.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
It's, uh, it's bit, sorry.

19:44.000 --> 19:59.000
Okay, so, uh, you caused that.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
You could have just turned that off at any time.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
Wasting precious time or not, pressed it.

20:05.000 --> 20:11.000
Bond of the week.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
James?

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Or...

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Okay.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Street.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
The sushi place in New York.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
No, James Bond.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
Every week, uh, until the next James Bond is cast, we're going to lob up our casting options for

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
the next James.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Um, this week, I'd like to pause it.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Bill Nye.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Why?

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Two.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Two.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Yeah.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Because then the movie could be called Golden Nye.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
No.

20:37.000 --> 20:47.000
Yeah, they're going to put the actor's name in the title for a comment.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
There, any precedent for that?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
There is none, but you know what?

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
There's no precedent for Pierce Brosnan.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
It was Irish.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
It was absolutely Irish.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
And now he's trying to sell a beach house mansion in Malibu for a hundred million.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
I don't know.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Isn't there something with watches and bonds?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
You're into watches.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
Is there like a James Bond watch connection?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Yeah.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
So the earlier movies it was Rolex would supply the watches.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
So that's part of how the submariner got, uh, I became iconic.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
Uh, and then eventually the partnership changed to Omega, which is huge for Omega

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
because, uh, there, um, less beloved brand.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
But every time a new Bond movie comes out, they release a watch that's in the movie

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
and you can buy it limited edition.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
Um, and people like the sea master that they release for this one.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
What does it know time to die?

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Uh, but it's not my favorite.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
The loom plots are, it's, it's faux patinaed.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Which is, uh, screw you man.

21:47.000 --> 21:52.000
Screw you.

21:52.000 --> 21:59.000
It's basically like this.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Yeah.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Yeah.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Yeah.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
It, isn't that a bolt?

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Shut up.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
I didn't want a bolt.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
So I thought I'd screw you.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Instead.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Are you nuts?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
That's good.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
That's a great way.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
It's really good.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Yeah.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Would you have to take a break?

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
I wish we could ride that, like adrenaline in momentum comedy-wise,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
but we do have to take a break and think some sponsors.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
Yeah.

22:28.000 --> 22:33.120
Thank you to Bean for sponsoring this episode of our show guys get ready for the ultimate

Guys, again, I take these supplements already, not all of them, but some of them magnesium

23:21.920 --> 23:27.400

23:27.400 --> 23:32.000
So to have all of that in a hot cocoa, I can't wait to try this.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.600
I mean, beans, what do we wait, non-brother?

23:34.600 --> 23:41.080
I need to get some of this hot cocoa, this some of this dream powder, as they say.

23:41.080 --> 23:44.120
People absolutely love dream powder and the reviews Jennifer M. Road, I've suffered

23:44.120 --> 23:45.960
from insomnia for years.

23:45.960 --> 23:49.920
I've tried just about every supplement on the market and this is by far the most effective.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.280
I'm very grateful for it.

23:51.280 --> 23:54.720
I fall asleep quickly and sleep deeper and longer.

23:54.720 --> 23:55.720
Thank you, Beam.

23:55.720 --> 23:57.840
Melanie wrote, this stuff is legit.

23:57.840 --> 24:01.120
I'm a gym rat or just turn 50 and has sleep issues.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.760
I take this at 10 p.m. and sleep from 11 to 6.

24:03.760 --> 24:08.120
The best part is that I wake up feeling refreshed and ready to hit the gym.

24:08.120 --> 24:11.880

Go to betterhelp.com slash what's that?

25:01.640 --> 25:05.160
Like a sin guy, his life is full of stressors, right?

25:05.160 --> 25:10.080
Doesn't matter who you are or what you have, your life is probably stressful.

25:10.080 --> 25:15.240
For me, I find it incredibly difficult to fall asleep, right?

25:15.240 --> 25:27.280
And that can't help but manifest in a life full of drowsiness, you know, wandering thoughts,

25:27.280 --> 25:29.400
wandering hands.

25:29.400 --> 25:34.160
And you may not be feeling down and totally out and depressed, or like you're at a total

25:34.160 --> 25:35.160
loss.

25:35.160 --> 25:39.080
But if your stress is high, your temper is shorter than usual, or even if you start to

25:39.080 --> 25:42.400
feel strained in any of your relationships, you could probably use the chance to unload.

25:42.400 --> 25:47.600
So unload the stressors and get it out by talking to somebody who's completely unbiased

25:47.600 --> 25:49.640
about your life, right?

25:49.640 --> 25:53.400
Someone who's not going to judge you or take sides on anything.

25:53.400 --> 25:57.000
You know, when there's things that you feel like you can't tell anyone, I feel like

25:57.000 --> 26:00.680
you can't unload to friends and family, but you need to unload it.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.080
That's what therapy can be.

26:02.080 --> 26:08.080
So go to betterhelp.com to find customized online therapy that offers video, phone, and

26:08.080 --> 26:11.960
even live chat sessions with your therapist, so you don't have to see anyone on camera

26:11.960 --> 26:13.360
if you don't want to.

26:13.360 --> 26:16.840
It's also much more affordable than in-person therapy, and you can start communicating

26:16.840 --> 26:19.400
with your therapist in under 48 hours.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.720
So unload the stressors and get some unbiased feedback.

26:21.720 --> 26:24.280
You'd be pretty surprised at what you might learn.

And we're back.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.200
Let's get the energy up.

26:44.200 --> 26:47.720
If you guys aren't contributing as much as I'd like you to other than Amir, Amir's

26:47.720 --> 26:48.720
bringing some energy.

26:48.720 --> 26:49.720
I don't know where it's coming from.

26:49.720 --> 26:53.880
Hopefully, it stays going into his weekend, and that this doesn't zap it, because

26:53.880 --> 26:58.760
he always complains that when he does the show, it kind of sucks your creative energy.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.880
You said he didn't know where his energy was coming from.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.240
It was coming from a very spiteful and hateful place.

27:03.240 --> 27:10.880
He was mad that you delivered food to his door unannounced at one of the other.

27:10.880 --> 27:16.640
Half anger for you, and half of this cold brew that I'm quickly finishing, unfortunately.

27:16.640 --> 27:23.280
Billy, did I do something to hurt your feelings?

27:23.280 --> 27:28.640
You invited me to your headgum live show, told me I was on the list, and then I arrived,

27:28.720 --> 27:34.720
bringing my girlfriend feeling proud, and I wasn't on the list, and they didn't allow me in.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.720
Okay.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.720
Okay.

27:38.720 --> 27:41.360
Oh, go, go, go, go, go.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.840
Street call Finn and have him loop in Millie.

27:44.840 --> 27:51.680
Okay, right, for like a number of reasons, definitely not.

27:51.680 --> 27:55.280
Well, I'll send you, I'll send you some fast food to make up for it.

27:55.920 --> 27:59.040
At least let him know that it's there.

28:09.280 --> 28:12.080
Welcome to backup careers.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.160
Or nah.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.680
No, it's just...

28:15.680 --> 28:19.920
Let me fucking host the show if you're going to give me this platform.

28:19.920 --> 28:22.400
I like a mirror.

28:22.480 --> 28:26.720
You want me to fucking change it on the fly to backup careers or not?

28:26.720 --> 28:31.760
Because it could kind of be like, you could have a backup career, or you could pursue what you really

28:31.760 --> 28:34.400
wanted all along, which I think is wise.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.240
That is wise.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.840
That's very wise of a mirror.

28:37.840 --> 28:43.600
Yeah, well, to have a backup and choose to not follow it means that you're thinking about it.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.800
And it means that you're betting on yourself in such a way that it doesn't matter.

28:46.800 --> 28:49.840
You know what the other paths are, but you're just going to stay true to yourself.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.880
And in that way, success does...

28:52.880 --> 28:57.440
You don't need like financial success or like critical success, just the fact that you're doing it

28:57.440 --> 29:01.040
and pursuing what you really want means that you're being successful.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.320
I think that that's much better.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.880
What did you say, Jeff, was just backup careers?

29:04.880 --> 29:06.480
I just didn't mean anything.

29:06.480 --> 29:08.960
I don't like how wise Billy just sounded.

29:08.960 --> 29:11.680
Because it makes me by comparison less wise.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.440
Did you want us all to get wise together or something?

29:15.440 --> 29:16.800
Yeah, but let me leave the pack.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.600
Please.

29:23.440 --> 29:25.200
This is backup careers.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.680
Kyrie Irving slash Johnny Villa edition.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.240
Why?

29:30.240 --> 29:31.200
Why?

29:31.200 --> 29:33.200
So basically it's going to be...

29:33.200 --> 29:36.480
I'm going to list a couple backup careers and then you guys guess whether that's one,

29:36.480 --> 29:39.520
or basically like tell me whether that's suitable for Kyrie Irving,

29:39.520 --> 29:44.320
who clearly doesn't care about basketball anymore, or Johnny Villa, who at a certain point

29:44.400 --> 29:47.840
is going to have to kind of get realistic if you want to have a family.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.040
Get realistic.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.360
Okay fine, why don't we just go ahead?

29:55.360 --> 29:56.320
Let's just start.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.960
Basketball coach for underserved youths.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.920
See, obviously not me.

30:01.920 --> 30:03.840
I don't have any basketball experience.

30:06.160 --> 30:07.600
I'm not even like five ten.

30:07.600 --> 30:08.880
I'm not even close to that.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.160
So I don't even know why...

30:11.520 --> 30:11.920
You know what?

30:11.920 --> 30:13.200
All right, Kyrie Irving, fine.

30:13.840 --> 30:14.320
Okay.

30:17.520 --> 30:18.960
Do you have to guess as well?

30:18.960 --> 30:20.560
Yeah, every way they're answers.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.360
There's no right or wrong answer here.

30:23.360 --> 30:23.840
Yeah.

30:23.840 --> 30:24.400
See?

30:24.400 --> 30:25.360
Why are you asking that?

30:26.800 --> 30:27.600
Fine.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.960
The right answer is Kyrie.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.000
Yeah.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.680
Kyrie Irving.

30:31.680 --> 30:32.400
Yeah.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.840
Great basketball player.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.840
One of the best basketball players.

30:35.840 --> 30:36.800
Probably of all time.

30:36.800 --> 30:37.120
Yeah.

30:37.120 --> 30:37.440
Yeah.

30:37.440 --> 30:38.880
Well, the best point that's for sure.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.400
Yeah, he'd be a great coach.

30:40.400 --> 30:43.120
That when his social wear with all would be amazing in terms of

30:43.760 --> 30:48.080
his sort of locker room presence and his locker room presence.

30:49.200 --> 30:53.200
It would be so helpful to the youth basketball organization.

30:53.200 --> 30:53.680
Yeah.

30:53.680 --> 30:57.840
He has presence, presence, and presence.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.120
Impression, too, said.

31:01.760 --> 31:02.480
Prescience.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.560
Because he's not getting this,

31:04.560 --> 31:07.760
this fucking vaccine, because he knows what it's going to do to you.

31:12.160 --> 31:12.880
Next guy.

31:12.960 --> 31:13.840
Just go to the next guy.

31:13.840 --> 31:14.640
Don't start this.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.680
Are the campsite, black water, attendant?

31:17.680 --> 31:19.840
And I'm just going to skip to saying this is Johnny.

31:21.840 --> 31:22.160
Why?

31:23.040 --> 31:25.520
Well, kind of experience do I have with that kind of job?

31:26.560 --> 31:29.120
Well, the issue is you don't have a lot of experience in general.

31:29.120 --> 31:33.200
So it's kind of like you can do anything that can be taught in an afternoon,

31:33.200 --> 31:35.680
part of which would be kind of emptying the sewage from

31:37.200 --> 31:37.920
win-a-biggest.

31:39.440 --> 31:42.480
I'm realizing now we sort of skipped over bond to the week, right?

31:42.560 --> 31:43.760
Yeah, I did have this film.

31:43.760 --> 31:46.480
And I had some like crazy cool answer.

31:47.120 --> 31:47.440
Okay.

31:47.440 --> 31:50.240
And yeah, let's hear you guys about the weeks, and as we power through this.

31:52.400 --> 31:57.280
All right, my bond to the week would have to be someone from BTS.

31:58.560 --> 32:02.160
It would have to be Jimin, I think, because that's the only one I know.

32:02.160 --> 32:02.800
But I think.

32:02.800 --> 32:09.680
Yeah, BTS person would boost the sales for bond exponentially.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.920
And also the fact that we're talking about it right now

32:11.920 --> 32:15.200
means the BTS army is going to run this podcast up.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.040
That's wise.

32:19.040 --> 32:19.680
Yeah.

32:19.680 --> 32:20.720
Thank you, Alex.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.560
No, we're all getting pretty wise.

32:22.560 --> 32:25.200
Really, except Jeff, but really wise answers.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.240
I've been wise.

32:26.240 --> 32:30.960
Yeah, yeah, two of us, two or three of us have been pretty wise.

32:30.960 --> 32:32.320
Yeah, totally.

32:32.320 --> 32:33.600
Billy, what's your bond of the week?

32:34.320 --> 32:39.120
Well, I would say we should pick someone that is unexpected.

32:39.280 --> 32:47.360
A lot of people are talking about maybe making bond a woman or maybe casting a black actor or

32:47.360 --> 32:48.800
somebody believe we're talking about Americans.

32:48.800 --> 32:53.120
So I think what if we just went against all those conversations and cast a white,

32:53.120 --> 32:58.960
British male actor like Jack O'Connell, who I think kind of has the look for it.

32:59.680 --> 33:05.120
And using that movie, 71 with Barry Keegan, who's another actor who I don't think would be

33:05.200 --> 33:09.440
right for James Bond, but I just think that it wouldn't be surprising and kind of

33:10.000 --> 33:14.480
ballsy of them to just go and give us exactly what we've had in the past.

33:15.040 --> 33:15.520
That's cool.

33:15.520 --> 33:17.520
And think of allowing you to be progressive.

33:17.520 --> 33:20.400
Going with the grain is the new against the grain.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.680
Yeah, exactly.

33:21.680 --> 33:23.120
Yeah, that was pretty wise.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.120
That's actually really wise.

33:26.800 --> 33:27.680
Who would you say, Jeff?

33:31.520 --> 33:32.800
That was pretty wise.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.080
Who would you say that one?

33:34.560 --> 33:39.600
I said, Bill Nye, the science guy, just in terms of yuck.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.000
Yeah, yeah, golden eye.

33:42.640 --> 33:45.440
Just like you would be the villain at that point too.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.480
Why not have him be the villain?

33:46.480 --> 33:47.600
He could be golden eye.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.760
And then he could be playing himself to an evil.

33:49.760 --> 33:54.880
Instead, he's playing James Bond, but the pawn is a villain's name and the actor's name.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.840
It doesn't make any sense at all.

33:57.840 --> 33:59.520
There's no way they would do that.

33:59.520 --> 34:02.960
Yeah, I just was thinking in terms of merchandising opportunities.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.600
What merchandising opportunities?

34:05.600 --> 34:10.880
T-shirts, watches, a just a golden eye on it.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.880
Golden eye, sick joke that you have.

34:13.600 --> 34:18.560
Yeah, the other thing would be like posters.

34:18.560 --> 34:21.120
Like it's so kind of the slogans write themselves.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.200
It could be like, the next Bond is Nye.

34:28.240 --> 34:31.440
Oh my god, I have fucking hives from you, I think.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.000
I mean, who's your Bond of the week?

34:34.000 --> 34:37.600
That actually is, if they're going to go white British guy,

34:37.600 --> 34:40.160
this is probably the best pick anyone said at the past couple of weeks.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.600
Is Jack O'Connell or don't Nye?

34:44.720 --> 34:46.880
Bill Nye could be awesome, but Jack O'Connell.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.360
I mean, who's your Bond of the week?

34:54.000 --> 34:59.920
Let's go with coming off of Space Jam 2.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.520
I'd love to see a LeBron James Bond.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.560
The Bond of James?

35:06.560 --> 35:07.280
Yeah, yeah.

35:12.560 --> 35:16.320
Yeah, he's already tall in the hot and like athletics.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.320
So like he can do some real cool.

35:18.320 --> 35:21.840
And what if Bond has to dunk a bomb at the end of the game?

35:22.560 --> 35:27.600
Or a chase down LeBron James at the end of the game?

35:27.840 --> 35:32.640
So it's like a guy putting a bomb in the rim and LeBron fucking.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.560
Dent, dent, dent, dent, dent, dent.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.240
They used the mission of possible theme.

35:36.240 --> 35:37.680
Mission of possible theme?

35:37.680 --> 35:39.040
Yeah.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.880
Swatting it out of the way.

35:40.880 --> 35:41.360
Yeah.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.280
He changed his number to 007.

35:43.280 --> 35:44.560
That's really good.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.680
Stop him on the other side.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.120
That's very short of the business.

35:47.120 --> 35:48.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:48.960 --> 35:50.400
I mean, who should pick them that?

35:50.400 --> 35:52.080
I could get on board with LeBron.

35:52.080 --> 35:52.560
Yeah.

35:52.560 --> 35:53.600
LeBron with James.

35:53.600 --> 35:56.480
In the movie, he'll have a little live strong style bracelet.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.880
And I'll say just a kid from Pet Bottom.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.160
Is that where he's from?

36:00.160 --> 36:00.880
Yeah.

36:05.680 --> 36:06.880
What's that?

36:06.880 --> 36:09.280
It's like the emoji LeBron always uses.

36:09.280 --> 36:11.040
Oh, yeah, the praise hands.

36:11.040 --> 36:11.440
Yeah.

36:14.000 --> 36:14.480
Sorry.

36:14.480 --> 36:15.680
Yeah, that's pretty good, I guess.

36:15.680 --> 36:18.240
We could get, is it M or Q?

36:18.240 --> 36:20.000
Who's like the both?

36:20.000 --> 36:21.200
Choose the tech guy?

36:21.200 --> 36:24.960
M's the kind of head of M I six.

36:25.600 --> 36:26.320
Yeah.

36:26.320 --> 36:28.480
So Q's not the old lady character, then.

36:28.480 --> 36:29.920
I mean, M's not the old lady character.

36:29.920 --> 36:30.560
M is the old lady.

36:30.560 --> 36:31.040
It's M.

36:31.040 --> 36:31.200
Sorry.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.400
Q is the best.

36:32.400 --> 36:32.800
No.

36:32.800 --> 36:33.040
No.

36:33.040 --> 36:33.760
Bus can be.

36:33.760 --> 36:34.320
Can be.

36:34.320 --> 36:34.800
Can be.

36:34.800 --> 36:35.200
M.

36:35.200 --> 36:35.920
Yes.

36:35.920 --> 36:36.400
Yes.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.840
Isn't one of them from mission impossible?

36:39.840 --> 36:41.360
M and Q are both bond.

36:42.400 --> 36:45.280
M6 is mission impossible.

36:45.280 --> 36:45.920
Six.

36:45.920 --> 36:46.880
Yes.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.400
M6 is what we call mission of.

36:55.440 --> 36:58.800
That's the fucking joke of the episode.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.880
You have to start awarding that shit now.

37:00.880 --> 37:04.080
I think LeBond James is the joke of the episode.

37:04.080 --> 37:06.720
Either way, Billy's taking on the hardware.

37:06.720 --> 37:09.520
I feel like him here was about to say LeBond James down.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.960
I kind of, and I kind of stood.

37:10.960 --> 37:11.760
But I didn't.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.600
And that means I'm getting a step slow.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.640
Thank you for, um.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.280
Do you know that highlight, and I'm sure you do, and I could be wrong.

37:17.280 --> 37:19.680
But when they try and get the ball to Kobe at the end of the game,

37:19.680 --> 37:22.320
and then hit young, caught it, and then shot it, and hit the buzzer.

37:22.720 --> 37:25.040
Yeah, I didn't went in, right?

37:25.040 --> 37:28.480
Yeah, and he hit the game when that's what that was.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.520
You were, you were setting.

37:29.520 --> 37:31.440
If you had it, the clock was winding down.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.520
You were turning the corner, getting to your spot.

37:33.520 --> 37:36.480
And then I kind of intercepted the pass from my on teammate.

37:36.480 --> 37:40.160
And now shot a terrible three and somehow banked it.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
History will only remember Nick Young and forget Kobe Bryant, though.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.600
I already don't know who Kobe is.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.600
I might, uh, I'm not going to say it.

37:51.600 --> 37:57.440
I had a different segment plan in place of this one that we're still in the middle of, uh,

37:57.440 --> 38:02.400
that was basically about how the Diana Princess Diana musical got, uh,

38:02.400 --> 38:06.640
just absolutely reamed by the New York Times, the other critic, because as exploitative and bad.

38:06.640 --> 38:08.640
And so I was going to say, what else could we,

38:08.640 --> 38:10.960
what other tragedies could we exploit for money?

38:10.960 --> 38:13.520
Oh, it was all too dark.

38:13.520 --> 38:14.720
Just disgusting.

38:14.720 --> 38:15.280
Yeah.

38:15.840 --> 38:18.240
Um, let's keep it going here.

38:18.240 --> 38:22.240
We'll kind of like, power through the rest of this.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.640
Uh, please, power through power through.

38:24.640 --> 38:25.760
Power through.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.600
Uh, full time social activists.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.880
I think Kyrie would be good at that.

38:32.160 --> 38:35.840
Um, I couldn't hear because the full time social activists.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.600
I think Kyrie would be good at that.

38:38.160 --> 38:42.560
Um, Johnny on their other hand, I think could be a sex worker who's clientele is mostly

38:42.560 --> 38:44.160
self-hating Republican homophobes.

38:44.800 --> 38:48.240
So like, you get basically turned inside out by Josh Hawley,

38:48.240 --> 38:53.760
and then he'll like go across the street to the Capitol and still pass anti LGBT legislation.

38:57.440 --> 38:59.040
Turned sounds awesome.

38:59.040 --> 38:59.360
Yeah.

38:59.360 --> 39:01.040
Turned inside out.

39:02.880 --> 39:03.360
What?

39:03.360 --> 39:04.320
Why that visual?

39:05.040 --> 39:06.720
The fuck is wrong with you, man.

39:10.320 --> 39:11.120
Turned it.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.120
Side out.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.200
Turned by his side out.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.200
Don't turn me out.

39:17.200 --> 39:22.560
Uh, I think Johnny could also be good as the last remaining Pony Express court career.

39:23.200 --> 39:30.880
So like cash him in like Eastern Oregon, like hauling ass on an ass to get like one

39:30.880 --> 39:34.960
fucking scroll to a librarian in Ashland.

39:35.600 --> 39:39.120
I can definitely foresee myself becoming a becoming that.

39:39.120 --> 39:39.600
Yeah.

39:41.520 --> 39:43.280
You know how like at the end of a high school day.

39:43.280 --> 39:48.320
It's like 243 or something and like the teacher's still talking and it's like,

39:48.320 --> 39:53.440
I'm just fucking seconds away from the weekend and the teacher's like,

39:53.440 --> 39:56.960
actually like, let me start this next chapter.

39:56.960 --> 40:01.920
Like, that's what this is like, the fact that we do this on a Friday afternoon is

40:02.640 --> 40:09.760
a very specific form of intellectual torture on the guests specifically,

40:09.760 --> 40:12.160
because people can just listen to it whenever they want.

40:12.880 --> 40:17.200
The fact that you're like grabbing our ankles as we're trying to like,

40:18.240 --> 40:23.440
get away from you and enjoy our time on a Friday night and we have to hear,

40:23.440 --> 40:31.760
what was it fucking Johnny would be an activist or whatever the hell or a

40:31.760 --> 40:39.040
career? Like, what is that? What is that? How did you think of that? Why did you think

40:39.040 --> 40:44.000
of that? Kyrie or Johnny? Not only are you grabbing us, grabbing our ankles and trying

40:44.000 --> 40:50.240
to every time we're trying to leave, even here, we're having conversations on the side

40:50.240 --> 40:54.320
and we're having a little bit of fun and I can feel the energy kind of creeping up once,

40:54.320 --> 41:00.000
but then you kind of chime in and then all of a sudden, yeah, just really your entire experience.

41:00.080 --> 41:09.120
Yeah, you're poisoning the well. You're souring the dessert. You're, like, you're allergic to

41:09.120 --> 41:13.520
having a good time. And when this show accidentally hits a stride,

41:14.480 --> 41:21.280
through literally despite what you're trying to do, you put the kabash on all of it, like spider

41:21.280 --> 41:27.440
man stopping a train. Try as you might, Johnny, like grind any moment that we're figuring out

41:27.440 --> 41:35.600
to an absolute hall. You suck. I mean, what do you look like? What can I say? I can't be any more

41:35.600 --> 41:43.200
plan that you're not, you're not good. And you're not wise. And I think that's the real nail in the

41:43.200 --> 41:49.280
coffin. No, where do I think he's capable of being wise? Like, you know what I mean? Like,

41:49.280 --> 41:54.480
I'll like, yeah, like a lot of people can figure it out or like get to a point where they

41:54.480 --> 42:00.560
can set themselves up for wisdom. Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jeff is a wafer. He's an empty vessel.

42:00.560 --> 42:06.480
He's a he's a hickema. Like, what is that root vegetable on my fucking plate? It's the it's the

42:06.480 --> 42:13.680
clear foamy beige one, right? You are hickema. Yeah. Oh my god. Now I'm feeling like the energy

42:13.680 --> 42:19.920
creating. Yeah. Like, it's weird. Like the wisest thing that Jeff could do is just give

42:19.920 --> 42:24.880
up on being wise, but he's so incapable of being wise in any way that he always be in pursuit of it

42:24.880 --> 42:30.480
and he'll never be able to get it. Exactly. Find some solace if he just accepted himself as

42:30.480 --> 42:36.320
the empty user in a losing game. And just moved on trying to live in the moment or something, but he's

42:36.320 --> 42:43.920
he can't even do that. He's also he's a balsa wood, a hickema man, an empty coffin. Yeah.

42:44.320 --> 42:56.000
He's a thin hollowed out vessel of nothing. It's so, and he doesn't even get it. Like, it's crazy.

42:56.000 --> 43:05.920
It's so fucked up. That's like the fucking. That's enough. That's enough. You had your fun.

43:06.640 --> 43:15.280
You talked about wafers. You talked about radishes. No, it did not. This is my show.

43:18.400 --> 43:23.280
I didn't say a radish. I'd love to eradish Kate you.

43:25.680 --> 43:35.840
This is what we're taking out a gun. And the turnup. That was really hurtful. Let's move on

43:36.880 --> 43:40.880
That was easy. That was easy.

43:50.240 --> 43:52.240
It's a smile. Let's get into it again.

43:52.720 --> 43:56.800
Well.

44:02.560 --> 44:07.920
Smile.

44:10.320 --> 44:14.240
Every smile come on.

44:14.240 --> 44:23.240
You guys are underectable.

44:23.240 --> 44:24.240
You're terrible director.

44:24.240 --> 44:26.240
To smile.

44:26.240 --> 44:28.240
Welcome to Michael or Buster.

44:28.240 --> 44:29.240
What an addition.

44:29.240 --> 44:31.240
It's 40 minutes.

44:31.240 --> 44:34.240
It's starting a new segment.

44:34.240 --> 44:36.240
By the way, we skipped a segment.

44:36.240 --> 44:39.240
There was going to be two more segments after this.

44:39.240 --> 44:42.240
Yes.

44:42.240 --> 44:44.240
Michael or Buster, Keaton addition.

44:44.240 --> 44:45.240
Here we go.

44:45.240 --> 44:48.240
I'm going to list some quotes.

44:48.240 --> 44:50.240
And you have to attribute them to the right keyton.

44:50.240 --> 44:54.240
Michael or Buster.

44:54.240 --> 44:57.240
You imagine thinking you're going to hear the plug section.

44:57.240 --> 45:01.240
And then just like, now it's time to start playing.

45:01.240 --> 45:04.240
Michael or Buster, the keyton addition.

45:04.240 --> 45:06.240
This is what I'm talking about, man.

45:06.240 --> 45:09.240
A comedian does funny things.

45:09.240 --> 45:14.240
A good comedian does things funny.

45:14.240 --> 45:17.240
Diane.

45:17.240 --> 45:20.240
Holy shit.

45:20.240 --> 45:24.240
You got my one trick question slash pony.

45:24.240 --> 45:25.240
Here we go.

45:25.240 --> 45:28.240
I took my play very seriously.

45:28.240 --> 45:34.240
And I got way way lost in my play world.

45:34.240 --> 45:35.240
Got to be Michael.

45:35.240 --> 45:36.240
Correct.

45:36.240 --> 45:37.240
That man said that.

45:37.240 --> 45:38.240
Oh, my life.

45:38.240 --> 45:42.240
I've been happiest when the folks watching me say to each other.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.240
Look at that poor dope.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.240
Will ya?

45:45.240 --> 45:46.240
Buster.

45:46.240 --> 45:47.240
Buster.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.240
Correct.

45:49.240 --> 45:50.240
These are easy.

45:50.240 --> 45:51.240
So far.

45:51.240 --> 45:53.240
Yeah.

45:53.240 --> 45:56.240
They say pantomimes a lost art.

45:56.240 --> 45:57.240
It's never been a lost art.

45:57.240 --> 46:02.240
It never will be because it's natural to do.

46:02.240 --> 46:05.240
Michael.

46:06.240 --> 46:09.240
Okay.

46:09.240 --> 46:13.240
Buster Keaton said pantomime is never a lost art.

46:13.240 --> 46:16.240
I'll give you that one because he did say it.

46:16.240 --> 46:21.240
But in this specific instance, it's actually me quoting him.

46:21.240 --> 46:27.240
To this day, I have the most fond memories of some of my old toys.

46:27.240 --> 46:29.240
Michael.

46:29.240 --> 46:31.240
Correct.

46:32.240 --> 46:37.240
Guys never really get over their toys.

46:37.240 --> 46:39.240
Michael.

46:39.240 --> 46:42.240
He's obsessed with toys.

46:42.240 --> 46:46.240
In our family, my brothers and I shared toys.

46:46.240 --> 46:49.240
In other words, just because it was mine.

46:49.240 --> 46:54.240
Didn't mean my brothers and I didn't play with it together.

46:54.240 --> 46:55.240
Definitely sounds.

46:55.240 --> 46:57.240
This is typical Michael Keaton.

46:57.240 --> 46:58.240
Correct.

46:59.240 --> 47:04.240
You know Michael Keaton's real name is Michael Douglas.

47:04.240 --> 47:06.240
But he had to change it.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.240
Because of Michael Douglas, yeah.

47:08.240 --> 47:11.240
Did you know that Albert Brooks's real name is Albert Einstein?

47:11.240 --> 47:14.240
That's he had to change it because of Albert Einstein.

47:14.240 --> 47:18.240
And now he's more famous than Einstein that will ever be.

47:18.240 --> 47:19.240
Yeah, exactly.

47:19.240 --> 47:20.240
Not really.

47:20.240 --> 47:24.240
And his brothers, super Dave Osborn, who recently passed away,

47:24.240 --> 47:26.240
Marty Funkhouse, are uncurve.

47:26.240 --> 47:27.240
Funkhouse or yeah.

47:27.240 --> 47:29.240
And together, they sort of broke brothers.

47:31.240 --> 47:34.240
And Einstein Brothers Bagel.

47:37.240 --> 47:39.240
That's enough of the goofs though.

47:39.240 --> 47:40.240
Let's get serious here.

47:40.240 --> 47:41.240
Plugs.

47:41.240 --> 47:42.240
Come in podcast.

47:42.240 --> 47:44.240
A lot of these.

47:44.240 --> 47:45.240
Oh, that's it.

47:45.240 --> 47:47.240
I feel like we're just getting started.

47:47.240 --> 47:48.240
I spent cutting it.

47:48.240 --> 47:49.240
I spent cutting it in one.

47:49.240 --> 47:50.240
I skipped it.

47:50.240 --> 47:51.240
I just started podcast.

47:51.240 --> 47:53.240
It's really hard to get a mirror.

47:53.240 --> 47:55.240
Well, the wise bros.

47:55.240 --> 47:56.240
Yeah.

47:56.240 --> 47:57.240
That's great.

47:57.240 --> 47:58.240
The values.

47:58.240 --> 48:00.240
Because we're 80.

48:00.240 --> 48:01.240
I owe you.

48:01.240 --> 48:02.240
And sometimes wise.

48:02.240 --> 48:03.240
That's really good.

48:03.240 --> 48:04.240
That's really funny.

48:04.240 --> 48:05.240
That's really funny.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.240
No, I was just on it.

48:07.240 --> 48:08.240
Meet yourself, Jeff.

48:08.240 --> 48:09.240
I would like to ask you guys.

48:09.240 --> 48:11.240
We're just going to talk right now.

48:11.240 --> 48:14.240
The values are going to sort of wax for the next view.

48:14.240 --> 48:15.240
A lot.

48:20.240 --> 48:23.240
Don't specify how often you want to be on there.

48:24.240 --> 48:26.240
Do you really know that it's not going to happen?

48:26.240 --> 48:27.240
It doesn't have to be every week.

48:27.240 --> 48:32.240
It could be fun if it's like because like we can sort of play with the fact that like,

48:32.240 --> 48:33.240
you know, we're talking about wisdom.

48:33.240 --> 48:34.240
Like I'm 38.

48:34.240 --> 48:36.240
But I feel like a 21 year old.

48:36.240 --> 48:37.240
Yeah.

48:37.240 --> 48:38.240
You guys are like in your ear.

48:38.240 --> 48:39.240
Jeff, I'm talking.

48:39.240 --> 48:41.240
You guys are in your early 20s.

48:41.240 --> 48:42.240
And maybe you feel more wise.

48:42.240 --> 48:45.240
So it's like this like play on like who's teaching.

48:45.240 --> 48:46.240
Who about what?

48:46.240 --> 48:49.240
We can both like sort of guide each other through like different.

48:49.240 --> 48:50.240
Yeah.

48:50.240 --> 48:52.240
The different ends of like, you know,

48:52.240 --> 48:55.240
being like a classic like 20 to 40 year old.

48:55.240 --> 48:56.240
Yeah.

48:56.240 --> 48:58.240
Turn about pop culture like, you know,

48:58.240 --> 49:00.240
I can teach you about fucking property taxes.

49:00.240 --> 49:02.240
And you can teach me about like, you know,

49:02.240 --> 49:08.240
a more important shit like tick-tock trends or what clothes cool kids are.

49:08.240 --> 49:09.240
Jeff, stop.

49:09.240 --> 49:10.240
Please.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.240
I didn't say anything.

49:11.240 --> 49:12.240
You were laughing.

49:12.240 --> 49:13.240
You were laughing.

49:13.240 --> 49:14.240
You're laughing.

49:14.240 --> 49:15.240
You're laughing.

49:15.240 --> 49:16.240
You're laughing.

49:16.240 --> 49:17.240
You're laughing.

49:17.240 --> 49:18.240
You're laughing.

49:18.240 --> 49:19.240
Yeah.

49:19.240 --> 49:20.240
It's kind of loud in my ears.

49:20.240 --> 49:22.240
I think it's a good idea.

49:22.240 --> 49:24.240
I'm being positive to you.

49:24.240 --> 49:25.240
Okay.

49:25.240 --> 49:28.240
I feel like you're making me want to rethink this with your enthusiasm.

49:28.240 --> 49:30.240
I feel like you're not the target audience.

49:30.240 --> 49:32.240
And how you're really responding to it.

49:32.240 --> 49:33.240
I feel like maybe we're doing something wrong.

49:33.240 --> 49:36.240
Now Billy's starting to second guess the podcast because you kind of.

49:36.240 --> 49:38.240
Because like chuckled.

49:38.240 --> 49:40.240
Because like kind of laughed.

49:40.240 --> 49:42.240
Just having you on board.

49:42.240 --> 49:43.240
Yeah.

49:43.240 --> 49:45.240
I don't know if I want to do it anymore either.

49:45.240 --> 49:47.240
Yeah.

49:47.240 --> 49:49.240
I thought we had something fun.

49:49.240 --> 49:50.240
Yeah.

49:50.240 --> 49:53.240
Do you know how like if someone smart is like, oh, you're really smart.

49:53.240 --> 49:55.240
Like then it like boosts you.

49:55.240 --> 49:56.240
It means a lot.

49:56.240 --> 49:57.240
Yeah.

49:57.240 --> 49:59.240
But the fact that you're like, oh, I love this idea.

49:59.240 --> 50:00.240
Yeah.

50:00.240 --> 50:02.240
It just proves that it's a terrible idea.

50:02.240 --> 50:03.240
Yeah.

50:03.240 --> 50:05.240
Like when the biggest idiot you know is like, wow.

50:05.240 --> 50:06.240
You're just like me.

50:06.240 --> 50:07.240
Yeah.

50:07.240 --> 50:08.240
Oh, no.

50:08.240 --> 50:09.240
I'm doing something.

50:09.240 --> 50:10.240
Sorry.

50:10.240 --> 50:11.240
That one.

50:11.240 --> 50:12.240
Jeff.

50:12.240 --> 50:13.240
There's a famous door Jeff.

50:13.240 --> 50:14.240
One second.

50:14.240 --> 50:16.240
There's a famous story that when Ben Affleck and Matt Damon were pitching

50:16.240 --> 50:19.240
to go hunting and trying to get funding for it.

50:19.240 --> 50:21.240
They put in a sexy between them.

50:21.240 --> 50:26.240
That was like just like a really, really out of play sexy.

50:26.240 --> 50:27.240
Obviously.

50:27.240 --> 50:31.240
And then anytime a producer would be like, oh, we love the script.

50:31.240 --> 50:33.240
They know that they weren't reading it properly.

50:33.240 --> 50:34.240
They were not the right fit.

50:34.240 --> 50:36.240
And then when someone go, oh, I don't know about this sexy.

50:36.240 --> 50:38.240
They go, okay, you're paying attention.

50:38.240 --> 50:41.240
So we could go all four of us to pitch to different places.

50:41.240 --> 50:43.240
And if they are like, yeah, it sounds good.

50:43.240 --> 50:46.240
And we'll now that they're not the right fit, but if they go, whoa.

50:46.240 --> 50:48.240
This Jeff guy doesn't really fit.

50:48.240 --> 50:51.240
Then we know that they really get it.

50:51.240 --> 50:52.240
Yeah.

50:52.240 --> 50:57.240
He's like so obviously like a canker sore on the idea that like anybody who's worth

50:57.240 --> 51:00.240
the damn will realize that and ask us to take him out.

51:00.240 --> 51:01.240
Exactly.

51:01.240 --> 51:02.240
Yeah.

51:02.240 --> 51:03.240
First thing.

51:03.240 --> 51:06.240
In the world of the vowels, Jeff's an F.

51:06.240 --> 51:10.240
Because he's constantly like pissing us off.

51:10.240 --> 51:11.240
Yeah.

51:12.240 --> 51:14.240
We should totally have guests on this podcast.

51:14.240 --> 51:15.240
That's really cool.

51:15.240 --> 51:16.240
Yeah.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.240
Yeah.

51:17.240 --> 51:18.240
I would love to be one.

51:18.240 --> 51:20.240
I would love to be one of them.

51:20.240 --> 51:21.240
Yeah.

51:21.240 --> 51:23.240
Someone really funny and like smart and wise.

51:23.240 --> 51:24.240
I think I'm some of those.

51:24.240 --> 51:26.240
What about Riley for the pilot?

51:26.240 --> 51:27.240
Yeah.

51:27.240 --> 51:28.240
The Riley.

51:28.240 --> 51:29.240
Yeah.

51:29.240 --> 51:30.240
Riley with Riley.

51:30.240 --> 51:31.240
Yeah.

51:31.240 --> 51:32.240
Jeff experiment.

51:32.240 --> 51:33.240
I think I have her phone.

51:33.240 --> 51:34.240
Oh, my God.

51:34.240 --> 51:36.240
What about Jeff from a George?

51:36.240 --> 51:38.240
Oh, my God.

51:38.240 --> 51:40.240
And then I didn't have the same get.

51:40.240 --> 51:41.240
Yeah.

51:41.240 --> 51:42.240
I don't have George's contact information.

51:42.240 --> 51:43.240
But I'd probably.

51:43.240 --> 51:44.240
I could DM him on Jester.

51:44.240 --> 51:45.240
Oh, yeah.

51:45.240 --> 51:46.240
Yeah.

51:46.240 --> 51:48.240
I don't like any of this.

51:48.240 --> 51:49.240
I don't like any of this.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.240
I guess.

51:50.240 --> 51:51.240
I guess.

51:51.240 --> 51:53.240
Did you get Mr. James in there for like one episode?

51:53.240 --> 51:54.240
Oh, just that.

51:54.240 --> 51:55.240
Oh.

51:55.240 --> 51:56.240
Yeah.

51:56.240 --> 51:57.240
Yeah.

51:57.240 --> 51:58.240
That would be fun.

51:58.240 --> 52:00.240
Sort of like the wisdom of James.

52:00.240 --> 52:01.240
We can call that segment.

52:01.240 --> 52:02.240
Oh, yeah.

52:02.240 --> 52:03.240
Jeff.

52:03.240 --> 52:04.240
That's why I want to call.

52:04.240 --> 52:06.240
Our Jeffrey's mom.

52:06.240 --> 52:07.240
Do there some time.

52:07.240 --> 52:08.240
Jeffrey sister too.

52:08.240 --> 52:09.240
Yeah.

52:09.240 --> 52:10.240
What?

52:10.240 --> 52:11.240
What?

52:11.240 --> 52:12.240
What are you guess?

52:12.240 --> 52:13.240
Good.

52:13.240 --> 52:14.240
Why are you still here?

52:14.240 --> 52:16.240
That's the question that stumped you.

52:16.240 --> 52:24.240
At Jeffrey James on Instagram, at Jeff Boy already on Twitter.

52:24.240 --> 52:25.240
You guys plug your stuff.

52:25.240 --> 52:27.240
I'm going to, I'm going to go.

52:27.240 --> 52:29.240
Oh, my God.

52:29.240 --> 52:30.240
Yeah.

52:30.240 --> 52:32.240
Finally, the valves can sort of fucking.

52:32.240 --> 52:33.240
This is lame.

52:33.240 --> 52:34.240
Yeah.

52:34.240 --> 52:35.240
This is like the podcast right now.

52:35.240 --> 52:37.240
There was like a high pitched ringing.

52:37.240 --> 52:38.240
Yeah.

52:38.240 --> 52:39.240
Yeah.

52:39.240 --> 52:40.240
Yeah.

52:40.240 --> 52:41.240
He gave me tonight.

52:41.240 --> 52:42.240
Yeah.

52:42.240 --> 52:43.240
He gave me tonight.

52:43.240 --> 52:44.240
Tonight is tonight.

52:44.240 --> 52:45.240
Yeah.

52:45.240 --> 52:47.240
That's really funny.

52:47.240 --> 52:48.240
Joke in the fucking episode.

52:48.240 --> 52:49.240
Yeah.

52:49.240 --> 52:50.240
It feels like.

52:50.240 --> 52:53.240
I feel like I had something removed like a boil from my back.

52:53.240 --> 52:54.240
You know what it feels like.

52:54.240 --> 52:55.240
Yeah.

52:55.240 --> 52:56.240
Like stand up.

52:56.240 --> 52:58.240
Like when the hangover ends and you're just like.

52:58.240 --> 52:59.240
Ah.

52:59.240 --> 53:00.240
Let's fucking party.

53:00.240 --> 53:01.240
Yeah.

53:01.240 --> 53:02.240
That's how I feel like.

53:02.240 --> 53:04.240
Like when you go see the hangover and you're just so step after.

53:04.240 --> 53:06.240
And you just want to go party.

53:06.240 --> 53:08.240
That's another great joke that Jeff would have stepped up.

53:08.240 --> 53:13.240
He'd been like, yeah, we're like a fucking the time where I gave a bagel to a fucking

53:13.240 --> 53:14.240
dwarf.

53:14.240 --> 53:16.240
And he would be like, yeah, chuckle chuckle.

53:16.240 --> 53:17.240
King or something like that.

53:17.240 --> 53:18.240
And we'd all be like.

53:18.240 --> 53:19.240
Yeah.

53:19.240 --> 53:20.240
Fucker.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.240
That was kind of funny because you can't even do like.

53:22.240 --> 53:23.240
I can't.

53:23.240 --> 53:24.240
Yeah.

53:24.240 --> 53:25.240
You can't.

53:25.240 --> 53:26.240
You can't.

53:26.240 --> 53:27.240
Yeah.

53:27.240 --> 53:28.240
Yeah.

53:28.240 --> 53:29.240
You know how like like you were like getting.

53:29.240 --> 53:32.240
Being on this podcast with Jeff to like.

53:32.240 --> 53:35.240
Like waiting for the end of the school day.

53:35.240 --> 53:36.240
Yeah.

53:36.240 --> 53:37.240
I feel like this lock.

53:37.240 --> 53:38.240
Yeah.

53:38.240 --> 53:39.240
Right now it's like it feels like summer.

53:39.240 --> 53:40.240
Yeah.

53:40.240 --> 53:41.240
It's like summer.

53:41.240 --> 53:42.240
Yeah.

53:42.240 --> 53:44.240
When he left, I heard a fucking school bell go off.

53:44.240 --> 53:45.240
Yeah.

53:45.240 --> 53:46.240
But it was like.

53:46.240 --> 53:47.240
Yeah.

53:47.240 --> 53:48.240
It was almost like a beautiful melody.

53:48.240 --> 53:49.240
It wasn't like that.

53:49.240 --> 53:52.240
It was almost just like the beautiful tone of his.

53:52.240 --> 53:55.240
It was like the homework of papers.

53:55.240 --> 53:56.240
Fine.

53:56.240 --> 53:58.240
Definitely throwing their binders up.

53:58.240 --> 53:59.240
Yeah.

53:59.240 --> 54:00.240
And he's pulled out.

54:00.240 --> 54:01.240
Yes.

54:01.240 --> 54:02.240
I was the graduation.

54:02.240 --> 54:04.240
Like it feels like that podcast as we knew it is over.

54:04.240 --> 54:05.240
Right?

54:05.240 --> 54:06.240
Yeah.

54:06.240 --> 54:08.240
And like this is sort of like this is like the Berlin wall falling down.

54:08.240 --> 54:09.240
A new era of a post.

54:09.240 --> 54:10.240
Yes.

54:10.240 --> 54:11.240
Post pandemic world.

54:11.240 --> 54:16.240
This feels like that that like when you can finally go in public and take that mask off

54:16.240 --> 54:18.240
for the first time that first breath of like, oh, yes.

54:18.240 --> 54:19.240
Yeah.

54:19.240 --> 54:20.240
The air that I've been missing out on.

54:20.240 --> 54:22.240
Not filtered through these dirty.

54:22.240 --> 54:24.240
He even scrunched up in my pocket.

54:24.240 --> 54:25.240
Yeah.

54:25.240 --> 54:26.240
Yeah.

54:26.240 --> 54:32.240
Jeff has a dirty mask in his ex professional podcast is a booster shot with 100% efficacy.

54:32.240 --> 54:33.240
Yeah.

54:33.240 --> 54:34.240
Yeah.

54:34.240 --> 54:39.240
I'm ready to kiss a fucking sailor in Times Square because he's finally gone.

54:39.240 --> 54:40.240
Great.

54:40.240 --> 54:41.240
All right.

54:41.240 --> 54:42.240
Yeah.

54:42.240 --> 54:43.240
Yeah.

54:43.240 --> 54:44.240
To talk.

54:44.240 --> 54:45.240
To talk.

54:45.240 --> 54:46.240
Insta.

54:46.240 --> 54:49.240
And.

54:49.240 --> 54:50.240
Yes.

54:50.240 --> 54:51.240
Okay.

54:51.240 --> 54:52.240
He's gone.

54:52.240 --> 54:53.240
Yeah.

54:53.240 --> 54:54.240
I'm just.

54:54.240 --> 54:55.240
Yeah.

54:55.240 --> 54:56.240
I'm on all the socials.

54:56.240 --> 54:57.240
Search me there.

54:57.240 --> 54:58.240
Okay.

54:58.240 --> 55:04.240
Blumer on TikTok trying to like get back in there.

55:04.240 --> 55:06.240
Like trying to get the creative juices flowing again.

55:06.240 --> 55:07.240
It's been a while.

55:07.240 --> 55:08.240
But I think I'm ready to.

55:08.240 --> 55:10.240
I think I'm ready to be funny again.

55:10.240 --> 55:11.240
I don't know.

55:11.240 --> 55:12.240
I feel like that.

55:12.240 --> 55:13.240
I got that sent from you.

55:13.240 --> 55:14.240
Not that you weren't being funny before.

55:14.240 --> 55:16.240
But this is just holding you back.

55:16.240 --> 55:20.240
It felt like I was on a treadmill where like every time I would take like rest

55:20.240 --> 55:21.240
it would like push me back.

55:21.240 --> 55:25.240
Jeff was sort of like this wind in my face.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.240
I'm.

55:27.240 --> 55:28.240
I'm also.

55:28.240 --> 55:29.240
Sorry.

55:29.240 --> 55:30.240
You, I think cut out.

55:30.240 --> 55:31.240
I can interrupt you.

55:31.240 --> 55:32.240
No.

55:32.240 --> 55:33.240
Yeah.

55:33.240 --> 55:34.240
Go for it.

55:34.240 --> 55:36.240
And just because we're in Jeff's zoom still that my connections a little bit off.

55:36.240 --> 55:37.240
Yeah.

55:37.240 --> 55:38.240
He's sort of like yeah.

55:38.240 --> 55:41.240
He's ruining the bandwidth for I think my internet slower now.

55:41.240 --> 55:42.240
Yeah.

55:42.240 --> 55:43.240
Because I'm.

55:43.240 --> 55:46.240
I have a as well part in the Ghostbusters movie that just came out.

55:46.240 --> 55:48.240
I was running yesterday.

55:48.240 --> 55:50.240
So if you guys want to check that out.

55:50.240 --> 55:51.240
That's amazing.

55:51.240 --> 55:52.240
I wonder.

55:52.240 --> 55:53.240
Yeah.

55:53.240 --> 55:54.240
I wonder if it doesn't make sense.

55:55.240 --> 55:58.240
I feel like if Jeff were here that scene would be cut.

55:58.240 --> 55:59.240
I like.

55:59.240 --> 56:00.240
Yeah.

56:00.240 --> 56:01.240
I think so.

56:01.240 --> 56:02.240
It doesn't.

56:02.240 --> 56:03.240
Like there's no reason.

56:03.240 --> 56:04.240
And yet.

56:04.240 --> 56:05.240
I understand exactly how.

56:05.240 --> 56:06.240
What that means.

56:06.240 --> 56:07.240
Like it's one of those things.

56:07.240 --> 56:09.240
It's like a weird feeling.

56:09.240 --> 56:10.240
Like deja vu.

56:10.240 --> 56:11.240
Where you can't really explain it.

56:11.240 --> 56:12.240
But you know.

56:12.240 --> 56:13.240
Right.

56:13.240 --> 56:14.240
Like there.

56:14.240 --> 56:15.240
Yeah.

56:15.240 --> 56:16.240
We're all feel it.

56:16.240 --> 56:18.240
Like he would somehow bend time space.

56:18.240 --> 56:21.240
In a way to make it retroactively gone or something.

56:21.240 --> 56:22.240
You know.

56:22.240 --> 56:23.240
If you're.

56:23.240 --> 56:24.240
I was really glad to meet Jeff.

56:24.240 --> 56:25.240
I would be on the posters.

56:25.240 --> 56:26.240
I feel like that be the.

56:26.240 --> 56:27.240
Yes.

56:27.240 --> 56:28.240
Yeah.

56:28.240 --> 56:29.240
Well, that's not a genre there.

56:29.240 --> 56:30.240

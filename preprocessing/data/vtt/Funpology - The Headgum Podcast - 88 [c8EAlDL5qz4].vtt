00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head gum original.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Are you going to open it?

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
No, I'm going to do it for a second.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Lovely day for a dance hit.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Um, this is me trying to get sponsored by an air against it.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Kind of New York's longer.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
And how long have you been drinking?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Please.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
It's been about, um,

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
huh.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Seven years?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
No way.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
No way.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Can you spell that out?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Can I spell there against it?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Okay, let's see.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
Um, N-A-R-R-A-G-A-N-S-E-T-T.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Turn out a little bit.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
The other way?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't as hard as I did.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Yeah, it was pretty phonetically.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
I said it's a lovely day for a dance hit.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Okay.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
With some pals.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
All right.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Okay.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
This is supposed to be, this is our second ever in person episode.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
We've set up the zoom in such a way that it's barely editable.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Mm-hmm.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
So AB on your A game.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Where?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
B.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Enjoy.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
You know, we have this kind of live energy in a way.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
This is awful.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
Every time I say, I can't leave because if I stand up, then the headphones will shock you.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah, it's awful.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
So I do feel like I'm actually held here against my will.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Just really cool.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
That is not, I'm not going to say that's something I set up, but it is a fortunate.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah, it does.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah, it kind of makes sense.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Thank you.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
For this show specifically, yeah.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Cheers.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
We should say this.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
To 20 on a Thursday.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Yeah.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Love, which is a lovely time for a dance hit.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
On its other white lock, she doesn't like beer.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
You said it's a logger.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
You said that was disgusting.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
I am not a beer gal.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
I won't pretend to like IPAs or anything like that.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
I don't.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Oh, shocked you.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
No.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
I don't my face.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Of course.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
So every bad thing is happening here.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
I love this.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
This is my favorite episode already.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
This is already one of the worst episodes we ever had.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Because there's only three of us.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Again.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Yeah.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
That's a combination that other people don't want to join.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
People just weren't in the office.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Mm-hmm.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Because it was us three in the office.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
We said maybe she should record an episode.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yes.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
That's a glad they would happen.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I know we know I'm doing it for them.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
And the thing is, we didn't, like, how do I put this?

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
We were, yeah, we didn't prepare her.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
But that's what makes it good.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
That's what makes it.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
It's on its toes.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
You can feel how fragile it is.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Sort of my sweet spot.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
That's sort of the, um, the batter's box in a way.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Okay.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Because I'm ready to, uh, slam against it.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Stop, stop talking about against it.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
It's been a bit of come my personality.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
You can talk about other things.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
All right.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Name a topic.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
I'll talk about it.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Okay.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
What did you eat for lunch today?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Trick question.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
What are you talking about?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
How did it taste like a hero?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Okay.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Great.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Great.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Let's talk about heroes on it.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I think Turkey, Chipotle, Mayo.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Okay.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Gouda.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I hate that you're ending this like you're being accused.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I just want this because it's a combination.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
When they turn into a cross, it's supposed to be fun.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
You asked us to ask you things.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
You know what?

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
I don't like is like the fucking defense, uh, the ball of the fence being the zoom

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
that I'm not in the physical room with you guys.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Now we've actually cornered you.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
I don't appreciate it.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Oh, we're going to really get into it today though.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Meaning let's really get to know one another.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
We should say John is hired full time now, which is, uh, unbelievable.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Grat.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
We knew what happened with the last time you were on the show.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
You hadn't been hired yet.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
No.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
I also graduated college.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Very cool it with the applause.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
I'm just trying to give her her do.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Yeah.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
But we can save it like till the end, right?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
That's true.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Because you are just asking.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Um.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
I like the applause.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
The also last time we talked, you had to, like,

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
like, cram an entire yoga course into a weekend.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Yeah.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
How did that go to your past?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I did pass obviously because I graduated.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Right.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Um, I didn't actually do all of the yoga that I was supposed to do.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
Um, and my teacher was very, very, very gracious and gave me an A-minus.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Cool.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
It's interesting.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
No way.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
You would be fine.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
No exactly.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
And I need to email her and thank her.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
It's just like, I've been busy.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
But yeah.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Thank you.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Well, it was your great point, average.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Is this shit?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
It's going to matter in the rest of your life.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
She's already hired.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Amazing.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Like next company, they're going to ask again.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Trust me.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
No, they only have to worry.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
5, 10 years down the line.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
They keep asking.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I don't think so.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
You've never been 5, 10 years down the line.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Yeah, I know.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
But I figure as much.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Haha.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
So you guess.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
So you guess.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Do you?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Do you?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Do you?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
What?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Why?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
What's your 39?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
No.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
You put that on your eyes.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
It's not much to brag home.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
It's the right home about.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
What's the opposite of a braggard?

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
Like someone who kind of openly projects a braggard.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Bad information about themselves.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Self-deprecation.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
A sagger.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Like a sagger.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
A sag after a braggard.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
I don't know.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
But you finished up.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
With a GPA of what?

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Like a 3.3 3.4.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
I think.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Like a lowest GPA in college.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
About any of us.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
That was 3.2.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
That's not bad though.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
You know how many C's I got?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Because I did in my G's.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
How many C's you got?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Like, five, nine.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
What were your G's?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
That's what you asked.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
That's what you asked.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
That's what you asked.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Random ass number calling nine.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
I don't think I was nine.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Geology.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Obviously.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Okay.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
See.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Okay.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Cool.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Because that's actually the one thing that I get insecure about.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
I found it.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Sorry.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
I said, see.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Okay.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Pick one though.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Hmm.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Linguistics.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
You've been speaking English your entire life.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
There was from being honest.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
A freshman math seminar.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
The mathematics of gaming.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Okay.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Okay.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
That seems way more like interesting.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Like you learned how to count cards.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I didn't get to see in that one.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
I got it.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
It was easy because it was kind of like learning how to con.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
To cut, come to con.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Oh.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
So it was like card game mathematics.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
In a way.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Like shape of my heart.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Sting mathematics.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
It was like board games.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Every week was a different type of game.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Okay.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
Just looking really, really, really not liking your energy.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
That's the most energy I've brought.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
No, yeah.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
That we did a Vegas month.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Okay.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
You went to Vegas?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
For a month.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
It was just a month.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
For that class.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Well, expense paid.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
No way.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
No.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
It was just in class.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
But we did talk about doing a class Vegas trip for a weekend.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
And then our professor, Sanjay was kind of like, you guys are.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
I would go for the gaming.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
But not all of you guys are 21.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
So you're not going to be able to get in the casino.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
I cannot endorse 18 year olds going to casino.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
And I actually ended up.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
And now, keep in mind that this guy is, you know, son of an immigrant.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Brown.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Of course.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Yeah.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
You know, doing the incredibly well for himself.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
I did petition to get him fired.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Fire.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Yeah.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Extra diet.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Yeah.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
I was like, get out of the, kind of.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Like, you came from, you know, and, uh,

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Not bad.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
No.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
No.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
100%.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Because everybody has me that.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
And it felt so good to dish it out.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
To dish it out.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Just take it.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
At least you're honest with yourself.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
We're all college graduates.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
VA or BFA.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Um, B.A.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Nice.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
B.A.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Me too.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Yeah.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
B.F.A.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
But yeah.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
See, I was going to say weren't you a film major.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
I just wanted to be a part of a group.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Yeah.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
The F.A.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yeah.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Well, no, no, no, no.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Because you guys were.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Yeah.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Yeah.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Oh, but honestly, this is all turning out to be BS.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Uh-huh.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
That's funny.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Funny.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
I guess.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Not, I guess.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Just say if it's funny or not.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Um.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
All right.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
So how long have we been doing this fucking thing?

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Why all of a sudden, the sour attitude, man.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
It's not all of a sudden.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Oh, by the way, the fact that you say sour all the time has made me say sour.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Wait more in my life.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Um.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
January and almost at the end of January.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Yeah.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Um.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
How are you guys looking forward to beach season already?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Hell yeah.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Yeah.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
I am.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
No.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
And then if you say no, you're looking to be it.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I guess so.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I don't look like an idiot.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I'm kind of looking forward to beach season.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Why?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Why are you kind of looking?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
I don't like the beach.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
You don't like the beach?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Not the beach.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
So fast on it.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Do you like mountains?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
What are you like?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
What's your bag?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
I love mountains.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
All right.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
I love the water.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
I love the sand.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
And I love the sun.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
So you love the beach.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Oh, no.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
I fucking hate the beach.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
You don't like when they're all together.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
You like sand independently of the sun and water.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
No.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
I like it when sand water.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Like even like the crisp air.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Like then what do you not like about the beach?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Desert.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
You want a desert oasis.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
No.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
That's like.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
That's too much.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
That's too much.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
That's nothing.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
But I like I really like the water.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Especially being like right by the coastline.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
That's the beach.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
You're describing a beach.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
But you're saying you hate beaches.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Don't understand why we're confused.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Not.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
I guess it was kind of pink.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
What do you think a mountain is?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Because you said you love mountains and then you're describing beaches.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Oh, mountains like an elevated natural land form.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Okay.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Correct.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
And then a beach.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Got it.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
So Johnny does like the beach.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
But you're not excited about beaches because why it's too far away.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Yeah.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
I actually really, I genuinely don't enjoy the beach.

10:23.000 --> 10:30.000
It's a little too boring to me.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
I mean, if I wanted to sit around on the sand or just sit around anywhere.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
I'd sit around anywhere.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Do you not swim?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I don't swim because of what it's too cold.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
I agree with that.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I don't really swim either.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Exactly.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
So why do you go to the beach?

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Because I like to lay on the beach and look hot.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
If I wanted to sit and be bored on hot sand.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
I would never have left the basement that my parents kept me in.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Do you want to talk about it?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Do we need to talk about it?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
I'm already out of it.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah, obviously.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
But that kind of trauma does not just sit with you when you're there.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
It kind of follows you for the rest of your life.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Well, you did say you have therapy after this.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
You want to unpack this?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Not really.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
That's not my job.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Are you thinking about the therapist should?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I lied to my therapist all the time.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
You're paying money.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Because I don't have enough trauma.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
What have you said?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
What have I told you?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
I'm sure you've looked.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
What?

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
I was, honestly, purposely, flunked in a lot of my classes.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Those sees I was telling you about.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
It's because people were out to get me.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
And then I could make up these back stories about how professors you know,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
tried to get me expelled.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
And again, this right by me, you try to get something gone.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Is 100% sure.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
So I like flip things that I do to other people.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
So first off, back thing was to clean down a flight of stairs.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
And I told my therapist that was me.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
That got kicked.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Okay.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
To what end?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
To what end?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
What does matter the end?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Because the ends justify the means.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
And I don't know what the means are until I do them.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Does that make sense?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Like, I'm only me every day.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
And it happens to be that I create these,

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
this chaos, these horrible acts.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Okay.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
So you like to be able to perform,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I guess, in front of your therapist, right?

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Like, kind of put on these like little facades for them.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Not perform as much as outright lie.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Okay.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
To get my money's worth.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Because if I just told her what happens in my actual life,

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
she'd be like, you're fine.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
You know, so there's like, I need to get advice that I can actually apply.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Okay.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Well, have you applied any of this advice?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
What?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Okay.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Well, for example, one of them was don't kick tweens.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Okay.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
That hasn't necessarily manifested in my everyday life.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Okay.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
You're getting your money's worth.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Well, you're a bad person.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Everybody needs to be in therapy.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
They say, so I'm giving it a fucking shot.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
And you know what I'm saying?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
I was just lying the whole time.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Yeah.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
No, I did set up.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
You've seen these free COVID tests.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Like, booths and volumes work.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Yeah.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
What?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
What are you going to say?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I set up a station in a tent.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
And I said free COVID tests.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
They were dangerous.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Yeah.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
Can you explain what a station is?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
It was like a banner, I think.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
A some kind of banner that said free COVID tests.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
And then people came out of the tent.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
And I was like, you know, do the swab and everything.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
It was just a cute tip.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
I don't know the tests.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
It was dummy tests.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
And they were dummies for coming me to test.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
Do you realize these people are kind of fearful for the lives right now?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Yeah.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Yeah.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
These kind of jobs.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
It's not like, okay.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Wow.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
And now the T word comes out.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Yeah.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Because I look like Sanjay.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Honestly not.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I learned that room with another Sanjay look alive.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
My God.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I can't wait till he shit can't.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
I really can't.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
We're all people of color.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Yeah.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
How does that meant?

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
What?

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
The one thing I ask of you guys is don't bring up the see thing or interrupt me.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
That's the one thing.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
That's two things.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Oh.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Yeah.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
That is.

14:07.000 --> 14:16.000
If you guys feel comfortable with it.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
What?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
What's your.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
What's the race you would rather be?

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Probably be white because I get a lot of free shit.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
And I get to hang out with like,

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
have dinner parties.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
What do I do?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
What do other white people do?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Um.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
They play Can Jam.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
A lot.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
A lot.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
They play.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
They do skirt the law.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
They read Cam Jansen.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Cam Jansen.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Yeah.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
The woman with the girl with the photographic memory.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
I don't remember.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
One with the photograph.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
You know.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
No.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Yeah.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Yeah.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
I do know.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
I know hoarder.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
I love hoarder.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
I love hoarder.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
I didn't record.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
I was a little too advanced for that.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
What'd you?

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
No David.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Have you ever?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
What?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
No David.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
What was that?

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I love no David.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
What is no David?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
No David is a book.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
That's not about David.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
No.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
It is about David.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
It's a picture book.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
And every page, it says no David.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
And this child is a dentist.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
The dentist type.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
He's pushing over fish bowls.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
No David.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
If he's like pulling a cat's tail.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
No David.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
And it just goes like that.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
And at the end, it's yes, David.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
Because like, he feels bad for all he's done.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
And then there's like a kind of redemption arc.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
And at the end, it's yes, Daddy.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
I don't know.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
I don't know.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
I don't know.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I don't know.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
I don't know.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
I don't know how to.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
I just go about the silence.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Get that out of the way.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
You guys are acting like saints.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
I will.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
New work.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Two New Jersey residents.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Not residents, but a lot.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Really.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Okay.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
And my question is that you guys are kind of scrutinizing

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
every decision I make.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
I think saying, you know, casting judgment that I shouldn't set up.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
What you guys called terrorist.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
Yeah, you shouldn't do that.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Okay.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Bad idea.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
What do you guys do that's morally questionable?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Morally questionable.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Yeah.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I mean, I've been.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
So I have a lot of like guy friends.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
And they all have girlfriends.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
They're all in relationships.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Lizard.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
For having friends.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
All right.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
We've got to be friends with single guys.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
I guess.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I mean,

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
not really my decision.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
I'm really happy for them, too, by the way.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Really.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Yeah.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
So I've been telling their girlfriends any time they come over.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
And like, we're all hanging out.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
And like, let's say my friend has to go to the bathroom.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
I'll tell her, like, hey, you should probably paint your nails soon.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Fuck.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Get to nails painted.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I don't know, like, what's going to happen.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
But like, I feel like I have a good feeling.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
You should probably get your nails painted.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
And then they get their nails painted.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Get the whole manning petty thing.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Then like weeks go by.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Nothing happens.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
That's so fun.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
You think that they're getting ready to be proposed.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Like, you're instilling the idea they might get proposed.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Yeah.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Yeah.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
And I mean, I don't think it's really that morally questionable because at the, like,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
right at the start, they're like, oh, my god.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Like, oh, something else.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
You think you're making people happy.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Yeah.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
I mean, I see it in the face.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
I'm voting.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
They're like, care.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
And they give me a big old hug.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Like, that means a lot to me.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
So it's more like questionable.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Because in the end, they're left off worse than before.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
They were out of stasis.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
You gave them a high and they end up in a low.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Yeah.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Like, do you see that?

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Well, like, I said, I have a good feeling.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
So it's not, like, I'm really, I'm not giving them anything concrete.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
But you don't see how that could make someone think they're about to be proposed to.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Or something great's going to happen.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
A trip or something.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
I don't know.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
I mean, I think that's why he does it because you do think about it.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Yeah.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
I think that.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
I mean, I don't, I guess, like, it's in the back of my mind.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
Like, oh, like, this could mean, like, you're getting proposed to.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
But like, I don't know.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Like, if you tell somebody, like, I have a good feeling about you.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Like, doesn't that make them feel good?

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
I feel physical and comfortable.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I guess be for yourself.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
I feel like in some way, this is deeply misogynistic.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
That can't.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
That was easy.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
Um, this show is webby worthy.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
What episode?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
It's actually going better than I thought.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Mostly because I've gotten me to confess.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
And you to confess to morally reprehensible hobbies, really.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Okay.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Gianna, what's something morally potentially more morally reprehensible that you do?

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
I was going to bring up the group chat that we have in the fact that half of it is.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
No, let's not.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Let's not bring it up.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
No, no, no, no.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
I'm not in the group chat, but we don't bring that up.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Yeah.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
We don't have to talk about it.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Yeah, we don't.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Okay.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
But everything you say and do in that group chat is morally reprehensible.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
It's pretty bad.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Yeah.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Like we're not being like.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
No.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
No, but I would.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Oh, yeah, man.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
I don't know.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Usually it's like a mistake when people do.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Yeah.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Like if you had said, yes, it would have been like, yes, but like I made a huge mistake.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Well, like, I feel like when everyone's like cheating on like a test.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Like there's like, oh, I cheated on the test too.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Oh, that was so sweet.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
But that's not the same thing.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Yeah.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Because you're hurting someone instead of just like, you know,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
increasing your academic success.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Well, I mean, like, the teacher's kind of hurt.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Aren't they?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
No, the teacher's not correct.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
And if they do, they suck.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Hmm.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
That's what I said.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
If I was going to be.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Here's the thing about if I ever end up being a high school teacher,

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
I'm going to be like, you guys are all getting good grades.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Like, you know, if the worst you'll get is a V-minus or something like that.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
And you don't have to come at all.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
But if you come, show up and to learn and we'll learn and you'll get an A.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
And you know, I'll figure it out with the administration.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
This is your halfway through the market period.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Why?

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Why didn't you tell us this shit on syllabus week?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Also, you're drinking in there against it.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Can't do that.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I had a teacher like that, Loki.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Shout out Mr. Lee.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Yeah.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Oh, from high school.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
From high school.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
He used to give me when I would skip other classes.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
I would like go to his class and he would write me like a late pass.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
To make it.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Wow.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
And where is he now?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
I think he's still teaching.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I think he was a fired.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Yeah.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Well, I thought he was like, I thought he was like,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I thought he was serving like a five year sentence.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Yeah.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Yeah.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Yeah.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Yeah.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Yeah.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Don't ruin this for me.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Don't ruin this for Lee.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Yeah.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
All right, Jeffrey.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Do you have a segment?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
We do have to take a break.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
And then I'll move it back with.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I think the best segment I've ever come up with on this show.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Cry.

You guys are going to love this.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I wrote this specifically for you

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
and if you don't like it.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Sorry about it.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Put a ton of work into it.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I wrote this specifically for us

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
in like the 30 minutes that you were.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Right.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Yeah.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
It was like a half a day.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Let's call it.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Okay.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Because I started it like one 10

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
and it was just 220.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
I guess.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
I always forget how long this song is.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Maybe you should shorten it.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Get a different one.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Welcome to West Alps or West's apps.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Okay.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
So you guys know the Alps.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
The mountain range.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
This is with Alps.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Yes.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Some of them.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
The Western Alps is kind of like it encompasses all of Monaco,

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
the southeast corner of France and some of.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
So you guys know the Alps.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
The Western Alps is kind of like it encompasses all of Monaco,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
the southeast corner of France

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
and some of Switzerland.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Fine.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Fine.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Okay.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Right.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
And then.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
West's apps.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Any questions?

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
I'm guessing it's Kanye West's apps.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Right.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Yes.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Or appetizer.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Yeah.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
In the second one.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
So basically.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
You have to think that EA eats out almost every day.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Okay.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Especially with, you know, Julia.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Yeah.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
He's trying to press it.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
What a fox.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
That's really good.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Um.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Yeah.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
So it was good.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
It's hard because like I'll never.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I'll ever find somebody like Fox.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Yeah.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
What a little on the legions.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Yeah.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Cause you're just a bad person.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Earlier today.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Imagine it.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
I tweeted earlier today that if taking her surname was all it took,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I would take really James's last name.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Mm hmm.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
But she hasn't seen the tweet.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Yeah.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
And so he probably will never.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Yeah.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Well, I was trying to add her because she doesn't have a Twitter.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
So I was trying to find her agents.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Uh.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
So that's bad.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Yeah.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Yeah.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
They, I mean, it's their job to kind of monitor.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Yeah.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Yeah.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Yeah.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
They're going to monitor it.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Probably put you on like a list.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Yeah.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Probably like a black list.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Yeah.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Yeah.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
What about like a brown list?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
So it's like because I'm brown.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Yeah.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Obviously.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Yeah.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
I get like the pun and everything.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
But like they're definitely going to black list you from like future.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Hollywood stuff.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Vars.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
I didn't explain the game.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
It's West Alps or West Saps.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
So I want to either list a town.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Okay.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
In the Western Alps.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Okay.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
Or an appetizer that Kanye West might have eaten at some point.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Vars.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Vars.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
Keep in mind, he eats at very fancy restaurants.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
That's a town.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Vars.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
That's correct.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Vars is a town in the Western Alps.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Okay.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
I don't know how you pronounce this.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Or gorgeous.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
Or gorgeous.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
That sounds like an app to me.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
I don't know.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
That's going to be a town in the Alps.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Wow, gorgeous.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
All right.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
What about bread?

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Oh.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Okay.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
This has to be a trick question.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Like an app.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Kanye West App.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
That's a Kanye West App.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Because a lot of times.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
I don't know how often you guys heat out.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
They'll bring, you're going to have to order it.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
They bring bread.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
We.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Yes.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I don't know if you're going to say something.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Corn fritters.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Okay.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
That's an app.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Correct.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Okay.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
And this is the best segment you got.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
We had 40 minutes.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
We weren't supposed to record today.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Yeah.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
We weren't supposed to record just today.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Great.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
That was a good one.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Yeah.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Gap.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
That's a town in the Alps.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Correct.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Okay.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Dean.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
That's a town.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Correct.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Snacks.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Snacks?

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Yeah.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
That's not an app.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Nor does it, though.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
That's going to be an appetizer.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Snacks?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
That's just.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
You can't order snacks.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
What do you mean is an appetizer?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Do you mean if not snacks?

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
I.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
You're not.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
You're not wrong.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
But you need to be specific.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Because you can't.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
You don't go to a restaurant.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
You order snacks.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
I.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Okay.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
I feel like this.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
What about bonchon?

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
At Korean barbecue.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
That's just snacks.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
I don't.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
I don't.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
I don't.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Do you go to bonchon and order snacks?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
You go to Korean barbecue and order bonchon.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Bonchon snacks.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Almost.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
You said almost.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
It's so it's not.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
I don't know the direct translation.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
I just know that I get bonchon.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
It's a bunch of snacks.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
As apps.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
This is not how I wanted this together.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
I feel like this game could have been interesting.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
If you would like.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Take in the names of like fancy foods.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
You know, like French.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
No, of course.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Of course.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
And I think he knows this.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Yeah.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
No.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Taken.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
What about Alps?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Alps.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Yeah.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Alps.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Is a city town?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
No.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
It's not a city or a town.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
It's like more of a region.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
How was that wrong?

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
Ha ha ha ha.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
How about this?

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Pate.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
That's an app.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Yeah.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
I thought that one would get Johnny.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
What about Oops?

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Oops.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Yeah.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
That's.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Town.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Correct.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Or a region or whatever the hell.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
It was a.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Well, now it's incorrect if you're changing it.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
It was actually on time.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Oh, okay.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
I feel like for all intents and purposes.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
Region town and city can all be the same thing right now.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Because the other option is food.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Yes.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
What about apps?

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
That's an app.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
All right.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
I can see the energy.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
I can feel it.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Maybe they can feel it on the video or not.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Yeah.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
The energy shifting.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Yeah.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Not in my favor.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
What about free juice?

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Free juice?

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Like free juice?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Or free juice?

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Free juice?

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Free juice.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Okay.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
That's a town.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Yeah.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
It's going to be a town.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
That's going to be maybe the southernmost part of the Alps.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
It was the fucking hand action.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
You look at your pressure.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Really?

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
What about bad juice?

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Bad juice?

28:16.000 --> 28:16.500
Yeah.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
That's a town.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
I guess.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
It's got to be a town.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
That's going to be Bay's juice, if I said it slower.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Gross.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Because she is snack.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Oh.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
If you're in a relationship, by the way, major healer.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
Savor every last sip.

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
Of the relationship, every sip of your partner.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
I hate that.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Enough.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Wow.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
If you guys hate that, then you're not going to like any of the rest of this.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
That's just...

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Move on.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
That was...

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
You just...

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
West Alps.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Or West Alps.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
And I had a lot of fun with that.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
You guys brought absolute poison to the table.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
And I can't believe it went this way.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
I'm starting to get mad.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Don't sing.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Don't sing in your bad.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Johnny, you brought in the second one.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Yeah.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
So...

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I think this podcast...

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Yeah.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
It is really good.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
No.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
He's a little too big for it's breaches right now.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
And we've all done some morally dubious things.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Yeah.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
So call me an optimist.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
But I really do think that we're going to mess up really, really soon.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Do you want to get it?

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Do you want to intro song?

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Do you have an intro song?

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Yeah.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Yeah.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Go for it.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Oh.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Like having done this one in a while.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
That's a good one.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Yeah.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Yeah.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
I hope it fits again.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
Yeah.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
It doesn't.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Oh.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
It's very yeast.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
Is there ever a bit to be used?

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Oh, no.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
I just thought it'd be fun to have a drink.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
I like that.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Yeah.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
It's good.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Okay.

29:55.000 --> 30:01.000
So in this segment, I wanted to see if you guys could help me write a notes app apology.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Yeah.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
I do figure that I'm going to need it at some point.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Yeah.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
So here's what I have so far.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
I'm going to go the line by line.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Okay.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
And feel free to stop me if I'm going in like the wrong direction.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
And I really do urge you to stop me.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
So I can better hone in my apologizing.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I already feel like it's going to be bad then.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
But let's hear it.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Yeah.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Because you shouldn't.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
You should.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
If you're presenting it to people, it should have gone through a couple of drafts.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
How many drafts was it?

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
This is one.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
This is kind of just freestyle.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
I did like.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
I did write a sentence.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Oh, I'll rework that sentence.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Are you apologizing for anything in particular?

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Well, no.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
I think like, this is could be like a catch all for anything that I do.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Anything.

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
I think any already never mind because it should be specific to the situation.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
Yeah.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
You need to be taking accountability.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
And listening to like why you did something wrong.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
I wrote about that.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Got it.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Okay.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Let's just do it.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
So I'm not perfect.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
And neither are you actually.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Oh, okay.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Yeah.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Because that's like even if that's true, it's a given.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
You don't want to say it.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Okay.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Oh, okay.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
So just just take the second fragment out.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
I'm continuing.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
The.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
I'm not perfect.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Mm-hmm.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
You can keep that.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
That's good to admit guilt up to.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Okay.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Yeah.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Just don't say that about someone else.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Okay.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Okay.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
All right.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
All right.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Next line.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
I've been listening.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I've been seeing what everyone has to say.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
Actually, we should add like sad music underneath every time I start apologizing.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
They can do it in post.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
All right.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
I've been listening.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
I've been seeing what everyone has to say.

31:33.000 --> 31:37.960
And I waited till general discourse slowed to a crawl before finally making a

31:37.960 --> 31:38.960
statement.

31:38.960 --> 31:41.960
What is an apology really?

31:41.960 --> 31:43.960
Sounds too sad.

31:43.960 --> 31:44.960
This is a fun apology.

31:44.960 --> 31:45.960
No, it's not.

31:45.960 --> 31:48.960
It's already not a catch all.

31:48.960 --> 31:51.960
Let's let's just plug and play something horrible you did.

31:51.960 --> 31:52.960
Right.

31:52.960 --> 31:58.960
Let's maybe say you made disparaging comments about one of your colleagues who happened

31:58.960 --> 31:59.960
to be a woman.

31:59.960 --> 32:00.960
Okay.

32:00.960 --> 32:01.960
It was me.

32:01.960 --> 32:02.960
Okay.

32:02.960 --> 32:03.960
Yeah.

32:03.960 --> 32:04.960
We'll use you as an example.

32:04.960 --> 32:05.960
I mean disparaging comments about me all the time.

32:05.960 --> 32:06.960
Don't okay.

32:06.960 --> 32:10.960
Well, I think a fun apology because it's not fun.

32:10.960 --> 32:13.960
Everything you've said so far has been dire.

32:13.960 --> 32:14.960
Okay.

32:14.960 --> 32:18.960
You kind of want to make it fun because you're not having fun.

32:18.960 --> 32:19.960
You're not supposed to have fun.

32:19.960 --> 32:20.960
You're a dog house.

32:20.960 --> 32:21.960
Yeah.

32:21.960 --> 32:27.960
Well, I mean, when you read someone's no top apology to like you feel like kind of sad

32:27.960 --> 32:29.960
when you're walking into like reading it.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.960
So I wanted like this is in the next line.

32:32.960 --> 32:33.960
Yeah.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.960
I'm going to leave this post better than when you walked in.

32:36.960 --> 32:37.960
Okay.

32:37.960 --> 32:38.960
It's not a physical space.

32:38.960 --> 32:39.960
Two sentences in a row.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.960
You mentioned walking into an apology.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.960
It's a nose app.

32:43.960 --> 32:44.960
Post.

32:44.960 --> 32:45.960
Yeah.

32:45.960 --> 32:46.960
Yeah.

32:46.960 --> 32:47.960
Okay.

32:47.960 --> 32:48.960
So it's good.

32:48.960 --> 32:49.960
No.

32:49.960 --> 32:50.960
I take that.

32:50.960 --> 32:51.960
Take out fun apology.

32:51.960 --> 32:52.960
Take out the last sentence as well.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.960
Fun apology was like one thing that you were really.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.960
I was really happy about it.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.960
Like obviously it's like not fun to you.

32:59.960 --> 33:00.960
Whatever.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.960
Maybe it all keep it in.

33:02.960 --> 33:03.960
What I did was funny.

33:03.960 --> 33:04.960
Can we agree?

33:04.960 --> 33:05.960
Cut.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.960
Not that part for sure.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.960
It wasn't funny if you're apologizing.

33:09.960 --> 33:10.960
Yeah.

33:10.960 --> 33:11.960
Okay.

33:11.960 --> 33:14.960
I get why people are upset.

33:14.960 --> 33:15.960
What do you want me to say?

33:15.960 --> 33:17.960
I'm sorry for being fun.

33:17.960 --> 33:18.960
No.

33:18.960 --> 33:19.960
No.

33:19.960 --> 33:20.960
You're just gaslighting every.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.960
Better to not post this at all.

33:22.960 --> 33:23.960
Hmm.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.960
But like we can like rewrite this a few more times.

33:25.960 --> 33:28.960
And then we'll probably get it to like a place where you can at least live in

33:28.960 --> 33:29.960
the drafts.

33:29.960 --> 33:30.960
All right.

33:30.960 --> 33:31.960
Okay.

33:32.960 --> 33:33.960
Oops.

33:33.960 --> 33:38.960
So I do that for you.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.960
Oops.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.960
Three times in a row.

33:42.960 --> 33:43.960
Oops.

33:43.960 --> 33:44.960
Oops.

33:44.960 --> 33:45.960
Oops.

33:45.960 --> 33:50.960
How did you think that this was good to present?

33:50.960 --> 33:52.960
How long did this take?

33:52.960 --> 33:54.960
It took me like 30 minutes.

33:54.960 --> 33:55.960
Okay.

33:55.960 --> 33:56.960
I'm glad it wasn't more than that.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.960
It's still your better judgment.

33:58.960 --> 33:59.960
Okay.

34:00.960 --> 34:03.960
And then like in the middle of the post, we're going to have an ad break.

34:03.960 --> 34:06.960
Of my own psychology.

34:06.960 --> 34:07.960
Who's the ad?

34:07.960 --> 34:09.960
Who's the company that you had maybe sponsored this,

34:09.960 --> 34:14.960
fun policy by three free meals with hello friends.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.960
No way for free using promo code.

34:17.960 --> 34:21.960
Now you're making money off the traction of a public apology.

34:21.960 --> 34:22.960
Yeah.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.960
No more code notes.

34:24.960 --> 34:25.960
Yeah.

34:25.960 --> 34:26.960
Yeah.

34:26.960 --> 34:27.960
Obviously it could be whatever.

34:27.960 --> 34:30.560
attention to the fact that it's a notesap apology.

34:30.560 --> 34:33.200
I mean, I work with advertisers.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.840
They want to know where it came from.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.760
So using the promo code notesap, they can

34:37.760 --> 34:41.080
track it on the victim, the person you've heard.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.520
Not a major conglomerate.

34:43.520 --> 34:46.080
Yeah, food delivery service.

34:46.080 --> 34:46.920
It's great, right?

34:46.920 --> 34:48.240
No, it's not.

34:48.240 --> 34:49.440
No.

34:49.440 --> 34:52.800
You're not hearing it, because it's keep going.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.200
Will I change?

34:55.200 --> 34:57.120
Well, ask me in five years.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.120
No, my god.

34:58.120 --> 35:01.200
Till then, can we really predict the future?

35:01.200 --> 35:03.840
If you keep going on a tangent about the future?

35:03.840 --> 35:08.080
Well, I mean, I think everyone's thinking about the future, right?

35:08.080 --> 35:12.480
Not when they're reading notesap apology from you.

35:12.480 --> 35:16.280
By the way, in this case, you must have done something at least where there was news about

35:16.280 --> 35:17.720
it, because you're posting this.

35:17.720 --> 35:18.720
Right.

35:18.720 --> 35:19.720
There was a lot of discourse.

35:19.720 --> 35:20.720
There was a lot of discourse.

35:20.720 --> 35:22.480
Well, I mean, it slowed a lot.

35:22.480 --> 35:26.360
Like I waited until people stopped talking about it to bring it up again.

35:26.360 --> 35:27.360
Why would?

35:27.360 --> 35:31.880
Because like it was too much, like everyone was kind of coming at me from all sides.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.320
So you're not so worried about the victim.

35:33.320 --> 35:37.000
You're worried about how you felt, because usually it's like we want to wait till

35:37.000 --> 35:39.080
everything dies down because you want to try apology.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.080
My post.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.080
It's my notesap.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.080
You're moment.

35:42.080 --> 35:44.680
I'm moment to shine.

35:44.680 --> 35:48.680
Okay, so future, great.

35:48.680 --> 35:52.600
So far, I think we've kept of the sentences you've said, we've kept four.

35:52.600 --> 35:53.600
Well, I'm not.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.240
Well, we're editing the other ones.

35:55.240 --> 35:59.560
I think like in every draft, like you kind of have to rewrite pretty much everything, right?

35:59.560 --> 36:03.160
No, usually you just like, you whittle down as the idea.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.800
So like the last couple of drafts you don't have to do much.

36:05.800 --> 36:06.800
Okay.

36:06.800 --> 36:07.800
So this is the first one.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.560
It's almost a total rewrite, which is fine.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.240
I've had to do that before.

36:12.240 --> 36:13.560
That's not surprising.

36:13.560 --> 36:15.760
Let's keep the rest of it.

36:15.760 --> 36:18.280
Anyway, I'm a good person.

36:18.280 --> 36:21.640
The blame should really be shifted somewhere else.

36:21.640 --> 36:25.360
The situation in Iran is getting really crazy.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.440
That's where that energy should go.

36:27.440 --> 36:28.680
That's where that energy should go.

36:28.680 --> 36:36.160
So do not review yourself, or emphasis, don't ring foreign policy into it.

36:36.160 --> 36:41.000
You're politicizing and monetizing a public apology for a horrible wrongdoing that you

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
did.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
It's going to get likes.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
A lot of views.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.800
It's going to, at the very least, the people who were mad are going to see it.

36:47.800 --> 36:48.800
Okay.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.920
And by the way, I did read over your shoulder earlier just a little bit.

36:50.920 --> 36:51.920
That sentence.

36:51.920 --> 36:52.920
I'm pretty sure.

36:52.920 --> 36:53.920
You're original draft.

36:53.920 --> 36:54.920
And I'm glad you made this change.

36:54.920 --> 36:55.920
I don't think it should be Iran.

36:55.920 --> 36:57.920
But it was originally going to be Coney, 2020, too.

36:57.920 --> 36:58.920
Yeah.

36:58.920 --> 36:59.920
10 year anniversary.

36:59.920 --> 37:00.920
Why don't we talk about that?

37:00.920 --> 37:01.920
Yeah.

37:01.920 --> 37:02.920
Yeah.

37:02.920 --> 37:03.920
No.

37:03.920 --> 37:04.920
But I didn't.

37:04.920 --> 37:06.920
I wouldn't have been as ever green because I wrote 2022.

37:06.920 --> 37:07.920
And after 2020.

37:07.920 --> 37:08.920
What if Iran's fine?

37:08.920 --> 37:09.920
Yeah.

37:09.920 --> 37:10.920
What if it's fine?

37:10.920 --> 37:11.920
It's also not ever green.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.920
Like, America's going to meddle in Iran for some reason.

37:14.920 --> 37:18.920
Why are we writing an ever green apology?

37:18.920 --> 37:19.920
Yeah.

37:19.920 --> 37:20.920
Because we're going to need it.

37:20.920 --> 37:21.920
Trust me.

37:21.920 --> 37:22.920
We.

37:22.920 --> 37:24.920
I'm not a part of this.

37:24.920 --> 37:25.920
Maybe like.

37:25.920 --> 37:26.920
Ask me in five years.

37:26.920 --> 37:28.920
And actually, you are cancel for something in post.

37:28.920 --> 37:29.920
But like a ballad.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.920
And you're like, by the way, thanks to my buddies, Gianna.

37:31.920 --> 37:34.920
We're really helping me through this entire process.

37:34.920 --> 37:35.920
And writing this apology.

37:35.920 --> 37:40.920
I haven't talked to Gianni in five years.

37:40.920 --> 37:41.920
There's more.

37:41.920 --> 37:42.920
There is.

37:42.920 --> 37:43.920
We're about to close it.

37:43.920 --> 37:47.920
Till then, peace and love to my fans who have stuck by me.

37:47.920 --> 37:50.920
And to my haters, I offer you nothing.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.920
Later, y'all.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.920
Honestly, I kind of fuck with that lad.

37:55.920 --> 37:58.920
You can't give him that.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.920
His haters hate him for a reason now.

38:00.920 --> 38:01.920
That's true.

38:01.920 --> 38:02.920
That's true.

38:02.920 --> 38:04.920
You can't say it's a good one.

38:04.920 --> 38:07.920
I like that energy on a general on a general note.

38:07.920 --> 38:08.920
Yeah.

38:08.920 --> 38:09.920
Yeah.

38:09.920 --> 38:10.920
I think in this situation.

38:10.920 --> 38:11.920
I'm looking at notes apologies.

38:11.920 --> 38:12.920
Really good.

38:12.920 --> 38:16.920
I think let's just do kind of a recap on what to change.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.920
Not only about the notes, but about you.

38:18.920 --> 38:19.920
Okay.

38:19.920 --> 38:20.920
Yeah.

38:20.920 --> 38:21.920
That's all ears.

38:21.920 --> 38:22.920
It doesn't feel like it.

38:22.920 --> 38:23.920
But yeah, let's go.

38:23.920 --> 38:28.920
Number one, don't create evergreen apologies because apologies should be singular to each person that you wrong.

38:28.920 --> 38:29.920
Okay.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.920
Number two, I would say actually don't maybe don't go public.

38:31.920 --> 38:35.920
Maybe reach out to the person individually so that they know that you actually give a shit.

38:35.920 --> 38:38.920
And think about them instead of taking it as your moment to monetize and exercise.

38:38.920 --> 38:39.920
Yeah.

38:39.920 --> 38:40.920
Okay.

38:40.920 --> 38:44.920
And then for this is just more on a microscope for this apology, I would cut everything other than I'm not perfect.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.920
You don't even say I'm sorry.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.920
You don't even say I'm sorry.

38:48.920 --> 38:52.920
Oh, you try to solicit forced or switched blame.

38:52.920 --> 38:56.920
You try to shift it to a struggling country.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.920
Oh, I know I didn't say I'm sorry.

38:58.920 --> 38:59.920
I'm sorry.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.920
I'm sorry for being funny.

39:01.920 --> 39:02.920
Yeah.

39:02.920 --> 39:03.920
Let's do it.

39:03.920 --> 39:04.920
I'm not perfect.

39:04.920 --> 39:05.920
I'm sorry.

39:05.920 --> 39:06.920
That's it.

39:06.920 --> 39:07.920
Maybe.

39:07.920 --> 39:08.920
What about the ruins?

39:08.920 --> 39:09.920
The oops is really.

39:09.920 --> 39:10.920
Absolutely.

39:11.920 --> 39:15.920
Well, I do challenge you guys to write a better note-up apology.

39:15.920 --> 39:18.920
Because I am trying because that's what's most concerning.

39:18.920 --> 39:23.920
I was going to say once we transitioned away from the recap is that I like we're here for you.

39:23.920 --> 39:24.920
Yeah.

39:24.920 --> 39:25.920
Yeah.

39:25.920 --> 39:26.920
I'm glad you guys are here.

39:26.920 --> 39:29.920
Just hear us out because you might not like the cost of it.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.920
Is that we're here for you for an edited over you need.

39:32.920 --> 39:34.920
And you have a support system.

39:34.920 --> 39:35.920
Yeah.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.920
You don't have to make these links by listening.

39:37.920 --> 39:38.920
You're not listening.

39:38.920 --> 39:39.920
You're not.

39:39.920 --> 39:42.920
Is that maybe you don't make these like big swing cries for help on public forums.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.920
We're like 40,000 people are going to see this.

39:44.920 --> 39:45.920
Okay.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.920
And they're going to think that you're doing well or that this is a comedy bit.

39:47.920 --> 39:48.920
We're here with you.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.920
We know you personally that this is an actual cry for help.

39:51.920 --> 39:52.920
Oh, yeah.

39:52.920 --> 39:53.920
Yeah.

39:53.920 --> 39:54.920
Yeah.

39:54.920 --> 39:55.920
Yeah.

39:55.920 --> 39:56.920
Yeah.

39:56.920 --> 39:57.920
It's not.

39:57.920 --> 39:58.920
It's not all right.

39:58.920 --> 39:59.920
That's what we're saying.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.920
Well, regardless, I'm glad you guys were here to help me brainstorm.

40:02.920 --> 40:05.920
Because these celebrities, they who do these notes have apologies.

40:05.920 --> 40:07.920
They do have full PR teams.

40:07.920 --> 40:09.920
And we don't have that kind of luxury.

40:09.920 --> 40:10.920
You, not we.

40:10.920 --> 40:11.920
You keep saying we.

40:11.920 --> 40:12.920
I don't want to be able to do.

40:12.920 --> 40:13.920
Yeah.

40:13.920 --> 40:14.920
Because also this kind of supposed is that something like that.

40:14.920 --> 40:15.920
So you have a PR team or something.

40:15.920 --> 40:16.920
No, I don't.

40:16.920 --> 40:17.920
Exactly.

40:17.920 --> 40:18.920
So we don't have that luxury.

40:18.920 --> 40:20.920
But we don't have any skeletons in our closet.

40:20.920 --> 40:24.920
I also want to clarify that even though it sounds nice, I'm not really a part of

40:24.920 --> 40:25.920
your support system.

40:25.920 --> 40:26.920
Oh.

40:26.920 --> 40:27.920
Okay.

40:27.920 --> 40:28.920
So I'm.

40:28.920 --> 40:29.920
Okay.

40:29.920 --> 40:30.920
Fuck.

40:30.920 --> 40:33.920
This is like a real kicking teeth.

40:33.920 --> 40:34.920
But teeth.

40:34.920 --> 40:35.920
Yeah.

40:35.920 --> 40:36.920
But it's nice.

40:36.920 --> 40:37.920
Yeah.

40:37.920 --> 40:38.920
It's not nice.

40:38.920 --> 40:43.920
You're on the verge of tears.

40:43.920 --> 40:44.920
This is.

40:44.920 --> 40:49.920
I think we should probably cut to a break.

40:49.920 --> 40:50.920
We did this again.

40:50.920 --> 40:51.920
We did this last week.

40:51.920 --> 40:52.920
I've never done it.

40:52.920 --> 40:53.920
But now we're doing it two weeks in a row.

40:53.920 --> 40:54.920
Let's just kind of regroup.

40:54.920 --> 40:55.920
And we'll come back and wrap this up.

40:55.920 --> 40:56.920
Okay.

40:56.920 --> 40:57.920
So fuck.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.920
Guys, you know my problem with edibles.

41:05.920 --> 41:08.920
Sometimes you get so high.

41:08.920 --> 41:11.920
I mean, it can really be difficult to control the dose.

41:11.920 --> 41:16.920
And there's nothing worse than being baked out of your mind when you didn't plan on it.

41:16.920 --> 41:18.920
And, you know, once you eat it, there's no going back.

41:18.920 --> 41:21.920
You just sit there, suffering, stone out of your mind.

41:21.920 --> 41:26.920
That's why when I need the perfect medium high, I hit up my friends at Diet's smoke.

41:26.920 --> 41:29.920
For their delicious Delta 8 THC gummies.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.920
So what is Delta 8?

41:31.920 --> 41:34.920
Delta 8 is a slightly less potent THC.

41:35.920 --> 41:38.920
The THC you're probably most familiar with is Delta 9.

41:38.920 --> 41:40.920
And while both are natural to the cannabis plant,

41:40.920 --> 41:43.920
Diet's smoke extracts their Delta 8 from hemp.

41:43.920 --> 41:45.920
Some may call this a loophole.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.920
I call it the secret recipe to getting a smooth, stable,

41:48.920 --> 41:51.920
and most importantly, legal high.

41:51.920 --> 41:53.920
Diet's smoke is legal in most states.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.920
And it's non-prescription.

41:55.920 --> 41:59.920
Just check Diet's smoke's website to see if they ship their delicious gummies to your state.

41:59.920 --> 42:02.920
Now you're probably asking yourself, does Diet's smoke really get you high?

42:03.920 --> 42:04.920
Of course!

42:04.920 --> 42:09.920
The high you get with Diet's smoke is best described as somewhere between the chillness of CBD

42:09.920 --> 42:13.920
and that classic stone feeling you get with regular weed.

42:13.920 --> 42:16.920
Diet's smoke isn't light, it's just right.

42:16.920 --> 42:18.920
Plus, Diet's smoke comes in two delicious flavors.

42:18.920 --> 42:20.920
Blue raspberry and watermelon.

42:20.920 --> 42:23.920
Now, I always love blue raspberry flavored things,

42:23.920 --> 42:25.920
but Marieka can't get enough of watermelon, man.

42:25.920 --> 42:27.920
I say try I'm both.

42:27.920 --> 42:33.920
Each gummy isn't fused with 10 milligrams of Delta 8 THC derived from American grown hemp.

42:33.920 --> 42:35.920
And you know what they say by American?

42:35.920 --> 42:37.920
Get high with American.

42:37.920 --> 42:42.920
Also, Diet's smoke's Delta 8 gummies are low in sugar, fat free, and delicious.

42:42.920 --> 42:44.920
And did I mention their legal?

42:44.920 --> 42:48.920
So when CBD isn't enough and traditional THC is too much,

42:48.920 --> 42:51.920
enjoy the smooth buzz of Diet's smoke.

43:16.920 --> 43:17.920
Let's go.

43:17.920 --> 43:26.920
Can you please?

43:26.920 --> 43:35.920
I'm back on the saddle baby.

43:35.920 --> 43:39.920
Apologize, ready to go.

43:39.920 --> 43:44.920
What's the next way?

43:44.920 --> 43:45.920
Go!

43:45.920 --> 43:47.920
What's the next way you got?

43:47.920 --> 43:48.920
Let's go.

43:48.920 --> 43:50.920
What are you talking about?

43:50.920 --> 43:52.920
When we were testing the micro levels,

43:52.920 --> 43:55.920
you specifically said that you were not going to scream.

43:55.920 --> 43:56.920
Yeah.

43:56.920 --> 44:00.920
So I probably flipped pretty bad, but it'll be worth it.

44:00.920 --> 44:03.920
Oh my fucking God.

44:03.920 --> 44:06.920
It's been 40 minutes.

44:06.920 --> 44:10.920
Let's wrap things up.

44:10.920 --> 44:13.920
Plugs, Gianna, what are you going on?

44:13.920 --> 44:14.920
What do you want to point the people to?

44:14.920 --> 44:18.920

44:18.920 --> 44:20.920
Spell that out for the people.

44:20.920 --> 44:22.920
I'm going to fucking spell it out.

44:22.920 --> 44:24.920
You bet you're as I'm going to spell it out.

44:24.920 --> 44:25.920
Okay.

44:25.920 --> 44:26.920
I'm trying and the break.

44:26.920 --> 44:27.920
Teared up.

44:27.920 --> 44:28.920
Yeah.

44:28.920 --> 44:29.920
A little back.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.920
I'm ready for another 50 minutes of this show.

44:32.920 --> 44:33.920

Proposed marriage to the comments.

44:42.920 --> 44:43.920
It's true the comments.

44:43.920 --> 44:44.920
Yeah.

44:44.920 --> 44:45.920
I'll do that.

44:45.920 --> 44:46.920
Two me in the comments.

44:46.920 --> 44:49.920
And we should say you're in a gainfully employed relationship.

44:49.920 --> 44:50.920
You're not going to do that.

44:50.920 --> 44:51.920
No.

44:51.920 --> 44:52.920
I'm not going to say anything back.

44:52.920 --> 44:57.920
But I think it's a little, it's, it's a little game that we have gone on.

44:57.920 --> 44:58.920
People enjoy it.

44:58.920 --> 44:59.920
Okay.

44:59.920 --> 45:00.920
Sure.

45:00.920 --> 45:01.920
If that's the bit that you're going to go with.

45:01.920 --> 45:02.920
Dog and play the show.

45:02.920 --> 45:03.920
This cat and mouse game.

45:03.920 --> 45:05.920
Proposed marriage in the comments.

45:05.920 --> 45:06.920
Yeah.

45:06.920 --> 45:08.920
Especially the women who listen to this podcast.

45:08.920 --> 45:09.920
Yes.

45:09.920 --> 45:10.920
Especially the women.

45:11.920 --> 45:13.920
You have to say my name first.

45:13.920 --> 45:14.920
Gianni.

45:14.920 --> 45:17.920
I'm motioned with my eyes because we're in the same room.

45:17.920 --> 45:18.920
Okay.

45:18.920 --> 45:19.920
Finally.

45:19.920 --> 45:21.920

45:21.920 --> 45:23.920

45:28.920 --> 45:30.920
Where my notes have a apology?

45:30.920 --> 45:31.920
Might be.

45:31.920 --> 45:33.920
You're going to post it?

45:33.920 --> 45:34.920
Probably.

45:34.920 --> 45:35.920
Probably.

45:35.920 --> 45:38.920
We should post the amended version and it's even worse.

45:39.920 --> 45:40.920
So yeah.

45:40.920 --> 45:41.920
Go check out Gianni's Instagram.

45:41.920 --> 45:42.920
That's also my plug.

45:42.920 --> 45:43.920
Is that Gianni V.

45:43.920 --> 45:45.920
Your memes are hilarious.

45:45.920 --> 45:46.920
Thank you.

45:46.920 --> 45:47.920
I appreciate that.

45:47.920 --> 45:48.920
No shade on Gianni.

45:48.920 --> 45:49.920
But also like.

45:49.920 --> 45:50.920
You don't post memes.

45:50.920 --> 45:51.920
Yeah.

45:51.920 --> 45:54.920
I actually am considering unfollowing the meme accounts that I follow.

45:54.920 --> 45:55.920
I think they're.

45:55.920 --> 45:58.920
They flood my feed and it's too much.

45:58.920 --> 45:59.920
Yeah.

45:59.920 --> 46:00.920
And they're not ever funny.

46:00.920 --> 46:01.920
Or things that I need to be a part of.

46:01.920 --> 46:02.920
I feel like anymore.

46:02.920 --> 46:03.920
I feel like it's a good.

46:03.920 --> 46:05.920
I do follow a lot of accounts.

46:05.920 --> 46:07.920
I follow a lot of bad meme accounts.

46:07.920 --> 46:08.920
Yeah.

46:08.920 --> 46:09.920
Because I think it's just good to see.

46:09.920 --> 46:11.920
Like, oh, the people are laughing at these things.

46:11.920 --> 46:13.920
Like, that's what it says me off.

46:13.920 --> 46:14.920
I think about it.

46:14.920 --> 46:17.920
Is that like, I'm just like, this isn't anything.

46:17.920 --> 46:19.920
Like, we were just talking about this.

46:19.920 --> 46:23.920
I feel like last weekend was like of NBA Twitter and NBA Instagram of just like,

46:23.920 --> 46:29.920
Lebron kind of has a misstep or like steal somebody's like water.

46:29.920 --> 46:31.920
And then gives it back to them two seconds later.

46:31.920 --> 46:33.920
And everybody's like 10 crylap emojis.

46:33.920 --> 46:35.920
They're like straight comedy.

46:35.920 --> 46:37.920
And I'm like, no, it's not.

46:37.920 --> 46:39.920
He's kind of goofy.

46:39.920 --> 46:43.920
But if he was in a room with normal people and wasn't the best basketball player of all time,

46:43.920 --> 46:45.920
nobody would think that's funny and it's not.

46:45.920 --> 46:47.920
That's what I think that's why it's so.

46:47.920 --> 46:48.920
It's so funny.

46:48.920 --> 46:49.920
That is like a metal level.

46:49.920 --> 46:50.920
On a metal level.

46:50.920 --> 46:51.920
Yeah.

46:51.920 --> 46:52.920
And then the metaverse.

46:52.920 --> 46:53.920
Yeah.

46:53.920 --> 46:54.920
Yeah.

46:54.920 --> 46:55.920
Yeah.

46:55.920 --> 46:56.920
We've been to the metaverse.

46:56.920 --> 46:57.920
Yeah.

46:57.920 --> 46:58.920
Nobody knew who you were.

46:58.920 --> 46:59.920
The metaverse.

46:59.920 --> 47:01.920
That's so cool.

47:01.920 --> 47:02.920
That's true.

47:02.920 --> 47:04.920
Why did that actually resonate?

47:05.920 --> 47:07.920
That was like fuck.

47:07.920 --> 47:10.920
That's what you said in Lebron and he really affects him.

47:10.920 --> 47:11.920
Yeah.

47:11.920 --> 47:14.920
No, I think you've seen footage of the metaverse, right?

47:14.920 --> 47:15.920
Yeah.

47:15.920 --> 47:16.920
It's janky as fuck.

47:16.920 --> 47:17.920
It is.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.920
Have you seen the grocery shopping video?

47:19.920 --> 47:20.920
No, I love that.

47:20.920 --> 47:22.920
Oh, we can create an entire great world.

47:22.920 --> 47:25.920
And then you're doing the same old shit you can't afford the grocery.

47:25.920 --> 47:27.920
It makes no sense.

47:27.920 --> 47:30.920
It looks the graphics are horrible.

47:30.920 --> 47:33.920
This is what companies are delving.

47:33.920 --> 47:34.920
Billions of dollars.

47:34.920 --> 47:36.920
It's also just VR.

47:36.920 --> 47:39.920
Like they're acting like it's this groundbreaking technology.

47:39.920 --> 47:40.920
And it's just VR.

47:40.920 --> 47:45.920
And I got a little fucking VR headset for Christmas when I was like 15.

47:45.920 --> 47:46.920
Yeah.

47:46.920 --> 47:52.920
I hung out with Marika in a VR chat room in like 20, 20.

47:52.920 --> 47:54.920
And Nike putting money into that experience.

47:54.920 --> 47:55.920
I can't imagine that.

47:55.920 --> 47:56.920
Yeah.

47:56.920 --> 47:57.920
I mean, no, no shade to Marika.

47:57.920 --> 47:59.920
But that was one of the worst experiences.

48:00.920 --> 48:02.920
I saw an article.

48:02.920 --> 48:05.920
And I don't mean to keep us going for this.

48:05.920 --> 48:07.920
Oh, I'll cut this out, but yeah.

48:07.920 --> 48:08.920
Okay.

48:08.920 --> 48:09.920
So it'll be a tight product.

48:09.920 --> 48:11.920
But you can spew nonsense.

48:11.920 --> 48:12.920
Yeah.

48:12.920 --> 48:13.920
All right.

48:13.920 --> 48:14.920
Whatever.

48:14.920 --> 48:15.920
I've read an article.

48:15.920 --> 48:17.920
That was saying that Facebook or sorry.

48:17.920 --> 48:19.920
I should address it by it's new name now.

48:19.920 --> 48:20.920
Meta meta.

48:20.920 --> 48:26.920
Meta just patented a technology that will track your eyes.

48:26.920 --> 48:32.920
And also the way your body moves in VR in the VR space to serve you ads,

48:32.920 --> 48:33.920
which is insane.

48:33.920 --> 48:34.920
That's awful.

48:34.920 --> 48:35.920
Yeah.

48:35.920 --> 48:36.920
It's literally so crazy.

48:36.920 --> 48:39.920
So like I guess if you like move a specific type of way,

48:39.920 --> 48:43.920
like you'll get ads recommended based on that.

48:43.920 --> 48:46.920
So I guess like if you move like you have like joint pain.

48:46.920 --> 48:47.920
Yeah.

48:47.920 --> 48:48.920
Like the fuck.

48:48.920 --> 48:50.920
If you limp when you move,

48:50.920 --> 48:53.920
there was actually this woman in England.

48:53.920 --> 48:58.920
I think probably like in the late 80s early 90s,

48:58.920 --> 48:59.920
I think.

48:59.920 --> 49:04.920
And she patents in the Robert.

49:04.920 --> 49:05.920
She was.

49:05.920 --> 49:06.920
No.

49:06.920 --> 49:07.920
It's just.

49:07.920 --> 49:09.920
I guess so much for listening to this episode of the head

49:09.920 --> 49:13.920
come podcast will be back again next Friday again with the weight bands.

49:13.920 --> 49:15.920
And this was great.

49:15.920 --> 49:16.920
I think we all had a great time.

49:16.920 --> 49:17.920
Especially at the end.

49:17.920 --> 49:19.920
The ending was probably the worst part.

49:19.920 --> 49:20.920
Yeah.

49:20.920 --> 49:21.920
I agree.

49:21.920 --> 49:22.920
Thank you.

49:22.920 --> 49:23.920
No.

49:23.920 --> 49:24.920
No.

49:24.920 --> 49:25.920
No.

49:25.920 --> 49:26.920
No.

49:26.920 --> 49:28.920
No.

49:28.920 --> 49:30.920
No.

49:30.920 --> 49:32.920
No.

49:32.920 --> 49:33.920
No.

49:33.920 --> 49:34.920
No.

49:34.920 --> 49:35.920
No.

49:35.920 --> 49:36.920
No.

49:36.920 --> 49:37.920
No.

49:37.920 --> 49:38.920
No.

49:38.920 --> 49:39.920
No.

49:39.920 --> 49:40.920
No.

49:40.920 --> 49:42.920
No.

49:42.920 --> 49:45.920
That was a hit thumb originally.

49:52.920 --> 49:54.920
You

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Right, I love that song.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
It's funny it kind of grows on you.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
When I first heard it, I was like, what is this garbage?

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
What is this?

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Right.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Yeah.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Like these obviously aren't train studio musicians.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
These are amateurs.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
And this is this show is not an amateur hour.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
This is a professional podcast.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
We got to do it.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
That's true.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Backed by network, which is back by a tech platform,

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
which is back by eating square ventures.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
And I think it's the perfect time to announce Casey and I set.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Hello?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Are you kidding me?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
No, I'm not doing anything important.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I'm going to see drink it.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I could.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
How long is this going to go?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
It's like 45 to 50 minutes.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Let's play in like five.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
Or plan on me playing with you in like five minutes.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
I think he's.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
I'm trying to sketch it out.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
I have an appointment.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Or something just came up.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Emergency.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
You could hear the whole thing.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Obviously.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
You didn't meet yourself.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
You asked.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
You're playing.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
You said in five minutes.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
In five minutes.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
What are you playing?

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
I got to go into the metaphors for a second.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Something went wrong on this.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
On the mini golf course.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
There's no way.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
This sucks to start.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Keep it all in.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
People love to hear how the sausage gets played.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
What happened to our fourth.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Fourth guest.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
I feel like we were going to have Kayla Mori already on the show.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
She's at a dentist appointment.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Which there's nothing more important than dental hygiene.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I'm sorry to say.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
So that's a valid excuse.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Going into the metaphors is not.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Okay.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Should we have a surprise guest instead?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Who's the most famous person in your context?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Maybe Rick Fox.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
But I don't really talk to him that much anymore.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Let's get him on.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
That'd be good.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
I feel bad because it would be kind of like a favor.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
We haven't really spoken in years.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
How to be a favor.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
This goes out to like 40,000 people a week or something like that.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
But he's really famous.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
So that doesn't mean anything to him.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Was really famous.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Yeah.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
What is he doing now?

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
What have you done for me recently, Rick?

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Well, this is why I kind of don't want to write them on to the show.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Because I feel like a antagonistic attitude.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Who's the next most famous?

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Ooh.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Maybe Finn Wolfhard?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Yeah.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
He's been on the show.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I think you're closer to him than I am.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Yeah.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
But I think he'd get more excited if you called.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
That's really true.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
And then we're down to like Riley.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
That's a big jump.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Riley's third.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
What about Ben Schwartz?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
He blocked me.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Oh, what about?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I can DM with Rose.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
All these people blocked me.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
What about Cohen?

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Cohen's the CEO of this company.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
That's.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
He's also.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
He also doesn't want to be on Mike.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
That's true.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
That could be interesting.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Oh, really?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
My cousin.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
My brother.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Fuck.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Oh.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
I follow Adrian Wojnorowski on Twitter.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
That's not knowing someone.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
He doesn't follow you back.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
So you can't send him a DM.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
There's no way for you to contact Woj.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
This is also probably the busiest day of this year.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
And be free to just start a little over 12 hours ago.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
I can see that.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Caleb.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
I think he's at the airport right now or on a plane.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
All right.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Just some options.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
We don't need to do a pre-pro meeting during the podcast, but could be interesting.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Well, we never do pre-pro.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I do all the fucking prep work.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
And then Marieka sort of cleans up the slack on the back end.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
What do you do?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
On the slack end.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
I show up on the day having had.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
You always show up with a full stomach so that you can focus.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
I show up groggy and full.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Let's start here.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
Having done this show for over two years, I think.

04:59.000 --> 05:08.000
Have you guys, what's the shortest amount of time between the when you came and then joined the record to be on the show?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
When we what?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Had an orgasm.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Two completion in a way.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Let's just start there.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Why would we remember that?

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
You preface this by we've been doing this for two years.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
That is actually very valid.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
I was worried you guys were going to come up with like, oh, let's not talk about this.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
You know, that's too personal information.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
What you just said.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Definitely that.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
What?

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
But also, but also, I don't understand how you'd expect us.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
To remember something like that over a two year period.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Yeah.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I mean, just ballpark it would be good.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
I know.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
A day?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Why?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
You asked me the fucking guest.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
Why does that one always stop the show when it's tracks?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I mean, it's nothing.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
I was taking a sip of coke.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
It's gibberish.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
Um.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
I don't want to answer that question.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
It feels too invasive, especially when you guys aren't sharing in a vulnerability

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
with me, a group mind, a high view vulnerable.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
You asked us, right?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Yeah.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
And then you barely answered.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
I think he answered a lot actually.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Like he answered the question.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Maria?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
To the best of his ability.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
I'm not going to answer the question.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
You know, it could be fun.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
Do you guys ever read the comments the last week's episode on this week's episode?

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
Maria, could you want to go to the YouTube page and pull out some choice comments?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
That's really fun.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
There's some good ones in there.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Sure.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Yeah.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
In the meantime, let's hit me with your bonds the week.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
By the way, that's an inception sound effect.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
I don't know why I chose that for Bond of the week.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Yeah.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
So clearly I could have done a 007.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
I'd watch a Chris Nolan Bond.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Hmm.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
My Bond of the week.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Um.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Oh my god.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Where did it go?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Great.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Great.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Got the second minute.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Here we go.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Bond of the week.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Um.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
I just saw a production of Hamlet last night starring Alex Lawther of.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Um.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
End of the fucking world.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
You said that you were last six days ago.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Yeah.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Subway to one day is the guy bought them 11 12 19.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
And the production obviously.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
It was re-scheduled because of COVID.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
And then I bought new tickets to the new production.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Those tickets got moved.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Like, location wise in the theater.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
And then my.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
A performance was canceled.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
Because one of the actors got injured with like an achilles heel injury.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
So then I had to reschedule it again.

08:25.000 --> 08:33.000
Schedule it again, but I finally saw it. It was perfect. It was beautiful. I love Alex Lothar. He's a small boy

08:34.360 --> 08:36.360
Just a frail little lad

08:37.000 --> 08:41.960
And so I want him to be bond. I think that would be fun. How old is he?

08:42.920 --> 08:44.920
27. Okay

08:48.840 --> 08:54.280
I mean, who's your bond of the absolute we Kevin Durant? Why?

08:55.480 --> 08:57.480
7 feet tall

08:57.480 --> 09:05.720
226 pounds soaking dry with a wit so dry you can only have it on high

09:06.600 --> 09:11.320
And as far as his weed intake, he's down to partake

09:12.040 --> 09:16.040
Imagine a bond that gets rip roaringly high

09:17.240 --> 09:23.480
You think that Kevin Durant should be the next James Bond because he gets high and eats dry

09:25.480 --> 09:30.520
He's also tall and skinny, which is kind of a cool look in his suit

09:32.680 --> 09:36.040
I guess he's stride would get him away from the other the bad guy

09:37.240 --> 09:43.000
I heard a weed intake as weed intake like dross weed and takes

09:44.120 --> 09:49.320
That you were saying he had really hot takes on me. So let's just talk packaging for a second

09:49.320 --> 09:54.760
It'll be just weed and directing bond and it'll be weed and steak on bond and then

09:54.840 --> 09:58.280
Kevin Durant KD easy money sniper will be

09:59.320 --> 10:05.800
Sort of increasing his weed intake as bond. Yeah, so the weed intake on the weed intake. What's that?

10:06.280 --> 10:09.400
Nothing sorry. What'd you say? I said shut up

10:14.040 --> 10:19.080
Just when you talk it's sort of great. I want to read some comments. Yeah, let's hear some comments. Thank god

10:19.240 --> 10:21.240
Um

10:21.800 --> 10:23.800
Huge sick. He's gone

10:25.400 --> 10:29.800
All right, I shouldn't do that. I didn't say that. I was about to say

10:32.200 --> 10:34.840
That's not your fucking mug

10:35.640 --> 10:37.640
Nazi

10:38.200 --> 10:40.200
Jesus

10:40.200 --> 10:44.920
I'll say it dabbing is still funny

10:46.040 --> 10:48.040
Hit him with a dab of air

10:49.480 --> 10:51.080
Oh

10:54.360 --> 11:06.120
Nice, we should have dab dab yeah double dip dab what was that even the dip dab was like you put a little catch up on your elbow

11:06.120 --> 11:08.360
And then you put a fry in your mouth and you go right

11:14.040 --> 11:17.400
What was that 2016 or 2017 answer fast

11:18.280 --> 11:20.280
2017 or 26

11:22.840 --> 11:24.840
You guys have to fight

11:25.800 --> 11:32.840
I mean should we look it up? Let's look it up. There's an answer was it on Instagram. Yeah. Yeah

11:34.200 --> 11:36.200
I'll look it up

11:38.120 --> 11:39.880
Because Jeff you interned

11:41.240 --> 11:45.400
Some of 2016 and then just stuck around for the rest of the time

11:47.480 --> 11:50.680
Let's see

11:54.360 --> 11:59.080
There's so many photos on here. That'll be kidding me

11:59.720 --> 12:03.960
This is valuable air time we've been doing for 2017. I'm here

12:05.240 --> 12:07.240
I just 26

12:08.520 --> 12:14.600
Did you say set 2017 for sure? No, I just guessed 2017. It 2016 felt a little early to me

12:15.560 --> 12:18.040
Oh, wait, okay, it is

12:19.640 --> 12:23.080
2012 holy show that we were five years off

12:25.160 --> 12:26.680
July 9

12:27.240 --> 12:32.840
2016 I see an image of a mirror holding a catch up bottle

12:35.000 --> 12:39.240
2016. What a time to be alive. Did I do it was a great year

12:39.800 --> 12:44.040
Do I look six to seven years younger in that picture or is it mostly similar

12:45.320 --> 12:47.320
um

12:47.960 --> 12:55.560
Yeah, six to seven years younger. Really? Can you send this to me? Wow. Yeah, I'll send it in the chat

12:58.120 --> 13:03.800
I don't know where the dipdev video is though. Yeah, that might be on Twitter. Hmm

13:04.040 --> 13:06.040
Oh

13:12.680 --> 13:14.680
Wild

13:14.680 --> 13:20.120
God yeah, all right, you know what? My bottom of the week is that Austin Butler

13:21.480 --> 13:24.440
Elvis yep, did you see Elvis?

13:25.160 --> 13:26.920
Have not seen Elvis. I've heard it's awful

13:29.080 --> 13:31.400
My thing with Austin Butler is

13:32.360 --> 13:37.560
seen a lot of tiktoks right of people like dissecting his voice that he did the Elvis thing and then now

13:37.560 --> 13:43.640
He stopped talking like Elvis which is fine and honestly cool that he lost himself in the role so much

13:43.960 --> 13:50.920
But it's time to get him out of that voice and I think that the only way is to give him another huge blockbuster role

13:51.320 --> 13:52.840
Where he has to

13:52.840 --> 13:58.440
Changes his voice because Elvis wouldn't do well as a double oh seven. I'm sorry to say he can't be like

13:59.400 --> 14:01.400
He was

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Sorry

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
I meant to start over the name was born

14:10.520 --> 14:12.520
James Bond

14:13.560 --> 14:17.880
I can't do the voice because I haven't spent three years preparing right right yeah

14:18.600 --> 14:22.680
What's the song that he's like in the good who right? He's like double loser

14:23.880 --> 14:25.880
I'm gonna kill myself

14:26.840 --> 14:29.800
I don't know enough about all this

14:31.320 --> 14:36.520
Or I can't do enough about Elvis but I do feel like I should see this movie because KC

14:36.920 --> 14:42.120
Producer KC and LA was radicalized by it. I think according to his letter boxed

14:42.840 --> 14:47.160
Did he like it or was he the one who said that it's time to admit that bad lyrman's not a good director?

14:48.040 --> 14:50.040
I love he find his reviews

14:51.480 --> 14:54.120
Because he saw he saw Elvis

14:55.080 --> 15:00.360
He liked and yeah, he saw Elvis and he liked it. He said let's see

15:01.720 --> 15:06.280
Well his review for Elvis was just I love this movie and all my friends hated it but then

15:07.000 --> 15:09.880
He watched the movie rush

15:10.200 --> 15:15.480
Which is about F1 yeah, and it's a dock you. I like a biopic type thing

15:17.240 --> 15:20.040
And hold on his review for that made me laugh really hard

15:20.680 --> 15:28.520
Because it was I'm fully into F1 now, so I watched this but I also just watched Elvis tonight and this movie is too normal and I got bored

15:33.880 --> 15:35.880
Yeah, I don't know

15:35.880 --> 15:41.320
Would you rather like a movie that everybody hated or hate a movie that everyone liked the first

15:41.880 --> 15:47.320
Because yeah, because when you're liking something yeah, but then everyone else hates it and they're like why do you like what is thing?

15:48.280 --> 15:52.360
It's better than feeling insane because you think something's bad

15:52.360 --> 15:57.240
Yeah, and I was just like it's good, which is how I feel a lot of the time

15:57.720 --> 16:00.040
That's how I felt about everything everywhere all at once. Oh

16:00.680 --> 16:06.360
Interesting you enjoyed I was an island man because I was like I thought it was good

16:07.080 --> 16:11.560
And I get why like I can understand why people like it and I don't feel insane

16:11.960 --> 16:18.360
I know that it's my hot take but that movie was 45 minutes too long and with the density of the material

16:18.680 --> 16:20.680
It really needed to be shorter

16:21.880 --> 16:24.600
Go on I don't know I think it was like

16:25.560 --> 16:32.040
It was fine the moral of the story was so simple that it didn't need the extra 45 minutes to get to that end

16:32.360 --> 16:38.920
Like when it's divided and chapters so you know how much longer there's going to be and then once it got to like all at once or whatever

16:39.080 --> 16:41.080
I was like there's another half hour

16:42.760 --> 16:48.040
But then like I went with my friend AJ and I was like here's like 20 thing and I was like I thought I was like

16:48.040 --> 16:50.840
Kind of went off on and he's like oh, I liked it and I was like I'm sorry

16:53.640 --> 17:00.840
Yeah, story story of my life like I really loved tenet and everyone a lot of people

17:02.120 --> 17:06.600
I feel fine. I feel fine in my love of tenet, but like I

17:07.560 --> 17:08.600
I

17:08.600 --> 17:15.160
I don't know what a reason one is that I hated I hated top god not maverick top and maverick good time

17:15.560 --> 17:19.400
Great vibes, but the original top god. I hated so much and

17:20.360 --> 17:22.040
felt insane

17:22.040 --> 17:24.040
Knowing that there's just people that love that movie

17:25.160 --> 17:27.160
Yeah

17:27.160 --> 17:29.640
Major killer if you don't like your title

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
You're entitled

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
to create a new one

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Right, you know

17:38.920 --> 17:44.040
I was gonna get to it. Yeah, I'm curious if you don't like your title you're entitled

17:44.600 --> 17:46.600
I don't want

17:46.600 --> 17:48.280
wondering what that means

17:48.280 --> 17:50.280
Meghan Markle

17:50.920 --> 17:54.200
Will now henceforth call herself white

17:55.400 --> 17:56.760
Say that again?

17:56.760 --> 17:59.080
Meghan Markle will call herself white

18:00.120 --> 18:02.680
How do you spell that P w i f e

18:03.560 --> 18:09.560
It's like that's her yeah, that's her name no that's her title

18:11.880 --> 18:14.280
It stands for polo wife

18:15.960 --> 18:17.960
polo

18:19.240 --> 18:21.240
meaning

18:23.720 --> 18:25.720
Hang up the sport

18:27.400 --> 18:29.400
Or the type of shirt

18:30.360 --> 18:35.320
I didn't do enough for the support. Do you didn't do enough you just did it seems like you just read a headline

18:36.520 --> 18:41.400
Getting to spend time together over these two months was so special she said in an Instagram caption

18:42.440 --> 18:47.880
I wish everyone knew the way you are. This is her sister. I guess my sister my now fellow

18:47.880 --> 18:50.040
Pwife polo wife

18:50.040 --> 18:53.720
Genius of you to come up with this cry laugh emoji

18:54.840 --> 18:56.840
I guess they play polo a lot

18:57.800 --> 18:59.800
So she's a fellow white

19:01.400 --> 19:08.520
Basically it was it was Markle's you know version of what I like to call a new name alert which is when you tell people hey

19:08.760 --> 19:11.640
I'm changing my name you may now refer to me. It's us

19:12.680 --> 19:17.240
I was wondering if you guys wanted to hit us with a new name alert which is similar to a major killer

19:17.240 --> 19:22.040
And I don't have a sound for it. So I'll just go new name alert. I'm thinking Desmond

19:22.600 --> 19:30.680
For her for me. We're always are oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, it's quite a weird Instagram, right? Rodney's played out. It's still will be

19:31.160 --> 19:35.160
But I'm wondering how Desmond might fit me

19:38.840 --> 19:40.840
I want both of you to die

19:44.760 --> 19:49.720
I don't think the names are bad man. I'm sorry you want us dead

19:49.800 --> 19:55.800
You want to kill yourself you're having a rough go of it. The Rodney the Desmond they're all not good

19:56.360 --> 19:59.080
Jeff is fine. I don't think you can pull it off

20:01.160 --> 20:03.160
Desmond no

20:03.560 --> 20:06.760
I think you have the balls too and I think you have the gals too

20:07.640 --> 20:09.640
I have the gals stones

20:11.240 --> 20:13.240
Sea kelp

20:13.640 --> 20:19.560
Just like I'm I'm gonna strike a pose and then you guys just in your mind think of me. Oh my god. There goes Desmond

20:20.200 --> 20:22.200
Okay

20:23.640 --> 20:25.000
No

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Mama there goes that does I

20:29.880 --> 20:31.880
Think you could be like a

20:32.680 --> 20:34.680
Lysha

20:34.680 --> 20:35.880
No

20:35.880 --> 20:37.880
Absolutely not

20:37.880 --> 20:40.520
What about um, what about Jeff Fetterman?

20:44.120 --> 20:46.120
Is that a middle name or a last

20:46.840 --> 20:54.680
Is it hyphenated? That's a last you know like some married couples are like oh instead of like taking your name or vice versa or a hyphenating

20:54.920 --> 20:56.600
Let's just create a new last name

20:56.600 --> 20:58.600
Never really

21:00.440 --> 21:03.480
Well, I was thinking I could do that as a single man

21:04.120 --> 21:06.120
Jeff Fetterman

21:08.040 --> 21:09.720
Um, I don't think you need you

21:10.840 --> 21:14.520
You guys come up with something then this is hard. I think I feel like

21:16.200 --> 21:24.200
Reading YouTube comments. No, I mean you guys never but the new name for you instead of a mirror what if it was fucking

21:26.760 --> 21:28.760
Me second

21:33.640 --> 21:35.640
What about

21:37.240 --> 21:40.920
The best you could do is a rod trick broad trick

21:40.920 --> 21:42.920
uh

21:43.320 --> 21:45.320
Like Matthew

21:45.560 --> 21:53.320
Actually that could be good for america if it's BR-O-A-D Rick so you it's like your Rick for sure

21:53.560 --> 21:55.560
But you're also a broad a damn

21:56.600 --> 21:58.600
broad Rick

22:02.760 --> 22:04.760
Jeff I think you should be

22:06.200 --> 22:08.200
No, with one for when you

22:09.240 --> 22:14.040
No, not to but I think you could be like a wind threat

22:15.480 --> 22:17.320
A wind threat

22:17.320 --> 22:18.840
wind drop

22:18.840 --> 22:24.200
Yeah, but don't say it like that. I don't want hop in my name nobody wants to have a hop

22:27.000 --> 22:31.400
What about a wind drop head so I changed my name to wind drop and then I'm like

22:32.440 --> 22:34.440
the LA times newest opinion writer

22:38.040 --> 22:40.040
Easter egg

22:40.520 --> 22:43.480
We do have to take a short break. This is just

22:44.440 --> 22:46.760
Brad's yeah, yeah, we don't know

22:53.800 --> 22:56.280
And now a word from our sponsor better help

22:57.080 --> 23:02.200
Guys you can take care of your mind in so many ways whether that's getting active

23:02.840 --> 23:07.400
resting and relaxing seeing friends and family taking a long walk

23:08.360 --> 23:13.880
And how well would you take care of your car if you had to keep the same one for your entire life

23:14.440 --> 23:17.800
Right? That's how our brains work. So why don't we treat them that way?

23:18.440 --> 23:25.000
How we care for our minds affects how we experience life so it's important to invest time and care into keeping them healthy

23:25.560 --> 23:31.000
There are plenty of ways to support a healthy brain like learning a new language or taking power naps

23:31.000 --> 23:34.120
And there's also better help online therapy

23:34.600 --> 23:36.600
I go to therapy every week

23:36.840 --> 23:40.040
Makes me a better person not that this show is any indication

23:40.920 --> 23:46.040
And I think everybody who has access to it and better help makes it easier should be in therapy

23:46.280 --> 23:50.520
So you can show up for those around you in a better healthier happier way

23:51.160 --> 23:56.680
Better help is online therapy that offers video phone and even live chat sessions with your therapist

23:56.680 --> 24:00.920
So you don't have to see anybody on camera if you don't want to it's also much more affordable than in person therapy

24:01.000 --> 24:03.800
And you can be matched with a therapist in under 48 hours

24:04.360 --> 24:06.440
So guys if you're going through something or not

24:07.000 --> 24:09.960
Reach out you could have your first therapy session this week

24:10.840 --> 24:15.480
Listeners of the headgon podcast also get 10% off their first month at better help.com slash what's that?

24:16.040 --> 24:17.160

24:38.680 --> 24:44.120
Just as if you can't hold it you just pissed yourself also way too comfortable being yourself

26:55.080 --> 26:57.960
No, you only have one option here we go

26:59.240 --> 27:02.440
Listen a lot of what we talk about on the show is not interesting to me

27:03.000 --> 27:05.720
Right, so I thought that we could switch things up this week

27:06.680 --> 27:10.600
This is a game four five hundred dollars cash and you keep it

27:11.480 --> 27:13.480
I'm not even fucking joking this time

27:14.600 --> 27:19.880
I am in the process of moving which is very expensive so if you want to send it back that'd be welcome

27:19.880 --> 27:21.880
But it's up to you this time

27:21.880 --> 27:25.160
I'm gonna always up to us yeah

27:31.560 --> 27:34.120
I would have kicked your ass if we went to the same high school

27:35.080 --> 27:38.760
We went to the same high school. It was just 21 years apart really

27:42.440 --> 27:47.480
I'm gonna set a timer and one like individually you guys are gonna have to keep me interested

27:48.040 --> 27:51.720

27:52.440 --> 27:58.920
I will say much like an eBay bidding war there is a reserve if you don't make it past two minutes

27:59.320 --> 28:01.320
You don't get any cash ready

28:01.400 --> 28:04.200

Right, I think we can all agree that round was a wash

28:24.760 --> 28:29.160
We're supposed to say things that are interesting you're supposed to regale us

28:30.120 --> 28:36.520
Be a racon tour for once in your goddamn life. You wonder why true TV passed on three pilots from your ass

28:36.840 --> 28:39.320
It's cuz you can't keep people in the room

28:41.720 --> 28:43.720
Executives

28:43.720 --> 28:45.720
Focus groups

28:45.720 --> 28:53.400
Network testing it all went to shit and now's your chance to redeem your ass. There's no way this will redeem me

Can it be

29:16.680 --> 29:18.680
I lost it just

29:18.920 --> 29:20.920
It's supposed to be sort of a monologue

29:21.560 --> 29:24.280
Let's tell us that was not that was not conveyed

29:28.840 --> 29:34.440

Part cheesy

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
What are these three games having common

29:43.080 --> 29:57.000

30:01.160 --> 30:08.040
What do you think racers goes so well with cheese again? It's all the same thing

30:08.440 --> 30:12.200
It's all the noises of the words more so than you know

30:13.080 --> 30:19.640
Yeah, so for example, I want to make a sandwich or even a deck of cards

30:20.040 --> 30:27.080
What are you starting with two slices of four clubs a turkey club, right? It's all right same

30:28.680 --> 30:33.400
And in between that what's that what's that same same

30:34.680 --> 30:40.360
Lost me I'm sorry, but the time to beat is a minute you can still win without getting cash

30:40.600 --> 30:42.760
We are in round three final round

30:43.240 --> 30:49.240
Marika monologue. I cannot answer questions, but you can keep me interested. I think three two one go

30:50.600 --> 30:53.800
Vin Diesel works the room just absolutely unhinged

30:53.800 --> 30:56.440
And they're coming off of Vin Diesel here

30:57.160 --> 31:05.800
Like late show staffers like they're in the fast family claiming that James Gordon is conquered America and hinting at secret three

31:05.800 --> 31:11.320
I am songs he in court and recorded in his home studio which by the way if you haven't listened to Vin Diesel

31:11.320 --> 31:13.320
Sogots insane

31:13.320 --> 31:17.800
When his new music coming feel like I do can't be the song of the summer three years in a row

31:18.280 --> 31:23.800
The book is really London has been phenomenal by the way only tremeous folks for the big live audience

31:28.040 --> 31:30.360
Are you reading an article? Yeah, of course

31:30.840 --> 31:32.840
Vulture

31:32.840 --> 31:35.880
The biggest quarry case personality has to be original

31:36.680 --> 31:42.440
It obviously has to be original obviously never is qualified disqualified

31:44.520 --> 31:47.960
All right, I'm you're already won, but let's see if you can get to the two minutes it takes to get met

31:48.520 --> 31:50.280
$500 to

31:50.280 --> 31:52.280
three two one

31:52.920 --> 31:56.600
Let's play a game me versus myself and I

31:57.080 --> 32:04.600
A one one on one. I'm gonna think of any number in between in one and 50 and I have to guess it

32:06.360 --> 32:08.840
Okay, ready. This is so boring. 47

32:09.720 --> 32:12.520
What's up the number plus it was 44

32:13.720 --> 32:15.720
29

32:15.720 --> 32:17.720
What's that because I didn't think of it

32:18.520 --> 32:23.320
I'm trying to I'm trying to guess what I thought of two seconds ago, but I already forgot what it was 42

32:26.680 --> 32:34.680
You had me you had me in the first half not gonna lie those sort of a game. Yeah, yeah, and I like that you were playing against what was it you yourself and I

32:35.400 --> 32:37.080
But um

32:37.080 --> 32:42.760
You kind of got to you real bit Marie, but you can't let these distractions because when you're out in the real world when you're in the pitching room

32:42.760 --> 32:46.680
When you're in the writers room people are gonna be distracting you on purpose so that you don't get what you want

32:47.960 --> 32:49.960
So you need to be able to take those punches on the chin

32:50.600 --> 32:56.200
I just think you're a board little man

33:03.320 --> 33:05.320
Nothing interests you for long

33:06.520 --> 33:08.520
And that's you are interesting

33:09.640 --> 33:11.640
For all for at all

33:15.240 --> 33:17.240
That fucking hurt take here

33:58.280 --> 34:01.080

Glass half full which is positive

35:42.600 --> 35:51.000

Kayla nice, but she bailed so it's like bail as her nickname. Okay

36:53.640 --> 36:56.520
Sorry, let me cute this up should have done this in the at break honestly

36:57.400 --> 37:03.240
Yeah, or um all right, so this is again. Yeah, like I said an Instagram deep dive on your guys

37:03.240 --> 37:09.320
It's stuff maybe stuff that you didn't remember you'd posted stuff that might get you in trouble in a couple seconds here

37:10.280 --> 37:12.280
Let's start with the mirror

37:14.120 --> 37:16.120
Care to explain

37:16.120 --> 37:20.680
Travel changes to you. Oh, this is fake. It's not fake

37:21.480 --> 37:23.480
It's taken from June 18

37:23.960 --> 37:25.960
Pretty recent also

37:26.520 --> 37:28.520
That's a picture of me

37:29.160 --> 37:32.520
In Moscow now

37:32.520 --> 37:38.120
Now that was me in Winnipeg you photo-shopped it and you placed me in Russia recently

37:38.440 --> 37:43.480
Travel changes you as you move through life in the world you change things slightly you leave marks

37:43.960 --> 37:50.520
Behind however small in in return by the way that's an Anthony boarding quote and you did not credit him

37:51.080 --> 37:54.840
I didn't write that you this whole thing this whole thing is photo shots. I never

38:00.680 --> 38:02.680
I didn't post that

38:03.400 --> 38:11.080
I'm trying logic to me. Not really. Yes, it is you just you it's on it's on the web people can see it and you're still saying

38:11.480 --> 38:13.080
This doesn't exist

38:13.080 --> 38:20.520
It exists be yeah because you photos. It exists. I know that's exactly right. I'm gonna edit the second part of that sentence out it exists and you did that

38:21.240 --> 38:23.240
Maria, what are your thoughts you just don't want to work here

38:24.360 --> 38:30.680
Why would you quit based on why would she work for a rush a sympathizer

38:32.760 --> 38:34.760
I

38:37.080 --> 38:42.760
Don't well, I mean first of all the screenshot that you have shows me liking this photo, so

38:43.320 --> 38:46.600
I logic if I

38:46.840 --> 38:52.280
I find what's the photo, but I don't remember this photo being posted. I do remember a

38:52.840 --> 38:56.040
Photo from me are wearing that outfit in a different location

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Winnipeg Canada

38:59.240 --> 39:04.760
Well, let's take a deeper dive into Marieka's Instagram

39:06.360 --> 39:08.360
Do it

39:11.400 --> 39:13.400
Mayus

39:14.920 --> 39:16.920
Care to explain

39:18.520 --> 39:22.200
What's the caption say when it post for the nuncheon nasties

39:26.840 --> 39:28.840
Was it a date on this

39:29.400 --> 39:34.920
Yeah, the date couldn't be neatly. Sorry. I think it was January 6th or 7. Oh

39:35.800 --> 39:37.800
2016 no

39:40.760 --> 39:42.760
Yeah, this is not basically Photoshop

39:44.120 --> 39:48.040
A photo of me pretty comfortable birthday at the insurrection

39:49.560 --> 39:55.560
But I'm kind of like in the corner it looks like I would have been on like someone's head or something

39:55.560 --> 39:58.760
Well, it looks like you're having the time your life and that's what I think you should with because

39:58.840 --> 40:01.640
This was as you said an insurrection this was in it

40:01.640 --> 40:04.440
Yeah, mm-hmm and attempted coup of the government

40:04.840 --> 40:06.840
I'm really tall

40:07.240 --> 40:09.240
Acuda the tata

40:09.240 --> 40:11.240
There's no worries

40:11.240 --> 40:13.240
After January 6

40:15.880 --> 40:20.680
Yeah, I don't know. I mean I could definitely like proof where I was on January 6

40:21.240 --> 40:22.760
Um

40:22.760 --> 40:27.320
Melting into this I'm never seen her. She's barely in the frame anymore

40:29.320 --> 40:37.080
She's Alex Mac turning into a puddle of liquid before our very eyes you know when people are always like I'm a trained police officer

40:37.080 --> 40:39.080
I know how to read people

40:39.080 --> 40:40.920
I don't talk to cop. You don't

40:41.640 --> 40:48.040
That's good, but I was gonna say I don't even have to be trained which whatever to know that you're lying because you're melting

40:48.600 --> 40:50.600
Like you're actually lying

40:51.000 --> 40:57.400
The weight could weight which of head gummies. What's good? Oh, it's rude. Um, yeah, obviously it was and then Kayla

40:58.760 --> 41:00.760
That was similar. Yeah, I see

41:02.200 --> 41:09.080
The crown at 50 Bowery Kayla sunset and my best friend and then who's that exactly? That's Ezra Miller

41:09.080 --> 41:15.240
Who's been accused of assaulting people physically at bars throughout the world for the better part of a decade. I see

41:15.560 --> 41:17.560
So this is not a good look for Moriarty

41:19.560 --> 41:21.560
And I you have to assume that

41:22.280 --> 41:23.800
Ezra

41:23.800 --> 41:29.480
Punch somebody at this bar in Kayla beard witness to it and post for a photo in smiled

41:32.520 --> 41:33.800
Uh

41:34.360 --> 41:36.360
I'm not gonna assume that

41:36.920 --> 41:40.200
Then I did tell her that I would defend her honor

41:41.160 --> 41:44.600
I don't believe she's friends with Ezra Miller. I also like

41:46.280 --> 41:53.320
I feel wasn't he in Hawaii for a decent amount of this time out know how he would have gotten to the crown at 50 Bowery

41:54.760 --> 41:55.960
Um

41:55.960 --> 41:59.800
They've a lot of money. She's they can go anywhere in the world. She's never she's never mentioned

42:00.760 --> 42:05.400
Being best friends with Ezra Miller and I feel you know Kayla

42:05.560 --> 42:12.920
Kayla's pretty humble, right? So I don't think that she would come out at a gate swinging. Hey, I'm friends with one of the stars of a perks of being a wallflower

42:15.160 --> 42:18.920
Uh, I do feel like she would call that out if that were the case

42:19.560 --> 42:23.960
Um, I feel like she talks about some of her other friends enough. So

42:25.080 --> 42:27.320
Yeah, I'm gonna go at this is also a photo shot

42:29.080 --> 42:31.080
You guys aren't any fun

That was a good segment

45:47.960 --> 45:49.960
Yeah, thank you

45:49.960 --> 45:51.960
Thank you guys. Oh, yeah

45:53.640 --> 45:55.640
Stop

45:55.640 --> 45:57.640
I was kind of like with us fine

45:59.640 --> 46:04.040
Yeah, I didn't like the rules of the monologueing keep your interest one

46:04.840 --> 46:07.640
So it felt like all of my ideas that every turn were

46:08.760 --> 46:11.160
Throwing back at me and I was just qualified for them

46:14.760 --> 46:16.760
We never did read the

46:16.760 --> 46:18.760
YouTube comments

46:18.760 --> 46:20.760
one

46:20.760 --> 46:22.760
I'll find another one

46:25.320 --> 46:27.320
Let's see

46:27.960 --> 46:31.000
Maybe that could be a new segment

46:31.720 --> 46:35.240
Everyone in the headgum slack votes on the best comment

46:35.960 --> 46:37.960
And so we could say this is a favorite comment

46:38.440 --> 46:42.440
Let's start the next week. Yeah, sure that was sorry um and

46:43.320 --> 46:46.440
You say shut up a lot for a host

46:49.000 --> 46:52.760
You're actually tell us to quiet down or the show was bad

46:52.760 --> 46:55.320
Well, it's hard, right because I thought I

46:55.800 --> 46:57.800
Study the greatest all the time

46:58.840 --> 47:03.240
Yeah, and Johnny cars study murder the recruitment rate. I would say

47:04.520 --> 47:11.160
David later. They interview. They're great interiors. Conan's a great interviewer and do they do they ever tell their guests to shut up?

47:11.160 --> 47:13.160
Do they ever say have they ever tried?

47:14.680 --> 47:19.640
But you have to bring your own flavors what I have gone first two people you mentioned are dead

47:19.720 --> 47:26.600
So when you say they haven't done that yet, that's it for them. What they've done is done

47:27.640 --> 47:33.400
Study what they do and try to replicate it. They never tell their guests to shut up. They never say that this episode was bad

47:33.560 --> 47:36.440
They never did but what if Merve Griffin out of fucking podcast

47:38.200 --> 47:41.960
He wouldn't do this you don't think his patients would run thin if he had you as a guest

47:43.480 --> 47:45.480
I don't really

47:45.480 --> 47:49.560
Yeah, why is that that part of being a host is dealing with whoever the guy?

47:50.600 --> 47:52.600
Correct

47:52.840 --> 47:56.680
Well, I have you on almost every week and I get tired of you

47:57.960 --> 48:01.240
Okay, so I'm gonna bite me back. I want to

48:05.480 --> 48:12.040
You want to have me on or you want to not have me on shut up shut up

48:15.240 --> 48:17.240
I bore of you

48:19.640 --> 48:21.640
I don't have stamina for a mirror

48:24.120 --> 48:27.160
Or you want you don't you owe him five hundred dollars?

48:28.040 --> 48:31.320
No, you didn't make it past the two minutes. I said there was a reserve

48:32.600 --> 48:35.960
Yeah, how hard is it to interest someone for two minutes?

48:36.680 --> 48:40.680
Haven't you ever been at a dinner party? It's hard to interest you for a two minute

48:41.880 --> 48:45.960
Me I feel no what happened was you guys felt put on the spot and you didn't have anything to talk about

48:46.440 --> 48:51.800
Maybe that's something you can work on as come to the show with some a talking point. That's what people do on talk shows

48:52.920 --> 48:54.920
Well, I will say that

48:55.000 --> 48:57.240
Not to pull one of the

48:57.240 --> 49:01.480
Naked of comments from last week's episode, but someone said in this rare occasion

49:01.480 --> 49:04.600
Marie gaps lately tanked the show talking way too much

49:05.560 --> 49:07.560
So that's a note that I took personally

49:07.960 --> 49:09.960
Absolutely tanked

49:09.960 --> 49:14.040
Is still there and he watched the whole thing. Yeah, probably

49:15.000 --> 49:18.600
So we'll see you guys again next week. That's all for this week's episode

49:18.600 --> 49:21.800
I promise the next week is gonna be better. I think we should do it in studio

49:22.360 --> 49:24.920
I think who do you think should be on it? I think it should be you

49:26.120 --> 49:28.120
Merv and

49:28.120 --> 49:30.120
Hurty

49:30.120 --> 49:32.120
Merv

49:32.120 --> 49:34.120
Merv

49:34.120 --> 49:36.120
With an F and a V

49:36.920 --> 49:38.920
Merv the fur f

49:39.480 --> 49:42.040

49:44.040 --> 49:46.040

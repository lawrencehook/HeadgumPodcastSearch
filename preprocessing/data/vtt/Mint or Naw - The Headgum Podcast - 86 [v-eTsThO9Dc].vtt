00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.240
Thank you to Diet Smoke for sponsoring this episode of our show guys you know what people

00:11.240 --> 00:16.520
often aren't happy with with specific regards to edibles.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.520
Sometimes you get way too high.

00:18.520 --> 00:23.200
I mean it can really be difficult to control the dose and there's nothing worse than being

00:23.200 --> 00:26.920
baked out of your mind when you didn't plan on it.

00:26.920 --> 00:29.280
And you know once you eat it there's no going back.

00:29.280 --> 00:33.400
You just sit there suffering stoned out of your mind.

00:33.400 --> 00:38.120
That's why when you need the perfect medium high, you got to hit up your friends at

00:38.120 --> 00:42.640
Diet Smoke for their delicious Delta 8 THC gummies.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.520
So what exactly is Delta 8?

00:44.520 --> 00:48.720
Well Delta 8 is simply a less potent THC.

00:48.720 --> 00:53.160
The THC that you're probably most familiar with is Delta 9 and while both are natural

00:53.160 --> 00:57.720
to the cannabis plant, Diet Smoke extracts their Delta 8 from hemp.

00:57.720 --> 01:02.480
When they call this a loophole, I call it the secret recipe to getting a smooth

01:02.480 --> 01:05.640
stable and most importantly, legal high.

01:05.640 --> 01:09.320
Now Diet Smoke is legal in most states and it's non-prescription.

01:09.320 --> 01:13.560
Just check Diet Smoke's website to see if they ship their delicious gummies to your state.

01:13.560 --> 01:17.640
Now if you're asking yourself to diet smoke really get you high, of course.

01:17.640 --> 01:21.760
The high you get with Diet Smoke is best described as somewhere in between the chillness

01:21.760 --> 01:27.240
of CBD and that classic stoned feeling you get from regular weed.

01:27.240 --> 01:30.360
Diet Smoke isn't light, it's just right.

01:30.360 --> 01:34.680
Plus Diet Smoke comes in two delicious flavors, blue raspberry and watermelon.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.840
Now some people like blue raspberry, but I think Marieka's favorite is watermelon.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.680
I say try them both.

01:40.680 --> 01:44.720
Each gummy is infused with 10 milligrams of Delta 8 THC derived from American

01:44.720 --> 01:49.240
grown hemp and you know what they say by American and get high with American.

01:49.240 --> 01:53.560
Also Diet Smoke's Delta 8 gummies are low in sugar, fat free, and delicious.

01:53.560 --> 01:59.160
And did I mention that her legal so in CBD isn't enough in traditional THC is too much

01:59.160 --> 02:02.120

Thanks DietSmoke.

02:44.240 --> 02:47.360
We need to get some sort of animation for that.

02:47.360 --> 02:50.560
What we need is higher production value.

02:50.560 --> 02:53.560
This show makes so much money and you guys don't ever throw anything.

02:53.560 --> 02:57.720
I'm sorry to get started off so angry, but Mike is selling ads out the Wazooies working

02:57.720 --> 02:59.240
as hard as he fucking can.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.240
Jake is at the helm.

03:00.240 --> 03:06.240
He's fucking capped and in the ship to freedom and glory and Marieka, what are you doing?

03:06.240 --> 03:08.760
What are you doing to help the show?

03:08.760 --> 03:12.000
For the past two weeks, I've been doing your job of uploading it.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
Get on that.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
Up, go, Bob, I'll pass on it.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Let's get into it.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Jake, you got COVID.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Yep.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
You recounted on a fire at you before we started recording that you were attacked by an orthodontist.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
Yes, I was a costed by a dentist.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
My dental surgeon.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Yeah.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.360
I don't want to repeat the story for everybody that's already heard it on the fire

03:46.360 --> 03:50.960
of you, but let's just say I was kept awake through a very torturous wisdom teeth

03:50.960 --> 03:51.960
extraction.

03:51.960 --> 03:57.000
We're in, they saw it and cracked my teeth in half and pulled them out piecemeal.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Yes.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Did that for both teeth?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yes, top and bottom.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
They basically left me for dead.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Is that a method?

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Is that like a known dental surgery method?

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
It seemed like it is, but it's a last ditch effort.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
After the top one, she asked if I wanted to leave.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
She was like, you don't have to do the second one because she knew how bad it was.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
But at that point, you wanted to give them COVID.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah, exactly.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
My retaliation.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Maria, any new hobbies?

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
I can hear my notes for once.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
I've been putting a talking points in here.

04:36.000 --> 04:43.000
We just knocked out Jake's wisdom teeth and like he said, I don't want to rehash it too much

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
because we almost 100% overlap between the show and his show.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Let's talk about your hobbies.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Sure.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I don't know.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
I think some of my hobbies have had to take a pause because of COVID.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Last week.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
But I did finally go side to see a musical that was closing.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I didn't think for me.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
In the theater.

05:10.000 --> 05:17.000
I saw flying over sunset, which was a musical about a bunch of old Hollywood people doing LSD.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
So it's cool.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Yeah.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Other than that, I don't know.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
I really want to go back to doing archery.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
But I'm like too scared to go.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Go there right now.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
I guess I could.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I don't think that's like the worst place to go.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Yeah.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
That seems like there's lots of space because you have to fire arrows along distance.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Yeah.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Yeah.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
It's not a resort.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
It's outside.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
It's outside.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Well, I mean, the good news for you.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
And I think that we can, you know, people are hearing it here first.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
You know, who often gives their recommendations for COVID, the CDC.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Now the headgump podcast is doing it.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
We can officially announce that COVID-19 is endemic.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Nice.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Oh my god.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
That's huge.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
This is amazing.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Oh.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
That means it's, it's ending.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
It's over.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
So what it means is that it's going to, we're going to live with it.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Right.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
So the flu is the same flu as the Spanish flu, it just evolves.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
And we live with it.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
People die of it.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Yeah.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Six figures, the numbers in the six figures of people who died from flu every year.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
That'll probably continue with COVID.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
But we're going to live with it.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
We're not going to live in fear of it.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
And I'm so happy that we get to be the ones to break the news.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
That's what we'll be right.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Yeah.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
What's that?

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
We shouldn't be right.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
We shouldn't be happy that it's endemic.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
We shouldn't be breaking the news.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Or we shouldn't even claiming to break any news ever.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Great.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Okay.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I see that point also.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Mm-hmm.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
But at the same time, I don't like to.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Because like, where did you?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I don't want to read on Jeff's parade.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
It feels like I'm okay with breaking news as long as it's like really positive.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Yeah.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Yeah.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Yeah.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Yeah.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Like that's awesome to hear.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
And it feels good for me to know that.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
And you're going to love this.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
I love the next piece of news that we're going to break.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Right.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Single pair universal healthcare is here.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
No way to stay.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
To stay.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
It's called James Care.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
No shit.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Yeah.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
How did we?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Are we breaking that news?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
We're breaking.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Are you passing a healthcare?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Like Bill.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Or there's no Bill.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Not even on the horizon or in the Senate.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
But we can still break news.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Like you can break news and crack-wise.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
And it doesn't have to all be real.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
So we're.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
It's break.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
I think that now's.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Uh, I don't like calling it that.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Mm-hmm.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Phone news.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Phone news is really good.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Sort of like faux leather.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
It's a little easier to say.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
And it's here.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Truly.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
It's a medically soft news.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Yeah.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
No news.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
No news is phone news.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
No.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
I guess we should get this out of the way too.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
He's not here.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
But it isn't news birthday.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Let's move on.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Nice.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Micah.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
What's new with you?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Are you excited?

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
You told me that you're taking an all-inclusive trip to Jamaica.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Yeah.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Sure.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
And are you excited about that?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Yeah.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
First weekend in February?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
It's uh, no.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Not the first one.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Okay.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Second?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Uh, yeah.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
So that's a later weekend of February.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
But is it second?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
What's new at down?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
How do you need to know this?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Yeah.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
Can I ask what all inclusive means?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Um, everything is paid for.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Right.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Right.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Yeah.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
It's easy.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Meals.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
While you're at the resort, like poolside service, drinks.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
God.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Everything.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
You just say your room number.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
It's all included in the bill.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
It's like club med.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
You guys ever go to club med?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
No.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
It's an all-inclusive resort.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Hmm.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
More of a sandals family.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Yeah.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Never.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Never went on a family vacation.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Yeah.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
I also actually have a business.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
We're dropping bombs left family right.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Then center.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Maybe you could go on.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Um, Micah's family vacation.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Rika.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
I'll be cool.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Do you have room for one more?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Sure.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Or I can replace anyone.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
You even.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Happy one.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Oh, I love.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Rika and live.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Going.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Oh, my God.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Going on.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Going on.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Going on.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Going on.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Going on.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Going on.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
But also Dutch.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Dutch and Amsterdam.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Ah, yeah.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
I went with Blumenfeld.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
And you split the bill.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
And they arrested him piece.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
And we split the bill.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Yeah.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
I thought he was born in 1982.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
So I thought this was 40.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Judd, up a test dial.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Hmm.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Oh, he's 39.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
He's 39.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
He's 39.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Like, that's like kind of the worst age.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Yeah.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
I would agree.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
Because you're like, I wouldn't say 39 is still your 30s.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
But it's not, I mean, it's not your 40s.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
You're not over the hill.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
You don't get to really celebrate.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Holy shit.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I close it up to 40 to realize that 39 is actually a good birthday.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
It feels like, oh, wow.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
We got one more year to live it up.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Because when you're 40, it's so.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
There's no turning back.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Yeah.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
You're basically dead.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Um.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Mike, are you 29?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
28.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
28.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
And Marie, are you 27?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Mm-hmm.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
I'm 24.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
And I'm 29.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
36.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Well.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Mm-hmm.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
36 is a good birthday.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Well, it already happened.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
So fucking, so thanks.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
But I don't have a 36 birthday anymore.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
I have a 37th birthday now.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
37th birthday too.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
37th birthday too.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
37th birthday.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
I'd say they're like, you're equally gay.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Maybe.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Cause I have no idea how much I needed to hear that today.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
God.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I was going to double down on the 29th thing.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Yeah.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
No, I have the confidence to say I'm actually 43.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
What's the best age to start lying about your birthday?

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Ooh.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
I guess 33.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
Cause I think you should be 33 for two to three years.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I could see that.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Yeah.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
It feels like not quite to 35, which is like too old to be lying.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Yeah.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
But you could start at 35 too and just be there.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
I feel like when you lie, you just have to say you're the same age for a few years in a row.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Yeah.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
But you have to play it off like you don't remember.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Yeah.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
And I actually sometimes I think I'm 37.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Jill will sometimes remind me that I'm younger, which is nice.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
That's an old person thing of like, babe, like how old am I?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Am I 30?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Yeah.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Or am I 35?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
And then they'll be like exhausted from the like the other room.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
You're 34.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Thanks.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Things are bad.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Do that old one.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
You put some art up.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Yeah.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Is it cricketer?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Is the laptop.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Probably the laptop.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
I would imagine, right?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Yeah.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Yeah.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
I'm sort of a master at photographic perspective, making things look different sizes.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
That's not really neat.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
You could be a master at it.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
No.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
What's the mastery involved there?

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
So there's this Etsy store and I can send you guys the link.

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
But basically it sends quarters that are instead of like, you know, 0.75 inches

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
and whatever the quarter is, it's like four inches.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
And it's a big quarter.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Yeah.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
And so I can like hold the quarter and then it looks like my hands are tiny.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Is anyone do that?

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
So how are you a master if you buy that in an Etsy shop?

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Because I know it sounds like that person is a master.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
That they're the master at making coins look big, but I'm the master of like,

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
holy shit.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
I got the iPhone 12 mini mini because it's next to the quarter.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
That's the master of making your hands look small.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Yeah.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Yeah.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
And then I'll accidentally send like a dick pick and it's like the quarter was in the corner

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
and I'm like, shit, shit.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
How do you unsend an SMS and you can't?

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
So I've garnered the nickname tiny cock James.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
That's been so long.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
I didn't say it was a short hand.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
I just said it was a nickname.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
Honest Abe is at the same amount of syllables as Abe Lincoln.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Hmm.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Yeah.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Great.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
My friend isn't on TikTok and I told them about the she thing.

13:51.000 --> 13:57.000
And it was in a car full of other people who all know about it and don't want to hear me explain it.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
But now that person's really excited about she.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
It's renewed my energy.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Is this on your list of things to wax?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
No.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
All I had was a music birthday.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Jake's wisdom teeth and Marika's hobbies.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
All right.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
So we were like, let's gloss over as quickly as possible.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
So this is music birthday.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
It has to be acknowledged.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Let's move on.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
That was in the wax.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
I don't want to give him this do.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Hmm.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Yeah.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
I mean, I think we all did a good job at trying to avoid that today.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Yeah.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
The company slack.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Let me just read the transcript here for a spell.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Um.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
Marika said it's it's Sam's birthday.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Same shackle.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
It had gum.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Uh, happy belated birthday to Sam shackle.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Uh, I believe it's the only birthday we're celebrating today.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
And then I said have a hard day.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
You know, we'll just.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
We'll make the episode description.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
The transcript.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
We won't.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Mike, are you doing other work?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Uh, I was reviewing the slack.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Messages that you're discussing.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
Um, because if you need to do my work cover, Mike, that's.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
Is this is this a waxing episode or do you have segments planned?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Because if it's a waxing episode, we need.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I want that warning ahead of time.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
That's.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
So you can decline.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Yeah.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
Like I usually do worn up top after the first part of the wax goes poor.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
I'll be like, yeah, this is all I have planned.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
I have other segments planned.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Uh.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Why do we have to think of the waxing girls?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Everything turned into a wax.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
It's all.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
The podcast is a full wax.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Even a question to you.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
I think I think for our next live show, we should hire a.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
God, what do they call it?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Anesthetician.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
Um, to literally wax us on stage as we wax.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Hmm.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Whether it's a eyebrow threading.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
Whether it's truly the ring around the rosy.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
If you know what I'm saying.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
No.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Haha.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Haha.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Haha.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Haha.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
No.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
You're saying you said it wasn't waxing.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
I brought threading.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Fine.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
It's its own fucking thing.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Pulling teeth.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Pulling hair.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Waxing eyes.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Let's just.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
I had a thing.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
That's good.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Yeah.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Pulling teeth.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Because waxing with you is like pulling teeth.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Kind of interesting.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
What was the thing you wanted to talk about to you?

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Um, I did think about it and then forget it.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
Maybe think I have some lingering brain fog.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
You had COVID.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Do you have symptoms still?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Are you good?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Um, no.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
I don't really have symptoms.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
I guess maybe I'm like, it feels like my.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I feel slightly congested.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
But it's because I'm not allowed to blow my nose from the wisdom teeth.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Oh.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
So I think it could just be that.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
That's horrible.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Yeah.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
You're not allowed to blow your nose.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
Not when your wisdom teeth were as deep as mine.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
They made holes in my Sinai.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
So.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Mount Sinai.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Yeah.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
My.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
My Sinai is.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
They're.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
They're whole.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
So if I.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
If I blow my nose too hard a little like blow through my.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Stitches in the blood clots.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Oh.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Good.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
That's horrible.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I've heard of stories about that.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Yeah.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
And this is all stuff they warn you about like as you're about like.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
If they told me all the stuff before the appointment.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
I would have been like, you know what?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
My wisdom teeth are fine.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Um.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
But instead they tell you kind of like after it's all over.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
They're like, all right.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Here.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Only chew on the side of your mouth.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Don't blow your nose.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
What?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
What?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
That's a drink.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
They're a straw.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Right.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
That's one.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Yeah.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
No.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I don't wonder when that's allowed to like when that runs up.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Maybe seven to ten days.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
I had a.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
I drank from a straw this morning.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
So.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
But it's been eight days.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
So I feel like it's fine.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
This is the most normal conversation that we've had.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
And Jeff has just left the room.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Wow.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Wow.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Where is Jeff?

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
I see the reflection of his.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
The ceiling.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Yeah.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
He sent his like friends apartment.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
That's really nice.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Yeah.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Pretty jealous.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Those beams.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Yeah.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
I like those pants, Jeff.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
I like that shirt too.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Yeah.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
It's a good shirt.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
I went to say wars for the first time.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Sort of my new Valhalla.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Where's the bars?

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
Upper West Side, which is also my new found holy land.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Really?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Why?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Yeah.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Explain, please.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
It's fucking gorgeous up there.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
I mean, I.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Yeah.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
I went to Zay bars.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
And I went to the natural history museum to see an exhibit on sharks.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
And I was so ready to do a.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
The bit that I was ready to do was that the Upper West Side is a horrible place.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
And boring.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
And then I literally stepped up.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
The bit you were ready to do.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I went there to hate it.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Yeah.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
And then I stepped out of the subway.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
I think I took the one.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Whatever the red one is.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
And I walk up the stairs.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
And I'm like.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
This.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
This is for me.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
No shit.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
I love that.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
But streets.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Where'd you go?

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
I was on 80th and second.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
No.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
80th and eight.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
I don't know.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Central Park West to Zay bars.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
I just went.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
I just went to 80th part.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
I went to get to Abern.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
Where they serve spaghetti in bags that are very

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
to particular.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
And I don't know why they do that.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
I don't know if it's to make like cleaning up the

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
bowls cleaner and easier.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
But that it was a weird day.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
But I can't.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
It was.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
It was.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
They also have a bunch of coffee shops and restaurants that are like.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
In the garden apartments of town homes.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
And I think that's amazing.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Wow.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Yeah.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
That's really nice.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
It is nice up there.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
The architecture.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Consider.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Would you consider living up there?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
I feel like.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I mean, well depends because we've been talking about maybe

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
moving our office in New York to Manhattan.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
So maybe if that happened.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
But like all my friends live in.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Around here.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
I probably still.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Brooklyn.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
But you know, maybe when I'm a dad.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Yeah.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Because it's.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
They're part of Manhattan that are relatively affordable.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
I mean, like, it's probably as affordable as Williamsburg.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
I mean, for sure.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Yeah.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I feel like it's probably same price.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
Friends that live on the upper west side.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Yeah.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
My shirt was eight dollars.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
That's a steal.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
We're talking about rents though.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Yeah.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
No, I'm just saying like.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
That's this shirt and Williamsburg would have been like 40.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Yeah.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
That's eight bucks is a very.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Inexpensive shirt.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Yeah.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Also, I feel like just.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
I don't you have to live around your friends.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
What?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Spoiler alert.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
You can live wherever you want and meet up with them.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Pretty easily.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
LA scarred me in that specific regard of like if you don't live.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Like my friends who live in Santa Monica.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
I don't see them.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
I never will.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Yeah.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
It isn't the same way though.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
I don't think I see people that I don't live near.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Hey, that's what everybody's saying.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Michael so often is.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Yeah.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
I think it is kind of a Brooklyn because like Queens like I.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I want to leave all the time.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Like Queens is good.

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
But it's like not if depending on what area and like you need to.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Well, I think it's hard to get anywhere.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Yeah.

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
I guess there's really the G gets you to other parts of Manhattan or other parts of Brooklyn and Queens.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Maybe it's fine.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
It's not that hard.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Nothing's hard.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
But everything's hard.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
It's all too much, you know.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
I have pretty close access to the G the L and the J and the M.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Yeah.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
You're in a good spot.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Very nice location.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Um.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
It's also Michelle Obama's birthday.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
That's interesting.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Was it?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
It is today.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
It was yesterday.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
It's either today or yesterday.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
But I bring it up because she's actually my pick for bond of the week.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Oh, nice.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Yeah.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
That's really going to back fast and hitting stuff.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
It was yesterday.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
But do you know what's strange?

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
A strange little parallel.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
I never know.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
New before.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
My birthday is the day after Barack Obama.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Right.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Right.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
That's why you and Amir work so well together.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
We both one day off from an Obama.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Are you Barack and he's Michelle?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
That's basically being married.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Yeah.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
I agree.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I'm Barack and he's Michelle.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
What do you mean are you Barack and do you mean like in the relationship?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
In the relationship and also maybe personality-wise.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Because that actually say that you're Michelle.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Yeah.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
I mean that is a Michelle.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Interesting.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Yeah.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Yeah.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Interesting.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
Because Michelle is like beloved by everybody.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Yeah.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
So it's Barack though.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
In a way.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
I think they're both loved equally by the same people.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
And he did pretty good.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
One time I went to Zebul on an LA.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
The night after the Obama sisters had been there.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
And everybody, because people, at least over the summer,

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
everybody was going to Zebul on on Friday and Saturday.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
And my friends were like, yeah, like Malia was right there.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Like she was dancing.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Like I was like, was there secret service?

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
And they were like, not that we could see.

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
But I do fear being within a 20 foot radius of a secret service agent.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
Because I think that I'm usually the sketchiest person in the joint.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Yeah.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
Because we're usually wearing some sort of like tasseled jacket.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
Like slightly overcompensating because you know they're there.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Yeah.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Yeah.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Trying to like befriended them.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
So they don't think I'm weird.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
But then you're doing so.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
They think I'm suspicious.

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
Somebody did post a really funny back to back quote on the headgum podcast.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Reddit.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
I do want to try and find it.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
If I can't, that's fine.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Here it is.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Okay.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Two great minds.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
And it's a John letting quote that says,

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
And then I quote for me that I from last week's episode.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
I don't want to be without rice.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
But to be rice, that'd be nice.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Like that's already worthy of like a 10 year sentence.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
God.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
And I don't even be in prison.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
I mean, a run-on.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
We have to take a break.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Good.

Thank you to athletic greens for sponsoring this episode of our show.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
I started taking athletic greens and I feel superhuman.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
I mean, I really do.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
I know that I'm getting all the nutrients that I need in just one morning shake.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
So what is this stuff?

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
What with one delicious scoop of athletic greens?

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
You're getting over 75 high quality vitamins,

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
minerals, whole food sourced, superfoods,

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
probiotics, adaptogens, and more to help start your day right.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
The special blend of ingredients supports your gut health,

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
your nervous system, your immune system, your energy, your recovery,

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
focus, and aging, all the things.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
I personally take my athletic greens the morning.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
I take it first thing in the morning, then I have my coffee.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
And my day is just jet setting, right?

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
Because I'm sort of a jet setter and a trend setter.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
So hopefully you follow the trend by trying athletic greens.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
It helps with my energy.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
It helps me feel a boost in the morning.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
Feel like I have the nutrients coursing through my veins.

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
And I would say that the taste is milder than you might think

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
from a green juice smoothie product, et cetera.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
I'm starting to get my family into it.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
I haven't tried it yet, but I did send them some.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
And I don't know.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
I'm somebody who doesn't always have probably enough vegetables.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
I'm sure there's a lot of you like me out there.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
So why not try athletic greens?

27:14.000 --> 27:20.000
You know, get all the nutrients and vitamins that you need in one drink.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
Now, a lot of people take a multivitamin.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
And, you know, that can be helpful in some ways.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
But it's harder for your body to absorb the nutrients and the vitamins that

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
needs just from a pill.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Athletic greens is blend.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
Aegee one is a small micro had it with big benefits.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
And it's one thing that you can do for yourself every single day

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
to support your health.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
Also, your subscription to athletic greens comes with a year's supply of vitamin D,

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
which is incredibly important to add in, especially in these winter months

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
when we don't get as much sunlight.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
So, right now, it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
with convenient daily nutrition, especially heading into cold and flu season.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
It's just one scoop of in a couple of water every day.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
That's it.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Thanks athletic greens.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Welcome to Maria Drew.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Carriedition.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
Maria or Drew?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Do you mean Maria?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Mariah's.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
I forgot then the H and then I read it.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
But as it was on the page,

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Mariah or Drew, carry you.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Oh, my God.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Maria, carry you.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
That's like a,

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
Jake, that video of Carlos Sine saying,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Mariah, carry everybody's assistant.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
Mariah, carry her something like that.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
I don't know.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Wait, did you send it to me?

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
No, I'll send it to you.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Yeah.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Does it do the party just say to us?

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Carry.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
These are going to be quotes from American's two favorite carries.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Mariah and Drew.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
And you guys are going to tribute them to one of the other.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Does that make sense?

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Of course.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
So like you wouldn't have come if we were just going to wax,

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
but you would have been fine coming if you knew it was going to be a segment like Maria

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Drew.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
Last time we were talking about getting railed on a toilet.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Who?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Who?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Who was?

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Who was?

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
So do you think.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
Rika, you have to tone it down.

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
There are some comments that I agreed with on the video last week.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Maria killed it last week.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Yeah, I crushed it.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Yeah.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Well.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
All right. Are you guys ready?

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Yeah.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
There is a light at the end of the tunnel.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Hopefully it's not a freight train.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Drew Gary.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Yeah.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I would have three.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Hang on.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
No way.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
That was Mariah.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
When?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
That I'd really clever.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
They don't have years.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
That's really clever.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Doesn't.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
The year doesn't matter.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
What?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Like why does she come in?

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Yeah.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
There's no context either.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I got these all from Braini quote.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
There's no way I can justify my salary level.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
But I'm learning to live with it.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Drew Kerry.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Correct.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Your price is right.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Yeah.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
In finding these quotes,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
I found out that Drew Kerry,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
who I used to claim,

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
because he's a big Clevelander and has like,

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
always gone back into the ground.

30:47.000 --> 30:53.000
He's like a really outspoken libertarian.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Hmm.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
I can see that.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
I got the glasses for it.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Yeah.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
But like supported Ron Paul and Gary Johnson.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
I don't know.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
I appreciate that you.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Whatever.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
I'm not going to get into it.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Yeah.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Time is irrelevant to me.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
I never wear a watch.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Mariah.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Yeah.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Correct.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
You didn't say what this is for.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Is it cash?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Is it what?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Um,

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
I stopped doing the cash thing because of the tax stuff.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
That really scared me kind of.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
It made me wise too.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Well, it's not actually a thing.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
As we, as we were told multiple times on our one viral check talk,

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
that was just misinformation.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
Uh, was, what was the misinformation?

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I don't think I knew anything about this.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
We were talking about how Venmo started our,

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
like, this year is starting to charge tax.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
Or like you, you will be taxed for like any.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Good.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
I mean, it's just exchange through it.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
But it's only for like,

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
when you claim that it is for a good service.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
So it's not like for exchanging money back and forth between friends.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Thank God.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
That makes sense.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Thank actual God.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Um.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Yeah.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Then this is for cash.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Very right answer.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
$100 to you.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
$100 owed to me for every wrong answer.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
So far, I bought $200.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Uh, and so is Jake.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Here we go.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
My heart has never been broken and I've never broken anyone else's.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
It has to be true.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Yeah.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Wow.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Right.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
There's so many songs about her having a broken heart.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
I know.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
I know.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
Also, that's an insane thing to just assume.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
She has a song called Heartbreaker.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
It's heartbreaker.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
You got the best of me.

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
She's like, yeah, this was written by a team of eight songwriters on Melrose.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Wow.

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
In an office that would rival a CPA's office in any middle Americans metherpol.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
I'm not vain.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I'm insecure.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Wait, that's quote.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
That's the quote.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
When, when did the quote start?

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
When did you stop talking?

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
Everything I've said since the game started has been me.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Except for the quotes.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Anyways, repeat the quote.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Sorry.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
I'm not a fan.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
I can't stop looking at it.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
I mean, this shade of orange just calls to me.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
It's really nice.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
I'm a little myth that if it was only a bucks, you didn't get me one.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Because I feel like you look at that shirt.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
You know that I was like that.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Here's the thing.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I'll be at Zabars within the next seven days.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Guarantee.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
What are you doing there?

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
I'm doing that.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Another shirt.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
What is Zabars?

33:27.000 --> 33:35.000
Zabars is going to be a gourmet grosser for the road slash ages and the road being 80th street.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
In all of all places, the upper west side of Manhattan.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Yeah.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
I can't make a mecca.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Yeah.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
It's perfect.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
The quote was Mariah Carey.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
Correct.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Checks up $300.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
I'm up $300 mostly from whatever you guys can split it.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
Now, that is one of the most conservative states in the union.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
But you can do what you want in Vegas and nobody judges you.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Drew Carey.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Correct.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
I wish I shouldn't have said the libertarian.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
Getting cash for a game would.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
That's not money being exchanged from friends.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
It is technically income.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Then we should.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
That's a winball.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
So I would be paying income tax.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
You would have no tax burden.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
You might be able to claim it as a loss since you actually.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
It's a right off because it's a charitable donation.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
Because there's sort of less fortunate.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
That's.

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
I actually think you could say that this is your job and and you know,

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
paying people is is an aspect of the job.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
So it's it's a loss.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
You don't have to call me a charity case.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
And I reset that.

34:46.000 --> 34:51.000
And I will be paying income tax on this cash, which is why I intend to keep it this time.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
I usually.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I'm not a libertarian.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
I believe in the government.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
And I will be paying my fair share of taxes.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
I will be reporting this income.

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
I'll be filling out a 1099, which actually means you will be hearing from the IRS.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Fuck.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
I'm very hard on myself.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
And I have too many issues.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
That one was.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Drew is just sitting on himself.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
No, that wasn't a quote.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
Oh, I see.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Mariah might have already said that.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
But I'm saying it now.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
So that's going to be cash.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Here we go.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
Butterflies are always following me wherever I go.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Right.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
Correct.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
That one I threw in there because I'm getting a butterfly tattoo after this.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Really?

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Somewhere.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
Yeah.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
You know where?

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Yep.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
No, it's called somewhere.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
All right.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Well, that was that was that game.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
Oh my god.

35:49.000 --> 35:55.000
Did you see the tattoo with $400?

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
Are you just at Jake Hurwitz?

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Yeah.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Can we see the tattoo?

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Yeah.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Hang on.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Can you confirm that that came through?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
One second.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Oh, I'm Jay Hurwitz.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
What did you say?

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I said, Jay Hurwitz.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Cancel cancel cancel.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
All right.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
This is fucked up.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Yeah.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Didn't get anything.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Jay.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Are you kidding me?

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
I'm Jay Hurwitz.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Okay.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
I got it.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Yeah.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I hate doing this.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
These are the inspiration photos.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
But in black ink.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Yeah.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
You're getting a butterfly?

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Yeah.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
Do you realize that I have a butterfly tattoo, right?

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Are you kidding me?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
That's an apple.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
That's a butterfly.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Did you not know I have a butterfly tattoo?

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
I think we talked about it as, yeah,

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
because that looks familiar.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Whatever.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
This is completely different.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
This is the square placement.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Left try.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Why?

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Why?

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Why, Seth?

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
It's not completely different.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
They look pretty similar.

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
I don't like to cure that in hour before I have the appointment.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
It's today.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
It's in an hour.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
It's somewhere.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Well.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
Can I, like, why, why a butterfly?

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Um, I don't know.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
I think it looks cool.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Uh, if you want me to describe meaning to it.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
It's constant reinvention.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Personal transfer.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
I didn't want you.

37:34.000 --> 37:39.000
I don't want to be a retiree who's arguing with his niece.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
Well, now you're going to be a retiree with a butterfly tattoo.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
I'll tell you something about the butterfly tattoo.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Yeah.

37:47.000 --> 37:52.000
I got my butterfly tattoo for what I believed to be a very valid reason when I was 18.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Yeah.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
And it doesn't matter your reason for getting the tattoo.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
It always leaves eventually and you'll have the tattoo.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
So it's, uh, I commend you for having no reason except for her.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
I agree.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
I don't, that's the move.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Yeah.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
You don't want to have a reason for a tattoo.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I don't need a reason for a butterfly tattoo.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Specifically.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
I was like, where is there something maybe?

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
I think butterflies are pretty.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Wow.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
The reason you need.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Let me finish pretty off.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
They're actually pretty fucking.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
I don't know.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
This is a step out from your lemon for sure.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
The lemon is for my dead dog.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
I thought you were a joke.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
No.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Um,

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
And you don't mean anything to you.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
The dog was my only thing.

38:34.000 --> 38:39.000
All right.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Let's move on.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Uh, this one I'm really excited about.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
Uh, do you know you can invest in crypto on Venmo?

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
That's new.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
Uh, I've been doing NFTs recently.

38:50.000 --> 38:56.000
So I actually just learned your, your $400 into Bitcoin.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
What?

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
I was able to lose 30 bucks right off.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
That's funny.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
That's funny.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
That is funny.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
We need more shit like that from Mike today.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Here we go.

39:11.000 --> 39:26.000
I forgot how long my song was.

39:26.000 --> 39:41.000
And now it's just the school photo of some person.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
Welcome to Mint or Nah.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
Speaking of NFTs.

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
So NFTs were explained to me on my knees recently.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
And I finally got it.

39:56.000 --> 40:01.000
Any one of us could print a photo of the Mona Lisa right now.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
And yeah, we could be like it's the same for photo.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
But you don't own the original.

40:07.000 --> 40:15.000
I'm the proud owner of a gray boy NFT and a sad cat.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
I hate those.

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
And you could print that or save the JPEG, but it wouldn't be yours.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
It's mine.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Are you just learning this now?

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
I knew that.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
But I, the Mona Lisa one was pretty key for me.

40:28.000 --> 40:33.000
So I thought that we could kind of get in on the NFT game because people are making

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
thousands of dollars.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
The meta versus Nye.

40:36.000 --> 40:41.000
So I thought we could look at a couple of JPEGs and we say whether or not we're going to mint

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
them, mint them being turning them into NFTs.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
So this is Mint or Nah.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Not for cash.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Not a game.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Just a discussion piece.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
First of all, you got this image from worldwideinterweb.com.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
It says.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
And that would be part of it.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
But I don't think you can just mint other people's photographs.

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
Okay, then we'll have fucking who does the art for the shows these days.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
First and last name.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
Grayson.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Yeah, Grayson.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
Grayson wise will be an artist.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Okay.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
And he'll, you know, take this as inspiration.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Turn it into something original.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
We'll mint it.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
So do we mint this or not?

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Who is this?

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I don't know.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
There's, I think there's, there's to me.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
There's something here.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
We're playing on the nostalgia.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Yeah.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Full photo.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Exactly.

41:36.000 --> 41:40.000
You can, there's everything that is that gets people fucking hard for NFTs.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
Yeah.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
You know, the, the changing the background.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
So like, maybe a rare trait is there's lasers back there instead of the blue.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Yeah.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
You know, all these things can be interchanged.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
I will mint this.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Yeah.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
You will work with Grayson.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I will be cutting you out.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
And what have school photos?

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
No.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
And if, yes, yes.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
On the open sea, this after fucking noon.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Thank you.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
Holy idea.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I actually do think it's going to see.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
I was, I was just like, I was like rolling with this.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
That's so, I was rolling with the bit.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
That's so harsh.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
I don't really.

42:21.000 --> 42:26.000
Because like, you don't have to like me personally or what I do, but useless.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
I don't really think that.

42:27.000 --> 42:33.000
I was just role playing was like, you guys, maybe we just do turn the rest of this into wax.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
And I'll turn my camera off.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
All right, next one.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
So I call this sour.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
This kid looks, this looks like Micah.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
This is what Micah looked like as a baby.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Just to white.

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
What I don't like about this and why I'm going to say not is like the slight v-neck.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Why did you put it on that?

42:57.000 --> 43:04.000
Because the sour, the project would be sour and empty or like sour apes or some shite.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
Hmm.

43:05.000 --> 43:11.000
Not enough there there for me to be involved.

43:11.000 --> 43:15.000
You know, I originally said, no, the school photos and NFT project.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
I'm back in on that.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
See how bad the next one was.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
They do regret not going in on the first one.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
So Jacob, whatever you need.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Cool.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Yeah, we're trying to cut Jeff out.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
So actually, if you could liais with grays,

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
that's really nice.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
But I'd like to kind of stay C seed slash wise.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
So if you could see me on the email to wise, that'd be great.

43:40.000 --> 43:46.000
You will be BC seed because you want to get my eyes off of it.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Yeah.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
Yeah.

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
And it'll be under the guys of not keeping me not unwise.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
But actually, the guys would be getting my eyes off of it.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
And being like, well, we don't want to crowd Jeffs and bucks.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
But guess what, there's not much in there.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
Yeah.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
So sour.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Are we saying, mentor?

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
No.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
No.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
No.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
All right.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
No.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
Yeah.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
No.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
On the douche.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
No.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
I thought it could be douche NFTs.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Yeah.

44:18.000 --> 44:24.000
You need, I think that I don't really know very much about NFTs.

44:24.000 --> 44:29.000
But I feel like for people to get it, they need to be like trading cards almost.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
They need to have unique features.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
And again, I'll say, there's not enough there there.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
It's kind of like a, it's kind of like a do shop if you think about it.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
It's like the ready made art.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
Like the, I don't know, if it were a real piece of art,

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
I'd be down.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
But I hate NFTs.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
So I'm going to answer not to anything.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Yeah.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
That's what made me think of it.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
That's really good.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
Thanks.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Yeah.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
But we're seeing not minting less.

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
A rise in popularity of women owned projects, women created women artists.

45:02.000 --> 45:07.000
Congrats to them.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
And a few are stupid.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
Next.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Oh, John.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
So a few different people with John this.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
Yeah.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Don't zoom in.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
I actually, I, I had a project that was a lot like this.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Yeah.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
To do hobos and I lost a lot of cash.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Yeah.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
I lost a lot of money in the last week.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
I was up and down down until I sell.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
But the thing with NFTs is that nobody wants it.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
It's worth it.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
They don't come back.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Yeah.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
The market is flooded.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
It's also dumb.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
I would.

45:43.000 --> 45:49.000
We should actually start explaining what these images are for the audio podcast.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Oh, yeah.

45:50.000 --> 45:55.000
It was a kid sucking on a lemon followed by.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
I, uh, a curge.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
Yeah.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
I think a mannequin project.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
I think a mannequin project.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
I think a mannequin project.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
I think a mannequin chain.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Yeah.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
Johnny might be able to help us out with this one.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Is that a Johnny could pull this off?

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
I think on his birthday, which we should say is August 12th.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
Uh, she should wear this.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
Yeah.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
I think I could pull it off.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
But again, how is that?

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
And then F.T.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
It views.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
I'm not that separately.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
Yeah.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
Okay.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
All right.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
Um, and then there's this old man with John this, but he, he's not letting him face him.

46:32.000 --> 46:37.000
He's still living his hashtag best life.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
This team was great.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
Though his teeth are so white.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Well, by comparison.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Yeah.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
I wonder if he's all yellow.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
Oh, that's good.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Thank you.

46:47.000 --> 46:52.000
Um, we should say that this, he's actually, I cropped this, but this is him at Coachella.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Oh, that's nice.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Weekend two, but still.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
Yeah.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
How sink is this?

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
I do cut it.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Just a do cutie for us.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
I don't whimmers body.

47:03.000 --> 47:08.000
There's, I hate to say it again, but there's not enough there there.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Unless we're talking to motorbikes.

47:10.000 --> 47:15.000
And then maybe, because then we have like, you know, you got a side car.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
You have a chopper.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
But then I think there's actually too much there there.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
Yeah.

47:23.000 --> 47:27.000
I would say this is almost like a distraction.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
You just started looking at choppers.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
Why?

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Yeah.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
How about a motorcycle gang NFT project?

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Yeah.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
I was a different person in the gang on a didn't like.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
I like here's what I, here's what I've pitched on that.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
It's all just their back leather jackets.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
That's a really good.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Yeah.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
It's just, it's like a motorcycle art on the leather jacket.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
And yeah.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Now I'm in because it was my idea.

47:56.000 --> 48:01.000
And I love it.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
All right.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
So that's mint.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
Like a me, me, you and Grayson could probably enjoy it on that.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Yeah.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
And we'll cut you in.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
You don't do anything.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
I don't.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
I don't.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
I don't.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
That's a game in this.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
Yeah.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
You don't have to contribute anybody.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
But we're just going to make you a passive investor.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
Yeah.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
We just want to give you cash if it works out.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
And can you make me a massive give you a surprise.

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
Jeff, you can buy these on an open sea in four hours.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
And Jeff, we'll keep you.

48:29.000 --> 48:35.000
We'll keep you as like a be like a carbon copied person who knows about the project.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
And it's like a scene.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
And it's not part of it.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
You can be part of it.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
I want to be clear about that.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
That you're not part of it or shit.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
You can get in on the floor.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Yeah.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
At that floor price.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
So I can mint it.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
You can buy one for five at area.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Five is the floor price.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
That's right.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
That's insane.

48:58.000 --> 49:03.000
These are genuine pictures of leather jackets.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
The leather's not genuine.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
It's digital.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
Yeah.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
Yeah.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
That's a picture.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
All right.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Back more John this.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
What if it's just John dice.

49:15.000 --> 49:21.000
J-A-U-N-D-A-E-Y-E-C-E.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
I think there's the eye.

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
Doing an eye-based project is a little too obvious.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Or should I say, uh, bias.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
That's really obvious.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
That's good.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
I was.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
The key is to make people eye-nevis.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
And they wanted.

49:37.000 --> 49:42.000
Is the idea behind all of these that they are art?

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
Like.

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
How we're considering all of these images.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
That is like the idea.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
Because we have an arch in a lot of like NFT YouTubers and shit.

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
And like it is funny to me when they're like, and like when you're buying them, like make sure you're,

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
your, your buying arts art.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
So make sure you like, like pick one you like.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
And I'm like, they're all bad.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
Yeah.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
That's a good to see.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
That's my biggest problem with NFT's.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
I think I at least think of them as assets.

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
Like not necessarily like stock, but not necessarily like art.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
Yeah.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
Yeah.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
Yeah.

50:15.000 --> 50:20.000
That said, I have only ever invested in crypto Hobos and lost all of the cash that I did it with.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
Yeah.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
So I don't have my handle on this world.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
And I think that's good.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
I think it's fine.

50:27.000 --> 50:33.000
I'm just trying to imagine a world where I like walk into a gallery.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
And all of these are on the wall.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
And I.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
That's more fun.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
It'll be.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
It'll be in the metaverse.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
Right.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
Yeah.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Yeah.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
I think you're like comparatively like that.

50:44.000 --> 50:49.000
That's a better experience to me than wherever these are.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
Yeah.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
But everything.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
Everything.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
Yeah.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
I think you like comparatively like that.

50:56.000 --> 51:01.000
That's a better experience to me than wherever these are.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
Yeah.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
But everything.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
Everything.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
Everything.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
Whatever the entrance fee is.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
All right.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Some kind of NFT project.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
Probably.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
And that seems like a nicer way to do it.

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
It's like it's almost the equivalent of like I can't buy an original, but I could buy a print.

51:17.000 --> 51:22.000
I can't buy an original, but I could buy a digital NFT.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
So yeah.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
But that's like what?

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
What?

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
No.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
It's my favorite artist.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
My favorite visual artist is Matt McCormick.

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
And if he had an NFT project, I would get in on it for sure.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Well, it was also probably due well because it's Matt McCormick.

51:34.000 --> 51:39.000
Is it just like the, but then is it like the idea that you're, you own stock in.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
Yes.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
Yes.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
This thing.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
I think that's not the artist.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
You could just buy a print if you wanted to enjoy it.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
Yeah.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Um, internal.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
This guy's.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Yeah.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
Base planting on.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Come.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
Of course.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
That.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
Wet.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
Haha.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
So.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
No.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
Yeah.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
I wouldn't, wouldn't meant this obviously.

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
But if I saw it in a gallery, I think I'd laugh and have a good time.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
Yeah.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
There's something interesting about it.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
Yeah.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
Because the sign could.

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
I do, I'll, did you Photoshop this?

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
No.

52:17.000 --> 52:25.000
I like that the, the caution wet floor has the, the, the, the shadow of the guy following in the opposite direction.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
Haha.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
This is hard.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
This, it's like a mirror image.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
It could change, change up that caution sign.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
What's happening there.

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
You know, I think every, I think I'm going to mint this because every time it's someone

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
comedically falling in a way that seems impossible.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
Hmm.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Like this guy, like, how do you slip this way?

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
And then that's kind of what makes it rare and interesting.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
So I'll say.

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
I haven't gotten very deep in it, but I don't think anybody's cracked the code of making like

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
funny NFTs.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
Yeah.

52:54.000 --> 53:01.000
It is like some weird kind of like anime chip, like ugly art project to me.

53:01.000 --> 53:07.000
If you can, if you could consistently make funny images, I would potentially invest in something

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
like that.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
It's, it's funny because I was about to suggest that you do a Jake and a mirror NFT.

53:11.000 --> 53:18.000
But, uh, so the academy tweeted, like, some stupid, like jokingly coy thing of like,

53:18.000 --> 53:22.000
we're not actually asking who you want to host that this year's Oscars, but if we were, who would

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
be, I'm like nice.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
But, uh, I said Jake and a mirror.

53:26.000 --> 53:32.000
And my favorite brand of Jake and a mirror fan are the ones who stopped watching you

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
guys eight years ago.

53:34.000 --> 53:38.000
And then, like, I'm TikTok sometimes on a mirror's TikTok, but like, holy shit, like, where did

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
these guys go?

53:39.000 --> 53:43.000
And they're like, like, like, a couple of people respond to being like, oh, my God, you just

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
took me back.

53:44.000 --> 53:48.000
So I think that's how you get back into the mainstream zeitgeist as Jake and a mirror's NFTs.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
Do you want?

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
Yeah.

53:50.000 --> 54:00.000
I mean, if it's making money, I feel like our core fans would not want to see us make

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
NFTs.

54:01.000 --> 54:07.000
And the passive casual fans would not want to support us in a cash way for NFTs.

54:07.000 --> 54:13.000
It basically be a project just for me, you and a mirror.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Right, there's other parts of NFTs, too.

54:16.000 --> 54:21.000
Like, you can, you could sell an NFT and owning it means that you get to go.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
Yeah.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
A private show.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
A dark city in like, right here.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Oh, that's, that's kind of nice.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
That's going to tick it.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
That's cool.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
But also, you could just buy it.

54:32.000 --> 54:38.000
Like, that's only a product of the fact that we created the stupid thing.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
That's like exclusive.

54:40.000 --> 54:45.000
If it was like, you could just buy and tick it to a cool event or like be invited.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
Yeah.

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
But no one just wants to argue that it's, it's not at least stupid.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
But just say it.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
It's such a, yeah.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
Like, you can't, people are doing it and it works.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
And that's the, it is fucking crazy.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
Yeah.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
But that's what Gary Vaynerchek does.

54:59.000 --> 55:03.000
He has, he makes hundreds of thousands of dollars every single, like,

55:03.000 --> 55:08.000
moment of the day because people are buying his NFTs so they can get access to it.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Yeah.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
Yeah.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
I don't think that we're there.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
Obviously.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I think Nicole.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
But it would be his.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Yeah.

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
I think if I, I do think if I could, I would do that.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
Yeah.

55:21.000 --> 55:26.000
I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't shy away from it.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
Monk.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
Tony, Tony.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Tony Shaluob.

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
But it's kind of a shitty photo that clearly is just a fan took a photo with him

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
and then crop themselves out.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
Yeah.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
Oh, man.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
Yeah.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
I think not.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
So I don't know.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
Celebrities looking pretty normal.

55:45.000 --> 55:49.000
Like that's what us weekly entirely is, you know.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
Yes.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Um, this celebrities are just like us.

55:52.000 --> 55:55.000
It's, it's fun to see a bad picture of a hot person.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
Not the Tony Shaluob was ever like a hot guy icon.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
But.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Or a guy con if you will.

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
I think he's poised to be the next 2G.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
I think he could be bonded the week.

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
Tony Shaluob on.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Maybe a good bond.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
I don't watch that.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
All right.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
Let's wrap this up.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
I'm in a running over.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
All right.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
I'm going to say no.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
But I appreciate that you are taking it.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
This next one I'm really excited about.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
Is that it?

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
It's.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Oh, it's an old photo of Marie.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
Isn't it?

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
Yeah.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
This is a, I think 14 year old.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
I think around me.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
To tap.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
To tap.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
Doing a tap showcase in Boston.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Oh my god.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Look out.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
Tense.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
I've never seen her like this.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
That's just an angle of Marie.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
I've never seen either.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
It's a joke.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
It's a weird thing.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
I feel like.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
I've just been staring at Marie on the zoom for two years.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
Yeah.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
This is like if Marie goes on dancing at the stars.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
And she like everybody's keeps voting.

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
She's voting her back week to week because of how serious she's taking the show.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
I mean, even her.

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
Her paired professional dancer is like, you sure you want to keep staying here for another two hours.

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
She's like, yeah, let's just keep going.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
And then she gets home and keeps dancing.

57:19.000 --> 57:23.000
And I know like, holster to you, sure.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Low rise jeans.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
No cuff.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
The wig for sure.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
Yeah.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
Yeah.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
It was part of the Boston tap company.

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
Uh, one of the first original members.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Huge of true.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
Yeah.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Pretty big deal.

57:42.000 --> 57:47.000
I'm going to say no, but I appreciate your dedication to the craft.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
That's rude to include this photo.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
And then not fucking share.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
All right.

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
We're going to hashtag stop the steal and hashtag stop the share here.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Screen wise.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
But um.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Wait with this song again.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
Yeah.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
Yeah.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
Um.

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
Let's wrap things up by just a quick discussion of Jason Mamo and Lisa Bonay's.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
So sad.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
Yeah.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
17 years.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
Yeah.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
So two years.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
And it's gone for not.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
And don't give me that shit.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
It's better to have loved and lost than to have never loved it all.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
It's a wash.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
They're very.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
And wash.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
Yeah.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
Kids.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
Kids.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
They have.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
They have an amazing stage.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
Not richy.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
But fun.

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
Yeah.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
You do it for sure.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
Yeah.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
Yeah.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
Really sad.

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
Very sad.

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
What I do want to take issue with is the way Mamo posted about it.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
On Instagram.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
This is something that really bothers me about celebrities.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
They think that because their famous.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.600
punctuation goes out the door.

58:51.600 --> 58:55.560
He was putting cameras at the beginning of sentences and littleshiglies.

58:55.560 --> 59:00.760
It was like, I'm like, just right, ah you just use normal grammar and the punctuation.

59:00.760 --> 59:04.360
You don't have to make it offensive and unusual.

59:04.360 --> 59:06.800
I don't like when celebrities do that.

59:06.800 --> 59:09.320
It's so small.

59:09.320 --> 59:10.960
That's such a shit.

59:10.960 --> 59:11.960
Yeah.

59:11.960 --> 59:12.960
We literally didn't do this.

59:12.960 --> 59:17.000
It was also like, his cool enough and weird enough呢.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
Did I baseball like?

59:18.000 --> 59:19.600
Like, it comes from the side.

59:19.600 --> 59:22.160
Is that specifically a celebrity thing

59:22.160 --> 59:23.840
or do people just do it and you go this way?

59:23.840 --> 59:26.760
People just do it and you notice one celebrity is doing it.

59:26.760 --> 59:31.080
Maybe I have noticed that celebrities have the most insane

59:31.080 --> 59:32.360
grammar as well.

59:32.360 --> 59:36.120
I just wouldn't use this podcast as a platform to call that out.

59:36.120 --> 59:37.920
It's like, I mean, but what I,

59:37.920 --> 59:39.520
it's the flip side of that coin, though,

59:39.520 --> 59:42.880
is like when I love when, especially a young celebrity

59:42.880 --> 59:46.680
posts like grainy bad photos to their Instagram grid,

59:46.680 --> 59:49.880
but they're famous, so the photo of them carries weight.

59:49.880 --> 59:53.360
So like Diana Silver's will post like a fucking photo

59:53.360 --> 59:56.680
of her in the background of a party.

59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.000
And she's barely in focus, but it gets like 100,000 likes

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.560
because it's fucking Silver's.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.120
So you're just, yeah, you're just jealous.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:06.400
I don't know that is either, but she's on space force.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.240
And she's to date Dominant Fique,

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.080
fought fake.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.040
I don't know who that is.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:11.880
This is crazy.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.160
Date from Derek.

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.640
No.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.120
Dominant Fique, like the, he's the artist.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.200
He's an amazing artist.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.840
He did three nights at the motor.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.040
Oh, nice and straight.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.840
Lights in the city of Paul's.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:29.280
And then he did the kiss of Venus.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.480
You were like the first one.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.480
Yeah.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.640
All right, plugs.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.360
Let's get it over with, not only the plug segment,

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.200
but this entire episode.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.040
I've had a nice one.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.520
I don't know if it's going to be good for other people to listen to.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:45.000
But Marie, I would have gone on what do you want to, sorry.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:45.840
It's over the plug.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.840
It's nice.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.560
It's fine, because I was looking up,

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.040
trained for you out of who I was thinking of.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.040
Yeah, plugs.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:00.560
Yeah, plugs, why is, boy, boy, what's happening?

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.560
New podcast, enemies, dropping the trailers,

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.400
probably dropped by the time this came out.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.640
So go check it out with Liza Trigger.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.080
Should be fun.

Same day.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.960
Micah.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.600
Hello, live Climbs Rocks.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.080
Yes, the Grams.

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.920
Nice.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:38.760
Very good.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:39.920
Do you want to explain what it is?

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.000
Yes, do you want to be with it?

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.120
My girlfriend started a rock climbing account,

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:48.200
where she posts videos and photos of her

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.760
tearing it up on the rock wall.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.880
She's been climbing so much less time than me, Micah,

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.280
and she's better than both of us.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.080
Yeah, six months, right?

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:57.720
Wow, really.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:58.720
Something like that.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:01:59.560
Yeah, she's really good.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.880
I saw that when I assumed that you met her climbing

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.200
or something like she was like,

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.880
they're all the same place.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.720
And we just took her.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.760
We took her to the gym and she took to it.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.720
She's very good.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.560
I'll second that.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.920
I'll second live Climbs Rocks.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.200
I'll also brothers Halcyon.

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.960
We're in a beanie right now.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.160
Can I get one of those beanies?

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.160
Yeah, we'll get what color way do you want.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:25.280
We got a green orange.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.120
Olive.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.720
We have olive cinnamon.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.520
Nice.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:29.680
Cream.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.760
Can I ask you how you do this?

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.200
Like is it drop shipping?

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.280
Like are you just getting in from a whole sailor

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.600
and then marking them up?

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.440
No.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.400
We're hand stitching these hats.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.400
They're not.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.400
They're not.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.400
They're not.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.400
They're not.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.400
So it is a drop shipping thing.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.400
No, it's not.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.400
Drop shipping.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.400
We ship them.

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.400
Okay.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.400
We manufacture them in bulk.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.400
Damn.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.400
How design them?

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:56.400
I stitched them in my mother's basement.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:03.080
Did my hand every single hat with love and care to cover your hair?

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:07.160
And let's take the hat off because then you're going completely bald.

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.800
Male pattern bald moves.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:17.000
Jagan, is your grandfather on your mom's side?

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.760
When he was alive or if he's alive, does he have a hair and did he have a hair till he died?

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.560
My mom's side.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:28.640
He's dead and he had no hair at all.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.480
Okay, so you're going to be bald from very early on.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.480
We're bald early on.

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.480
We're going to go with that.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.480
So in theory, you guys should be going bald.

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.480
But like shit.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.120
I think I'm definitely.

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.560
I have hair past the point that he did.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:44.480
So I feel like now the difference is you're in your 20s.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.920
If you lose your hair, it's sad.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.280
I'm almost I'm 30.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.720
Jill, how old am I?

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.720
I'm so calm.

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:56.760
So the fact that I have hair at all is everything else is just gravy now.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:57.760
It's all good.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.760
I can coast.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.760
That's a higher for you.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.080
That's something that I am going to consider when I'm trying my life partner.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:10.480
If I want to have kids is is her old man bald.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.680
And if so, it's a deal breaker.

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.080
Because I want to be you.

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.880
By the time you have kids, though, there's going to be like surgeries and there are

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:19.880
yard surgeries.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:20.880
Granting pill.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:21.880
Granting for whatever.

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.880
Yeah.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:23.880
Projects.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.880
Bald.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.880
It's an empty.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.880
Well, this is all good insight.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:32.000
I don't want to trail off and we're about to pass an hour.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
So let's finish up.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.520
That's part keeps code if you're worried, though.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.520
Yeah.

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.520
Everybody stay golden.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:42.240
Everybody say humble and check out Zaybar as if you're in the New York City area.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.240
It's up to the upper west side of the style.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.560
And I'll see you guys there.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.960
We'll see you guys again next week.

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.680
Thanks for listening to this episode, I guess.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.680
But, you know, we get the mad money either way.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.880
No, we need the listeners.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:05:15.000
That was a hit-dum original.

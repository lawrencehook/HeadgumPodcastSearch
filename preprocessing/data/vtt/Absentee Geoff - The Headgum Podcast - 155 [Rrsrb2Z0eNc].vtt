00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head gum original.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
All right, I'm going to click on one of these and hope it's the show intro because

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
I can't tell you what you want much button it is.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
All right.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Nope.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Okay.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
It's not labeled like intro.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
That was intro dash music.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
So I always met Jeff.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
Jeff had all these sound effects labeled as if they were the zodiacs code.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Yeah.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
It's kind of like that, yeah.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
I think I found it.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
That is it.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
We know that.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
We know that.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
What was that one we played well actually in the end?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Head gum podcast intro.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
No.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Okay.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
That's awesome.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Well, it's in a separate.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
There's two sections to Jeff Soundboard.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
One is favorites and one is uploaded.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
And then I checked upload it.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
And obviously that's where it was.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
So I'll just have to remember that.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
And he did say to have both open.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
That makes sense.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Yeah.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Can you kind of go over the instructions you get?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Can you read the email?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I haven't shared the screen.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
I won't share the screen.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
But I will go through line by line of what I was given.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
We should say.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Welcome to that gump podcast.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Jeff is not here.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
He's kind of left us high and dry as it were.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
He's in Kentucky doing God knows what.

01:49.000 --> 01:58.000
And I received an email last night at like around 930 p.m.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
Saying hello dash way too formal.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Attaching the outline for tomorrow's episode here.

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
As per discussion, you'll be stepping in as the de facto me.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
And then there's an attachment a PDF attachment of his outline.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Don't know why it's PDF.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
And he gave me the login to his soundboard.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
But as we all know, Jeff's soundboard is publicly available on the internet.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
So I just use that link and didn't log in using his password.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
That is definitely his password for other things besides this.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
So good work.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Thank you.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
I won't do that.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
It's a character.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah, let's see if we can guess it.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
We'll bleep it out if we get it right.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Oh.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Oh, is it Jeff?

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
I knew it.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
It is not.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I guess we could do intros.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Even though that doesn't really happen anymore.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
But the first line item on this outline is intro for the first five minutes.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
I also don't have a timer up which could prove to be a problem.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
But you know, whatever.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Does he usually?

03:24.000 --> 03:31.000
I think so solely because sometimes he's like, we have to move on to this thing at this time mark.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
And he did list out times.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
I've been rolling for five minutes.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
That feels correct.

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
It feels crazy listening back to some of these episodes knowing that there was a plan that was down to the minute.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
In fact, I would agree.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I agree.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
What else does that play?

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Well, like what would it show be like if there was no.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Yeah.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
More chaos.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Do you guys know what Jeff is doing in Kentucky?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
He's been there for almost a month.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
More chaos back.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
He's learning to horseback ride.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Did he give us a heads up or he's like, can't do that.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
He wanted to, he wanted to be in the derby next year.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
No.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
He didn't give us a heads up.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
He doesn't have a friend in Kentucky to race in the Kentucky Derby.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Why are you telling me this?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Tell Jeff.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I can't.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
The Kentucky.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
The Kentucky.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
The Kentucky.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
He has no service.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Has jockies?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Yeah.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
I know if it was that or just the horse running on their own.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Yeah.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
We know where to go.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
You're thinking of dog racing.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm super thinking of crayon racing.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Anyway.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
What's the whole thing?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
It's.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
I'm America.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Amir's here bringing up the rear.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Mm-hmm.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
KC's on the facts.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
An onus on the sacks.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
It's pretty good.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Thank you.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Yeah.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
So far we don't miss them at all.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Yeah.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
I'm kind of especially.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Yeah.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Yeah.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Yeah.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
We're only six.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Six minutes in.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I should say before I really get into it.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
There is the bottom of this outline.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
A highlighted section titled tips for hosting.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And I will take them to heart.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
The first one is cut people off at your leisure slash pleasure.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
If you find your own faces red, cut to break.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
That makes sense.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
When in doubt, make a pun off something a guest just said.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
Lean on the soundboard to put in funny moments through.

05:47.000 --> 05:55.000
In general act incredulously put out by your own show slash the guests.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.000
I feel like I'd be better at the soundboard one if I knew what all of these were.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
But yeah.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Look at that.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
It's kind of the wash.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Yeah.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Yeah.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
That's good.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Thank you.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Let's try out your skills.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Let's maybe talk about something.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
And then if someone says something funny, hit us.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
We are in the wax portion.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Oh, he has the whole episode outline.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Yes.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
So how long is the wax portion?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Yeah.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
We can cut kind of from the top because I've like a meaning.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Yeah.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
I mean, I think that there's a few things.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
The wax portion is technically 15 minutes.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
And I'm fine with cutting one of the segments at the end of that, which happens to be

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Marika's brothers.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
This feels kind of pointless right now.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
But yeah, what's everyone been up to?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
What's dating like in LA?

06:54.500 --> 06:59.000
I've got a great chef question.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
Well, I could tell you a mirror's engaged on your lives with her boyfriend.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
And I haven't been on a date in several months.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
That's what it's like over here.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Oh, shit.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Oh, that was good.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
That was really good, actually.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Nice.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Thank you.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Do you use that random one here?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Was that on purpose?

07:23.000 --> 07:28.600
I did it on purpose, but very quickly because the first thing I saw was oh shit.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.760
I was going to do the clap one, but I saw that clap.

07:31.760 --> 07:32.760
That's not meaner.

07:32.760 --> 07:33.760
That felt mean.

07:33.760 --> 07:34.960
That feels mean.

07:34.960 --> 07:39.440
The clap would have felt a very Jeff of you.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.440
Yeah.

07:40.440 --> 07:45.040
Casey and I became regular as a bar last week as I was.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.040
Whoa.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.040
That's how you become well.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.040
Well, we won the right.

07:50.040 --> 07:55.040
And I went back and then they were like, where's on you?

07:55.040 --> 07:57.040
And I said, I don't know.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.040
Oh, so you guys both went once.

07:59.040 --> 08:02.040
And then Casey went a second time and they're like, where's on you?

08:02.040 --> 08:03.040
Yeah.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.040
So I think we are regular.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.040
So I think that qualifies.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.040
Do we dare say where it is?

08:09.040 --> 08:10.040
Or is that two personal slash?

08:10.040 --> 08:12.040
I don't want people blown up our spot.

08:12.040 --> 08:16.040
But it is a cool place named for animal.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.040
The roost.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.040
God.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.040
Oh, it's not named for an animal.

08:20.040 --> 08:22.040
I guess.

08:22.040 --> 08:25.040
Is an animal.

08:25.040 --> 08:28.040
But the roost is not an animal.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.040
Right.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.040
Well, you come home to roost.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.040
Yeah.

08:32.040 --> 08:36.040
That feels like that could be a Jeff phrase.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.040
Yeah.

08:37.040 --> 08:40.040
We should not add that into the script.

08:40.040 --> 08:42.040
Just the roost.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.040
Like, come in home to roost.

08:43.040 --> 08:46.040
Feels like something he's going to start saying at some point.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.040
Jeff would do something like, come and home to roost.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.040
I'm coming home to roost.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.040
Oh, that's good.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.040
Did you hear that sound?

08:52.040 --> 08:54.040
It was the word of the day or something.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.040
Yeah.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.040
The word of the day is Jeff.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.040
Interesting.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.040
So congrats to Casey.

08:59.040 --> 09:02.040
I'm not going to Venmo you though.

09:02.040 --> 09:03.040
Okay.

09:05.040 --> 09:08.040
It's also time for bond of the week.

09:08.040 --> 09:12.040
And I have one specifically selected.

09:12.040 --> 09:15.040
It's Mark D. Jansen.

09:15.040 --> 09:21.040
The CEO of Blue Diamond Growers because it's time for a James almond.

09:21.040 --> 09:24.040
Right.

09:24.040 --> 09:27.040
Any questions or no, we got it.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.040
No.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.040
All right.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.040
On you.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.040
Who's your bond of the week?

09:34.040 --> 09:35.040
You're becoming Jeff.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.040
The more you host this show.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.040
Don't you realize?

09:37.040 --> 09:40.040
I don't like your power in her eyes.

09:40.040 --> 09:44.040
Whatever is happening is fucking contagious.

09:44.040 --> 09:45.040
Yeah.

09:45.040 --> 09:47.040
We all hate being on the show unless we're hosting.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.040
And we break it up in the best times.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.040
The major killer.

09:52.040 --> 09:56.040
Have the power at hand in the soundboard in your browser.

09:56.040 --> 09:59.040
And you'll be a god of sorts.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.040
Did you read that or see that?

10:01.040 --> 10:02.040
I just said it.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.040
It just came out.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.040
I don't have a god.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.040
You're fucking me coming, Jeff.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.040
I'm fucking scared.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.040
Yeah.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.040
Because then he's going to come back.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.040
He's going to be too old.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.040
All right.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.040
Well, we'll see.

10:16.040 --> 10:19.040
Do you like to make up her power me?

10:19.040 --> 10:20.040
I see.

10:20.040 --> 10:24.040
We're going to be editing your face to look more like Jeff's throughout the episode.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.040
God with a eye.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.040
Yeah.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.040
Yeah.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.040
Any other bonds of the weeks?

10:33.040 --> 10:35.040
Jimmy Butler.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.040
Jimmy Buffett.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.040
Because this name is already sort of James Bond.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.040
Same with James Buffett.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.040
Yeah.

10:44.040 --> 10:47.040
Jimmy James Butler, Bondler.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.040
It's all sort of a shame.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.040
Imagine.

10:51.040 --> 10:54.040
James Butler, Bondler.

10:54.040 --> 10:55.040
Yes.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.040
Third.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.040
Exactly.

10:57.040 --> 11:00.040
Do you think the series would be as successful as his name was Bondler?

11:02.040 --> 11:04.040
The name is Bondler.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.040
James Bondler.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.040
James Pass.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.040
Casey.

11:15.040 --> 11:19.040
My Bond of the week is Shikilo Neil.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.040
Another buzz.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.040
He's a basketball player.

11:22.040 --> 11:29.040
And he's a spokesman for Gold Bond Powder.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.040
Hello.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.040
That's pretty good.

11:34.040 --> 11:35.040
We need it.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.040
Yeah.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.040
That's pretty good.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.040
Yeah.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.040
It was kind of looking for one.

11:44.040 --> 11:47.040
And I really don't have to turn these off.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.040
So.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.040
There we go.

11:50.040 --> 11:54.040
Because Jeff, what Jeff normally does is he'll hit the button first.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.040
It'll be the wrong.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.040
He'll hit the right.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.040
He'll hit the right.

11:57.040 --> 11:59.040
And then he'll cut it off with the plies.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.040
Oh, yeah.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.040
We're going to get used to that.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.040
Yeah.

12:02.040 --> 12:05.040
You know, like, trying to make the muscle memory of.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.040
Yeah.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.040
I've made it.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.040
It's a lot of just like scrolling up and down.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.040
Yeah.

12:10.040 --> 12:13.040
It's week five of the WGA strike.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.040
Oh, we're late.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.040
You get the bond of the week.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.040
Oh, I thought you gave Jimmy Buffett.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.040
Oh, great.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.040
Do you want another one?

12:23.040 --> 12:24.040
No, it's fine.

12:24.040 --> 12:27.040
I was going to be the waitress from the roost.

12:27.040 --> 12:28.040
Oh, I'm now a regular.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.040
We're soon.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.040
I don't know if I like get shaken or stirred.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.040
Ooh.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.040
My understanding.

12:35.040 --> 12:38.040
Uh, yeah, Los Feliz.

12:38.040 --> 12:41.040
Off Los Feliz both are right on the street from the big foot lodge.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.040
Come on out, folks.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.040
You're really going to burst that.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.040
Yeah.

12:47.040 --> 12:53.040
Um, yeah, this just says discussed WGA strike week five.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.040
Um, still going strong.

12:56.040 --> 12:57.040
Yeah.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.040
Yeah.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.040
Yeah.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.040
That's what we were great.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.040
Real quick.

13:01.040 --> 13:11.040
Just I looked up the roost and it said it's an unpretentious pub with a jukebox and tie on trays.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.040
That's right.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.040
That's right.

13:13.040 --> 13:16.040
Are you had the tie food there?

13:16.040 --> 13:17.040
I have not.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.040
I have.

13:18.040 --> 13:21.040
And whoa, what's the like it's just a bar.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.040
A dive bar would just pad see you.

13:23.040 --> 13:25.040
Have you never been with a roost?

13:25.040 --> 13:28.040
It's a dive bar that was bought by like a tie couple.

13:28.040 --> 13:31.040
And so they make their food there.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.040
Do they have pads to you?

13:33.040 --> 13:34.040
Yeah.

13:34.040 --> 13:37.040
And are people having it at the bar?

13:37.040 --> 13:41.040
I don't see a lot of people ordering.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.040
I love this place.

13:42.040 --> 13:45.040
And I'm going to give it a no comment on the food.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.040
Got it.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.040
It's a casual bar.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.040
Wow.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.040
Cash only bar, but they have like pad tie.

13:51.040 --> 13:54.040
Yeah, you can pay for the food with a credit card.

13:54.040 --> 13:57.040
But if you want to beer, you have to pay cash.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.040
Okay.

13:58.040 --> 14:01.040
Are there licenses in order?

14:01.040 --> 14:02.040
Do we think?

14:02.040 --> 14:06.040
They serve alcohol or there must be some sort of a.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.040
I just feel like.

14:08.040 --> 14:12.040
They're like this is let's let's keep things separate.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.040
Yeah.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.040
Food, drinks, drinks.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.040
Sure.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.040
Sure.

14:16.040 --> 14:20.040
Well, it's always a cash only bar for a used to also be like even

14:20.040 --> 14:21.040
beer.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.040
Then it is now.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.040
It's pretty clean these days at the roost.

14:24.040 --> 14:25.040
Come on.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.040
Bye.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.040
Catch me there.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.040
Today.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.040
When you hear this.

14:29.040 --> 14:33.040
Have you had the chicken wings?

14:33.040 --> 14:36.040
We have to move on.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.040
I was going.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.040
That's fine.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.040
Just a quick yes or no.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.040
No.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.040
But we did open the chicken tenders.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.040
I didn't use.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.040
And they were good.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.040
We went with Mike Mitchell.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.040
He ordered.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.040
Got it.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.040
I think it's good.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.040
But I'll take it.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.040
Which I think is smart.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.040
Right.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.040
They don't need the time.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.040
They read the room.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.040
They say what do these people want?

14:56.040 --> 14:57.040
Yeah.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.040
To why the type of you that I want?

14:58.040 --> 15:00.040
In the summer.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.040
They put it.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.040
They have like a back patio.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.040
But it's just like a folding table in the parking lot.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.040
Yeah.

15:05.040 --> 15:06.040
Yeah.

15:06.040 --> 15:10.040
And there's such like curry.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.040
I went out of my first date there.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.040
My friend.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.040
Which he said was there.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.040
Was that there?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.040
No.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.040
Did you do that in front of me?

15:20.040 --> 15:21.040
I told you this the other day.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.040
And you said it was.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.040
You would never take a date there.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.040
A first date.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.040
Yeah.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.040
To the roost.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.040
Yeah.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.040
The cash only bar.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.040
Which I thought was a perfect first date.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.040
It's good.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.040
It's good.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.040
It's good.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.040
It's good.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.040
It's good.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.040
It's good.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.040
It's good.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.040
It's good.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.040
It's good.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.040
It's good.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.040
It's good.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.040
It's good.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.040
It's good.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.040
It's good.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.040
Yeah.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.040
Where are you going?

15:48.040 --> 15:49.040
How was your trip?

15:49.040 --> 15:50.040
Yeah.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.040
Speaking of cash.

15:51.040 --> 15:55.040
I didn't get a single cash conversion.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.040
When I went to London.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.040
Only use my card.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.040
It's great.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.040
It used to be the biggest thing in international travel.

16:02.040 --> 16:06.040
You got to like get the currency early and like make an appointment with a bank.

16:06.040 --> 16:10.040
And like exchange it at a good rate and call your phone calling your bank.

16:10.040 --> 16:13.040
To tell them you're going out of the country.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.040
International travel.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.040
Now it's just like, yeah, I'm in London.

16:16.040 --> 16:19.040
I'm just using the same card as always and they'll deal with it later.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.040
It was delightful.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.040
I had a great time.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.040
Saw a lot of faves.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.040
Saw six shows.

16:25.040 --> 16:28.040
Six shows and how many days?

16:28.040 --> 16:29.040
Five.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.040
Four.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.040
Three.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.040
That's a lot.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.040
Everyone's a lot.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.040
Every night.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.040
Yeah.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.040
Once.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.040
Once too.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.040
Saw.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.040
A lot of long shows too.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.040
Isn't one of them?

16:44.040 --> 16:45.040
Paul six.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.040
There is a show called six.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.040
I didn't see that on my trip there.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.040
But I didn't see her.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.040
Was the goal of your trip to see all these shows?

16:53.040 --> 16:54.040
Yes.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.040
Wow.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.040
Originally I made the trip to, all right.

16:57.040 --> 17:00.040
I booked the trip because they announced that Groundhog Day.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.040
The musical was coming back to England.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.040
So my favorite shows.

17:03.040 --> 17:05.040
Saw four times on Broadway.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.040
It was like, that'll be fun.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.040
If I go to this, I miss this show.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.040
But it took it when they went on sale.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.040
Didn't have tickets to London.

17:13.040 --> 17:16.040
And then as it kept getting closer to the date, they kept announcing more shows.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.040
So there was like, I really want to see this.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.040
There's like a broke back mountain play.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.040
Starting Lucas hedges and Mike Feist.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.040
Got to take it for that.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.040
What was my mom's boyfriend?

17:26.040 --> 17:29.040
He was in the play a little life.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.040
Oh, right.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.040
Based off of the book.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.040
I mean, you have a question.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.040
Are you waving at a question?

17:34.040 --> 17:36.040
He's doing one of these, which is crazy.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.040
Yeah.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.040
This is, this is a stupid question.

17:39.040 --> 17:42.040
But I bet nobody here knows the answer to.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.040
So I'm already getting pre-matted.

17:44.040 --> 17:46.040
You guys were calling it a stupid question.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.040
You called it that.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.040
Yeah.

17:48.040 --> 17:52.040
You got to London to see the plays.

17:52.040 --> 17:57.040
Are the actors British follow up to all the characters have British accents?

17:57.040 --> 18:01.040
Or are they British actors playing Americans in the play?

18:01.040 --> 18:02.040
Well, I'm here.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.040
Depends on the play.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.040
But I can do a rundown for you.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.040
We've got Cabaret.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.040
That's a bevy of accents.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.040
Most of them were British.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.040
Some doing one doing an American accent.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.040
That was very bad.

The rest of the cast British.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.040

18:59.040 --> 19:01.040
That were hit or miss.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.040
The other way around.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.040
But rarely an entire play were British.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.040

20:16.040 --> 20:19.040
Because I'm a young people are a nude and a yonder bag.

20:19.040 --> 20:21.040
Because a bunch of people are nude.

20:21.040 --> 20:24.040
And I was sitting on stage.

20:24.040 --> 20:27.040
Um, I'm just for you to a private part.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.040
Pretty pretty close.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.040
Wow.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.040

20:30.040 --> 20:31.040
Where do you allow?

20:31.040 --> 20:32.040

20:32.040 --> 20:33.040
Was I allowed?

I'm so inspired.

20:43.040 --> 20:48.040
I too wanted the nude on stage.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.040

20:49.040 --> 20:51.040
She's in this one for Yelena.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.040
We're in a car.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.040
Tackled instead.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.040
Make it.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.040
Which is crazy.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.040
Chopped forever.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.040
The cops are also naked.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.040
Yeah.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.040
This is a dream you had.

21:04.040 --> 21:07.040
Hey, can't get in the yard.

21:10.040 --> 21:11.040

21:11.040 --> 21:12.040
This wouldn't be something like this.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.040
Like, yeah, this is.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.040
It's all your things lined up.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.040
I feel like it can't be real.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.040
Yeah, my face is red.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.040
So I am going to cut to break.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.040

21:26.040 --> 21:28.040
I don't know where the end we're back.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.040
Soundtakers.

Bam.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.040
And we're back.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.040
Before we get into.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.040
Sorry.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.040
Remember, people used to say that about London.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.040
What's that?

21:44.040 --> 21:45.040
The mood was bad.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.040
Oh, there we go.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.040
Oh, yes.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.040
Yeah, you really broke character to talk about London.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.040
But yeah, really bad.

21:52.040 --> 21:53.040
Yeah, really bad.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.040
Food, food great.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.040
How do great time went to Nando's.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.040

21:58.040 --> 22:00.040
Went to one of my favorite restaurants.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.040
Um.

Fish and chips.

22:04.040 --> 22:07.040
What are the like chipies?

22:07.040 --> 22:09.040
A bottle of Nando's.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.040
Is it?

22:10.040 --> 22:13.040
A bottle of Nando's.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.040
Have you even been to the UK?

22:15.040 --> 22:18.040
Oh, Nando's.

22:18.040 --> 22:21.040
Well, I never ever considered that.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.040
No, I do.

22:23.040 --> 22:26.040
That's how you do a fucking British accent.

22:26.040 --> 22:29.040
Not like these messed up actors who can't pull it off.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.040
Exactly.

22:30.040 --> 22:32.040
That's that's why I'm here.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.040
Ask that question.

22:33.040 --> 22:36.040
He was just waiting for someone to sell him up to do his last.

22:36.040 --> 22:39.040
Have me on stage.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.040
He's.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.040
You'd be streaking doing a better accent.

22:42.040 --> 22:43.040
Yeah.

22:44.040 --> 22:47.040
Let's get into the news of the week.

22:47.040 --> 22:52.040
AI poses risk of extinction industry leaders Warren.

22:52.040 --> 22:54.040
I saw that.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.040
News.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.040
So I make it.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.040
Whoa.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.040
Right.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.040
Um.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.040
Why make it?

23:00.040 --> 23:01.040
Why did.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.040
Oppenheimer make the bomb.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.040
You know.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.040
Exactly.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.040
Follow the money.

23:06.040 --> 23:09.040
Follow the money.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.040
Uh.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.040
It says here.

23:11.040 --> 23:13.800
Expl Stop The

23:13.800 --> 23:15.040
Weak.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.040
Did you know that?

23:17.040 --> 23:20.040
Is it thanks for sending it.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.040
That way.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.040
Yeah.

23:22.040 --> 23:22.240
Just go

23:22.240 --> 23:25.040
There's a link if you like to be on.

23:25.040 --> 23:25.480
There's a ghost and I go

23:25.480 --> 23:26.040
You ssnes mouth.

23:26.040 --> 23:29.080
I'll just punch my legs and balls.

23:29.080 --> 23:30.680
Hand them out to my friends and then

23:30.680 --> 23:36.480
whinns, and say this poses the risk of diarrhea.

23:36.480 --> 23:37.940
Is that related to the AI or

23:37.940 --> 23:40.040
Art, set a like an eight note that Jeff wrote for you.

23:40.040 --> 23:45.040
I think it should have been crammed us, right?

23:45.040 --> 23:46.040
It's kind of lead.

23:46.040 --> 23:49.040
And your careers were kind of leading up to that point?

23:49.040 --> 23:51.040
Yeah, it should have been an inside joke true.

23:51.040 --> 23:54.040
Instead, it was like a family name or something.

23:54.040 --> 23:57.040
I do think that if Jeff was hosting,

23:57.040 --> 24:01.040
he asked that none of us would participate.

24:01.040 --> 24:07.040
We want to give him that sort of positive reinforcement.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.040
We didn't really dig into the AI thing.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.040
I sort of read up on that.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.040
No, we did.

24:13.040 --> 24:15.040
Casey was like, I'm a big fan of Oppenheimer's work.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.040
And I said, oh yeah, he did.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.040
Pro bomb.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.040
Yeah.

24:19.040 --> 24:22.040
Just put several words in my mouth.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.040
You're not that guy, pal.

24:23.040 --> 24:24.040
Trust me.

24:24.040 --> 24:25.040
You're not that guy.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.040
Anyway.

24:50.040 --> 24:53.040
Which, I guess, I'll just say things.

24:53.040 --> 24:54.040
And then you respond.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.040
So what?

24:55.040 --> 24:56.040
Okay.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.040
Okay.

24:57.040 --> 25:00.040

I've got it.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.040
Just a random Starbucks.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.040
Just a random one.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.040
You're right.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.040
Yeah.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.040
Beer on ice is fine.

25:26.040 --> 25:27.040
Sometimes.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.040
From the tasting table.

25:30.040 --> 25:32.040
Yeah.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.040
That's a good.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.040
Yeah.

25:34.040 --> 25:35.040
So what?

25:35.040 --> 25:37.040
Well, I want to hear more, actually.

25:37.040 --> 25:39.040
That's like a dive bar thing.

25:43.040 --> 25:46.040
There's old men drinking beer on ice with a straw.

25:46.040 --> 25:47.040
Sounds delightful.

25:47.040 --> 25:49.040
It's like going to that day.

25:49.040 --> 25:52.040
Beer on ice or beer piping hot.

26:05.040 --> 26:06.040
Yeah.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.040
There are a few from there.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.040
I also have a lot of it.

26:09.040 --> 26:10.040
So well.

26:10.040 --> 26:11.040
Yeah.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.040
I'm interested in that as well.

26:13.040 --> 26:16.040
At least for Ben Wall Blanc to solve.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.040
Wow.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.040
Very true.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.040
Nice or twin.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.040
I'm really scared of cruise ships.

26:21.040 --> 26:24.040
If you've ever been on the cruise ships death website.

26:24.040 --> 26:26.040
I'm sure they're covering this extensively.

26:26.040 --> 26:29.040
Because that's a website that exists.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.040
I've never been on a cruise.

26:30.040 --> 26:31.040
Never.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.040
Me neither.

26:32.040 --> 26:34.040
I had to go on one for work.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.040
It was bad.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.040
I'm sorry.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.040
It's okay.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.040
My room had no windows.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.040
Terrifying.

26:40.040 --> 26:41.040
Yeah.

26:41.040 --> 26:44.040
My job has been keeps calling our son a nerd.

26:44.040 --> 26:45.040
From a slate.

26:45.040 --> 26:49.040
Very good.

26:49.040 --> 26:52.040
It was so what?

26:52.040 --> 26:53.040
So what?

26:53.040 --> 26:54.040
So what?

26:55.040 --> 26:57.040
That's sad.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.040
Okay.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.040
I'm team.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.040
I'm son.

27:01.040 --> 27:05.040
It's time for our first segment.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.040
Yeah.

27:06.040 --> 27:08.040
That.

27:08.040 --> 27:12.040
I'm nervous about.

27:12.040 --> 27:15.040
Because it says Riceburn.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.040
Yeah.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.040
It's 10 minutes long.

27:18.040 --> 27:21.040
We all have to make it that long.

27:24.040 --> 27:27.040
And there's lyrics here.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.040
So.

27:28.040 --> 27:32.040
I guess I have to sing a song now.

27:32.040 --> 27:34.040
And say it.

27:34.040 --> 27:37.040
Not a 10 minutes long.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.040
It's a song segment.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.040
Jeff has written a song.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.040
He says sing the song.

27:41.040 --> 27:42.040
Then ask for feedback.

27:42.040 --> 27:43.040
If anyone pushes back.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.040
Come back.

27:44.040 --> 27:45.040
The rice is hard at them.

27:45.040 --> 27:47.040
Personal tax etc.

27:47.040 --> 27:51.040
Don't let anyone tell you the song ain't good.

27:51.040 --> 27:53.040
Which is kind of.

27:53.040 --> 27:55.040
It's like he wrote it.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.040
So obviously he's going to say that.

27:57.040 --> 28:00.040
But I am sight reading this.

28:00.040 --> 28:04.040
And I honestly, I did look up.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.040
When he sent me this email.

28:06.040 --> 28:08.040
I did look up the song.

28:08.040 --> 28:12.040
And I opened the karaoke track.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.040
And he immediately faced.

28:14.040 --> 28:18.040
I mean, was like, don't open the song.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.040
So.

28:20.040 --> 28:22.040
So here we go.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.040
Yeah.

28:23.040 --> 28:26.040
Life.

28:26.040 --> 28:28.040
Can all we can all hear this, right?

28:28.040 --> 28:29.040
Yes.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.040
What's the name of this song again?

28:31.040 --> 28:32.040
Rice burn.

28:32.040 --> 28:40.040
Okay.

28:40.040 --> 28:41.040
Long and true.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.040
Of course.

28:42.040 --> 28:47.040
They know when to start.

28:47.040 --> 28:51.040
From this karaoke track.

28:51.040 --> 28:57.040
This is the pan.

28:57.040 --> 29:03.040
Pour some soy and burn it tan.

29:03.040 --> 29:09.040
Feel the pot heat and tan.

29:09.040 --> 29:14.040
Grab cans of rice for the pan.

29:14.040 --> 29:17.040
Can's of course.

29:17.040 --> 29:20.040
For this is a pan.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.040
What song is this?

29:22.040 --> 29:27.040
I've scalded soy and brought some sand.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.040
Got it.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.040
So we see that I grow.

29:31.040 --> 29:33.040
My glance.

29:33.040 --> 29:35.040
Awesome.

29:35.040 --> 29:40.040
Starting to pour rice from cans.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.040
Oh god.

29:42.040 --> 29:45.040
And let the rice burn.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.040
Oh god.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.040
Oh god.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.040
Oh god.

29:49.040 --> 29:51.040
Oh god.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.040
And then charge.

29:53.040 --> 29:55.040
Tommy so well.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.040
Sure.

29:56.040 --> 29:58.040
Oh god, let the sand scald.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.040
Oh when it seers.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.040
The sand scald.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.040
Oh god.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.040
Oh god.

30:02.040 --> 30:03.040
When it seers.

30:03.040 --> 30:07.040
The sand scald.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.040
Now.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.040
The paint of.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.040
A thick.

30:12.040 --> 30:17.040
Oh, hey, sick moat.

30:21.040 --> 30:25.440
Yeah, so I guess any notes feed back, otherwise.

30:25.440 --> 30:27.120
It's a hard song to throw.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.360
It's a really hard song.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.200
You didn't like that.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.040
I didn't like that.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.720
I didn't think it's a doubt.

30:31.720 --> 30:34.480
I don't know the words to regular skyfall.

30:34.480 --> 30:37.480
So yeah, no, you honestly killed that.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.040
I do very, very good.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.120
Yeah, I didn't even know that.

30:42.120 --> 30:45.080
The song, the melody, how do you know that stuff?

30:45.080 --> 30:47.880
I kind of just guessed and I'm looking at the,

30:47.880 --> 30:53.400
I had to look at the karaoke track text and match it

30:53.400 --> 30:56.200
to his lyrics.

30:56.200 --> 30:58.160
It's really like that for real time.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.520
Yeah, we should.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.040
I'm worried that participates in the cultural

31:01.040 --> 31:01.640
conversation, though.

31:01.640 --> 31:02.320
She knows the songs.

31:02.320 --> 31:06.800
Yeah, I saw Skyfall in the Navy pier.

31:06.800 --> 31:08.080
I'm Max theater.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.920
Okay, we can move on to the feedback section.

31:10.920 --> 31:13.040
Yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure.

31:13.040 --> 31:16.280
I think can, can't rise as a funny concept.

31:16.280 --> 31:21.600
I think saying pan six or seven times in the opening.

31:21.600 --> 31:24.040
Versus is lazy.

31:24.040 --> 31:25.240
I couldn't.

31:25.240 --> 31:29.520
I can read the lyrics one more time since I did laughter

31:29.520 --> 31:31.280
and half of them.

31:31.280 --> 31:36.280
It's this is the pan, pour some soy and burn it tan.

31:36.760 --> 31:39.920
Feel the pot heat and Dan.

31:39.920 --> 31:40.800
What's in Dan?

31:40.800 --> 31:42.200
Like, and then?

31:42.200 --> 31:47.200
Yeah, I think that's Jeff Slash or mirror colloquialism.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.360
Okay, and Dan.

31:48.360 --> 31:49.200
Sorry about that.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.000
Yeah, right?

31:53.120 --> 31:54.120
No.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.400
Hi.

31:55.400 --> 31:56.240
Hi.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.840
Pretty, yes.

31:57.840 --> 32:01.840
Grab cans of rice for the pan.

32:01.840 --> 32:05.640
For this is the pan, for sorry, for this is a pan.

32:05.640 --> 32:08.680
I've scalded soy and brought some sand.

32:08.680 --> 32:14.960
So Racy, that I grow my glands and if I can add a note,

32:14.960 --> 32:18.880
awful air, terrible, terrible.

32:18.880 --> 32:25.880
So about start, starting to pour rice from cans,

32:25.880 --> 32:28.880
let the rice burn when it chars brown.

32:28.880 --> 32:33.680
Tummy's will turn, that's in scorched rice down.

32:33.680 --> 32:38.880
Let the sand scald when it sears thus wash it all down

32:38.880 --> 32:43.800
with a pint of a thick malt, a thick malt.

32:43.800 --> 32:47.640
Oh, what in sears thus?

32:47.640 --> 32:50.000
What was the word before is thus?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.240
Nothing that rhymes with thus.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.640
I'll say that one.

32:52.640 --> 32:58.640
When Jeff writes a song, he's looking at a list of the same 10 words.

32:58.640 --> 32:59.640
Yes.

32:59.640 --> 33:00.960
Yes.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.200
Yeah, he has like fridge magnets with these words on it.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.640
And that's the right thing.

33:04.640 --> 33:10.720
It's rice sand, scald, burn, that's not new.

33:10.720 --> 33:11.720
Yeah.

33:11.720 --> 33:14.800
The thing is always that burnt sand in case like rice,

33:14.800 --> 33:15.920
which is not true.

33:15.920 --> 33:20.320
Or burnt rice is the consistency of sand, also not true.

33:20.320 --> 33:25.760
And also, you can add soy and sometimes hoist and sauce.

33:25.760 --> 33:26.760
Yeah.

33:26.760 --> 33:30.240
We're really, we understand the limits of his cooking experience.

33:30.240 --> 33:34.000
Also, while I pay him so much, he mentions pot once.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.840
I will say most people cook rice in a pot.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.160
That's very true.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.320
Does he meant like pot?

33:39.320 --> 33:41.160
I think he writes pot at all.

33:41.160 --> 33:43.440
He doesn't mention pot at all, actually.

33:43.440 --> 33:44.240
Well, there you go.

33:44.240 --> 33:48.880
Pot rhymes with hot, which would be helpful.

33:48.880 --> 33:52.640
I kind of want to see if I can find a better key to sing this in,

33:52.640 --> 33:57.440
because I would like to be on the album in theory.

33:57.520 --> 34:00.880
But I could also just play, I could also play Jeff's version,

34:00.880 --> 34:03.240
which he did say you have to attempt singing it.

34:03.240 --> 34:07.240
But if that works out poor, plays this version.

34:07.240 --> 34:09.520
So you can listen.

34:09.520 --> 34:10.520
Yeah.

34:10.520 --> 34:12.680
Yeah, it's done.

34:12.680 --> 34:19.480
I will say that this is on, he uploaded it to SoundCloud.

34:19.480 --> 34:23.960
Tagged, genuinely good song.

34:23.960 --> 34:27.320
And yesterday, when I looked at this five minutes later,

34:27.320 --> 34:31.880
someone reposted it on SoundCloud.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.400
So he didn't make it private or anything.

34:33.400 --> 34:36.040
This is nice that he's like, here with us.

34:36.040 --> 34:36.880
Yeah.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.680
This is the pan.

34:44.680 --> 34:47.680
Oh, the reverb.

34:47.680 --> 34:51.640
Pour some soy and burn a tan.

34:51.640 --> 34:53.640
You're like, I'm at Jeff's funeral.

34:53.640 --> 34:58.640
Oh, he didn't dance.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.640
Oh, great.

35:00.640 --> 35:06.640
I'm out of choice, I made it for the pan.

35:06.640 --> 35:09.640
For this is a pan.

35:09.640 --> 35:15.640
And most of just imagining him singing also like his Kentucky.

35:15.640 --> 35:18.640
I was just about, I was like, I think I didn't even feel like in his hotel room,

35:18.640 --> 35:19.640
and he didn't visit neighbors.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.640
So you could nail it.

35:22.640 --> 35:25.640
Oh, I love this.

35:25.640 --> 35:32.640
Starting to pour, rise from cans.

35:32.640 --> 35:38.640
Let the rice burn when it chars brown.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.640
And for your time, he says, Charles.

35:40.640 --> 35:44.640
Turns, forcing scorched,

35:45.640 --> 35:48.640
the cadence of that.

35:48.640 --> 35:49.640
Really good.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.640
It's clumsy.

35:51.640 --> 35:54.640
Oh, she has it all down.

35:54.640 --> 35:57.640
Doesn't have enough Wi-Fi to upload the headgum podcast.

35:57.640 --> 35:59.640
I can upload this.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.640
Yeah.

36:00.640 --> 36:04.640
Makes sense.

36:04.640 --> 36:11.640
I think you are delivery of the end was better.

36:11.640 --> 36:12.640
Thank you.

36:12.640 --> 36:14.640
Oh, my god.

36:14.640 --> 36:19.640
When I just started speaking it,

36:19.640 --> 36:22.640
because it's a little more definitive.

36:22.640 --> 36:23.640
Yeah.

36:23.640 --> 36:24.640
Wow, thank you.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.640
That's really kind.

36:26.640 --> 36:28.640
I like your version better than Jeff's.

36:28.640 --> 36:29.640
Yeah.

36:29.640 --> 36:30.640
Hands down.

36:30.640 --> 36:31.640
For the 100%.

36:31.640 --> 36:33.640
Don't even need a second take.

36:33.640 --> 36:35.640
Huge.

36:35.640 --> 36:36.640
You have the drum.

36:36.640 --> 36:37.640
Thank you.

36:38.640 --> 36:40.640
Thank you.

36:46.640 --> 36:47.640
I need to go.

36:55.640 --> 36:56.640
Just let me leave.

36:56.640 --> 36:57.640
I really don't need it.

36:57.640 --> 36:58.640
I really don't need it.

37:00.640 --> 37:02.640
I don't take it at all.

37:03.640 --> 37:05.640
I feel like we're making great time.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.640
That was so much fun.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.640
I thought it was the end.

37:09.640 --> 37:11.640
This is the final segment.

37:11.640 --> 37:15.640
It says Trump CNN Town Hall from four weeks ago.

37:15.640 --> 37:19.640
Let's answer the same exact questions he was asked.

37:19.640 --> 37:20.640
No.

37:20.640 --> 37:26.640
So I've pulled up this document, I guess.

37:26.640 --> 37:30.640
And even Trump did a town hall on CNN.

37:30.640 --> 37:32.640
I don't either.

37:32.640 --> 37:39.640
I honestly don't know what the questions are because while these are

37:39.640 --> 37:44.640
clipped out into segments, the headlines aren't really questions,

37:44.640 --> 37:49.640
but would Trump apologize to Mike Pence.

37:49.640 --> 37:52.640
This was a town hall question.

37:52.640 --> 37:53.640
Yeah.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.640
For this guy.

37:55.640 --> 37:58.640
He's as if he feels is running for president again.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.640
They open it up with with you apologize for Mike Pence.

38:02.640 --> 38:05.640
When asked to be sorry to the vice president.

38:05.640 --> 38:07.640
You tried to kill.

38:07.640 --> 38:08.640
Yeah.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.640
He's hard hitting the interview, huh?

38:10.640 --> 38:12.640
Mm-hmm.

38:13.640 --> 38:14.640
I guess.

38:14.640 --> 38:15.640
I guess.

38:15.640 --> 38:16.640
Wait.

38:16.640 --> 38:17.640
Should we answer?

38:17.640 --> 38:19.640
I guess that's the point of this.

38:19.640 --> 38:22.640
I don't know if it's for Trump or just for yourself.

38:22.640 --> 38:24.640
Would I apologize to Mike Pence?

38:24.640 --> 38:25.640
Sure.

38:25.640 --> 38:26.640
No.

38:26.640 --> 38:27.640
We didn't do anything wrong.

38:27.640 --> 38:28.640
Grants.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.640
I would apologize.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.640
I wouldn't apologize for it.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.640
Hell yeah.

38:33.640 --> 38:36.640
Is that the one who calls his wife mother?

38:36.640 --> 38:37.640
Yeah.

38:37.640 --> 38:38.640
I would apologize to Mike Pence.

38:38.640 --> 38:39.640
He's a blunt cake.

38:39.640 --> 38:42.640
He's an absolute blunt cake.

38:42.640 --> 38:44.640
We're all thinking it.

38:44.640 --> 38:46.640
Sure.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.640
blunt cake.

38:48.640 --> 38:51.640
I don't know what that was.

38:51.640 --> 38:53.640
Did not expect it to be this.

38:54.640 --> 39:00.640
Uh, it would be something like that in the town hall.

39:00.640 --> 39:03.640
After every question.

39:03.640 --> 39:09.640
On the famous, on the infamous Axis Hollywood tape, um,

39:09.640 --> 39:14.640
Trump asked if he stands by comments from the Axis Hollywood tape.

39:14.640 --> 39:15.640
Wow.

39:15.640 --> 39:18.640
I want to know what Trump said.

39:18.640 --> 39:22.640
Uh, apparently he responded.

39:22.640 --> 39:25.640
I can take it back if you'd like to.

39:25.640 --> 39:28.640
That's honestly funny.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.640
Or than anything we could have said.

39:30.640 --> 39:33.640
I was on a flight with Billy Bush recently to Boston.

39:33.640 --> 39:34.640
Wow.

39:34.640 --> 39:35.640
Yeah.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.640
I tried to give him a hug talk.

39:37.640 --> 39:38.640
That was like.

39:38.640 --> 39:39.640
It's Billy Bush.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.640
I should have lost him.

39:41.640 --> 39:42.640
Oh.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.640
Let's try him.

39:44.640 --> 39:45.640
Oh my god.

39:45.640 --> 39:46.640
Um, anyways.

39:46.640 --> 39:47.640
Yeah.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.640
He didn't really pick up on my.

39:49.640 --> 39:51.640
Kind of my messages that I was trying to send.

39:51.640 --> 39:55.640
I wanted to down the plane with him on it.

39:55.640 --> 39:56.640
But.

39:56.640 --> 39:59.640
Oh, you can't say that.

39:59.640 --> 40:02.640
Nice.

40:02.640 --> 40:05.640
United flight 93 style.

40:05.640 --> 40:10.640
Um, storm the car.

40:10.640 --> 40:11.640
Do you want Billy Bush?

40:11.640 --> 40:12.640
Russia.

40:12.640 --> 40:14.640
Are you crazy to win the war?

40:14.640 --> 40:15.640
Okay.

40:15.640 --> 40:16.640
What did he say?

40:16.640 --> 40:18.640
This is more interesting to me.

40:18.640 --> 40:20.640
I don't know.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.640
A lot of people fight in the war.

40:23.640 --> 40:28.640
The Russia Ukraine war in one day 24 hours.

40:28.640 --> 40:29.640
What is that?

40:29.640 --> 40:30.640
Wait.

40:30.640 --> 40:32.640
What is it again?

40:32.640 --> 40:37.640
He'd settle the Russia Ukraine war in one day 24 hours.

40:37.640 --> 40:40.640
Again, so much funnier than anything we could have said.

40:40.640 --> 40:41.640
He's good.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.640
He's good at being him.

40:43.640 --> 40:44.640
Yeah.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.640
So funny.

40:46.640 --> 40:47.640
Yeah.

40:47.640 --> 40:48.640
That would.

40:48.640 --> 40:49.640
That would rock if he did that.

40:50.640 --> 40:51.640
Yeah.

40:51.640 --> 40:53.640
I don't know if like a.

40:53.640 --> 40:55.640
None of these.

40:55.640 --> 40:58.640
None of these are questions.

40:58.640 --> 40:59.640
Um.

40:59.640 --> 41:02.640
I'm having fun.

41:02.640 --> 41:08.640
I guess that was maybe the last question that he was asked.

41:08.640 --> 41:09.640
They asked him to.

41:09.640 --> 41:10.640
Two questions.

41:10.640 --> 41:11.640
Maybe three.

41:11.640 --> 41:12.640
Apparently.

41:12.640 --> 41:14.640
I guess so.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.640
He talked to all of these in one plan.

41:17.640 --> 41:18.640
Yeah.

41:19.640 --> 41:22.640
Well, it didn't sound like it sounds like one of the apology wasn't an apology.

41:22.640 --> 41:23.640
Sorry.

41:23.640 --> 41:24.640
It was like too late.

41:24.640 --> 41:25.640
I'll take it back.

41:25.640 --> 41:26.640
If you want.

41:26.640 --> 41:27.640
If that's what you want.

41:27.640 --> 41:28.640
I'll take it back.

41:32.640 --> 41:35.640
Anyway, I like this plan for Russia.

41:35.640 --> 41:40.640
Guess what this sound he was called.

41:40.640 --> 41:42.640
Bad news.

41:42.640 --> 41:43.640
Nope.

41:44.640 --> 41:53.640
Case closed dash detective.

41:53.640 --> 41:54.640
Pretty good.

41:54.640 --> 41:58.640
I was assuming it was going to be like a case close like we wrapped up the segment.

41:58.640 --> 41:59.640
No.

41:59.640 --> 42:00.640
Yeah.

42:00.640 --> 42:01.640
That should be the case.

42:01.640 --> 42:03.640
You should have a podcast.

42:03.640 --> 42:04.640
Case closed.

42:04.640 --> 42:05.640
Oh.

42:05.640 --> 42:06.640
Oh.

42:06.640 --> 42:07.640
Oh.

42:07.640 --> 42:08.640
It's fun.

42:08.640 --> 42:09.640
Yeah.

42:09.640 --> 42:10.640
And that's your theme.

42:10.640 --> 42:14.640
Well, like another show that we got in the works.

42:14.640 --> 42:15.640
Oh.

42:15.640 --> 42:16.640
Bleep.

42:16.640 --> 42:17.640
Great.

42:17.640 --> 42:18.640
Bleep that out.

42:18.640 --> 42:22.640
We can't have anybody know about that.

42:22.640 --> 42:28.640
I thought this was going to be.

42:28.640 --> 42:30.640
You must not know about me.

42:30.640 --> 42:33.640
Like it was actually me singing, but now it's just the track.

42:33.640 --> 42:37.640
I was going to say you must not know about that.

42:37.640 --> 42:38.640
Anyway.

42:38.640 --> 42:39.640
Yeah.

42:40.640 --> 42:42.640
Great.

42:42.640 --> 42:45.640
Guys.

42:45.640 --> 42:48.640
I think we did it.

42:48.640 --> 42:51.640
Do you know more notes?

42:51.640 --> 42:54.640
It just says out.

42:54.640 --> 42:57.640
We for five minutes.

42:57.640 --> 42:58.640
We've read books.

42:58.640 --> 43:00.640
Jeff obsolete slash irrelevant.

43:00.640 --> 43:01.640
Yeah.

43:01.640 --> 43:03.640
I think you heard a lot today.

43:03.640 --> 43:04.640
Can we let's talk about that?

43:04.640 --> 43:05.640
How do we feel like?

43:05.640 --> 43:06.640
Debrief.

43:06.640 --> 43:07.640
Yeah.

43:07.640 --> 43:12.640
Do we need him in future episodes or no?

43:12.640 --> 43:14.640
Well, we need somebody to make the outline.

43:14.640 --> 43:17.640
But I assume, again, chat GPT can.

43:17.640 --> 43:18.640
Yeah.

43:18.640 --> 43:19.640
We could tell some of that out.

43:19.640 --> 43:22.640
We don't need him to like write the songs.

43:22.640 --> 43:23.640
I guess.

43:23.640 --> 43:25.640
Again, the algorithm could probably.

43:25.640 --> 43:26.640
Yeah.

43:26.640 --> 43:27.640
Yeah.

43:27.640 --> 43:28.640
We kind of have.

43:28.640 --> 43:29.640
We have the favor words.

43:29.640 --> 43:30.640
Right.

43:30.640 --> 43:31.640
We have the words.

43:31.640 --> 43:32.640
That's true.

43:32.640 --> 43:33.640
We have the 10 words.

43:33.640 --> 43:35.640
You must not know about race.

43:35.640 --> 43:36.640
You must not know about char.

43:36.640 --> 43:39.640
I can burn another race in a minute.

43:39.640 --> 43:43.640
Matter of fact, sand will burn in an hour baby.

43:43.640 --> 43:44.640
Yeah.

43:44.640 --> 43:48.640
Do I did he write that to you?

43:48.640 --> 43:50.640
That's really good.

43:50.640 --> 43:52.640
Someone better than any side.

43:52.640 --> 43:53.640
I'm so far.

43:53.640 --> 43:55.640
Sand will burn in an hour.

43:55.640 --> 43:56.640
That's right.

44:00.640 --> 44:02.640
Plugs.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.640
Follow me on Instagram.

44:04.640 --> 44:05.640
Yeah.

44:05.640 --> 44:06.640
I'll add a mirror.

44:06.640 --> 44:09.640
I'll drop in some really hot reels this month.

44:09.640 --> 44:10.640
Up.

44:10.640 --> 44:11.640
Go.

44:11.640 --> 44:12.640
I'll pass on it.

44:12.640 --> 44:21.640
I'll pass on it.

44:21.640 --> 44:22.640
Yeah.

44:22.640 --> 44:24.640
Follow me on.

44:24.640 --> 44:26.640
Twitter, Instagram, and Letterbugs.

44:26.640 --> 44:27.640
At Marie Gailon.

44:27.640 --> 44:33.640
And if you think that I could host the show instead of Jeff.

44:33.640 --> 44:39.640
Comment on Jeff's posts on Instagram.

44:39.640 --> 44:43.640
His last grid posts and say so.

44:43.640 --> 44:49.640
Maybe slide into his DM is just generally sort of take over his account with slander.

44:49.640 --> 44:52.640
I don't like Beyonce fans do where they all do like the beat.

44:52.640 --> 44:53.640
Oh, the beat.

44:53.640 --> 44:54.640
Yeah, I would love.

44:54.640 --> 44:55.640
I'd love an emoji.

44:55.640 --> 44:57.640
What's your emoji?

44:57.640 --> 45:02.640
I think my emoji.

45:02.640 --> 45:04.640
I guess it can't be like a face.

45:04.640 --> 45:06.640
I would have to be.

45:06.640 --> 45:08.640
Is there a saxophone?

45:08.640 --> 45:09.640
I would be good.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.640
But that feels a Jeff.

45:11.640 --> 45:18.640
Well, I feel like sax was like sax was a thing in our old episodes.

45:18.640 --> 45:23.640
That we kind of did away with.

45:23.640 --> 45:26.640
That feels pro Jeff and you want one that's pro Marika.

45:26.640 --> 45:27.640
Right.

45:27.640 --> 45:29.640
The Marika plays the sax.

45:29.640 --> 45:31.640
It's true.

45:31.640 --> 45:32.640
I agree.

45:32.640 --> 45:35.640
I think it.

45:35.640 --> 45:39.640
I think it's too Jeff forward.

45:39.640 --> 45:40.640
Okay.

45:40.640 --> 45:43.640
Then go with the American flag.

45:43.640 --> 45:44.640
No.

45:44.640 --> 45:47.640
I don't want to be attributed to that.

45:47.640 --> 45:52.640
Maybe like that scary moon face.

45:52.640 --> 45:55.640
Is that fun?

45:55.640 --> 45:56.640
Which one scary?

45:56.640 --> 45:58.640
I don't think any of them are scary to me.

45:59.640 --> 46:01.640
Is it the one that's like this?

46:01.640 --> 46:02.640
It looks like.

46:02.640 --> 46:03.640
Yeah.

46:03.640 --> 46:04.640
Actually.

46:04.640 --> 46:06.640
Thank you, scary.

46:06.640 --> 46:10.640
Actually, I will comment the poodle on all of Jeff's posts.

46:10.640 --> 46:11.640
For on, yeah.

46:11.640 --> 46:12.640
I do that.

46:12.640 --> 46:20.640
I want to be the pizza emoji.

46:20.640 --> 46:21.640
That's good.

46:21.640 --> 46:22.640
It's not feel fair.

46:22.640 --> 46:23.640
Yeah.

46:23.640 --> 46:24.640
Great.

46:24.640 --> 46:25.640
Yeah.

46:25.640 --> 46:27.640
So comment the pizza emoji.

46:27.640 --> 46:34.640
If you think I should take over the show and then follow me on all on my socials.

46:34.640 --> 46:36.640
Listen to the pit wall.

46:36.640 --> 46:40.640
Which Jeff is not dating to show up for a week.

46:40.640 --> 46:43.640
So it's kind of just me in case you're running the joint.

46:43.640 --> 46:44.640
Yeah.

46:44.640 --> 46:48.640
Piles there sometimes.

46:48.640 --> 46:49.640
It's true.

46:49.640 --> 46:51.640
I want to come on.

46:51.640 --> 46:55.640
So that I can justify buying a F1 jacket.

46:55.640 --> 46:56.640
Okay.

46:57.640 --> 46:58.640
Okay.

46:58.640 --> 47:00.640
Can I have a gossip section?

47:00.640 --> 47:01.640
Yeah.

47:01.640 --> 47:04.640

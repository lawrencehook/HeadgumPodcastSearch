WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:32.000
Let's get straight into this fuckers.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Do you regret this segment at this point?

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Of course, but if I stop now, it's a failure.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
At least if I go to the cast, it might have made to last.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
I'm going to go to the cast.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
It's kind of good news that they haven't announced it.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
They need to start making the next bond, right?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
What's going on?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
The other one came out in what?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
2021?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Yeah, I think.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
And it was already ready to go two years before that.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
So yeah.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Right.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
I didn't see it.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
It was good.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
It was fine.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
You know, I had a dream.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
I think because I knew I was doing this today,

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
I had the most realistic dream last night that I was doing my own bond of the week,

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
but it was Mr. Thumbness of the Week for a Crawl of the Money.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
That's really funny.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
That doesn't exist.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Mr. Thumbness of the Week.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Wow.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
We should start doing that.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
We can pivot.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Yeah.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Who would it be though?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
So it's kind of like James McVoice the Go.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
That key of nature was okay.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
I was like, what about Murray Bartlett?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
And I was like, Ellie, that's so on the nose.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
You're so annoying.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Come up with something different.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
That's what they would do though.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
They would do it the other day.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
But it is true.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
That it's on the nose.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
They would cancel it.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
They would cancel it.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
They don't do the opposite thing.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
That's the whole thing.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
You know, that's why I have never written anything.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Yeah.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I'll say Andy Circus.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I really liked him in Andor.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
And I think he can actually play a pretty

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Dapper gentleman if they give him the chance.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
I think I won't pull Miss Scout.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Ha ha.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
That's a wee.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Talk to us.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Talking about right.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Thumbness.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Oh, you're talking.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I was talking about bond.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
I mean, Circus is bond.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Mr. Thumbness adaptor.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
He could be both.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Mr. Thumbness could be easily circus.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
I mean, that's an obvious choice.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Once con said,

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Beth's cow.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
I was like, oh, she's talking about bond.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
I know.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
I want to come out on this.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
I thought it was Thumbness.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
This is the Van Diagram that needs to be made.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Who can you go?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Ellie, you've thrown a real wrench in this.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
I already.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Sorry.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Thumbness and bond are now forever intertwined.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
They can't be untangled.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Well, I mean, you've been bond of the week as as James Mcboy.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
I love it.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
I love it.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
He does have their inch.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
You know what I might have to change.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I might have to change my bond of the week.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Um,

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
I might have to change it to Steve.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I mean, because as we all know,

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
the one chooses the wizard and now the bond

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
is choosing the lizard for monsters ink.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Hmm.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
What's that guy's name?

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
It's like stew or something.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Stew?

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah, that's the lizard's name.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Um, in what?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
In Barney and monsters ink.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Oh, my god.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Randall box.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
He's the bad guy, right?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
But let's call it Randall bond.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Good.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
My bond of the week is going to be Andy Samberg.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
All right.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Uh, that's those little icebreaker.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
You know, I wanted to go straight into a kind of warm

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Jake back up to the idea of this whole shabas

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
because you haven't been on for a couple months.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I think last time I'd have been what?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Gash cab.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
I don't take a huge sip.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
I'm going to go straight back to you ask me that.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
I think I was on since Gash cab.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I think I hope so.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
I'm not sure.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I guess you may be Ash cab.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Why?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah, I guess.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Please don't have to have.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Please.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I guess that would have been better.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
A better first one than Gash cab.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Which one?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
How would it have?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Oh, you did.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
It's about.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Yeah.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Was it me already?

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Do like skin disease game?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Yeah.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I did.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
What was that rash or not?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Probably.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
There's a leader while I take him on.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
I guess.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Um.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
We got to talk about St. Patrick's Day.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
It's today.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
It's also Miles birthday.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
I think I might specifically not wish him a happy birthday this year.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Does that make sense?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
That's good.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Yeah, that's cool.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
That way, he starts to sort of question like,

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Did I do anything to upset Jeff?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I don't think he's in a question.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
He knows that you basically hate him already.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Like he won't question that.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
That's true.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
That's true.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Maybe you go the other way.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Just overdo the celebratory.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
See, that is funnier.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
But I would have had to have planned like a delivery.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Like I would have had to have sent him a kind of expensive gift.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
And then he'll be like, are we that close?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Yeah.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
There's still time.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
What is this?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Is there?

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
I mean, he doesn't live in the city.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Yeah.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
You just call a local upstairs.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Yeah.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
A bakery or something.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
They could make a drop off happen for sure.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
That would be really funny.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
I think I'm going to work on that right now.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Hang on.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
You can get them like a roast.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Yeah.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Oh, I love.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
And then the milk could just be like,

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
I know this is your favorite.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Yeah.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
I pulled all the strings and I got you a roast after all.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
And after hours.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Yeah.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
What do you mean?

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
I want us to take over.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Well, you do your research.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Why don't you guys, why don't you guys hear?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I mean, because here's the thing, right?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I did an episode yesterday.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
It was, what was it?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Me and mere.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Casey and.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Emma.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Emma.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
And they really brought it.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
It was a good crew.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
They brought a lot of energy to it.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
They gave me the benefit of the doubt.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
That the episode might be actually fun to do.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
You guys are coming in expecting.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
I think Marie is the only one open to it being better.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
And so I'm.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
That's a pretty big projection on me.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
And I don't think that's fair.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
And this is a pretty big projection bond me.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
And it's just like a projected sandwich.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
There's no way you could have known.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
So let's just, you know, let's re-center.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Let's stay grounded.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Please.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
If I can ask this of you guys.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
And you guys just wax while I figure out the best birthday gift for piles acts.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Sure.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Yeah.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Sure.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Okay.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
I'm speaking of staying grounded.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I went to my.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
A.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Chiropractor person yesterday.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
And she said that.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
That's a thing I need to work on.

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
Just like bodily and mentally because currently my body is acting like this.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Like a.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Oh, it's rising.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
I don't.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Like a.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Like a.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
I'm so sorry.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I didn't wrap the've never done this.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
But can you send me piles of address?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Oh, yeah.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
I know it's.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
It's.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Road.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
No.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
It's not.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
But.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Hold on.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Yeah.

08:28.000 --> 08:35.000
She lived in a rye New York for like a solid two years.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
That's true.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Yeah.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Okay.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
So yeah.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
The point of that story is that now I'm constantly thinking about how

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
attends my body is and.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
It's not.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
It's not doing wonders for me.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
No totally.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
I'm the same way.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
I'm listening to you and I'm realizing that I'm also like this.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
You know, just hunched little Graham.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Yeah.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Energy.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
It's one out of the world.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
I'd like to.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
I'd like to talk to you about exposing your body to extreme temperatures.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Both heat and to love to do that.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
And I and I think it's actually.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
It's done wonders for my chronic pains in my body.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
So.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
I don't know.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I feel like getting you a little cold plunge.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
It's in the car.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Have you gone to the spa.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
That we.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
No.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
I brought from like that.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
It was a bad.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
So I decided to not go.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Quick enough.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
I was going to make for us.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
That is perfect.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
And I'm going to try and get him the biggest bouquet.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
I can afford right now.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Wow.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
All of that.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
And I wanted to look bad.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Okay.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Great.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Because I think it's going to be a hundred dollars.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Do you have that address?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Just in terms of the.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
I put it in the chat.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
And there it is.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Okay.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I'm going to meet myself.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
So I don't actually dox them.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Actually, you know what?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
I'm going to not meet myself.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Because I can censor it because we're not live.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
That's this chair.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Why do you have to say it?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Are you calling?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
He's going to call.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
He's going to get on call.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Right.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
That's really funny.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
I.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
I'm.

10:15.000 --> 10:21.000
I'm bummed to know that Michael went because I was going to offer my coupon to him for live.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
And actually cash.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Wow.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
And he would have taken you up on that.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
But now he knows that he doesn't like it.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
And you're.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
You're out.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Because he did took.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
He took a live.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
I knew what happened.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
I didn't.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
I haven't used mine yet.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
And I've been gifted.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Other gift cards to that place.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
So I have like.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
I'm calling.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I have two massages.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Well, I think one of LA is good.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Yeah.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Okay.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Thanks for saying that.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
I think.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
I think it's like a lot of.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Michael said it was just like very, very crowded.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
And people were like, we towels out everywhere.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Okay.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Just pie trap.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
No.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Not a good choice.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
I was really intrigued by the snow room though.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Yeah.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I don't want to go there.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Just for that.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
The snow room is interesting.

11:14.000 --> 11:24.000
Okay.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Do you have to look.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Like dialed in.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
I mean, when it comes to sending people.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Unwanted and unwanted gifts.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
It's like maybe his biggest passion.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Right.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
It's it's where he shines.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Yeah.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Where do I not shy?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Where do you not?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Because everywhere else.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
You're really.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
What about having hydrated looking hair?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Um, no.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
I think you're you're generally a dry guy.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Yeah.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
You have the dry eye.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Yeah.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
The split ends.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
You have the right.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Yeah.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Exima.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
That's.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Yeah.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
For a while there, I had a.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Soriotic arthritis.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
What happened?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
I still have it.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
It's just been.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Like psoriasis.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
What's that?

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Kiska say I'm going to Paris.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
What by the time this comes out, I will have gone to Paris.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Really?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Really?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
I'll be in here.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
No.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
I'm looking for you.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
No.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
What's happening?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
What's happening?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Next.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Next.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
I'm going to study abroad.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
But that's going to be domestically.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
And then after that, I'm going to go to Paris.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Yeah.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
What's happening?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Don't say to me.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
It was one.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
You talked about your personal.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
You say everyone else is addressed.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Let's just rain it in.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
All right.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Wait.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
So you're seriously going to Paris next weekend.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Correct.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
For how long?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
I had gum calendar.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Yeah.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
For how long?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Sorry, the counterpart of a week.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
and I will be checking the calendar.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
Are you going anywhere else or are you just going to do like a long weekend in Paris?

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
The plan is to be based out of

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
the Lithuania and these more.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Okay.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Make

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Oh,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
time a daytime trip to somewhere else.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
But we're just going to go to the fucking train station and then just decide there on the day.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Right.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
So you're going to Paris for five days then you're going to fly back to Los Angeles?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
In a way, yeah.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Well, that's quick.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
If it fits and shows.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Do you direct?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Uh, if I'll tell you.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
If you represent.

13:52.000 --> 13:59.000
When I was young when I was like six, I'll take Rex, but I'm not going to necessarily promise you that I'll go to where you suggested.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Does that make sense? Like,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I mean, this museum recommendation, it looked incredible.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
It was a little museum.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
There's a, there's a chassis and they too.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
And I was like, oh my god, that looks incredible.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
But then if you set me just, I just have to be honest about this.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Like, if Marie cassettes me something, it looks like horseshit.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
I'm not going to go.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
It doesn't really cool bar.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Actually, it went to like two really cool bars while I was there.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Harry's, I don't know.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
I don't remember. I'll find out.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
But you, there's also a cool little restaurant that gave me food poisoning and I threw up and

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
ship myself for 36 hours while I was there.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
So I can let you know.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
I was called, I don't think it was called like clown bar or something.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Oh, wait, that gave you food poisoning?

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Yeah, yeah.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Oh, that sucks.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
I almost was that.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Yeah.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
It was like, everybody else loved it.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Yeah.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I had food poisoning from it.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I turned it on the phone.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Did you know?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
That's pretty crazy.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Hello.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Yeah, it was fun.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
Is it possible to play the same day delivery order today?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Yeah.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
I was good.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
They can write a note by the way, Jeff.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
It's going to be like, I have some pretty good

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
New York Paris relax.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
And one of them is a museum, but it's a museum full of animal bones.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
It was crazy.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
The museum's are over.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
It's kind of never been to a museum.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
I'll say this museum.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
One room full of bones.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
You're in your out.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
You see some weird, you see some weird animals.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
There are weird fetus bones in the way that the human fetuses.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
It looked like little gremlins.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
I think about them all the time.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
They hot my dreams.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
I didn't take a photo of them because I was afraid they would curse my

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
phone.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Yeah.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
But I looked at them.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Jeff, did you get that order?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Or did they say they couldn't do it?

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
They couldn't do it.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
They couldn't do it, but it's not the only option.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
All right.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
It's not the only option.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Okay.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Jeff, you should go.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
My one recommendation that I think a genuine wreck

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
probably the place that I enjoyed the most was

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
a museum full of animal bones.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
And I think you should go there.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Okay.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
Wait, is that the Shaston edge you?

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
I don't think it was that.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
All right.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I think it is the gallery.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Day paleontology.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Okay.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Day.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Do it, but yeah.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
And.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Do you take French?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Did you take French?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Did I take French?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Or are you just doing Duolingo?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I took French in high school.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Nice, nice, nice.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Way, way, way, way.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Yeah.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Same way, same way.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Go ahead.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Go ahead.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I said, bombe.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I know, but that's what's that in French.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Yeah.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Uh.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
That was my favorite place.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
You know, the.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Did anyone go in the catacombs?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Those were cool.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
I think it's more of one of them.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
First time I went to Paris.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
This is so fucked up.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
It's like everyone in the greater area is working against me.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Giving pile flowers.

17:25.000 --> 17:32.000
Why is that everyone seems to be out to get me all the time?

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
I don't think that's necessarily.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Yeah.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Really?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Um.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Do you.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
I mean, maybe there's like a grocery store cake that you could get them.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
That's true.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
I just really.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I think sending him an unsettling.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Large bouquet is really funny.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
And he'll just like, that's going to be the thing.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
I'm like, why?

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
We're not close.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Like that.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Right.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
They should be really romantic.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
See me too.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Yeah.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Doesn't like not celebrate.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Not yet.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Not celebration flowers.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Absolutely not.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Yeah.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Keep waxing.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Don't let me get in the way.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Sorry.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Sorry.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Um.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Okay.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
I know.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
I.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I know what you mean with me is.

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
So I like ones that are weird and niche and like a strange.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I can't believe that that's why it.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
How is this still in business type of museum?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Yeah.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Yeah.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
I'm sorry.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
I feel about all these florists because like kind of more fucking open.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
Don't tell us to wax and then interrupt us with your shit.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
Ali was about to tell us about a museum that she went to.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
I know.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
I didn't.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
I won't.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
I went to the second largest museum.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
Like collection of tax-dermied frogs once.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Because I was.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
I was sick and I was like a bunch of people were going on a trip.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
I couldn't go on the trip.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
And so like me and one person left over.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Who's like there to keep me company because they felt bad.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
We were like that's not that's an empty.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
And it was actually so cool.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Where was this museum?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
It was in.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
It was in.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
It was in.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
It was.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I was calling to see if you guys could do a sale.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
All right.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
That's the right today.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
I know.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
It was just wondering.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Yeah.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
I found great museums.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
Like if I could like snap my fingers and be in one and experience one.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Great.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
But I wouldn't.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
So I'm really just looking.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
I'm not ever like waking up.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I can't see a lot of museum going in.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Okay.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
And the feed wandering around finding the exhibit.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
It's one of my first birthday.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
But I kind of want to inconvenience him with how large the bouquet is.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
If that's possible.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Can't believe he's giving us.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
We didn't reason.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Like I don't want to like stress you out.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
And I also, you know.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
So yeah, you know it.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Yeah.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
For you get it.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
They don't get it.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
You get it.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
You get it.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I want to annoy my friends.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
You understand.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Well, no.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
I'll do just.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Hand telling.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
He has bosses.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
I'm sure.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
I don't call it a boss.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Obviously.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
That works.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Yeah.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Um.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
I.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I'm a really fast museum gore.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I'm like really speedy.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
So the the name is.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
And I can't.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I can't deal with like stopping and staring.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Yeah.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
For five minutes.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Oh, yes.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Yeah.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I need to.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
That's another thing.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
I need to be moving.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
And if I'm in a museum with a group of people.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
And they're appreciating art.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Yeah.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Okay.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
But then then inevitably you go through the whole entire thing.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
And you have to go and.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
And then you have to want to go back.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Yeah.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Yeah.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
That's the worst.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
I once realized I needed to break up with someone because we were incompatible.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Museum goers together.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
It was like.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Yeah.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
I was behind me.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
And I was like, I can't live my life like this.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Yeah.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
That's a.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
I got to keep a movement.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
I.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
I.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
I just like to go.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
I just like to go for what I want to see.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I'll just speed through.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
I'll look at both sides of the room.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I'll be like, hey, let's go.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Yeah.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Maybe I'll stop.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Like some brush.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
I'm on my way.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
But it's geo.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
I feel.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
I like some really basic museum stuff.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Like I would go to the net and just like.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Look at Picasso's or something.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Like what you're supposed to do.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
You know, the first museum.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Yeah.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
The first museum.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
I like field trip museum stuff.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
I'm not like cultured enough to be.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Going any deeper than that.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
You're not like searching for exhibitions.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Yeah.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Yeah.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Yeah.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
I don't think so.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
I'm like, okay.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
I have an afternoon free.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Should I go see a Monet?

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
I guess.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Sure.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Yeah.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
That's a good.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
But I mean, I would never do that.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
I would never do that.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
I'm not cultured.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
I'm not cultured.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Um.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Yeah.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
I.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
I'm trying to think of.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
I one really weird museum that I went to.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
When I was in London one time was like a museum of.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Like.

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
Oh, it was like advertise me advertising like boxes.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
Like old serial boxes, old like product design stuff.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
And it was just like a really dark winding.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
Couple of rooms like packed with a bunch of old like tide boxes.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
And it was really.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
It's done.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
It's going to address.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
She said she got the assignment.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
I said happy birthday, love Jeff.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
I think I think it's the funniest version of this to me is just.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
It's kind of actually a nice gift.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
But it's just a little off.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Yeah.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
You didn't get barely wrote any.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
Why'd you do this?

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Yeah.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Yeah.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
So did you find a flower?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Is there anything?

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Yeah.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
What is the secret?

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
What are you looking for?

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
And I said I wanted to just be as large as possible.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
I said somewhat comically large.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
And then she said great.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Do you want to just stems or in a vase?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
And I said.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
And then she said in a vase.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
And then I was like, actually.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I, that's going to cost like another $40.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
So I was just like.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Hmm.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Just the stems.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
It's funny as a vase.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
He has a.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
But you don't know what the flowers are going to be.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
They don't care.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
They don't need to be beautiful.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
They just need to be plentiful.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Uh, they just need to be big.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
We have to.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
Guys, getting to know yourself can be a lifelong process.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Right?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
We're always learning, growing, linking, building, et cetera.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
And changing.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
And therapy is all about deepening yourself awareness and understanding.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
Because sometimes we don't know what we want or why we react the way we do

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
until we talk things through with an objective third party.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
BetterHelp is here to help with that exact thing.

23:37.000 --> 23:43.000
Because BetterHelp connects you with a licensed therapist who can take you on that journey of self discovery from wherever you are.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Right?

23:44.000 --> 23:50.000
Wherever you're coming from, if you've never done therapy, if you've been in therapy for years, you can always come to BetterHelp and they will match you with a licensed therapist.

23:50.000 --> 23:56.000
I am in therapy every week or at least as much as I try to be because my sessions are at 10 a.m. on Monday and I miss them a lot.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Uh, no, it is, it is huge for me.

23:58.000 --> 24:06.000
It's, it's very grounding and helps me kind of show up in my life towards other people as the best version of myself that I can be at that time.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
Uh, and if you have the access to therapy, I would highly recommend it.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
So if you're thinking of starting therapy, start with BetterHelp.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Give it a try.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
It's entirely online designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
Cause we're going to fuck up some rise.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Is anyone else home?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Yeah.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
I go.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
I constantly have a version of that songs.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
Like in my head that gossip King sang.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Yeah.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
Where they're just like, I know there's apples in here.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
And I got that.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
Some love that now you now have this tickle.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
We're going to fuck up some rise.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
You shouldn't be allowed into France.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
What if I solve the strikes?

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
All right.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
So we're clearly not keeping up with international politics.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Got it.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Yeah.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
I'm aware they're striking.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Jake is.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
You guys didn't laugh.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Just kind of in shock.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
Like the thought of you.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Like holding down.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Uh, pick it line sort of thing.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Yeah.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Negotiating with a French union.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Given your limited high school.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
I mean, you just say.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
I think the same.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Yeah.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
It's failing.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Yeah.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
I mean, during negotiations.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
It's been like, that's good to say.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
No.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
No.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
So you don't know anything.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Even if you don't say.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
It turns out it only took the better part of a week.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Five days and done.

26:37.000 --> 26:47.000
All it was a dumbass American in Paris.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Do you guys have any notes on those lyrics?

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
I want to get them perfect.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
The sand one I do want to circle back to because it didn't kind of feel like at that point

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
you were making upwards again.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Yeah.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Well, no, it's just that the song is really fast.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Do you mind if I do it again?

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Yeah.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Yeah.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
We're going to fuck up some rides.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Pretty nice.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
There's no tracks.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
You win the race.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Unapologetic.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
When we fuck up some rides.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
We're going to ruin some rides.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
That you'll see.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
That you'll burn rice.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
That you too much soy.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
That you'll soil sand.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
Does I feel like burning some rides?

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Yeah.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
I don't know who the fucks some rides are.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
Because we're going to fuck up some rides.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
Bet you you'll.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
What was it?

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
Bet you you'll soil sand.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Well, there was the others.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
That you you'll see.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
That you'll burn rice.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
That you too much soy.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Bet you.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
That you'll soil sand.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Bet you you'll soil sand.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Yes.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Was that you wrote and chose?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Does everything.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
It was a it was a pleasing track.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Actually, really enjoyed it.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
I was great.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
I put on about the lyrics and my performance.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
I thought the lyrics.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
They were, yeah, it was rich.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
So much soy.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
Bet you you'll soil sand.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Why that?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Why, why you you'll burn rice?

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Bet you you'll soil sand.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Well, this isn't mean.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Yeah, because that very.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Basically, okay.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
So, if you're I don't like.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Diving into my lears isn't.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
You're a little more scary.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
But, I mean,

28:39.000 --> 28:43.560
diving into my lyricism, but based on the idea of this song, and I'll be like,

28:43.560 --> 28:47.280
diving into your lyricism, why did you sing the song back to a slower,

28:47.280 --> 28:49.120
and ask what we thought about the lyrics?

28:53.120 --> 28:55.520
It's not like you needed to dive into the lyrics.

28:55.520 --> 29:00.760
I also didn't ask you to define the lyrics so much as I asked you to

29:00.760 --> 29:03.720
define what your soil sand means.

29:03.720 --> 29:08.560
The narrator is setting out to ruin rice.

29:08.640 --> 29:14.800
Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. And so that's going to entail

29:14.800 --> 29:18.720
seeing some char burning the rice. Maybe it's burning because you've

29:18.720 --> 29:22.960
added too much soy, but also ultimately what you will be doing

29:22.960 --> 29:30.640
is soiling sand. To me, as we've kind of, that was the consistency of sand.

29:30.680 --> 29:35.080
Right. Right. Yes. Rice is as a result.

29:36.520 --> 29:40.440
You'll soil sand, which is, now we don't have to move on, because you're saying

29:40.440 --> 29:43.480
you'll soil sand. But you're the one ruining the rice, and then you're

29:43.480 --> 29:48.080
seeing two someone that they will soil the sand. But yeah, it's kind of like

29:48.080 --> 29:51.780
in the spirit still of the original song lyrics, which is beyond

29:51.780 --> 29:57.280
saying we are all going to collectively fuck up the night. But in this

29:57.280 --> 30:02.720
in the case it's we're gonna find some rice right okay I want to ruin some

30:02.720 --> 30:09.520
rice are those are all of those in the Beyonce song um do they all start with

30:09.520 --> 30:12.240
Betch you yeah

30:15.360 --> 30:19.200
that you use more soy why wasn't it that instead

30:19.840 --> 30:23.840
haha I don't know

30:26.000 --> 30:31.680
sense of ponder but I in general really like yeah that was nice thank you for

30:31.680 --> 30:35.280
sharing yeah welcome to realer Jake

30:36.400 --> 30:43.120
op-edition so this is gonna be an either-or game this one's uh called realer Jake

30:43.120 --> 30:47.520
op-edition but it's basically half of these are real New York time

30:48.400 --> 30:53.360
New York Times op-ed article titles and then some of these are just op-edts that Jake would

30:53.360 --> 30:55.360
write for sure

30:56.400 --> 31:01.520
so great uh you just guys have to tell me whether I'm gonna read out these headlines and you

31:01.520 --> 31:06.080
tell me whether they're real or Jake got it yeah okay I should know these you should

31:06.080 --> 31:10.640
because I mean right yeah and you know your opinions better than we do but I think we

31:10.640 --> 31:15.120
have no idea yeah and I think you you have a strong enough personality that we know

31:15.120 --> 31:18.400
what you would write and what you would the opinions you would hold to be true so here we

31:18.400 --> 31:24.240
got to tell everyone what I think about museums all right yeah go ahead chat GPT and the human mind

31:24.240 --> 31:29.040
how do they compare that's got to be NYT I don't give a fuck

31:31.440 --> 31:33.600
that is that's correct

31:34.720 --> 31:41.040
guess um here we go why I think brown employees shouldn't have health care from the co-founder of

31:41.040 --> 31:46.160
head-go trick question that sounds like a a marty

31:48.960 --> 31:55.200
correct no that was uh yeah okay you don't have to I'll give you that one that was that was you

31:55.200 --> 31:58.640
but I'll give you the other is correct I mentioned where more pink

32:02.960 --> 32:08.160
New York Times yeah that correct feels like that was that was in the

32:08.160 --> 32:15.040
Times like yesterday I feel like that sounds like it came from 2008 yeah I think everyone

32:15.040 --> 32:20.560
wears the enough of the right colors it's fine I've never gone out be like there's there's

32:20.560 --> 32:24.560
there's not enough pink more than wearing a yellow sweater which I think is a good representation

32:24.560 --> 32:32.080
of the color yellow yeah okay here we go why I redirected charity funds from a 24 hour live stream

32:32.080 --> 32:41.200
to my personal checking account I mean you're accusing me of doing that but I didn't

32:41.200 --> 32:49.600
do that and I wouldn't publicly try to do with Jake how to get kids to hate it has to go through

32:49.600 --> 32:53.600
my account by the way it has to filter through my account so I can do it out appropriately

32:54.240 --> 33:14.640
which is a real opinion interesting how to get kids to run errands for you as

33:14.640 --> 33:17.760
for as little pens as possible like the olden days

33:18.240 --> 33:29.920
Halcyon wallets it don't mail themselves it's not correct why Jesus loved friendship

33:36.720 --> 33:44.240
we're gonna find out some rice you think that's me kind of feel like it's you and be

33:44.400 --> 33:52.320
that's a real one that's a question that I've asked before in like religion classes because

33:52.320 --> 33:57.440
you know I'm Jewish and I don't know but I was like to Jesus have friends do you have like a friend

33:57.440 --> 34:01.840
group and their my teacher was like well he had a postals I'm like that's not the same yeah that's

34:01.840 --> 34:07.120
like saying everyone who works in headgum is my friend only some of them are I don't know anything

34:07.120 --> 34:13.120
about Michelle I've never met Narissa and guess what and she's never in town she doesn't even live in

34:13.280 --> 34:21.200
LA I know them I'm I'm like on good terms with them are we friends absolutely not really

34:21.200 --> 34:25.600
you're not friends with Michelle or Angie or Narissa I think Angie and I have a sort of rapport

34:27.120 --> 34:34.080
I could see that sort of like a yeah you're friendly you're friendly with every

34:34.240 --> 34:43.440

Jake's always talking about that yeah I like to get into that really it had a

35:00.320 --> 35:05.360
prose that was interesting to me uthanasia and Canada like that's nice

35:09.600 --> 35:13.120
which whole feels better for the girl I'm genuinely asking

35:14.080 --> 35:23.840

I feel like I could afford to be a little less anger towards y'all so what I but also

37:01.120 --> 37:05.600
let's be honest I mean I'm also met with a lot of vitriol every time I'm on the mic

37:06.560 --> 37:13.360
so I thought what what's that I was I was a green I feel like you're yeah it's it's an

37:13.360 --> 37:21.440
antagonistic relationship between you and your guess yeah so I thought that we could sit here and just

37:21.440 --> 37:32.080
kind of learn about anger the way a child does so I found this British audiobook about anger it's

37:32.080 --> 37:39.440
called when I am angry by Michael Gordon uh children's audiobook read aloud on how to overcome anger

37:39.440 --> 37:44.560

illustrated by Max Lauren as you may or may not know it's not fun feeling mad

40:20.960 --> 40:27.040
it's even worse when you're angry with your mum or your dad so that's right

40:28.000 --> 40:31.680
sorry can we just give it our full attention you said we could pause

40:34.240 --> 40:40.960
we're asking for a pause I was asking for a pause for my commentary

40:42.640 --> 40:47.040
that shows I was paying attention thank you I really didn't mean to flash out at you like that I'm

40:47.040 --> 40:52.080
sorry yes I was on doubt so I'm glad that we paused because now I'll start listening to the next

40:52.080 --> 40:56.720
part all right let's just really focus up because I'm on my woodson it comes around and once

40:56.800 --> 41:02.560
to ruin your day get rid of it fast so you can continue to play

41:03.840 --> 41:07.920
for the most part Josh was sweet and as far as can be

41:08.800 --> 41:16.320
except when he lost his temper which was odd it can I pause for a second yeah right so Josh was

41:16.320 --> 41:21.840
fun and as sweet as could be except for when he lost his temperature or temper excuse me um you're

41:21.920 --> 41:27.120
like a piece of shit all the time is I don't think that you have the like redeeming

41:27.120 --> 41:34.560
qualities that this child Josh seems to have like if you get rid of your anger who are you

41:34.560 --> 41:39.760
you're you're still kind of dumb you're boring you're dry you're all over the place you're

41:39.760 --> 41:51.120
dictating to caffeine so yeah you're right yeah so I just want to I just want you to know that like

41:51.200 --> 41:54.800
I wouldn't relate too much to Josh but maybe he has some like coping mechanisms

41:54.800 --> 42:00.800
that you can pull from okay you can play so you think if I wanted to solve my anger at least

42:00.800 --> 42:06.800
you think I need to develop like more of a personality in general yeah in general yeah

42:06.800 --> 42:15.360
today's angry mind started just after morning play Josh wanted cake before lunch but his mum said

42:15.440 --> 42:25.120
no way Josh started to breathe heavily his heart beating fast he greeted his teeth and hoped

42:25.120 --> 42:31.760
the feelings wouldn't last mum taught Josh a trick to stop anger from ruining his day

42:32.880 --> 42:42.000
pretend anger is a ball and throw that ball far away Josh threw three big balls of anger as far

42:42.000 --> 42:50.640
as he could okay yeah yeah I can see the odd I can see the illustrations now

42:51.440 --> 42:57.120
it's nice to know what Josh looks like yeah balls of anger as far as he could

42:57.920 --> 43:06.480
before long it was all gone and Josh was feeling good he sat down and ate lunch and had cake

43:06.480 --> 43:14.640
when he was done mum was proud that Josh had batted his anger and won when Josh was at the

43:14.640 --> 43:21.360
park with his sister later that day they saw a black and white cat that mum said was a stray

43:22.160 --> 43:29.840
Josh wanted to keep the cat and take it home with them all when mum said no Josh got angry

43:30.480 --> 43:39.280
he threw an anger ball although it's made him feel better he was still really what's an anger ball

43:39.280 --> 43:42.960
I think it's the illustration that we just saw where it's Josh like you're on the ball of his own

43:42.960 --> 43:48.640
emotion it's like yeah it's like a rage ball it's an imaginary ball this time I was envisioning it

43:48.640 --> 43:54.240
it was a physical ball when I was little and I got angry I would go hit a tennis ball in the wall

43:54.320 --> 44:00.080
so that's what I was imagining yeah this this reminded me of us of something I saw yesterday

44:00.080 --> 44:06.960
which was like a kid skateboarding down the street with his babysitter kind of like chasing after

44:06.960 --> 44:12.240
him I think he was like eight or nine years old and she kept on yelling at him to like stop at

44:12.240 --> 44:17.680
every stop sign and then at one point he's just like rolling down towards the stop sign he turned

44:17.680 --> 44:30.400
her and yelled I hope I die and he was so angry it was I was like my god I'm so happy I'm not this

44:30.400 --> 44:39.600
this poor woman although it's made him feel better he was still really mad so his sister suggested

44:39.600 --> 44:46.000
a trick she learned from their dad dad said when you feel he had an angry father had said

44:46.080 --> 44:49.600
when you feel so angry that you just want to shout out I think you're going to Josh

44:49.600 --> 44:58.640
having an angry dad sorry counter to four and then let it all out this worked well for Josh soon

44:58.640 --> 45:04.960
he was back to enjoying his day until he was in the front yard later trying to play

45:05.680 --> 45:12.800
some big boy the head you know he shouldn't need to do this meant like this is a lot of like

45:13.200 --> 45:18.480
yeah not coping mechanisms for like yeah no it's like you don't have people it's like

45:18.480 --> 45:25.200
hair trigger I'm so fucking mad that I can't keep a cat that I can't have cake he's just always

45:25.200 --> 45:32.240
ready to lose his shit unless he's like holding his breath I don't think maybe Josh is a lot like you

45:33.680 --> 45:37.440
I think he should have been able to keep the cat I think that's a mistake on the mom

45:38.400 --> 45:42.720
they have room it would teach him some responsibility it would be an emotional support animal

45:42.720 --> 45:46.160
I do want to say back to Jake like any meat to Josh which I don't think is fair

45:48.720 --> 45:53.520
I it's not a compliment though because earlier to insult to Josh

45:56.720 --> 46:01.520
yeah because earlier I was saying Jeff is a piece of shit and Josh is like otherwise fine but it sounds like

46:02.080 --> 46:10.720
Josh's a rise is this how we find out that Jeff is Josh yeah Jeff is Michael Gordon

46:12.960 --> 46:19.360
this story is about me by the way we didn't talk enough about how Michael Gordon is like so close to

46:19.360 --> 46:27.520
Michael Jordan and we actually had a joke in the Gordon sketch it was an off day's Gordon sketch

46:27.760 --> 46:34.400
with John George where he's like well then why are the shoes called air Gordon after the best

46:34.400 --> 46:39.760
basketball player of all time Michael Gordon is like it's Michael Jordan and he's like really

46:40.480 --> 46:47.760
what are these what are these I can we all agree and you know pitch maybe by a show of hands

46:48.720 --> 46:50.800
this guy should have been this kid should have been spanked

46:50.800 --> 46:59.680
like he gets angry because he was never overdads me

47:03.040 --> 47:08.480
it's fine to be angry mom say not like that but don't let it ruin your day

47:09.200 --> 47:16.880
on proud of how you've calm down by sending anger away the end you know I feel like that's a

47:16.960 --> 47:23.280
lesson that a lot of adults need to learn even still I mean you're not going to run

47:23.280 --> 47:33.280
anger balls don't let anger in your day yeah so you know it's a little counter-intuitive

47:33.280 --> 47:37.360
because I'm a little pissed I have to say that you guys didn't seem to be really fully paying attention

47:37.360 --> 47:48.800
giving it your whole jay kasi alosi murri kasi hmm oh what's that white

47:48.800 --> 47:52.960
does that mean you guys didn't give it your all but what does that can you tell

47:56.240 --> 48:04.160

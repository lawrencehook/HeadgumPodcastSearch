WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
I feel like the intro doesn't get enough love

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
in terms of it being all done.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
You started without our permission.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
You just started too fast.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
I was like fixing things.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
We were talking about a technical issue.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
That is ongoing, we should say.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Yeah.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
I can't hear myself.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Am I sounding good to you guys?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
I can't hear you.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Is your mic on?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
It says it's on.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
What about this?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
That's better.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Yeah.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
All right.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
That's so much worse.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
That's it.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Yeah.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
That was good.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
That was good.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Thanks.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I really needed to hear that actually.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Not you.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
No, not you.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
I'm a stroke.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
About how do your voice is bad.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
For on one today, huh?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
This is messed up.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
We've got Emma.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
What's that?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
As opposed to any other day?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Three on one would be fine.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Three on one's better.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
You're hearing their voices.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
We've got two New Yorkers in from the East Coast.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
You've got Emma Foley on the sacs.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Marie could brown down the facts.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Rounding it out.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
What's that?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
You said woo.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
It's hard.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
We've talked about this so much.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Sure.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Again, one, two, three, four screens.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Five if you count them on.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
I'll never want to sound the same.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
No.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
This is not how I wanted to start the show.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
We've got a lot to get to by the way.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Okay.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Great.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Then we've got Ali Khan.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
And on your kind of sky.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Bringing up the rear.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
He did it.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Really nice.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I nailed it the first.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
I forget why I was watching this.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
I think I was trying to get inspiration going forward from the past.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Because if you can't learn from the past,

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
history is bound to repeat itself.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Ali.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
You agree?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Yeah, I agree.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
That's good.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Single do you up because Jewish?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
No, I got that.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Oh my god.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Is this what the whole hour's going to be?

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
It's going to be you guys catching me and some kind of.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
You're trying to cancel me.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
That's what's happening.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
This is gotcha journalism.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Not a sponsor.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
What is going on with this table?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Don't.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Don't.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
You just.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Can you show the table?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
No.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Can you pick the table up and bring it into the.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Bring it into the frame.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Don't show.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Yeah.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
That's true.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Yeah.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
That's for our only fans.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Oh.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
We should say.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Can we go down the line?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Let's start with Emma.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
As if I'm reading a book.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
What you guys were in the middle of doing?

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
You all four of you are really busy.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
And if you can just go down the line and say what you were busy with,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
that I pulled you away from to do this show.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Sorry, Emma.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I was editing social videos for.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
I had no podcasting.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
You're super.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I should be really important because that's ahead.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Gamma original.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
On you?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
No.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
I was kind of in a conversation with like three different

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
departments about some ad reads that need to go up like tomorrow.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Like yesterday.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Fuck.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Alley.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
I was compiling a brand logos and lot in guidelines to make really cool cue cards

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
for a shoot coming up.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
The branded shoot we should say.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Yeah.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Branded.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Making money for the network.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
That keeps shows like this a float.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Yes.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Team numbers.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
You'll never even touch.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Of course.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
And you mean for the show or ever in my life?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Oh.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Rico.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I was setting up.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
I was talking to Andrew Pile or CTO over Google

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
and setting up a server.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Yeah.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Server for the network and the office.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
That that was what you pulled me away from.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
It's actually finishing the review.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
The way he won't let you speak.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Speak.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Yeah.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
That's true.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
So true.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Queen.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
You guys flew halfway across the country.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
All the way across the country.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
I was like.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Unless you take the country.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
It's like your house.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
The sugar and falls.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
The last pick package that I had to ship there for my mom's birthday.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
She said, shag ring falls.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Doing this show.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Perfect to scale rep.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
We'll go by the way.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
The studio.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Set up a parent's garage.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
We watch the old tapes.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Yeah.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
That's the thing.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I just went to the dead and company show.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
It was the final one in San Francisco.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
And the thing with the grateful that is that people listen to the old shows.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
They're like, oh, there's these tapers.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
And they tape every show.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
You can listen to every show.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
And tell me about it.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
I think it'd be interesting if people did that for the headgun podcast.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Right.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
So people set up like a tape deck.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
And they're recording their speakers at home.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
This podcast coming out of the speakers.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
And it's like, oh, my God.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Like, they were really cooking spring 23.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
You know what I mean?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
That's not the same thing.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
That's not the same thing.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
That's the same thing.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
We would have to be doing live.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
That would.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
What you can do is.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Sure.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
And we eventually go on tour.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Ask people to boot like our live shows.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
People.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I'd say it's for like the people that come on the pole.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Get some like old camcorders.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
And people can like wear a little.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
Uh, where they call trench coats and like record them.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Um, speaking of.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Uh, Katie Moose in the studio for the first time ever.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
I think.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
What do you mean?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
She's never.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Well, she's always in.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
She'd say.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
On.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
What do I think?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
And um, she, she made it.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I think it was because you guys are in town.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Yeah.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
What's that?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Definitely was.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
I mean, she's been here a lot for the past couple of weeks.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Because of the branded show.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Yeah.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
She's done like her overnight.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Watch.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
What is this?

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
Um, but she poked her head into the studio as I was setting up.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
And she was like, by the way, we haven't forgotten about the.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
It's squeaking.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
So loud.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
We had to push the whole desk back because of.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
The room for the producer cam for all the cables that are never plugged into the right thing.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Because every show has a different set up, by the way.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
I try to stick to the chef cabin method.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
I try to keep stick to the on your Casey approved method.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
But every time I come in here, this cables plugged into this hard drive.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
This fucking thing is set up for some live stream that barely happened, by the way.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
And I'll say chef coming was the last person to be in here.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Really.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Also there right now.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Yeah.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Um.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Katie poked her head in and she said, we haven't forgotten.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
We've forgotten about the tour.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
We're just trying to figure out some shit and we're trying to.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
She basically said, and I don't know if I should say this on here.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
That money's tight.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
And we were thinking.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Like San Bernardino.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Mm-hmm.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Like as like the farthest that we could afford to have you go.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Maybe Baker's field.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
San Luis Obispo.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
That seems that's a college town.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Yeah.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
That's kind of cool college town.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
That feels like too far.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
That's too far.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Yeah.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
It's considered.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
San Ana.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Too far.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Where the wind comes from?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
When they make winds.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Antonio.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Too way too far.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
We cannot.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Sand's Jeff.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
At the Vegas.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Sand's resort.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Um.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Sand's Jeff resort.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
You mean you meant the like in the French.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Like without.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
In the French quarter.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
In the by you.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
No.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
She meant like without you.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Like Sans.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
I feel like we're not.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Is it comics?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Because that was good.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
And you didn't even react.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
I built off that.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
I guess I ended.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
I guess.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
You didn't say hello to me when I walked in this morning.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Yes.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
I did.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I walked specifically.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
I interrupted the conversation.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
I said hi.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
I didn't even do that to America.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
I just.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
To America.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
I walked five.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
What did I say?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
To me.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
What is this?

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Should we tell Jack what we learned yesterday in our.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Um.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Had done bonding activity about the Great Wall of China.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
That it's constructed.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Oh, yes.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Yes.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
I thought of him.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
I thought of you.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
It was the consistency of sand.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
What is it then?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Even better.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
It's better than that.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
It's like pieces of it are like stuck together with the mortar.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
It's made out of glutinous rice.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
And yeah.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
That was a fun fact that we had to learn during a team bonding activity.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
And why did you guys do that?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Marty.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
We played play like it on.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
I got to miss it.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
But then I heard this kind of fun.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Honestly.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
It was fun.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
And I mean, on you saying that because she won.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
On.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
And my team I think was dead last the entire time.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Yeah.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
We were in first place the whole time.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
It was me Casey Brad and Sage.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
And I think it wasn't there.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
I was on on you.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Yeah.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Sage is fast really.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
I don't know.

08:41.000 --> 08:48.000
It was on fairly stack because I think it was on your Brad Sage.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
And Casey I think was on our team.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Jeff was not there.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
I'm hearing a buzz.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I'm just a friend.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
That's just the energy in the room.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
I mean, it's a buzz with this shit.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
It is a trick.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I'm liking that everyone.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
IRL.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
It's electric.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
That'd be a good burnt rice.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Yeah.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Jeff's being really goofy.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Jeff was like, you're not being combat.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
It's because we're.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Because you're with the lead.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Yeah.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
There's like a feminine energy in the room.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
That's.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Girls don't.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Another rice parody to only girl in the world by Rihanna.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Because the bridge of it sounds like let me make you rice.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
And still fries.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
And I already thought that.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
So I'd love.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Wait, what's the secret from that one?

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
It's like, let me make you rice.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
That's so good.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
What make you feel like it's the only grain in the world?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Yeah.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
That's really good.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Like I'm the only.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
A char that you'd ever love.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
And this is why people think it's easy to do what I do.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
It's then you see somebody take a crack at it.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
And it's not the same.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
No.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
If it was.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
Want you to char the grains like I'm the only parboiled in the world.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
That it kind of.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
It's about a plant rhyme.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
Let's check in Emma has post production on the short.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
You're doing.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I'm still waiting to hear back from festivals.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
And I also want to just.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Correct the record from last time.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I can do the sound at it.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
I didn't have enough time.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Because if.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Here's the thing about heavy gum too.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
That people don't understand.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
They're not.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Super supportive of outside endeavors.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Would you say?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Like you're.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
This is a place and crank me if I'm wrong.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
You're not.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
You are.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Well, because when I was going to say.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Uh, is that.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
You kind of have to hide your other passions.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
You know what I mean?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Like like on your.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
You you host the love motel.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
All right.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
It online radio show.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
I will say something about the love motel that is funny.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Which is.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
And vis-a-vis what you're saying.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
To have a.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
I've had a.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Little.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Not.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
To have.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I've had a little.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
I have a little.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
I have a little.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Tell flyer with little like you can like rip off the.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Terrible number.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Um, eight five seven dial love.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
It's been in the kitchen since pretty much since my first.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
I put it up because I thought it'd be cute.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Mm-hmm.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
And like.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Three weeks ago, Marty was like, what is that?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Who does that?

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
We talked about that specifically and how it's like my.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Little personal project in my interview for so long.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
It was on my resume.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
It was like part of the thing that I like.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
It was how I got hired.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
He had no idea.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
He was like it's on the actual radio.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
He looked at me like I was crazy.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Right.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Major killer.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
You have to plug your shit.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
You know what I mean?

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Like you don't be like bashful about like extra.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
What's that?

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
You're not in your head like you understand what I'm not sure you do.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Basically like like you do the love motel.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
You should be saying that every day you come in to the work.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
And.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
I thought it was funny.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
I just thought it was funny that my like boss didn't know.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
No, I agree.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
But at the same time.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Yeah.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
You can't expect anyone, you know, to read your mind, right?

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
Like if you're in romantic partnership with someone, you have to ask for what you want.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
You know what I mean?

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
You can't be like sulking, honestly.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Is this an audition?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Four co-hosts.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Yep.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
That's right.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
It is the supervising producer to co-host track.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
A mirror basically said on last week's episode.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
All right.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Can I help you, Morgan?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
There's a lot of buzzing in my ear.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
And I'm scared that's affecting the recording.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
I'm here in a crystal clear.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Actually, it's okay.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
It's okay.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
You hear that?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
No, no, no.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
I think it sounds good.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
You have to ask what for what you want in any part of your shit.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
We're listening.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
We're doing deep listening.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
And here's the thing.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
If Grace Harper can't get that out, then I think she's shit.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Oh, you know what it might be?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
It might be Jeff's mic because it,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
You definitely have to turn that way up.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Right.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
For us to hear it.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I just turned it down and still there.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
But I can't hear it.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
I can't hear it.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
I think it's okay.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Okay.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
It's like so subtle that I can't tell if I'm about to hear it.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Yeah.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
It's more just like I'm scared.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
It's messed up.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Well, here's the thing.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
What hear about it in the comments?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Where are you talking about?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
I'm here.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Did you just call me a mirror?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Yeah.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
You were talking about me sitting.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
What were you talking about?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
I'm here.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Yeah.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Got it.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
I'm looking for what you want in relationship.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
I fucking think that's what you're saying.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
You didn't make sense.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
And how do you do things?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
How do you do things?

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
How do you do things about landing with me?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
But how do you do that in your relationship?

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
I don't feel comfortable talking about that.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Here's what's on the limits for me.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Any interpersonal relationships.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Any interpersonal relationships.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
Like that part of me that I can only access that one wonderful time of the year.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
We're talking Christmas.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
We're on January 7th.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
That's generous season.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
And now it's summer.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
I'm in the thick of being selfish.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Where I live.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Absolutely.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Off limits.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
And I would never do that to you.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Follow the Scrooge calendar.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
You know, I've been trying to find like my tiny Tim.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I think it might have to be pile.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
Just like a scrappy young lad who I need to help out on Christmas morning.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
He send a cooked goose to his door next.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Or so as flowers.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah.

14:23.000 --> 14:30.000
He's the only person I got a birthday gift for this year to date.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
My sister and dad both had birthdays.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
I only got yep.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
I want to know what your gag budget is for the show.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
I don't know.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
All I know is that I didn't know I know.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Here's what happened.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
I had a credit card.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
So here's so I graduated from college.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
I got a job writing for a TV show where they overpaid us to do not a lot of work.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
And that was when I got a credit card.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Credit limit was way too high.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
It was good for what I was making then.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Got fired at the beginning of the pandemic.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Had this credit limit for a long time.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
I treated it like a gift card.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I could have.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I got rid of any credit.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
I had debit card out the wasoo for two years.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
And should we pull that up again?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
No, we should not.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Okay.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I just recently got a credit card and it's happening again.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Okay.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Stop.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
How?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
What do you mean how?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
So when how was it?

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
They barely even talked about this by the way.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I spent $270 something.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
Almost $300 actually because Hase is 250 and

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Sean's was like 35.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
When I saw you sent me a screenshot because I didn't believe you that you were doing it.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
100%.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
What did you do?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
He sent them edible arrangements.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
He showed I saw a receipt.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
It was $200.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
It was $300.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
It was $300 total.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
And one was really big and one was really small.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
And they didn't talk about it.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
I had to figure it out.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
They didn't think it was funny at all.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Nothing.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
They did not compare notes.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Like we thought they might.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
I really thought it was the first thing they said.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
It would break the ice.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
They'd be like, why did you send us fruit in the bag?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
They were like, just thanks for the fruit.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Yeah.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
And then Sean was like, I was hit at a party.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
I was like, you were hit at a party.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I thought they were going to do like a measuring contest.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
How do they know that one smaller one?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
That whole show is a Dick measuring contest.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
That's what we should do next.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
I got it.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
But to answer your question, gag gift budget.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
It's just whatever credit.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Whatever credit.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Yeah.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Because I'll figure it out.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
That's my whole fucking philosophy.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Do you want to tell people what you're ready to?

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Love what?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
No, I want to do it.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Okay.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
What?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I'm not going to be in this room with a bunch of dolls.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Bond of the week.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
This one's not an actor, but I'm going to pitch Emma Foley

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
as the director of the next double of seven.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Hell yeah.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
I love that.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
You'll take it or you're born with a chain.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
I will tame it.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
No.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
If I have the time.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
It's a big commitment.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Schedule depending.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Yeah.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
And you don't care about that.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
You probably get like $2 million to do that.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
And you're like, if I have time, like, if I get through

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
factually, if I record enough episodes of girls on porn,

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
maybe I'll have time to do a storyboard for the next bond.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Yeah.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Got it.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
I've never seen any of that before.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
That's an fresh new perspective.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
I think you all are rich, wrote on the new one.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
The newest one.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Have you seen us in power?

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
The women directors doing these, like,

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Greta Gerwig.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Yeah.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
What is that about?

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
It's a fantastic role.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Yeah.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
What's the deal?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Yeah.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
What's up with that?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Have you seen Austin Powers?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Okay.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
So just make it like that.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Grace cut that up.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Emma, have you seen Austin Powers?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Mhm.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
So make it like that.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Okay.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
There's like a joy to this show.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
I don't know what else to say.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
Like, this is like, um, I would say that.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Oh, kind of interesting.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
There's, do you think we put on errors on this show?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Or do you think we're ourselves?

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
And there's just a general error?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
A general error?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
A joy of joy.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
I've got an email.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
I've got an email.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
I've got an email.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
I've got an email from something called.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Rejoie.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
So you've heard of B joy.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
No.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
You've never heard of B joy.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
What's B joy?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
It's like a personal mantra of mine.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
B joy?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Yes.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Ask have you heard of a person on a trip?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I've talked about it all the time.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Now we know who listens to the show.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Now we know who listens to the show.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Marie can do about it.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
I knew about George Joy.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
No.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Okay.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
That's even more fun.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
I like to be joy.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
I didn't know that your personal mantra is B joy.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
I don't know about everything personal intro personal intro personal intro personal

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
I don't know about it.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
So not monstrous.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
I said, interpersonally.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
If anything should be off limits.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Well, it's a relationship with yourself.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
That's the most person of all.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
This is so nice.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
I wanted this episode to go on to the week.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Yeah.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
I met him.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Who is that?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Where?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
I made him L-O-L.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Truly.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
He lost it.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I told him about my brother's breakaway pants.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Oh, my God.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
So he's in.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Oh, good.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
So excited to see him.

We're about to see.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Yeah.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
We do have to just quickly pause and say for the pod.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
The today is a really, really big day for me.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000

She's a primer.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
She's a primer.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
I've never heard of it.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
I thought it was going to be scary.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
And actually, I like.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Okay.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
I'm sorry for putting words on your mouth.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
It's not too scary.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
She just fell never heard of it.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
We're not in your mouth.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Thank you.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000

Can't afford it.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
You know, we can't afford to have this noise.

And then do you like the tools in the New York City, I like those?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
They're fun.

20:56.000 --> 21:02.000
They were originally Jake and Mike, because matching desk chairs.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
To do that.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
One of what I didn't know they were.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Yeah, that was so funny.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
You know, no.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
I was like, you're the only.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Exactly.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Right.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
It interacted with Mike, that much.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
And then one day someone said something.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
And I was like, who's brother?

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
Yeah, because Jake's been up for her, she would be like a year.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Yeah, well, before that, but it was for that.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I didn't know Michael that, well, now I know.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
I think that my bond of the week is Judy Dunch.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Wow.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Because wouldn't that be funny if she comes in and she's a new role?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Yeah.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
She demoted herself to Boston.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Yeah.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Did you guys ever watch Dr. Who?

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
No.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Should I?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
No.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Okay.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
So B. Joy is a personal mantra at mine.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Okay.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
I have to.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
One is get wise.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
In the other one is B. Joy.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Yeah.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
I keep getting these emails from a company called ReJoy.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Which is a.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Hydration.

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
I think it's like an athletic greens rip off.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
It's sponsored the show.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
So I'm just trying to guess.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Insistigate a season assist.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
When should I drink ReJoy according to the email?

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
ReJoy is hydration to replenish your fluids and electrolytes.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
As.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
As such.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Are you said replenists?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Sorry.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
I'm really funny.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
I feel like it's so much.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I'm almost killed.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Oh, we got to figure this out.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Because this is.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Just for all being.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
We're all being.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Joy right now.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Really being.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
I agree.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
I believed Ali.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
I did not believe that.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
ReJoy.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Right.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Right again.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Well, she's being.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Joy and she's getting wise.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Was that the other one?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
The other one is getting wise.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Yeah.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Oh, wow.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I felt that duo.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Come together.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
ReJoy is hydration to replenish your fluids and electrolytes.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
As such is good to drink all day.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Wow.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
What this says.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Perfect.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
And then it says.

23:06.000 --> 23:13.000
The most common usage is first thing in the morning and about 30 minutes prior to a workout

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
or when mental clarity is at a premium.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
I feel like if you're kind of real clear.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Yeah.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
You're getting there.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Yeah.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
What's that?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
I'm never going to be at premium.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Holy shit.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
You heard it in your first.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Are you okay?

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Yeah.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
You're just saying like I want the I would want ReJoy to get me there.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
I don't want to be there.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Yeah.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
If I'm at a premium.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
If it's out of premium.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Then I don't need your product because I'm at premium.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Yeah.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
At that point.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
You've already been joy.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
You don't need to re-becoming.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Yeah.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Right.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
And I think that's a good thing to say.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Mm-hmm.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Did you throw a break already?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Oh, we should do that.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
We'll take a break.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
And I don't think we have any ads on this episode.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
Imagine if it was ReJoy.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Natural marketing.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
What is it organic marketing?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
What if they don't reach out now?

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Because we made fun of it.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
I don't think that they are in a place where they can sell it.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
You hear that?

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
It's the sound of a sale.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
You're missing out on because you're not selling on Shopify.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
And what does it sound like with Shopify?

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Oh, much better.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Start selling with Shopify today.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I'm obviously a huge fan of Shopify.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
I have to say thank you to Shopify because they did put me in a commercial last year.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
They did do that.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
I do appreciate it.

24:36.000 --> 24:42.000
But Shopify is just hands down the best commerce platform revolutionizing millions of businesses worldwide.

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
I am a regular customer of retailers who use Shopify with for their e-commerce.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
And I got to say from the customer standpoint at least,

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
it is an incredible online source for buying products.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
So that means you know it's a good online source for selling products.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
Whether you're a garage entrepreneur or IPO ready,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Shopify is the only tool you need to start,

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
run, and grow your business without the struggle.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
Shopify puts you in control of every sales channel,

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
so whether you're selling satin sheets from Shopify's in-person

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
POS system or offering organic olive oil on Shopify's all-in-one e-commerce platform,

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
you're covered.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
And once you've reached your audience,

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
Shopify has the internet's best converting checkout

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
to help you turn them from browsers to buyers.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
I can personally vouch for this as a customer.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Sometimes I'm like,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I don't know, like, I've never bought from this place before.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
First of all, I don't know if it's secure.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
Second of all, it's just kind of a hassle to sign up for a new account

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
or enter my address.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
I know that sounds like a small thing, guys.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
But when you're trying to push these products,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
the littlest thing can make that sale.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
And for me, as a customer, oftentimes I'm like,

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
oh, the huge Shopify.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
All I have to do is enter my email or my phone number,

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
boom, they have all my info pre-saved,

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
and the auto-fills and boom, I can buy it in less than like 20 seconds.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
It's unbelievable.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Shopify powers 10% of all e-commerce in the US,

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
and there's a reason.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
Because Shopify's truly a global force,

29:21.880 --> 29:25.880

29:25.880 --> 29:29.880
last weekend to see a screening of Romeo Michelle's high school reunion and they had a

29:29.880 --> 29:37.880
DJ before and they were playing uh the song and me and my sister Jayney were both like

29:37.880 --> 29:41.880

yeah that's really good yeah my um Grace beat this up my girlfriend was in a

29:47.080 --> 29:51.240
out of raven the desert and they also played that song and she was she's like

29:51.240 --> 29:55.240

party once and i did line dancing with him what did you make up I did line dancing

30:18.840 --> 30:23.880

37:29.640 --> 37:35.320
of money out of anyone in this room at least from headgum i mean if you you're a contractor if you

37:35.320 --> 37:40.440

37:59.400 --> 38:06.040
angel plastic that's right that down was why you wanted it's basically an angel plastic is when

38:10.520 --> 38:19.560
all of gray is saying i'm rewatching right wait i was just rewatching last night but when and i got

38:19.560 --> 38:24.360
in the episode where she has to choose between the vet and McDreamy and i really had no one to text

38:24.360 --> 38:32.520
and he was proud it's really like this is a really good job because i know oh my god that's such a

38:32.520 --> 38:37.960
good episode but when i don't cry i almost cry when that i watched that episode for the first time

38:37.960 --> 38:44.760

now that's real emotion sounds like he had a good night's leave that

39:07.560 --> 39:14.280
is that in real or if i was out of my life i have talked about my music on the show

39:14.280 --> 39:19.480
is Jeff gonna go see the two does Jeff go to the movies yeah i asked him that one's on here

39:19.480 --> 39:23.720
if he goes to movies i do that feels crazy it feels crazy

39:23.720 --> 39:37.080
i feel like i can think about you doing it night is coming in here unannounced to edit

39:37.080 --> 39:41.320
the headgum podcast for some reason at night here while we're trying to play on the 24 hour

39:41.320 --> 39:45.560
live stream there was like two to three different times i don't know if we ever talked about this

39:45.560 --> 39:50.360
on the show there was two to three different times where we were talking about you and planning

39:50.440 --> 39:55.080
the secret live stream and then i'd come out and you would be in a side room and no one

39:55.080 --> 40:00.040
knew when you showed up and we'd kind of try to guess based on your manner is and like you if you

40:00.040 --> 40:03.720
could hear any of the things that we said and how long you'd been there that would be like so far

40:03.720 --> 40:08.120
i didn't hear what happened what's up why are you here it's so late you said when it doesn't

40:08.120 --> 40:13.560
come in the office that often you're never exactly you're planning a specific thing and then you

40:13.560 --> 40:18.200
walk out and suddenly i'm there it's like eight thirty p.m. in like a side room yeah it's really

40:18.520 --> 40:23.000
so to think about you doing like a normal night thing like going to movies feels wild

40:23.000 --> 40:30.440
it was last movie so i think it was evil dead rise exactly exactly that proves my point

40:30.440 --> 40:37.720
i like seeing horror movies in the theater wait so how does it end evil dead rise whether it does rise

40:37.720 --> 40:42.680
okay okay um it wasn't very good it's the little girl okay from the preview

40:43.640 --> 40:57.400

41:02.600 --> 41:08.440
some joa deveaf yeah yeah exact some sauce that's beef beef is what is really

41:09.080 --> 41:18.040

i don't think they'd like their spot being blown up i didn't wait i didn't hear them oh it

46:24.520 --> 46:30.200
happened like 20 minutes ago okay well we'll make no stress i feel like yeah i literally missed it

46:34.200 --> 46:39.080
oh wait i guess murica still has a question available here on yeah and emma didn't ask anything

46:39.080 --> 46:44.200
you should do it into the actor studio episode it's such a good idea i love that we have to get

46:44.200 --> 46:52.200
Cooper though we have to get Bradley Cooper because he asked a question oh wow famously when he

46:52.200 --> 46:57.640
was an actor at the actor studio and by the way he looked so annoying he looked so earnest and he's just like

46:57.640 --> 47:02.440
he was just like thank you so much mr. Lipton uh when you're like thinking about a part like

47:02.440 --> 47:06.600
is that yeah it's so i mean i don't do a good impression of my god i got the vibe

47:06.600 --> 47:11.800
he was like my godly Cooper and i'm an actor that's what he's gonna say to god

47:15.000 --> 47:23.880
oh no no no he was he was in the audience at an interview one and they took questions and he was

47:23.880 --> 47:31.800
an audience fan question wow that's okay that's nice i thought i was mentioning Bradley

47:31.800 --> 47:36.200
Cooper now talking to god i have to get him really right i'm really good man i'm not sure

47:36.360 --> 47:45.800
okay i have to say something and i want to know if you guys are great this isn't the most fun i've

47:45.800 --> 47:52.200
ever had in the head of my i think it's gonna be the least fun don't oh no i think he's working talking

47:52.200 --> 47:56.360
on my work exactly he's not participating we're talking amongst ourselves there's conversations

47:56.360 --> 48:02.680
going on and he has no idea about and so i'm sorry for you no i i just i feel like Jeff you're in it

48:02.760 --> 48:09.880
do you not feel in it here's your bomba char the grains i'm for old deying on what bomba

48:10.280 --> 48:17.240
bomba right thank you uh no here's your bomba char the grains time for old deying on soy yeah i'm

48:17.240 --> 48:21.160
actually allergic to soy so that is me you can get soy poisoning my friend Harry got that

48:21.160 --> 48:26.840
my god what happened he was hazed in college but what what what is it how does that matter us

48:27.000 --> 48:36.520
sodium poisoning really what and then what what happens longer i don't what is it like like

48:37.240 --> 48:44.680
i mean is that dead that would be better thing to say to god just our father who

48:44.920 --> 48:57.240
in heaven who aren't having art in heaven is that our father who are just in heaven long grain white

48:57.240 --> 49:07.000
rice is here uh flamed enough but not too much cotterized grain seer thus yeah make you have a

49:07.000 --> 49:12.440
really nice little huh there was one thank you so there was one lot keep going there was one line

49:12.440 --> 49:16.440
where you really should have done right there was one line that there's a line coming up where you

49:16.440 --> 49:20.840
should have gone back to i think um burning all the rice but you were like did something i didn't

49:20.840 --> 49:27.560
rhyme charring all the green exactly but then that was that's all for saying that for the first time

49:27.560 --> 49:34.360
you work as you weren't listening intently uh and that imagine beaches of rice that's my

49:34.520 --> 49:45.560
line all scorched yeah that's really good hey you might need some hoisin on speed yeah anything else's

49:45.560 --> 49:50.600
poison that's really good when you get a rhyme like that and you're not carrying that love like that's

49:50.600 --> 49:55.880
the bar you should you're you can do this you should go back to me the funniest thing because with the

49:55.880 --> 50:01.560
goal of these songs is for the listener to not be able to find stable ground you think you know

50:01.560 --> 50:05.880
what's up man it's not there that's true so i like going in a rhyme at the end when people are like

50:05.880 --> 50:09.240
okay so none of this is gonna rhyme they've already decided that and all of a sudden there's a perfect

50:09.240 --> 50:17.320
rhyme like what it really needs a sound it needs the yeah the open hymer the hundred sixty five

50:17.320 --> 50:27.640
burnt specks burning all the rice and that's the uh okay i think if your goal was to keep

50:27.720 --> 50:34.520
people on edge then you've achieved it well that's why you too had a basis named the edge

50:34.520 --> 50:40.120
or guitarist river that's why comfortable with him in a room that's why Jeff locked the door behind

50:40.120 --> 50:48.200
this one we can actually do what i get you know this been all amiable you know on that side of the

50:48.200 --> 50:53.560
desk everybody's been really having a great time it sounds like it's time to get a little more sour

50:54.520 --> 51:00.600
how long moving going for it's been an hour and fifteen yes it's been forty nine okay

51:00.600 --> 51:07.800
by the note felt like an hour fifteen all right marica yeah Emma can you guys tell the audience why

51:07.800 --> 51:15.240
you're an L.A. Comicon yeah yeah and their big fans of Comicon let's say I did have a few people

51:15.240 --> 51:19.000
asked me like oh you're going for work or like for personal yeah you're like i've never heard of

51:19.640 --> 51:27.480
I'm going to work I'm not so insulted but I now feel like I should yeah that's a question

51:27.480 --> 51:36.520
not should be directed to me okay oh my god you can breathe easy yeah yeah you guys are here for

51:36.520 --> 51:41.400
Comicon what are you doing at Comicon panels why are you there two scary didn't watch ahead

51:41.400 --> 51:45.720
them horror recap podcast is going to record an episode there okay and that's what I wanted to

51:45.720 --> 51:50.760
talk to you guys about why did we get a panel there why did we get a live show at Comicon it's crazy

51:50.760 --> 51:55.480
that I think I'm podcast yeah because I why well how many listeners do they get more than us more

51:55.480 --> 52:00.440
than that compact yes yeah it's not fucked up I'd say we're like they're like a little more it's not like

52:01.640 --> 52:08.200
huge remote so we could theoretically because this is the new goal hmm by next year's Comicon you

52:08.200 --> 52:13.800
think there's a chance sure you tell me there's a chance they don't they didn't ask for a numbers

52:14.760 --> 52:20.520
okay so it's about content yeah well you would have had to be submitted yeah which first of all

52:20.520 --> 52:26.440
we didn't do right this is what I want to I will say well here's here's one thing yeah

52:26.440 --> 52:32.440
I think it would be so funny I don't know how to pull it off because I don't know what the rules

52:32.440 --> 52:36.440
are about like filming on the floor but I think it would be really funny for you and Riley to go to

52:36.440 --> 52:41.640
Comicon and just like interview people maybe I don't like man on the street stuff I'd be honest but

52:41.800 --> 52:51.320
you don't you know like you're too you're too much for the story as a person I think indoors

52:51.320 --> 52:56.840
something bad I think he needs an outline yeah let me ask you guys a couple questions okay

52:56.840 --> 53:02.280
because my fear let me first express my fear and then you guys can either confirm it or deny it okay my fear

53:02.280 --> 53:09.480
is that this show has been sort of gradually getting swept under the rug in favor of newer shows

53:09.640 --> 53:14.200
Hollywood handbook is new oh my god shiny object everybody's distracted I don't know what this

53:14.200 --> 53:18.840
fucking brand of show is I get that it's bringing in money I get that but does it have the charm the

53:18.840 --> 53:24.520
wit the fucking gorilla warfare feel of this show and then my question to you is that it is it

53:24.520 --> 53:31.080
it's not really awesome is it an out of sight out of mind thing we're like you're in New York you're

53:31.080 --> 53:35.640
in New York and then you I rarely come to the LA office right you know it's a front night except

53:36.120 --> 53:40.200
so like is it is that the issue is that that I'm not showing face enough to be reminding

53:40.200 --> 53:45.480
Marie because on the show every week yeah I talk to you so often right and then so it's not that so

53:45.480 --> 53:51.320
it's not that who right I think you're just kind of feeling first born first normal you know when

53:51.320 --> 53:56.200
you're when you make a waffle the first ones the tester that's the thing though is I bought low and

53:56.200 --> 54:01.720
I want to sell high and so far I haven't even had the option to sell stuff well also like what what

54:01.800 --> 54:07.800
are you feeling particularly neglected about just like something I've been begging for months right

54:07.800 --> 54:11.880
we have two ideas we want to do for the show haven't gotten either one off the ground and then

54:11.880 --> 54:18.920
they're so expensive well okay I said I would sell fund and then it doesn't seem like anyone's

54:18.920 --> 54:25.000
allowing me to do that I mean yeah I want to have the bags of fruit I'm sorry to be to unveil

54:25.000 --> 54:31.560
the man behind the curtain oh yeah you mean Marieka had a meeting months ago wait

54:32.040 --> 54:37.640
I remember this yes a two that's on a very special episode of the head gum podcast and you

54:37.640 --> 54:42.840
I believe we're on vacation he books he's blessed I was shooting a movie

54:45.720 --> 54:50.680
also one week you didn't have Wi-Fi yeah yeah we're not meeting no that was also the

54:50.680 --> 54:55.560
fun thing that was in your attempt at fucking Wi-Fi yeah well we had Wi-Fi but it was literally

54:55.560 --> 55:02.200
I was upload speeds of 0.25 megabytes yeah yeah it was like we we had a meeting we were going to

55:02.200 --> 55:07.720
were meeting sort of we had a meeting we were going to regroup I did my homework and then we never

55:07.720 --> 55:12.760
regrouped because you were in Kentucky with 0.25 so it was there not like a Starbucks like near

55:12.760 --> 55:18.360
there was a coffee shop that had Wi-Fi 45 minutes away okay so if you really wanted to

55:19.480 --> 55:22.760
do what you could it sounds like well I was also on yeah yeah

55:26.520 --> 55:31.000
I say we regroup we do that we didn't shoot whenever you guys are free on the day and then we

55:31.480 --> 55:36.360
figured out from there but what I do I just I want to be an included in decision making like

55:36.360 --> 55:39.400
what shows do we submit for Comic Con and I'm like and maybe I'm on the zoom and I'm like

55:40.120 --> 55:43.880

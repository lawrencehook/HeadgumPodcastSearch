00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Camera is the violin ring.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Well, I thought it was time. Sorry, I'm here.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Can you knock me on your phone?

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Can you close the settings window?

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
So we can see Maria and Ricky's.

00:21.000 --> 00:33.000
Why is the camera kind of like a C-P-A-Tone image of the studio?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
I can answer that.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
What?

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Jeff.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Answer.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
That's what happens when you go with charcoal.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
I'm sorry to say that.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
That's what happens when you go with coal.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Which has a kind of warm tone, by the way.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
I'll drink to that coal.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
I think that was pretty cool.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
One person wanted coal and by the internet, by the way.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
I think they were interested in Cheyenne Green.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Empty cup.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Because you guys don't fill mine.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Where is there a blue bottle?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Los filis.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
We're back at it again.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I'm hungover.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I got to say.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Well, mostly it's like two o'clock.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Well, I have like brain fog.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
I have like vision loss.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Her peripheral field is not doing the right.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I didn't have any alcohol, but I just feel hungover.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
I just dehydrated.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I think I'm still, you don't drink enough water.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
You got to hit with the acid.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Yeah.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Yeah.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
I'm calling it a hangover second dress like this.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
And where the sunglasses are.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
So the tides can change.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
She didn't let me finish.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
So the tides can change.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
So that they can become swift.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
And the sunglasses and doors.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Is that a concussive thing?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Or is that just you trying out a new style?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I have like hangsiety about the concussion.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
What's hangsiety?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Hangover anxiety.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
It's like, oh my god.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
What did I do?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
What did I say to everybody last night?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
You know what I mean?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
What is really like this?

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Yeah.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Concussive syndrome lasts.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
It's like everything that could be see thing.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Like now you're post concussion.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
This is it.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
It's kind of like that's it for me for maybe up to a year.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Oh, it's like long COVID.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
They sort of are like a cool party.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
It's like till question mark question mark.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Exactly right.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
So like you don't know where the party is going to end.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
But in this case, the party is that I just can't really drive.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Yeah.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
And the worst thing about being sexy style.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
It doesn't end instantly.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
So you don't get to be like.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Ah.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Exactly.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Refresh.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Yeah.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Yeah.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Wait a second.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
I guess I'm better.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
I don't know.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
I wouldn't add it.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
And I said to the ceiling.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Give me a tight fade.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Basically I wonder with three months.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Hmm.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
I don't know Jeff.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
I don't know if you can see us on the screen.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
But.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Great.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
So see on that.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Yeah.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
I need like a monitor right there.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Sorry.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
You have you are looking at.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Four monitors right now.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
This is like the worst thing for my concussion.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
By the way.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Your surroundings look at screens.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Two people in front and two people in back.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Four five six seven.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Without.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
If you count the little one on that zoom.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Hmm.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Nine.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
And when I said nine, I count.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
I cut to a black screen.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
You done.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Yeah.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
And it was great for us.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
And it was grace for us.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
She is beauty.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
She is grace.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Harper.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Uh.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
How the hell are you?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
How the hell.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
How the hard.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
How the hard.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Okay.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
How do you feel?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Me?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Who?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Grace.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Right.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I feel fine.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Thank you.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
You.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
How is the editing work flow been with my concussive state?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
No difference.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
The same.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
So before.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I kind of feel like worse.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Right.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Well, there wasn't incident where he said, can you do the video?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
And I said, yeah, of course.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Some of the files.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And then he didn't send me anything for a week.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
And then he did send me everything.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
After it.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
The podcast was orange.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
He meant to have gone live.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Full edit.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
You left out the big covers that I fully edited it.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
So I didn't inconvenience you and you didn't get extra money.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Swat did you send all the footage to grace?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Because basically what happened was I was like, Oh, I'll just have Grace do it.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Because I feel like garbage.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
And in the next week, I was like, I feel fine enough to edit.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
And at this point.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
And we.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
And we.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
I should say that we.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
I wasn't done.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
Got rid of his posting permissions because he never followed instructions.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
So that grace does a great job at actually uploading the episodes.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
That's what I was going to say.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Don't you worry.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Yeah.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
God.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
God doesn't incredible job of loading.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
But the thing is like to to get all the templates, files, to get all the things to be like,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
This is, you know, what you need to edit the video.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
It's probably would have been harder on my head.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Harper on your head.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
I see you.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
It's so easy for every other podcast to do that.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Right.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
What makes it hard.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Every other podcast doesn't have a concussion.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
What was the experience of times?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
I know their lives.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I know their lives.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
I know everything about Mike Mitchell is up to.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Mike Mitchell isn't falling down.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
He's staying put a lot.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
That's cool.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Every boring conversation.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Yeah.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Yeah.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
A little bit.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
That's fair.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Well, let's get into some shit then.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Oh, that's fun.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
All right.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Thank you.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Is that the only.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Go on.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Is that the only camera on you?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Because it's almost too dark to use.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
I'm going to have to overexpose the garbage out of it.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
I don't feel like very rainy.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Yeah.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Well, that's hard.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
You know, because the studio is outfitted with cameras that if you're going to zoom into

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
a certain point, you can only go down to 4.5.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
What was wrong with the GoPro?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Everybody was complaining about the GoPro.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Nothing wrong with the GoPro.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Jeff just doesn't know how to use it.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
See, this is the only show that records in the studio where I try and like be hands off

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
with the video stuff.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
That was Jeff kind of direct the ship.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
And he does stuff like take one of the cameras that is calibrated.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
To be shot in the studio lighting turn it completely around.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Yeah.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
Aim it outside of the studio lighting and wonder why the colors are off and why it looks dark.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Yeah.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
But that's the vision he has for the show.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
The colors are always off.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
These ones are calibrated for the normal studio.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
And Marie, because it looks seepia tone.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
I think it's a color.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Your camera looks seepia tone because it's pointed at you because it's not color corrected

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
for the lighting that you're in.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I'm going to send a screenshot of you.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Yeah.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Are you?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
No.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Sugar a liar?

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Well, I think I speak truth to powers what I do.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
And I think you guys are just uncomfortable because you're realizing you're in the position of power.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
You're not able to punch up anymore.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Yeah.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
It's hard to be hung over on it Tuesday because that means you went out on so hard on a Monday night.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Yeah, what did you do?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
That's rare.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Last night I didn't.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I'm not hung over.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
I just am trying to like seem cooler because it's not cool to be like I'm still dealing with a concussion.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Yeah.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
What did you do last night?

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Just at a curiosity.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Last night.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Last night.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I ordered Chinese food from where?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
From Broadway, cuisine.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Interesting.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Chinatown.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
And I watched a salt burn.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Oh.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
What do you think?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Nice.

07:13.000 --> 07:20.000
And were you slurping on egg drop soup when he started slurping on the inside of a post-gismed bathtub?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
I had a mopu.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
A mopu?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Tofu?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Yeah.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
And it was just.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Time to up as a 4D experience.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
It was 40 XXX.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
I don't know.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
I'm pretty good in the lab.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Harder.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
You can't even see me.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Yes.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
I thought it was okay.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
It was overhyped, I think, before you got to you and then you were expecting a lot.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
I think that's what it mostly was.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
But I'm like.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
How do you expect more disgusting things than you actually saw?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Was that a problem?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I think it was shot beautifully.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
The cast was incredible.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
And then the story wasn't there there.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
It was just kind of like so.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
So ultimately he just was a psychopath who wanted to get around.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Yeah.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
That's not as interesting.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
But that's fine.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
What I wanted it to be.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
I got into a whole debate about what it should have been.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
I think it would have been more interesting.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
It kind of ended soon after Jacob authorities.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Well, it's okay.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Spoiler alert.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
If you haven't seen salt part at this point, you know.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
That's on yours than me.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Yeah.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Because I've seen it.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Is that.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Yeah.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
There's that scene where they're at the breakfast.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
You guys have seen it?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Yeah.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
I've seen it.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
The breakfast table where they're closing the red curtains.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
That should be closer to the end of the movie.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
And it should be this thing where it's a comment on like British culture where it's like

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
they just need everything to be okay.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
And so they're going to like dilute themselves into thinking it's fine.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
And then when the Farley's like, why the fuck is he still here?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
And then Farley gets booted because of the cocaine.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
It's like he should have like replaced Jacob awarding the family.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
And then he should have just accepted him.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
And then it's like, oh my god.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Like they after all that, they just basically like took this other kid in and

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
are moving on like nothing happened.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Like repressing their emotional side.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
That's more interesting to me than just a psychopath got in a state.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Yeah.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Also like one by one.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I'm trying to throw psychopath getting in a state.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Did you really thought it was just kind of a story?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Like yeah, I figured that was happening.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
It was just all flashbacks, which I feel like is lazy writing.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Hmm.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
It was funny that one of the flashbacks was like he was typing gibberish at the cafe.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Yeah.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Yeah.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
We figured that.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
That's much.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
I wasn't actually like when I thought that.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Anyway.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
So it didn't seem like a big like, oh my god twist.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
It's like, oh, that was the leading theory.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
My friend DJ was like, I feel like that was a note handed down from Amazon.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Your friend DJ, your friend who's a DJ.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Both.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Amazing.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
They're like, like you're in a mirror.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
You're in a mirror.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Yeah.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
You're one of many.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
But you're also your name as a mirror.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
That's cool.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
I'd love to hear more.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
We're going to do Bono.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Yeah.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Gracie.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Gracie.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
There's a Gracie in an America.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
That's pretty good.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Thank you.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
Um, I thought Solper was one of the worst movies I saw.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Thank you.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Thank you.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
It's not music.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Great.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Oh, I'm never super.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
It's not bad.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
I mean.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Great.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Directed.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Yeah.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
I am a world fannel.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Uh, look.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
I thought Solper was a dog.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
This is all.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Your right.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
That was the song.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
What's that?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Jesus Christ.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I thought it was fine.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
But when people started being mean online,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I said, all the fun, this movie.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
You know, I thought I feel like everybody was like that was like a incredible movie.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
It's best movie I've ever seen.

10:40.000 --> 10:40.500
No.

10:40.500 --> 10:47.460
Yeah, I keep seeing a lot of that and I'm like I was in a lot of that. Oh, I've seen online is that people think it's a master piece

10:47.460 --> 10:54.420
And I'm like, it's good. I've never seen that take posted on any online for a lot of people being like

10:54.420 --> 10:59.900
Oh, I can't watch this with my parents are like, oh wow like I don't know just the audience reactions when I saw it

10:59.900 --> 11:05.020
We're so extreme and I was like, you guys need you got it. I would say we'll let's grow test. Then people

11:05.020 --> 11:09.480
Yeah, people yeah, people scandalized by that point. We need to watch more movies and

11:09.480 --> 11:15.260
Right. Yeah, I was in the bathroom or in his movies the bath the thing was grosser than everything I'd seen in the movie

11:15.260 --> 11:21.980
I was so excited for the bathtub thing because I wanted it to happen. I like I couldn't do it

11:21.980 --> 11:24.700
What happened? It was it was it was not even like

11:25.980 --> 11:34.980
Like it was a setup the whole movie kind of felt like it was trying to be call me by your name exactly and and it all kind of

11:34.980 --> 11:40.340
felt like a tear below what was happening and call me by your name. You know what I like the peach stuff

11:40.340 --> 11:44.860
I was like whoa yeah, and then the bath tub stuff. I'm like come on do something else

11:44.860 --> 11:51.660
I just think he was I think it's a movie about a psycho path. I think it's more so let's call me by your name

11:51.660 --> 11:53.660
Army hammer

11:55.660 --> 12:01.140
Sorry you really worked up the courage to do that to do what like I'm gonna sorry

12:01.140 --> 12:05.940
Okay, here's here's the replay for the viewers and I was asked in the comments

12:05.940 --> 12:10.420
But like it really looked and felt like you like worked your way into being like yeah

12:10.420 --> 12:15.740
I've ever heard of him. Well, he said I'm here. I said ever. Yeah, and when Casey said it had felt natural

12:15.740 --> 12:18.860
I felt great and just I don't I want to be very clearly when Casey said that that was amazing

12:18.860 --> 12:23.840
Yeah, I was just sort of like yes ending that I feel like you were gonna say that no matter what had happened

12:23.840 --> 12:25.500
Said no way no way

12:25.500 --> 12:28.120
It would have said ever heard of him regardless of what was said

12:28.120 --> 12:30.600
I just feel like it's from the moment you walk through the studio

12:30.600 --> 12:33.220
You were like, oh, it's freezing. Let me wear your jeans and then you're like

12:33.900 --> 12:37.620
From that one you're like I already did say that to me

12:37.620 --> 12:41.660
I asked him to switch pants with me. It's very frigid in the studio, but warm outside

12:41.660 --> 12:45.860
Yeah, but from that moment when I feel like you were like I have a couple of lines that I'm gonna say no way

12:46.140 --> 12:49.440
Yeah, not like that all right ever heard of him

12:49.440 --> 12:52.160
You thought I was trying to say show on the show

12:56.060 --> 12:58.060
You

13:03.260 --> 13:05.260
James Bond Street

13:05.900 --> 13:09.260
Wanna go shopping for some spiced up?

13:11.380 --> 13:20.420
What fucking it's for this one was for great sucked dude. I wasn't good. It wasn't good, but you know what yeah, I bought in the week a Sam Rockwell

13:21.140 --> 13:28.180
Okay, wait James Bond Street a person Bond Street is like an area of London where there's a bunch of expect it's like rodeo drive

13:28.180 --> 13:32.660
Okay, go on the first grace. Can you confirm that it's like rodeo drive?

13:33.860 --> 13:37.460
I've been in a vintage rodeo drive, but I can't confirm it's on the monopoli blusher

13:37.460 --> 13:42.500
We'll drive so it's kind of worse streets in LA. I had dinner on rodeo the other like a couple months ago

13:42.500 --> 13:49.460
I was kind of fun. That doesn't matter mr. Chad see when you invite so many people in the studio and you leave

13:50.180 --> 13:54.500
All of the zoom people behind your so you can't see them

13:55.300 --> 13:59.700
You can only hear them. We're not gonna pay attention to them and you're not gonna talk to them. Is it delay?

14:00.180 --> 14:05.040
There's a delay. There's not a delay. There's not really a delay, but also it's all on here

14:05.040 --> 14:08.180
I will say anytime I'm here and Jeff is about to record the show

14:08.180 --> 14:13.620
He goes do you want to be on this because I think he doesn't want to be sitting in a room alone with a mirror

14:14.260 --> 14:17.660
Yeah, oh, that's interesting now. I can see you guys all right

14:17.740 --> 14:24.140
Well, how would it work if I wasn't here? It was just Jeff facing out the same direction better zoom facing out

14:24.140 --> 14:28.460
Would you would you be looking at the TV? I just got them on my laptop. I think this is working fine

14:29.980 --> 14:31.980
Sounds like it

14:33.980 --> 14:35.980
Got him

14:35.980 --> 14:37.980
Ever heard of them

14:38.540 --> 14:45.020
Nice. Thank you going off of what a Marieka said it with Sam Rockwell being born a week my bond of the week is our guy

14:45.100 --> 14:47.100
Yeah

14:47.100 --> 14:50.140
Or the guy in the movie our guy all himself

14:51.340 --> 14:53.340
Do you know

14:53.740 --> 14:55.740
We said I don't know

14:56.060 --> 14:58.060
Yeah, me neither

14:58.060 --> 15:00.060
I know that was dual today

15:00.060 --> 15:02.060
It is truly

15:02.060 --> 15:05.180
I didn't really I wouldn't say it's I wouldn't say it's full comedy, but

15:06.060 --> 15:09.740
Action comedy adventure. Sure. Yeah, do you guys think if I was like

15:10.700 --> 15:18.380
At the same party is do a I could absolutely not no cuz doesn't matter what your real day after I could no

15:18.380 --> 15:25.740
I know the case sort of like yeah, but I mean I think I could like charm her use your best line. What what would you say?

15:28.620 --> 15:30.620
Miss Leapah

15:30.620 --> 15:34.540
I think I would be like how about we make it a trio we put meaning

15:35.900 --> 15:37.900
Let me eat your goddamn ass

15:39.900 --> 15:44.780
Sorry, I got really nervous. I don't look at what I've actually

15:46.060 --> 15:49.180
No, I think you would get really nervous and that is what you would do

15:49.580 --> 15:51.660
That's how you would do awesome be like yeah

15:52.220 --> 15:55.660
This party sucks. What if we went down like what if we could just go into a fucking diner?

15:55.660 --> 15:59.340
You know like when was last time you went to a diner? I bet you can't get away with it. I can't hear you

15:59.340 --> 16:03.740
I got to go somewhere else. No, when I was saying was if you seen with me people will think you're not

16:03.740 --> 16:05.740
Do talking to me. They'll be like oh

She never be with the guy like that. That's actually a really good do I am pressure. Thank you

16:12.780 --> 16:14.780
It's actually a really good way to talk to do a

16:16.940 --> 16:18.940
Imagine do was do a

16:19.500 --> 16:21.500
I wouldn't mind midwifeing Leapah

16:43.900 --> 16:45.900
Any updates on wall saw

Oh no, no, same same I did break my wrist for like six of these episodes and

16:52.460 --> 16:55.420
Business carried on as usual. Wow, you broke your wrist

16:56.140 --> 16:59.980
That's so funny. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god. What does it look like now?

17:00.940 --> 17:07.420
Fine normal cast no cast. Wow. How does this last snowboard in oh my god

17:07.420 --> 17:08.140
It's cool

17:08.140 --> 17:11.820
Me too. I fell is my first broken bone. Where do you snowboard?

17:13.420 --> 17:18.140
Uh, about half an hour from my house. There's an indoor snowdimes about 20 me as well

17:19.340 --> 17:22.620
Inborders no dome at least smokes

17:23.900 --> 17:28.700
Nice. It's near how's that clock? I weird that was really good. Sorry. I just want to get that in there

17:29.100 --> 17:31.100
What did I say

17:31.100 --> 17:33.100
Didn't she you said holy slopes

17:34.220 --> 17:34.860
Should have

17:36.620 --> 17:42.700
But then Jeff asked me about my penis and so I sort of browned out yeah recording stuff

17:50.380 --> 17:54.460
I'm here. I wanted to talk to you about your house. Yeah. I feel like

17:55.260 --> 18:02.060
If anyone here and I'm not encouraging anyone who is watching this but anyone who wanted to could find your address

18:02.620 --> 18:05.900
Not true. It could find points of entry. Nope. On

18:06.780 --> 18:08.380
Yeah, yeah

18:08.380 --> 18:12.780
You're a street view apple street view for that better apple maps

18:13.340 --> 18:15.500
And so I wonder if yeah, yeah, maybe

18:16.220 --> 18:21.420
And again, I really have not encouraged anything to happen. It seems like you are a little bit just by implicitly talking about it

18:21.660 --> 18:25.820
You don't really it's not like you live on a gated street. You know you live on actually your house we should say

18:29.820 --> 18:34.460
And my fear for you is that you don't have enough. No, this is good. No, no

18:35.020 --> 18:38.300
Let's take it from you ask me about my dick again

18:38.300 --> 18:44.140
I have heard the notes. I'm tired of people saying that I'm toned up to the show and

18:44.860 --> 18:46.860
I've stopped

18:46.860 --> 18:48.860
I

18:48.860 --> 18:57.260

19:00.620 --> 19:04.300
I'm I'm gonna let you finish okay, but you have one of the least

19:05.980 --> 19:12.140
Private homies in Los Angeles very private nobody knows where I live except for you. I'm wondering if you plant

19:13.020 --> 19:15.020
Privacy hedges

19:15.660 --> 19:17.660
Oh, yeah, then what

19:19.100 --> 19:24.300
That's sort of the pitch. Yeah, basically like you've been to like billair. Yeah

19:25.340 --> 19:27.340
I wonder if you're the fresh prince of

19:28.140 --> 19:30.140
You know

19:32.700 --> 19:35.580
Unusable you feel like the salt part is unusable

19:38.460 --> 19:43.660
I also salt burns a horrible name for in a state that just sounds like you're rubbing salt in a wound

19:44.300 --> 19:46.060
I think maybe that's the point. Yeah

19:49.100 --> 19:53.340
Yeah, like they stayed itself as cursed or personally yeah

19:54.060 --> 19:56.060
Beautiful though

19:56.060 --> 20:00.380
And you know why? Why? Because they don't use colors like charcoal

20:01.020 --> 20:02.780
These cool up these cool

20:02.780 --> 20:04.380
Sam and

20:04.380 --> 20:06.380
These giant

20:06.380 --> 20:08.380
I think you're just hungry

20:09.340 --> 20:13.020
I want a fucking bagel and locks with a die at sea

20:20.380 --> 20:22.380
My hair position is geo

20:25.900 --> 20:28.620
We need to take a break here when we already

20:29.180 --> 20:37.340
Basically had to cut out video guys one of my proudest relationships in my life is the one with a mirror my working relationship with a mirror because

20:37.900 --> 20:40.220
From where it started to where it is now

20:41.180 --> 20:48.380
Was an easy right and and it's that's a common misconception about relationships is that they have to be easy to be quote-unquote right

20:48.700 --> 20:53.180
But sometimes the best ones happen when both people put in the work

20:53.740 --> 20:59.660

Did anybody do with their bond of the week? It was like a sack the only thing that's happened so far

21:49.740 --> 21:51.340
But I think like

21:51.340 --> 21:57.180
Marica Sam Marqua. I said our guy and then we just moved on entirely. Do you want to say one you could have had any more

21:57.820 --> 21:59.820
Really couldn't have on the thing

22:00.620 --> 22:05.340
Because the zoom cut out you came back. You started talking about salt burn again, and then we went to commercial

22:07.100 --> 22:09.100
That's true

22:19.580 --> 22:25.420
That's a name of the fucking game quote Matt we played this before we'll play it again

22:25.900 --> 22:27.900
Right match

22:30.620 --> 22:32.620
Let's fucking get this shit out. All right

22:34.300 --> 22:38.620
This I'm gonna read a quote and you're gonna attribute it to a celebrity all right

22:39.740 --> 22:45.180
Can you just list all of the celebrities by name because I can't but can you see the scream?

22:47.580 --> 22:53.980
We got Laura Dern correct. Yeah. We got Chuck Laurie correct. We got Sigourney Weaver

22:54.060 --> 23:00.300
Absolutely correct. We got Laker coach Dervin. Dervin Ham. Yeah, Dervin Ham. We have Dwayne the Rock Johnson obviously

23:00.780 --> 23:02.780
Travis Kelsey absolutely

23:02.780 --> 23:04.780
Lastly

23:04.780 --> 23:08.620
John Bungi and I actually done another Orlando Bloom

23:09.340 --> 23:14.940
That's Orlando Bloom behind a mirrored Orlando Bloom. I don't like the positioning because it makes me feel like I'm referring to a mirror

23:14.940 --> 23:16.940
Somebody like Orlando Bloom

23:17.420 --> 23:19.420
Wow

23:19.580 --> 23:23.580
What's that in it?

23:25.580 --> 23:27.580
Yeah

23:27.580 --> 23:29.580
I think we have and we will

23:30.700 --> 23:32.700
Nothing commercial

23:35.660 --> 23:39.420
So what are we gonna like guess which of these people said I was kidding

23:41.580 --> 23:42.860
The noise

23:42.860 --> 23:47.900
Dig it for me guys taking care of your health is not always easy, but it should be simple

23:48.220 --> 23:52.220
That's why for the last two and a half almost three years now to the day

23:52.220 --> 23:59.100
I've been drinking AG1 every day no exceptions just one scoop mixed in water once a day every day

23:59.100 --> 24:05.020
And it makes me feel energized focused and like I'm ready to take on the day and that's because each serving of

24:37.500 --> 24:42.300

Okay

25:12.700 --> 25:16.780
I'm gonna say a quote and you're gonna attribute it to one of these celebrities. Does that make sense?

25:17.980 --> 25:22.060
I will also give you context this time because last time people got a lot of them wrong

25:22.060 --> 25:27.260
Yeah, are these real or fake the oh these are things that actually have been said on documented whether it's via twitter

25:27.260 --> 25:35.820
via an interview or like a story that they told on a late night show or some of them are here say I guess but most of them are like I have proof

25:36.460 --> 25:42.940
Still 50 50 and then when they're real or not here we go. Okay, I'm thinking any of them are gonna be real

25:44.940 --> 25:50.060
Let's just see all right. Let me see if I can prove your ass wrong. She gornies on my weaver till I'm me

25:52.540 --> 25:55.020
This was this celebrity said this on IG live

25:56.060 --> 26:03.180
She gornies on my weaver till I'm me. Yeah, she gornies on my weaver till I'm me. I mean none of these are

26:06.780 --> 26:10.780
I don't think it's a gornie

26:10.780 --> 26:13.420
Okay, well, do you how well do you know it's a gornie

26:15.020 --> 26:19.420
So I guess I've never met her personal. It's like a rappley Rick. Yeah, yeah

26:20.300 --> 26:23.900
Well, this was heard sorry, this was them on IG live

26:24.780 --> 26:29.740
Having she gornies on my weaver till I'm me till I'm me. Yeah

26:30.140 --> 26:35.740
What's that even me? I'm gonna say Laura Dern said that

26:38.540 --> 26:40.940
It's a gornie weaver

26:48.940 --> 26:54.060
Why would she say that? I don't fucking know weaver. I don't know it's a gornie

26:54.060 --> 26:58.780
So I don't know why she would say that and you say but you saw her say this on an IG live

26:58.860 --> 27:03.420
I'm pretty sure she was promoting at the xorcist. Okay. Yeah, okay

27:04.540 --> 27:06.540
All right here we go

27:09.580 --> 27:11.980
I think that does help yes. Thank you

27:14.300 --> 27:16.300
Powering through

27:16.300 --> 27:18.300
We're only at the beginning

27:22.300 --> 27:28.620
I'd love to make a show about a Hollywood producer named Chuck who owns a gun and isn't afraid to use it

27:28.620 --> 27:33.260
If a certain network passes on his show that's the kind of shell I'd like to make

27:34.300 --> 27:36.300
Yes, the rock

27:36.300 --> 27:39.020
Seems like it would be the rock this this was a celebrity

27:41.020 --> 27:43.020
Yes, it's Chuck Laurie

27:48.860 --> 27:50.860
Amir is too for two

27:51.980 --> 27:53.980
Checking in how we love in the game

27:54.780 --> 27:59.020
It's a bad game so far

28:00.380 --> 28:05.020
Well, at least we're getting towards a place where it's a had game as it's a game we have had

28:06.300 --> 28:10.700
Maria, let's see some more joy. Let's have some more participation. Let's see

28:12.140 --> 28:14.700
When this this is a celebrity talking to their daughter

28:15.580 --> 28:19.660
When I heard they were opening a Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Orlando

28:20.220 --> 28:22.220
My dumbass

28:24.940 --> 28:31.340
Yeah, you didn't hear the full quote in my changing care to hear it look full quote. You said

28:31.980 --> 28:35.260
Participate and you said that

28:36.460 --> 28:41.020
The game would be good to have had what you mean so it would be good to be done fast

28:41.420 --> 28:43.980
Yeah, let me just say the fucking quote

28:45.260 --> 28:48.780
Because you're I don't know if you're right or wrong because I have to see the whole thing to be reminded

28:49.740 --> 28:58.060
When I heard they were opening a Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Orlando my dumbass thought they wanted to put the ride in my ass

29:01.100 --> 29:03.100
Orlando blue

29:08.140 --> 29:14.460
We're really testing the sound barrier between the two of you're really testing it. What's up? And Katy Perry. Yeah

29:14.780 --> 29:20.380
Did I make it there? Are they? They are married. Wow. Are they getting divorced then? I wouldn't be surprised

29:20.380 --> 29:25.340
I don't think they have it in them Orlando blue and Katy Perry are married. I think you made it up. Okay.

29:26.060 --> 29:30.460
All right here we go. Just this is a celebrity talking to Taylor Swift

29:31.500 --> 29:35.740
Just between us when I message Taylor. I thought I was DMing my Elie Cyrus

29:36.140 --> 29:42.300
Sorry, so this person is talking to Taylor Swift

29:42.300 --> 29:45.980
Yeah, and saying just to clear things up when I message Taylor

29:46.780 --> 29:51.900
Just between us girls when I message Taylor. I thought I was talking to my Elie Cyrus

29:52.540 --> 29:57.180
Just between us girls is the quote now. That's no that's like the essence of it though. I feel like

29:57.180 --> 29:58.860
You got it. So Travis Kelsey

29:58.860 --> 30:00.860
Travis Kelsey

30:02.380 --> 30:04.380
Great

30:04.380 --> 30:10.700
Why last week's episode was awesome now that was last week's it was the one where I was like giving out New Year's resolutions

30:11.500 --> 30:16.300
I don't recall that one. I recall it and he had like written a bunch of stuff

30:17.020 --> 30:23.660
The flan it was my birthday. Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right if I'd known being an actor was this hard

30:24.220 --> 30:26.220
I

30:27.900 --> 30:34.220
Are you gonna read the fucking entire message now? Obviously. Yeah, I think that's like a rule we need to answer you now because you guys

30:35.660 --> 30:41.500
Trigger happy with the fucking guessing you have to hear the full quote to guess and if not I'm gonna

30:42.700 --> 30:44.700
I'm gonna kick grass

30:44.700 --> 30:47.100
What no I can't I can't

30:47.180 --> 30:49.180
Uh

30:49.500 --> 30:52.380
If I'd known being an actor was this hard. I were a dern

30:59.740 --> 31:01.740
Because I thought I just I mean

31:02.300 --> 31:06.060
When I'm reading when I'm editing this I'll just make sure because I feel like I didn't think easy

31:07.180 --> 31:09.180
Acting would be this hard

31:09.180 --> 31:11.180
Hard as a rock sort of

31:11.180 --> 31:15.980
Is where I think we're dealing with this if I'd known being an actor was this hard. I would have married rich

31:18.060 --> 31:20.060
The rock

31:29.020 --> 31:31.020
This this is

31:32.780 --> 31:37.580
I wouldn't be opposed to it says this person on collaborating with Lorna Dune

31:48.060 --> 31:50.060
Correct me

31:52.540 --> 31:54.540
Now it was Laura Durn

31:55.100 --> 31:57.500
Laura she said that Laura Dune

31:57.980 --> 32:01.180
Sorry, it was on Sigourney Weaver's IG live actually

32:02.380 --> 32:06.940
Laura's doing ex Lorna Dune. It's sort of a Michael Sarah the ex collab

32:07.580 --> 32:11.180
Variation Michael Sarah was an office today in New York

32:11.980 --> 32:14.940

You didn't see either

32:22.540 --> 32:29.340
Not in your life. Yeah, they're not it. You still haven't even been in the same building as them at the same time

32:29.580 --> 32:32.620
They don't know you you're persona nothing to do with a rock

32:33.180 --> 32:38.780
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say your persona and rod it to them. That's really good. Thank you all right

32:38.780 --> 32:41.980
Here we go every time I'm at the airport people say

Bon Jovage as if they're the first to come up with that. Give me a break

32:49.580 --> 32:51.580
It's like Bon Voyage

32:51.580 --> 32:53.580
Yeah, but John Bon Jovie. Correct

32:55.740 --> 32:57.740
Bon Jovage

32:57.740 --> 32:59.740
Bon Jovie who we have left

33:01.020 --> 33:06.140
I may not I may not be related to John him, but I'm definitely as hung as him

33:06.700 --> 33:10.780
And this is somebody sending an unresponded to text and milker's group chat

33:12.380 --> 33:19.340
And you have access to that. I think it went viral like it was like some like bleep do mothing

33:19.340 --> 33:21.740
Yeah, and Darwin him correct

33:23.020 --> 33:25.020
All right now that we got through that garbage

33:26.700 --> 33:32.140
My hair position. Moving on to the lake is no who John him is. Yeah

33:35.500 --> 33:37.500
I think LeBron does for sure

33:37.500 --> 33:40.140
Hangs out. No, he's John Hammond

33:42.380 --> 33:43.980
What

33:43.980 --> 33:45.980
Madman

33:47.260 --> 33:49.900
Delo has seen top gun Maverick

34:08.220 --> 34:11.260
That was a good one. I don't remember that one unused

34:11.260 --> 34:17.420
I'm trying to do right by the fan base. How is it unused unused? How did you get it then? It's on YouTube

34:18.060 --> 34:22.620
And you searched if I were you theme song. I thought it was just the other one that you got like the actual theme song

34:22.620 --> 34:25.820
Yeah, the show has been gone for a while almost a decade now. Nope. Oh, and

34:28.140 --> 34:32.060
Since people miss people miss the advice, right? I don't know Casey

34:34.540 --> 34:38.060
Yeah, you know, there's a there's a ton of advice podcasts now. So

34:38.540 --> 34:46.380
There's a huge hole in the market. I think it's what Casey just basically meant to say and um I thought that we could kind of bring back the old ethos the old uh the old show

34:47.100 --> 34:48.380
And uh

34:48.380 --> 34:56.220
Answer some advice columns from slate. Who made that theme song? We shouldn't have credit. Uh super Mario Mercado brothers or something like that

34:56.300 --> 34:59.740
That name sounds familiar. I don't know if we ever used that theme though. All right here we go

35:00.700 --> 35:07.340
The title of this is I've reunited with my high school boyfriend. He says he wishes he could have locked me away

35:07.420 --> 35:09.420
So I'd be untainted

35:10.460 --> 35:12.460
My god

35:14.140 --> 35:21.580
I'd be like we already know what to say just based on the title of the new house leave his ass, but let's get to it

35:21.980 --> 35:27.020
My situation is thus. I'm currently dating a guy after a six-year break from one another

35:27.340 --> 35:33.180
We were a high school sweetheart separated for college and recently at 25 he contacted me and we've begun dating again

35:33.580 --> 35:40.220
Everything is great with one exception. He has major issues with events that occurred in our time apart

35:40.620 --> 35:45.660
I had a few flings in college more sexual partners than he did and he had a problem with this

35:45.660 --> 35:51.500
He told me I just don't want to think of my girlfriend as ever being promiscuous or sluddy

35:52.220 --> 35:57.900
Such a double standard. How can I get him to forget the past and look toward our future will he ever get over it?

35:57.980 --> 36:07.180
Sir, certain things on TV make him think of things

36:08.060 --> 36:14.540
He told me you was just kind of locked me away for the past six years to keep me untainted. Please help

36:18.620 --> 36:24.780
She should get a video of him saying that. Yeah, put it online and then dump him and then he'll be like hey

36:24.780 --> 36:31.820
You shouldn't have done that and she'd be like that's Jonah Hill. Oh, there's this Jonah Hill his ass. Yeah, although was not like a reverse Jonah Hill

36:31.820 --> 36:36.540
Like he leaked it thinking he was the hero, but in fact. No, she leaked it. Oh, that's nice

36:36.940 --> 36:43.260
Yeah, then the full Jonah Hill. Yeah, certain things on TV make him think of things

36:43.820 --> 36:47.020
Yeah, like any sex scene gets his fucking blood pressure going

36:47.020 --> 36:54.540
Wasn't there there was like a TikTok account where a woman was explaining how that happened to her husband

36:54.860 --> 37:04.380
Like he just couldn't watch sex scenes because it was too triggering for something and it but like essentially baby to him because of that

37:06.060 --> 37:08.060
Cover his eyes

37:08.060 --> 37:16.060
Yeah, like it was like a video of her like hugging him and like consoling him. It was really wild

37:17.820 --> 37:19.580
So what do you guys did that's what I imagine?

37:20.060 --> 37:27.260
My advice is to get him to say that on camera and then get him to admit that he has this really small dick on camera

37:27.260 --> 37:32.140
Yeah, put that online have a go viral on TikTok and then break up with him on live

37:32.780 --> 37:34.780
So he sort of

37:35.340 --> 37:40.380
More to find advice behavior. Yeah, and then when he tells people the story everyone takes her side

37:40.380 --> 37:42.780
So yes to sort of live with that shame for the rest of his life

37:42.780 --> 37:46.140
But what if I wasn't expecting or sorry, what if he wasn't expecting that that would be your answer?

37:47.100 --> 37:52.060
He probably doesn't expect that. Yeah, yeah, because I didn't I he didn't you know

37:53.500 --> 37:55.500
He's aren't gonna sleep all right

37:56.780 --> 37:59.660
Next one I mean other people can weigh in two

38:00.540 --> 38:03.180
No, what got you made it very clear that you were at his gospel

38:06.140 --> 38:11.420
Oh my god, I told you guys I told you guys was gonna be a great episode

38:11.900 --> 38:17.900
It was awful. I just want it. I want to check on with Casey on regret scale of one to ten. Yeah

38:18.700 --> 38:23.980
Yeah, doing this part of this yeah, yeah talking about car accidents. Well, what would have been better?

38:25.900 --> 38:29.660
What would have been better than this? I really this was you know it could have gone either way

38:30.700 --> 38:33.420
It's kind of telling us something in the chat

38:35.020 --> 38:37.020
Maybe something that you could entertain us with

38:37.660 --> 38:42.220
Okay, Grace sent something in the chat. We're glad you're are currently at a

38:43.020 --> 38:45.020
Seven also

38:45.020 --> 38:47.980
That's pretty good because you don't want to be associated with this episode

38:48.860 --> 38:51.580
No, most most of the time I don't my god

38:53.020 --> 38:55.020
Sorry

38:56.300 --> 38:58.300
I never do this

38:59.420 --> 39:02.380
Isn't prepare for this show it could be a hundred things you're talking about

39:02.540 --> 39:04.540
Oh

39:06.140 --> 39:08.140
Rice is versatile

39:09.420 --> 39:15.580
It goes with every meat so much echo. I know I'm mostly drained

39:18.460 --> 39:20.460
Cold brew antidote

39:20.940 --> 39:22.940
Do you know what song this is?

39:22.940 --> 39:24.940
We ever tried sushi

39:24.940 --> 39:30.940
Princeton stripping a gear. It's something sugar with Japanese vinegar

39:31.900 --> 39:37.340
Do you fry my body and your dad is named Sandy? I take my soy

39:37.900 --> 39:39.900
Sturgeon shaking with butter

39:40.700 --> 39:42.700
But the child

39:42.940 --> 39:44.940
It's cold

39:49.740 --> 39:52.700
It's a lunch which comes from Spain

39:52.700 --> 39:55.820
I will spurn and return to the chef and take autorize

39:55.820 --> 39:59.740
Cautorize I want soiled sand and a year

40:00.700 --> 40:02.700
To advise you

40:03.180 --> 40:05.180
Consistency

40:05.180 --> 40:11.180
The ancient grains and burn hair that ignited

40:11.980 --> 40:17.900
When I seeered by self with the name of me are our

40:17.900 --> 40:19.900
Boreo

40:21.660 --> 40:23.660
I don't know the verses

40:24.700 --> 40:26.700
And fried rice stew

40:29.100 --> 40:31.100
Chorpe not too much

40:33.100 --> 40:35.100
I thought you should

40:37.740 --> 40:40.780
I asked precipitously of your ethnicity

40:41.820 --> 40:45.100
I want to wax about the grains of your culture

40:45.100 --> 40:48.060
Juicester as a maid or did you make this?

40:48.060 --> 40:54.460
Catch a great copper carbonizer and chimie keepers of your combusted couscous

40:56.460 --> 41:00.380
With the hoys it was nice to play with the labels in the rain just follow the rain

41:00.380 --> 41:02.380
They pay for rice

41:02.540 --> 41:04.540
Yes

41:05.100 --> 41:06.780
I roasted that fried rice

41:06.780 --> 41:09.260
You claim to shed an actor like soft butter

41:09.260 --> 41:11.020
But I did not think it was a cold

41:11.020 --> 41:12.220
What a cold

41:12.220 --> 41:13.820
That was a cold

41:13.820 --> 41:16.060
And I'm here

41:16.060 --> 41:18.300
To advise you

41:18.300 --> 41:22.700
Consistency of the ancient grains

41:22.700 --> 41:27.260
And burn hair that ignited

41:27.260 --> 41:32.060
When I see myself with the name of me are

41:32.540 --> 41:34.540
Our Boreo

41:42.140 --> 41:43.500
Crazy

41:43.500 --> 41:44.780
How are we feeling?

41:44.780 --> 41:46.140
I'm still echoing

41:46.140 --> 41:48.140
Yeah, I think the whole thing I could

41:48.140 --> 41:50.780
Kind of the worst listening experience for us

41:53.500 --> 41:55.180
This is fucked up but plugs

41:56.300 --> 41:58.300
Are you spinning me?

42:02.220 --> 42:05.420
Grace, I wish you had mentioned that earlier in the episode

42:06.620 --> 42:08.620
That's cool, she did

42:10.620 --> 42:13.100
Sent it earlier, didn't mention it

42:13.100 --> 42:15.020
There's a huge difference between sending it

42:15.020 --> 42:16.700
We couldn't get a word in head dry

42:16.700 --> 42:17.980
That's bullshit

42:17.980 --> 42:19.340
I'm what's hired of this

42:19.340 --> 42:19.980
What do you find?

42:19.980 --> 42:21.340
I think you're just tired

42:21.340 --> 42:21.980
Yeah

42:21.980 --> 42:22.620
Yeah

42:22.620 --> 42:23.900
We'll think it's of this

42:23.900 --> 42:26.540
Everything is like three times more fatiguing

42:26.540 --> 42:27.660
Yes exactly

42:27.660 --> 42:28.540
Like your energy

42:29.500 --> 42:30.460
I know

42:30.460 --> 42:31.500
Ultimately it's

42:31.500 --> 42:32.700
Irbent time

42:32.700 --> 42:33.900
No, it's just like doing

42:33.900 --> 42:34.700
Yeah anyway

42:34.700 --> 42:36.380
People are going to be really mad at me for this episode

42:36.380 --> 42:37.180
But I really tried

42:37.180 --> 42:37.980
I'm sorry, you guys

42:37.980 --> 42:39.180
Yeah

42:39.180 --> 42:41.020
Never apologize for this

42:41.020 --> 42:43.020
I thought I put together fine enough

42:43.020 --> 42:43.660
Not mind

42:43.660 --> 42:44.300
Just like this

42:44.300 --> 42:46.140
Again, this same outline could have gone well with like

42:46.140 --> 42:47.980
If everyone was in a different mood

42:47.980 --> 42:50.940
No, you were like reading the stuff that you had prepared

42:50.940 --> 42:53.900
And while you were reading it would constantly stop and go

42:53.900 --> 42:54.700
I might just cut this

42:56.140 --> 42:58.140
And so people always talk about it

42:58.780 --> 43:00.060
People in the room

43:00.060 --> 43:02.620
It's like I can guarantee it once they're in the episode

43:02.620 --> 43:04.380
So like there's a lot then you need to cut

43:04.380 --> 43:05.100
I was going to do this

43:05.100 --> 43:06.860
It's a 45 minutes of material

43:06.860 --> 43:08.380
That you said you were going to cut

43:08.380 --> 43:09.100
I don't mind

43:09.100 --> 43:11.100
I'm just just talking about

43:11.100 --> 43:12.460
How about the salt first

43:12.460 --> 43:13.100
Or

43:14.220 --> 43:16.940
Yeah, I'd say like 10% is about salt burn

43:17.900 --> 43:19.580
80% is about

43:20.700 --> 43:22.860
The technical difficulties we went through

43:23.500 --> 43:25.500
The my housecraft went through for sure

43:25.500 --> 43:27.180
I'm not going to mention the privacy edges

43:27.180 --> 43:29.180
Yeah, not even know anything about my house

43:29.180 --> 43:30.460
I want to I want all that

43:30.460 --> 43:33.900
All that section lifted out yeah, I get 10% was a really great

43:35.260 --> 43:38.860
Alanna's Morrisett cover yeah, yeah, that well great syrup

43:39.180 --> 43:41.180
Yeah, right Alanna's Morrisett parody

43:41.180 --> 43:44.220
I don't know if the cover was there. It was me and Casey sort of toned off

43:44.460 --> 43:48.140
Not only like we can't keep a tune but also like Casey was pitch-pumped

43:48.140 --> 43:49.740
We shouldn't have done that wasn't our story. Thank you, too

43:51.100 --> 43:55.500
Casey got it pretty early actually. I really like yeah. I didn't know what song it was until the chorus

43:56.460 --> 44:01.820
Because I don't know that song other than chorus probably. I apologize. No, it's it's your song

44:01.820 --> 44:05.980
You are a better thing. I knew the song. I apologize. No, no, it's here fall

44:09.900 --> 44:13.740
I'll start my fucking plugs nobody ever starts until I like yell other my guys no seriously

44:13.740 --> 44:16.060
We got to get the fuck out when the entire episode everybody's like

44:16.940 --> 44:20.780
Like what is this over and then it gets to plug and everybody's like kidding me like we want to like stay

44:20.860 --> 44:26.140
The last two times I've been on you haven't given me chance to plug and in fact the only segment you did the past

44:26.140 --> 44:29.900
Easy episodes. It's just been me you and him it and the only segment you have prepared was right

44:31.100 --> 44:33.100
Breaking ourselves

44:35.660 --> 44:38.300
What and that stayed in

44:39.900 --> 44:48.860
You did not do that when was that we all got diagnosed with as pergarious

44:51.020 --> 44:55.420
Yeah, when was that I had to see a psychiatrist after that. You don't remember

44:56.860 --> 44:59.900
What was we used to I can sponsored by better help

45:00.300 --> 45:02.780
I think we're like we're gonna use some momentum help integrate it

45:03.180 --> 45:05.180
Mentor how I started taking medication

45:06.060 --> 45:10.700
Because of the episode I think so I think I have a lot of episode on the end

45:10.700 --> 45:14.860
Taking a lot of lithium because I left the episode thinking I had bipolar

45:15.500 --> 45:19.980
Um, I don't know what you're talking

45:22.540 --> 45:31.740
Long and short to remedy it's like every four episode is garbage. Why Pluto TV on right now? I can't handle this

45:34.860 --> 45:41.180
Patreon.com forward slash Riley and Jeff we still have a patreon and we do zoom parties where you can kind of hang out with us

45:41.660 --> 45:44.700
And it's they're very fun. I got somebody else took over that

45:44.940 --> 45:51.740
Plus the yeah review review review review different hosts, but because we don't own the rights of the show that was never officially a review

45:51.740 --> 45:53.980
A podcast thing so we kept doing it interesting

45:55.100 --> 45:59.340
Remind me to talk to you about that because that might be my cat take me to court. You don't have the money

46:02.220 --> 46:03.900
If you don't have the money for privacy edges

46:05.420 --> 46:07.420
Let alone Lucas edges look

46:08.220 --> 46:15.580
My lawyer you couldn't afford Lucas edges. You barely have the money for no a

46:15.580 --> 46:22.940
Con ticket let alone Ali Khan Mountain and Lucas edges. He's uh is he is he beautiful boy or is he boy

46:23.740 --> 46:27.340
Jean boy's back. What's he's been his back in the edge

46:28.460 --> 46:31.260
Do you think Lucas hedges his bets do you think that's how he got to where he is?

46:32.220 --> 46:38.940

WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Sounds faint.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
There's day, May 11th.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
WJ Strike is in full effect.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
This is a, we batch recorded an episode.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
We did it one this morning.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
I'm still kind of in a bad mood.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Just to be honest.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
So you guys know where I'm coming from.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Every week we've been trying to, sorry.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
I can sip on the show.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
It's not a stopable event.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
I know.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
I just, I'm gonna have to edit that out.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
I like fully heard that.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah, we, uh, we're checking in on the WJ Strike.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
It's sort of halted Hollywood.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
But because we're batch recording,

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
we're not gonna really get a check in for week three.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
So what do you guys think will have happened then?

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
I think that we're gonna see some repeating signs.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Yeah, that's good.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
A sign repeater?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Yeah.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
It's like an outfit repeater.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Yeah.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Um, and then second most important.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
And I guess we should introduce Erica.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Uh, welcome to the show.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Uh, I don't know your last name.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Otherwise, I would have said both.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
That's okay.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
It's a matter.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
That's not where you're about it.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Holy shit.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Do you want to correct that?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
What's that?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
That's correct.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Um, and then I guess you're sophomore appearance,

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
Alkberg on the show.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
No, Alkberg on the show.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
You just renaming everyone.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Well, Alkberg is the creator of Silicon Valley, right?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
It doesn't matter.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
What are you doing here?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
You're like a millionaire.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
I know.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Uh, Erica, this is your first time on the show.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Do you want to introduce yourself to the audience?

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
What do you do at head gum or anything else you want them to know?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Yeah.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
So my last name is Jensen.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Just putting it out there.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Erica Jensen.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
That sounds like an animated character.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Really?

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
And then I do add-ups for the West Coast.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
For gumball or head gum.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
I guess head gum both.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
All right.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Gumball.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Very cool.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
And you said you live in the valley.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Where in the valley?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
I don't know where that is.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
It's okay.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
That doesn't matter either.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Okay, cool.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
And I'll leave that out, I guess.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Um, you answered like that.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
I mean, this is going on to like what 50,000 people.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Really?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Yeah.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Um, doubtful.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Not even.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Not even.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
I thought it was like 30,000.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Don't we sell the ads at 30,000?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Yeah, but those numbers are fudge.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
It's probably close to 2,900 people listening.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
And then we sell it for 30, 40k.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Which ends up being pennies on the dollar.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Exactly.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Erica knows all about that.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Yeah.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
So yeah.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
And I don't see a dime of that.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
I get paid hourly.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Yes, exactly.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
We pay you up front.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
So it's low risk, but low reward.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
A stipend.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Exactly.

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
You said stipend with the same like intonation as like new parents say diaper.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
Where it's like, they don't want to change a diaper because they're, they're first

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
time having a kid.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
You get this.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
No.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Oh yeah, it's Jake that's having a kid.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Um, where is the little soccer?

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Do you think, well, by this time next Friday, you'll have been born.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
She'll have been born.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
I think so, yeah.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
And if not, then we've got a real problem on our hands.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Yeah.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Yeah.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I'm going to cut that out.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Uh, we've got a lot to get to.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Everyone seems very nervous.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Even a mirror.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
What the hell is that?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
My headphones don't work.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Yeah, I feel like I can't hear.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
I know.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yeah.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
The headphones are not actually amplifying our microphones.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
It's just dampening what we can hear.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
IRL.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
What about the sound effects?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I can get the sound effects.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I take my headphones off because I couldn't even hear the sound effects.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Are you okay?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Yeah.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
You seem upset.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
All right.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
Um, we're doing this new setup again where I'm behind the boards just because I can live

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
at it, uh, which makes it easier for me.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
And also, uh, head camera fuses to give us a producer for the show.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Uh, other than Ania, who's a supervising producer.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
So she handles emails and scheduling, et cetera.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
But they don't seem to want to pair this show with a, in studio producer, right?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Someone who can be on the board.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
So you can make sure everything is working right the levels, uh, do the live at it.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
And, uh, I don't appreciate it.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
So here I am behind the boards.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Uh, and I think that people enjoy it last week's episode.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
So I don't know what to say.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Yeah.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Yeah.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Thank you.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Thank you.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Thank you.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Thank you.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Thank you.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Thank you.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Thank you.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Thank you.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Thank you.

05:06.000 --> 05:14.000
Bonn of the week, uh, every week, we put up a fucking casting option for 007.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
It doesn't matter.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
This week, my pick is Dylan Brosnan.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
So instead of James Bond, it's James's spawn.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Hmm.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Who's Dylan Brosnan?

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
He's, uh, Pierce's son.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Oh, his hot son.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
How old is he?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
What's that?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
How old is he?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
He's my age.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
I went to school with him.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I went to USC with him.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Hmm.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
And, uh, there was a day.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
There was a night that we were out downtown with some friends at the Ace Hotel.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Hmm.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Pretty awesome.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
And, uh, at least at the time.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
And, I see Dylan.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
And so I'm like, holy shit.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
I know like I'm from class.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
I don't even think at this point I knew that he was like a famous person's son.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
So I go up to him and I'm like, Dylan.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Bunch of you.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
I see a people over there like you should come have a drink with us because he was alone.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Uh, and then it turned out he was on a date.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
His date walked up and I was like, oh, oh, never mind.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
And he was kind of an asshole to me about it.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Hmm.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Interesting.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Sounds like you were just being really nice.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
I was.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
We might not have been able to hear me because he didn't end up, uh,

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
with me in the eye.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
And that was like 40 feet away.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Yeah, that could be it.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
It's so foggy up.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
It's a mere second episode.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
So he kind of expanded all his energy on the first one.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
You're not even trying first of all.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
You're mad that you had to have a salad.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
We were scheduled to record at one.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Sure.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Our lunch got here at one.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Absolutely.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
So the decision was made.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Do we eat now or just think about the food you made record?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Right.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
So I thought which was kind of smart.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Should half of it before the record for about 10 minutes.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Yeah.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
And then so we're safe.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
You satiated for the actual episode.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
But it's not like fargic for the full episode.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
But now we're, yeah, digesting.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Yes, exactly.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Which is why I thought half was a good compromise.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
So I'm not like fully in this post food coma world.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Do you want a digesty?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
No.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
I don't want a digesty if I'm using it.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
I do.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
I do.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Do you want to compare?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
We have comparing.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
That's all we have right here.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
In the office.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Yeah.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Not good.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
We've got a lot to get to.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
We're going to talk about the WGA strike.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
All we got projecting to next week is that alley thinks that people are going to be sign repeaters.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Which I think is great.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
A great prediction.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Erica, what do you got?

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
Honestly, I have no idea about the whole thing.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Like I know about it.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
But like I couldn't give you much to talk about.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
And would you say that the question I just asked was good for content.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Sure.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
You think it was?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
I mean, I don't know why.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
I'm not talking about that.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
I think it was.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
What's that?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
No, I didn't say it.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Erica, you said you went to school in Vegas.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
You're going to Vegas tonight?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
No.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Is that true?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Just for fun.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Yeah.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Well, how often do you go to Vegas?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
I go.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
I used to go a lot.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Like every few weeks.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
And then now it's like once a month or so.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
I mean, I go a lot.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Yeah.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Once a month is pretty solid.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yeah.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
I've never been.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
No, I'm driving.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Got it.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
But sometimes I'll fly.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
I don't like flying in the summer.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
It's the turbulence is so bad.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Well, you didn't mean the airline.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
You just meant like that's the general region.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
I meant the airline.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
You've never been to Vegas?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
I've never.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
I've never been to Vegas.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Really?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
It shows.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Wait, no, you said it definitely shows.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
It's for the best.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Yeah.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Well, I don't think he'd be able to handle what Vegas has to offer.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
What do you mean?

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
It's the same as any other town.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
There's just like more clubs.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Yeah.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Well, it's not really that.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
The American can tell you.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
She's sort of this kind of server.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
But that city would chew you up and spit you out.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Yeah.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
You don't know me at all.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
But what do you think?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
To me out.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Well, it's just like all clubbing, drinking, gambling.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
It's pretty nice.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Part of stuff.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
You don't like.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Those are all things.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
It's expensive.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Dinner's buffet.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Well, I like a buffet.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Yeah.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Yeah.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
And I like a Cirque du Soleil.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
They have that fair.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
It's too.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
It's scary for me.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Vegas.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
I'm terrified.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
It's too risky.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
The axe, the tricks.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Oh, you're like.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Oh, you're nervous.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I said they're the entire time waiting for someone to get hurt.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
And then I'm at the show where something terrible happened.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
I have to.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
And then I was there.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
And then I have that memory.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
It's too much for me.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Okay.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
So let's do this.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
Let's do like a not even thought exercise, but straight up acting exercise.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
So you're in the.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Sorry.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
She just said okay.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
I'm still picking up on the fact that Alex and I'm here.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Wish they could have finished their lunch and peace.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
You're at Cirque du Soleil.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Sure.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
You're in the audience.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Okay.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
They're doing their high flying high fatuten accidents.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Yeah.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
I'm starting.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
That's what I know.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Okay.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
So let's say you and a.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
We're at a company to treat next year's in Vegas.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
You guys are sat next to each other.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
How do you both react?

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Here we go.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Three, two, one action.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Whoa.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Oh.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Can I stop you right there?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Yeah.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
You're already.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
You're doing too much because like you want to be like,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Whoa, you know, during like a.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Yeah.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
It's like a performance.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
And we're actually doing that there.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Right.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Yeah.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
But that's not a good thing.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Like absolutely correct.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
But that's not a good thing.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
I think it's fun to like engage with the show and like feel.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Yeah.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Almost like you're overcome with the joy.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Yeah.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Or the need to like exclaim.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Yeah.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Someone's going to fall.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
And then it'll be a silent theater and a mirror going.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Whoa.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Whoa.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
I've heard.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Oh.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Oh.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Yeah.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
The fear.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Just one second.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Because so the fear for me is that you.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
So you stop doing it for you.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Sure.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Right.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
And so can we agree on that?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Yeah.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
It's a fact.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Yeah.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Not like something we have to agree on.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
And it's a fact.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
It's not like such a big deal.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
It's a fact.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Carry on.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
You stopped doing that show.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
And I feel like there's this like.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Each that's not being scratched for your ass.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
In terms of performing in terms of being in the limelight.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
You think me going.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Whoa.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
During a circus.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
It's being drunk.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Like reclaim my glory years of being a podcast.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
I think you're trying to.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Yeah.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Center yourself.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Where there is no narrative for you there.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
And Jeff St.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
You're saying stop with the cameo.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
So imagine like.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Yeah.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Like a blackjack table saying the.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
To with dealer.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Like it wouldn't be sense.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
You know.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Sort it out.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Yeah.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
They're calling the pit boss.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
The first in card counting.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Yeah.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Who's there?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
No.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
That's your asking for the hit.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Is that knocking on wood?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
No.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
That's me saying hit me.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Have you been to any casino ever?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Yes.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
I went to the talking stick thing with you last year.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
It's got still.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Like how much money I lost.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
He lost a few hundred dollars pretty fast.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I lost two hundred dollars within ten minutes.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Like what?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Card.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
It's fucking blackjack.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
I think.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
And then there was yeah.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Isn't that like the easiest game though?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Watch the easiest game.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
He's still quite couldn't figure it out.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
And then do you want to tell the story of how I almost got my legs broken?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Did you?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Were you there?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
No.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Remember I like.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
So I like barely grazed the table with the chip.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
To increase a bit or not.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Oh yeah.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
A bet.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
And I remember.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Yeah.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
The fucking dealers like whoa.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Like you can't.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
He's not like the chip.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
What mid bet.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
It's like you're not supposed to touch that.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
It looked like you were like taking some chips off.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
I was like, sorry.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Yeah.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Never been to casino.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
And he's like, no.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I have to take call my manager.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Oh.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
I'm like, but it's like already lost.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Yeah.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Okay.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
If I win this.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
The casino still wins.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
I still lost a hundred fifty dollars.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
So I didn't know that it.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
People.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Especially in fucking.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
What does it Scottsdale?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Yeah.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
I don't know.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
So I almost got my legs broken.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
We shouldn't.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Alex.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
What do your thoughts on Vegas?

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
You know, I went to Vegas for this job for a conference just a few months ago.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
That feels like it's the worst way to do Vegas.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Yeah.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Sitting inside like a sea level.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Resort.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
It's gone for so whole.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Yeah.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
More us at lights.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
The smell is smoke everywhere.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
That's the first time you've ever been.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
No.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
No, no, no.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
But it's not my favorite place.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Where is your favorite place?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Poooticana.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Sorry.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
I was a funny.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Yeah.

13:42.000 --> 13:52.000
What a bad thing to say during a conversation.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
You're never in a good place.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
You have to ask that.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
What's your favorite place?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Turkey.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Really?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Yeah.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
What's your favorite food?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Turkey.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Yeah.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Like chicken.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Not like kebab and stuff.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Yeah.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Yeah.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Favorite Turkish restaurant?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
You don't have to answer that.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
I want to.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I don't want to divulge my secrets.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Wow.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Because then there'll be a line up at the door.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
It's like when that bagel place got really famous in Highland Park.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Local references.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
People hate when this happens.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Grace cut that out.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Alex, you recently started a vintage furniture with furnishing company.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Wow.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Wow.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Wow.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Let's hear her out.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
No, let's hear her out.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
It's good.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Both.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
I did it.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Do you want to plug it?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Yeah.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
It's called old souls.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
LA.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
And I am sourcing cool vintage furniture and home decor.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
And I'm selling it online.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
And it's fun.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
We actually do have a.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
If you ever.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
If do.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Are there any couches?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
You didn't have a question.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
You wanted to ask a question.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
And you figured it out as you said.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
No.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
I was trying to say, I need a new couch so bad.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
And so if you ever have, I follow your account.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Oh.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
I do.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
I'm on the hunt for a new couch so bad.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
I hate mine.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
I can't say it enough.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
I hate it.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
I got you.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
It makes me mad when I go home.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
I actually feel the same way about my couch right now.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Yeah.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Talk about it every day to my boyfriend.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
And he's probably fed up with me.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Yeah.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
You know what?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Like, there's no structure to the back of your couch.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
It just hurts your back.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
And you're just on.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Lang.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
You're playing this against the life of me.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
You're playing.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Yeah.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Yeah.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
It's a reverse playing.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I'm like, look at you.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Oh.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
How does that work?

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
Where you own basically a furniture company.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
But your furniture that you own is not cutting it.

15:59.000 --> 16:05.000
Well, you know, I ordered a new couch like six months ago.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Yeah.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Restoration hardware.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Cardi L.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Dame?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Yeah.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Yeah.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
I don't know.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
I don't know.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
I don't know.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
I don't know.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Not never heard of that brand, but it sounds great.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Yeah.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
They have like mid-century modern stuff.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
But they've pushed it back essentially until October now.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Yeah.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
That's a bunch of that mid-century.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Yeah.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Yeah.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I don't know.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
See, that's a joke.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Not like you're weird.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Sorry, I can't hear.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
What's that?

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Are you playing a song?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
You made the sound effect.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Yeah.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Yeah.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Yeah.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Yeah.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
So at Old Souls LA.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
At Old Souls.LA.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
And is it local pickup only?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Mostly, yeah.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Unless it's like something really small.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Like put in the effort.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Huh?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Nothing.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
How are you?

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
No.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
Is it you purchasing stuff that you see from like flea markets and stores?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Yeah.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
So is it from your house?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
So is it from your house?

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Sourcing from places like like the Rose Bowl flea.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
And you didn't realize it.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I think I said it pretty simply.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
I was just wondering.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Yeah.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Yeah.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Not as much flea markets because I feel like that stuff

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
already like priced.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Accordingly.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Accordingly.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Yeah.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
A lot is state sales.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
That's cool.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
So I'm hitting the estate.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Did you go to that one in Belair?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
The other day?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
No.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Did you?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
I was going to.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
I didn't wake up at the time.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
No.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
When you talk.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
When you say estate sales is like people

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
I just passed away.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Sometimes yes.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Well, sometimes they're just trying to get

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
a bunch of shit.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
Sometimes they're someone's moving and they're like

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
liquidating all their stuff.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
It's not enough.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
What's the best deal you've gotten at an estate sale?

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
I got a $50 desk for $9.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
No, I paid $50.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Yeah.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
And then you can sell it for much more.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Yeah.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Much more.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Yeah.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Let's.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Let's facilitate some deals right now.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
So you need a sofa.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
I can't even tell you how much I hate my couch.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Yes.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
What's wrong with your couch?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
I hate it.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
It's bad.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
It's dirty.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
It's comfortable.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Oh.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
It's.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
I think I.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
I bought it from Facebook Marketplace.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
I think it.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I bought it new.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
But it's so cheap from Amazon.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
And I didn't realize that until after it was

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
already in my house.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Like I didn't put it in the couch.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
I made it at the same material.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Yes.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
They're a tap.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Yeah.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
One lump sum.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
It is one lump sum.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
One lump sum.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
It was a hot cross of bun's parody.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
I didn't mean to get so heated.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
I didn't.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
You know what?

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I don't talk about this outside of my apartment at night.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
So it's like I didn't realize how much it's permeating my mood during the day.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Right.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
It's hard to get away.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
You can't escape it.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
No.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
It's always top of mind.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Can I ask a question?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Please.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
If your couch was a real life person.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Who would it be?

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Oh.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
And why?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
What's that?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
And why?

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Please not be.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Oh my god.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
If it's me.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
It would be like.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
You know, okay.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
It is a it is a sea.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
It's also.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
It's not the right shade of green.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
But it's green.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
So I would say it's like the most annoying.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Like Tucker Carlson or something.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Yeah.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
But like there.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Have you heard the.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
Have you heard the thing that it's like.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Like green couches or like supposed to be bisexual.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
It's like.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
It's like.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Have you heard a green couch?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Am I a sexual?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
You must be.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
I was going on a line where it was like.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
All of these people being like if you have a green velvet couch.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
That means you're bisexual.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Which my couch is in green or velvet.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
And I'm not bisexual.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
But.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
So what are you worried about?

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
I'm saying that my couch would be the most annoying.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
Try hard out there that also happens to be bisexual.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Interesting.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
And it's.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
It's I can't complain about it enough.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
It was asked me what color my couch is.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
We're colors.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Your couch green.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Ask me what material it's made of.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Can I guess.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Yeah.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Right.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
That's that's what it.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I've been limiting my option sexually.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Is that true?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
You have a green velvet couch.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Why are you so curious all of a sudden?

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
I'm just thinking.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
That's how M.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
It came out as by with a green couch.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Is that true?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Yeah.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
She used to be my neighbor.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Really?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Yeah.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
And then we both moved.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Same week.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
She came out as by because of her green couch on to talk.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Did she come out on top?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
I thought she came out on top.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
It's a winch selling girl.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I think this is what that means.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Right.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
And then who did she?

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
French.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Pete Davidson.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Harry Styles.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Yeah.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
I ended up being Harry.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Yeah.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
So that's not really proving anything because she was married to a man.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Got divorced, sold to house.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
I moved as well.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Same week.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Did I mention that?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Yep.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Yep.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
And we do have to take a break.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
The show is sponsored by BetterHelp.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Guys, I'm in a coffee shop in Madison, Indiana.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
And I'm going to attempt to do this at read.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
It's easy to get caught up in whatever what else needs from you.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Right?

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
And it's hard to take a moment to think about what you need from yourself.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
I often get caught up with my weekly schedule.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Right?

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
What I have to get done.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Who I have to sort of appease who I have to please.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
And I don't check in with myself to be like, what do I need?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Is that rest?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Is that relaxation?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Is that connecting with friends and family?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
etc.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
But when we spend all of our time giving,

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
you can leave us feeling stretched then and burnt out.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Right?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
And that's where there becomes then.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
Because there can give you the tools to find more balance in your life.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
So you can keep supporting others without leaving yourself behind.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
I'm therapy every week.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Again, I talk about it every week.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Change my life.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Maybe a different version of myself.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Maybe a better version of myself.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
And I would encourage you to do the same,

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
especially because BetterHelp offers expanded access.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
So if you're thinking about starting therapy,

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
you get better help a try.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
It's entirely online.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
It's decided to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
Just fill out a brief questionnaire to get matched with a license therapist.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
And switch therapist at any time for no additional charge.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
You see how fast that was?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Oh, my head for work again.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
We're already back.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
See, I'll forgive it.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Oh, she knows this.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Erica, how'd you meet your best friend?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
My best friend?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Yeah.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Hmm.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
My best friend, I met in high school.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Hmm.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
But I feel like I have multiple best friends.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
That makes sense.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
I got that.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Yeah.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
It's a tier.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Like my best friend grew.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
My best friend grew from LA.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Like I met them in high school.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Yeah.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
But I have like best friends from like preschool.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Like I have a different friend.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
I like Vegas.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
But like...

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
There's a lot.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
But it's just like there's different groups.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
And I consider them all like...

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Are they all part of the Vegas crew?

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
No.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
I have my Vegas friends.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Separate.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
And honestly, if my friends watch this,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
but my Vegas friends are my best friend.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Oh.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
I love them.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
A lot.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
No.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
I mean...

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
No, they're not.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
You're gonna hear first.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
For the life of you.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
No.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Who...

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
But okay.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
So let's just start some shit.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
What's funny?

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Right?

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Like this is actually kind of a series episode so far.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Try to get to know Erica.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
I've never met her.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Not really.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Not really.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
We talked about Cirque du Soleil.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Yeah.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Yeah.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
We talked about Alex's actual business, by the way.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Literally a circus.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I'm not running a circus.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
No.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Not you.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
A lot.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Cirque du Soleil.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Like a PT Barnum kind of guy.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Right.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Yeah.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Like an agent of chaos.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I can't come out pro circus.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
I'm not.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
I feel like I stuck.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
And I'm sorry for laughing earlier.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
It's kind of fucked up.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Um...

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Of your Vegas group.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Close his friends.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
I should say.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
I should take that back.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Oh.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
No.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
I mean like to go out with.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Yeah.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
And like no drama.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
No issues.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Like they're like the best people.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I feel like the people I go out with are the ones that always have drama.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
But I feel like you're best friends that you've known the longest.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
There's always going to be drama.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
That's true.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Like there's always like some built up anger.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Something between everybody.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Yeah.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
How big is the Vegas group?

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Sorry.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
It's only like...

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
I'm curious.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
How big is how many people though?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Okay.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Okay.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
So an L.A. like our group is like...

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
I guess like six girls?

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Six out.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
No.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Six out.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Six out.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Six out.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Six out.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Six out.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Six out.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Six out.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Six out.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Six out.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Six out.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Six out.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Six out.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Six out.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Five out.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Six out.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Eight out.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Fifter?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Let's see.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Six out.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Six out.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Five out.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Six out.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Five out.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Six out.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Six out.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
Six out.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Minions.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.400
hanging out with from college that her boyfriend's not your best friend. He is my best friend.

26:01.400 --> 26:06.440
So how did we do? He is coming. But I will say, so here's the thing, my boyfriend's from Vegas.

26:07.000 --> 26:13.480
So he has a lot, he lives here now, but he has a lot of like friends in Vegas that have

26:13.480 --> 26:18.600
other friends that we all kind of like all became a group. The crew's sort of the network grows from

26:18.600 --> 26:23.640
there. It's like, yeah, it's like a phone tree. You become his friend and then his friends become your

26:24.120 --> 26:27.320
friends and then they all become friends with each other. Right. I guess you're there. It's a never.

26:27.320 --> 26:32.520
For five minutes in Vegas, you would not survive. Your energy is so anti fun. What do you mean?

26:32.520 --> 26:36.440
There's no way that you would ever like step foot at another casino and have a good time.

26:36.440 --> 26:42.040
The last time Alex was in this room for this show, we were concocting dairy. Yeah, that is nothing.

26:44.040 --> 26:46.920
I almost want to like see you in Vegas, just to like test you out. Yeah,

26:46.920 --> 26:51.240
so it's like a weird fish. Like we grow you. It's an efficient water, just different waters.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.920
But you have to wear what you're wearing now, but like you wouldn't get into a class. You would

26:54.920 --> 26:59.320
not get into a club. That's what I'm trying to say. You would not get into a club. You're wearing a

26:59.320 --> 27:06.520
golf pole. By the way, the same shirt you wore last night on the live. Sure. Sure. Sure.

27:06.520 --> 27:10.360
Take a break. We're right back.

27:14.360 --> 27:18.840
Guys here, I am still in this coffee shop in Madison, Indiana and I want to talk to you guys about

27:18.840 --> 27:23.320
AG1 by athletic greens. Right? Because our next partner is athletic greens. And I take

27:23.320 --> 27:29.240
AG1 by athletic greens every day. I am traveling right now. I've been out of LA for two weeks.

27:29.240 --> 27:35.240
And I have been using their travel packs by AG1 to make sure that I'm having that consistent

27:35.240 --> 27:41.640
nutritional insurance every morning. Again, I take AG1 in the morning every day. I do a glass of water.

27:41.640 --> 27:46.760
I do AG1 and then I do cold brew. I'm soaring, right? Because I feel like I'm doing one thing for

27:46.840 --> 27:51.400
my health every day. The rest of the day, I might not work out. I might not eat well. But I know

27:51.400 --> 27:58.360
that I'm getting all of the vitamins, minerals, and nutritional whole food source super foods

27:58.360 --> 28:05.080
that I need to get my day started right to have good energy and to have good sleep and recovery.

28:05.880 --> 28:10.280
It's hard for me to keep up with the supplement routine. I used to take a bunch of vitamins

28:10.280 --> 28:14.680
different individual pills from different companies. There's no need for that anymore. Because with

28:14.680 --> 28:20.200
AG1, I get over 75 vitamins, minerals, and again, a whole food source ingredients. Have the highest

28:20.200 --> 28:24.520
quality of the highest caliber of the highest calendar that give me major benefits like gut and

28:24.520 --> 28:29.880
move support, boosted energy, and even healthier looking skin, hair, and nails, right?

28:30.840 --> 28:34.680
So if you're looking for an easier way to take supplements, athletic greens is going to give you

28:34.680 --> 28:40.040
a free one-year supply of vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. Which

28:40.040 --> 28:46.040
again, I am using currently. Go to athleticgreens.com slash reports that, that's athleticgreens.com slash

28:46.040 --> 28:48.360
what's that? Check it out. Thanks athleticgreens.

28:51.320 --> 28:55.400
I think I would last a day in Vegas, and then I'd have to come back. Sure. Sure. You did almost get your

28:55.400 --> 29:02.840
legs broken at the talking stick. You couldn't handle Scottsdale. I don't know, I could have

29:02.840 --> 29:08.520
been you want to be on the strip. No, Vegas has never been my back and I've never been there,

29:08.520 --> 29:14.520
but I don't think I would enjoy it. I think what we should do is we all join Erica on her trip

29:14.520 --> 29:21.000
third and I know the way she wants that. Now you guys could come, tack on, kind of test this out.

29:21.000 --> 29:26.680
Like, see how it'll go. Let me show you around how it'll go. The drive, the drive is the most fun part,

29:26.680 --> 29:31.480
right? Yeah, I'm going to try to drive it through the desert. We can have like hijinks on the road.

29:31.480 --> 29:35.720
Oh, road hijinks basically. Where do you stop along the way? And then I'll rather be in the

29:35.720 --> 29:41.160
car. No, you have to stop in bar so. And then maybe watch some few videos from bar stool and bar

29:41.160 --> 29:45.400
stow. No, not that at all. It's Dave Portno. You know, it's in Baker.

29:46.680 --> 29:53.880
World's largest thermals. I was going to say. And again, and you would tell that because you don't

29:53.880 --> 29:58.440
belong anywhere near there. When how many times have you been to Vegas? It doesn't. Really. Yeah,

29:58.440 --> 30:05.000
literally like gambling. Yeah, grew up in LA, very close by been 21 for at least 19 years. You

30:05.080 --> 30:10.680
got to assume I'm there a few times a year. All right. Yeah, times a year. A few. Do you fly?

30:11.240 --> 30:16.920
Sometimes I fly. Sometimes I drive. I fly. I fly is like easy. It's like 45 minutes, but driving is the

30:16.920 --> 30:22.520
fun part. If you're going with friends, like, driving back is so bad. It's so bad. It is really bad. It

30:22.520 --> 30:29.400
almost undoes the fun of Vegas. Yeah, you cannot leave Sunday at like nine a.m. You'll be like 12 hours.

30:29.480 --> 30:39.320
12 hours. It's beer. Huh? Nothing. I said, I've been to Big Bear. Right. You know, I've never been to Big

30:39.320 --> 30:44.760
Bear. Oh, you guys should do a little retreat. So I go to Vegas and you go to Big Bear. Yeah,

30:44.760 --> 30:49.400
we can like FaceTime and that probably like do you like going to like a cabin and yeah, I've gone to

30:49.400 --> 30:54.600
Maman, but I've never done Big Bear. So you're just like socially liquid. You're just like, you have the

30:54.600 --> 31:00.040
cap. I don't know if it's the food I just had or what you just said, but that I really feel

31:00.040 --> 31:04.680
nauseous right now. What's the problem? Did you eat too fast? No, I was sort of eating at a normal

31:04.680 --> 31:09.320
amount, but then you said socially liquid and I feel like food was just a perfect thing. I feel like

31:09.320 --> 31:15.560
what you said was the norivirus and it's affecting me. The norivirus? I think so. Oh, here we go.

31:16.440 --> 31:22.920
Oh, fuck. Socialy liquid, was it? Yeah, can you elaborate on that? Like you have the capitol. You have the

31:23.000 --> 31:27.720
social capitol to do and the wherewithal, mind you, to be in Vegas, but also in a cabin, which is

31:27.720 --> 31:35.800
like a very well for it. I can only do the latter. I'm with you there. I don't think I'm Vegas.

31:35.800 --> 31:40.680
I feel like I've driven that point home pretty clear though. Yeah, because you said that you get worried

31:40.680 --> 31:50.280
it. I would love to go to Vegas. I want to go once, but I feel, it's a fun place to be.

31:50.280 --> 31:55.320
I feel like I'm going to end up there for like bachelor parties. So I find not going by choice.

31:55.320 --> 32:00.680
And you only go for like a weekend. It's not as too much. No, you get their Friday, party,

32:00.680 --> 32:05.640
party Saturday, leave Sunday. I can't party two nights in a row anymore. I'm only 25.

32:06.360 --> 32:10.920
You're only 25? Yeah. You could party.

32:14.520 --> 32:18.120
Hey, if I can party two nights in a row. You can't, you can't even do one night. When we went to New

32:18.120 --> 32:21.480
York, if the Grammar season shows, you didn't go out afterwards. Everyone else did.

32:21.480 --> 32:25.640
Yeah, you did leave Austin one night. What did you do on the retreat this year? Did he go out?

32:25.640 --> 32:29.960
No, you left early one night. Is that really early? But I thought it was after midnight.

32:29.960 --> 32:34.440
We watched, we sat next to each other and watched a pool game for a little. Yeah, that was fun.

32:34.440 --> 32:38.440
Yeah, we watched a billion. One second, was it fun for Ali? Yeah. Yeah.

32:38.440 --> 32:44.280
Because it was sort of swing twice if he paid you off. No way. That's not like a dream.

32:44.280 --> 32:47.160
My fear with you is like, I don't want you to get too rich because you're going to become weird.

32:48.600 --> 32:52.680
What? Like, you know, some people can handle wealth. You don't think he can take it. Not at all.

32:52.680 --> 32:57.240
I feel like you're going to, you're going to be spending $300 on a hoodie. Do you're not going to change your style?

32:57.240 --> 33:00.520
Okay. And then, like, are you with me? Okay, or are you skeptical?

33:00.520 --> 33:06.520
I mean, that sounds like a nice hoodie. But you know what I mean? And then, you're going to like pay people off.

33:06.520 --> 33:09.240
You know what I mean? I wouldn't do that. No, you would. You would be like,

33:09.960 --> 33:14.120
don't come to this thing tonight because I don't want to feel anxious. Here's a thousand dollars. Here's a rack.

33:15.080 --> 33:21.000
You can pay me not to show up. How much light? I don't want to pay anybody not to show up. That's crazy.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.160
What's the, what's the sandwich picture that you put up behind you? Oh, yeah. So that's going to be,

33:25.160 --> 33:32.600
you can't really see it, but you can see on any sandwich here. But it says Dutch. It says Dutch crunch bread

33:33.640 --> 33:40.120
from togos. Also to the tune of hot crossbubble. Dutch crunch bread. On any sandwich.

33:40.520 --> 33:44.520
Um, Aaron, what's your impression of the show so far?

33:46.440 --> 33:52.520
Honestly. Yes. It's okay. Okay. It's good. You haven't like caught a vibe.

33:53.240 --> 34:01.800
I mean, I think can I be honest? Yeah. I feel like within like head gun. Yeah. Like there's always an awkward

34:01.800 --> 34:07.320
silence. Like someone talks and then it's like quiet. Yeah. So the thing that everybody

34:07.320 --> 34:12.200
comments this every week, they're like, I thought I'd paused the podcast, but it was just something

34:12.200 --> 34:16.280
that happened in the source. But Eric, I mean, it's even not the company. I know I always

34:16.280 --> 34:20.120
am pushing like overlapping dialogue. But like there's a difference between like long silences,

34:20.120 --> 34:23.960
and then like talking over each time. I feel like you're over. I feel like you're making sure that there's

34:23.960 --> 34:29.320
no silence. Well, but normal conversations do have a little bit of a beat between when I talk when you

34:29.400 --> 34:39.400
do. Right. Right. Should we see how long we can go on the silence? Oh, that could be good.

34:40.200 --> 34:44.280
What's the longest silence on the podcast? What's that? Let's get a numbers crunch on that.

34:44.280 --> 34:49.080
I'm sure somebody will love stage make a compilation of that right now. See what it feels like.

34:49.080 --> 34:54.120
Sage does already too much work. Let's let's one minute, 60 seconds of silence. Can you do that?

34:54.120 --> 34:58.920
I love it. Can you put up a timer? Do you see how long we can manage? No, I'm saying,

34:58.920 --> 35:01.960
can we should do 60 seconds of silence right now? All right.

35:01.960 --> 35:06.760
Mayer wants to 60 seconds now. A moment of silence. Starting now.

35:29.240 --> 35:40.040
How long has it been? Not even 36 seconds. That was horrible. That was awkward.

35:40.040 --> 35:44.440
That was hard. Did we make an halfway? There's a lot of eye contact though.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.920
Oh, I was just sort of staring off in the space. Yeah.

35:46.920 --> 35:50.280
Oh, it's the last time you were one in a ward. In a ward? Yeah.

35:50.920 --> 36:01.240
I think in like fourth grade, I did an academic pentathlon. What's the pentathlon?

36:01.240 --> 36:07.400
Yeah. It's like math science. Yeah, you compete with the team of your peers

36:08.440 --> 36:13.160
in like a bunch of answer questions and a bunch of different genres. Maybe it was like fourth

36:13.240 --> 36:18.600
grade or something. I don't know. It was a long time ago. I. Yeah. I don't think we did that go.

36:18.600 --> 36:23.240
You went to UCSB. Yeah. Oh, I have a funny story about that though. I go. Okay.

36:23.240 --> 36:32.280
About the pentathlon. My family always reminds me that I was on stage and I had to answer a question

36:33.240 --> 36:39.320
and the question was like how can animals, something about how animals can sense

36:39.400 --> 36:48.280
like natural disasters or something? And it was multiple choice and I put ESP because I didn't

36:48.280 --> 36:55.400
know what ESP stood for. But basically, yeah, it was just that they can like read minds.

36:57.400 --> 37:03.400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What is it for my sake?

37:05.000 --> 37:08.840
I don't know what the acronym actually means. So I still could not answer the question.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.880
One of the choices was mind reading and you chose that. Yeah.

37:14.360 --> 37:21.080
Honestly, that's as good a guesses. I think here's something. You're sorry. Yeah.

37:22.360 --> 37:28.360
What was that? That's funny though. That's a good answer. What was the real answer? Like I still

37:28.360 --> 37:32.440
don't know how I have no idea actually. Now that I think about it, that's like not really a fourth grade

37:32.440 --> 37:34.920
level. Yeah, none of us know the answer.

37:39.400 --> 37:45.720
Alley. Yeah. Do you pray? No. Got it. I mean, what was the best birthday of your life?

37:45.720 --> 37:49.480
Just because you have the most to choose from? I guess when I turned 30, I did go to Vegas and

37:49.480 --> 37:52.840
I thought it was very fun. But my friends went. You thought it was very fun or are you

37:52.840 --> 37:59.400
experienced a lot of joy? Both. Okay. Did you have any of your friends about that trip? Nope.

37:59.400 --> 38:01.960
Did you leave anything in Vegas? Did it stay? Did I what?

38:02.680 --> 38:06.040
Because they said, what do they say, Erica? They like what happens in Vegas is always in Vegas?

38:06.120 --> 38:11.320
Stays in Vegas. Did anything stay in Vegas? Did you lose your wallet? His dignity. No.

38:11.320 --> 38:16.200
My dignity and my wallet lost a little bit of my dignity. But in my wallet was completely into. Yeah.

38:19.720 --> 38:22.360
And what put an end to your last relationship?

38:24.840 --> 38:31.640
For me. Or sticking with you. Well, I mean, that Vegas trip was probably the beginning of the end.

38:32.280 --> 38:38.520
In terms of having the relationship ball apart. But for what reasons? Is it that you were there with

38:38.520 --> 38:43.560
just your buddies? And you were like, oh my god. I think it was a case of like meeting somebody at age 25

38:43.560 --> 38:48.840
and then by the 30 year difference person. What's that? Actually, really wasn't done. I can

38:48.840 --> 38:55.080
clear your vision. The question was, is it that you were there without songs, her? No, she was there.

38:55.240 --> 39:03.240
Can I finish the question? Sure. Is it that you were there? Songs, her. And you realized, oh my god,

39:03.240 --> 39:10.360
like life is a, it feels a little lighter. She was there. I still do it. If it's an either or it's the

39:10.360 --> 39:16.200
other one. I really didn't finish. Yeah. Because you keep jumping my line. Okay. Is it that you were in Vegas?

39:16.200 --> 39:23.160
Songs, her. And you were kind of with your buddies and realizing that life felt a little bit better

39:23.240 --> 39:28.440
without her that you were more yourself and that you couldn't really be yourself around her. Sure. Yes.

39:29.080 --> 39:36.520
I've had some questions. Definitely the end. So what was the war? What actually happened?

39:38.360 --> 39:43.000
A case of drifting apart. Sure. Yeah. Because you were moving to Los Angeles. And she was staying

39:43.000 --> 39:49.720
in the air. Correct. And did you, yeah, did you take it well? Well, she, she obviously not. We broke

39:49.720 --> 39:53.480
up. Yeah, but there can be a mutual parting in ways where she also was thinking. Yeah. I mean,

39:53.480 --> 39:58.840
it wasn't an emiss, but it also wasn't like, you know, a happy go lucky time in my life. Yeah,

39:58.840 --> 40:04.280
Erica, do you pray? No, I'm Jewish. And then I mean, in terms of, was that the beginning of the

40:04.280 --> 40:09.640
end or the, that was the end? Well, Jewish people can pray. Are you right? But the way he asked it.

40:09.640 --> 40:15.240
Yeah, I made it seem like a, do you Christian? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So where is she now?

40:16.200 --> 40:24.520
I'm not sure. And this, this is not. No. Take a break. You're right back.

40:35.560 --> 40:40.040
Do we actually go to break every time you throw to break? Yeah. So like, there's a commercial there.

40:40.920 --> 40:46.200
God, not really an ad, most of the time. Yeah. Sometimes it's just a pause. Not selling very well.

40:46.200 --> 40:50.440
It's manifesting what I want to be true, which is that this show would have won four ads for episode.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.840
Sure. Yeah. Do you guys have any involvement in the, the selling of the head gym show?

40:54.840 --> 40:59.240
I don't think anyone sells it anymore. Yeah. Riding the co-tills of AG1. Yeah.

40:59.240 --> 41:03.400
My involvement is a schedule in it. Oh, interesting. So do you ever see like someone who wants

41:03.400 --> 41:08.520
to schedule an ad for this show? And you cancel it. You dive right into Hollywood handbook? No, I don't do.

41:09.480 --> 41:14.200
It's already like booked. And then I just do the ending for it. Yeah. You know?

41:14.760 --> 41:19.880
Ali, let me ask you this. What is something you truly like about yourself? Oh, wow. Yeah.

41:22.520 --> 41:28.280
Um, look at the sandwich behind you all. You asked these questions. So it's no sense. Fred. Yeah.

41:29.480 --> 41:36.680
I like, uh, I think, I think I am a good friend. I like that about myself. Yeah. It's good.

41:37.320 --> 41:50.840
And when was last time you cried? Oh, um, like yesterday. Why? I got, uh, yeah. I got stressed out.

41:51.560 --> 42:00.040
Um, I, I've been, I've been having, uh, insomnia, Alice knows not this. I, it's not funny. It's just the

42:00.840 --> 42:05.480
No, it's just the honesty. I've been having horrible insomnia. And for some reason,

42:05.480 --> 42:12.920
I have found that like, um, if I watch a sad movie and I cry and I have like an emotional release of

42:12.920 --> 42:20.200
crying, then I am able to sleep better. So it's been kind of a journey of like watching really sad

42:20.200 --> 42:26.120
stuff to try to go to sleep. And it's like a weird cycle that now I'm in. Yeah. That's still happening.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.680
Yeah. I'm like, I should tell me about this so long ago.

42:30.680 --> 42:35.000
I'm so sorry. Um, so can I just give one note to him here there? Because I was just, I was

42:35.000 --> 42:38.920
tired of living perfectly fine questions. No, the, the question was great. But before that,

42:38.920 --> 42:43.400
like, Ali and Alex were having a moment. They were like connecting even Eric was smiling. You

42:43.400 --> 42:48.760
looked like you just seen a animal die. So like have some empathy and just yeah, actually. Yeah.

42:48.760 --> 42:54.360
Oh, speaking of animal's dying. It's, yeah. It's like, like, band cheese of entrain, like

42:54.520 --> 43:01.080
spoiler, the donkey. Yeah. That I like had a hard time with that. You know, I'm so attached to

43:01.080 --> 43:07.400
chicken. It's like anything like that. I just, I lock onto it and then I cry and then I, you know,

43:07.400 --> 43:18.680
try to get a solid five. I try to get a solid, not enough sleep. I did wreck for you. What?

43:18.760 --> 43:26.440
The really depressing scene in Dumbo, where the mom is like singing to Dumbo. Yeah. And are you

43:26.440 --> 43:31.400
sure firecrower? Are you thinking, oh, gee, cartoon or you thinking that weird Tim Burton

43:31.400 --> 43:37.880
romantic. Oh, gee, cartoon. I didn't even say the remake. So I can't do that. It's really sad. Yeah.

43:37.880 --> 43:42.920
Eric, can I ask, when you do something positive or like helpful to others, do you prefer like

43:43.640 --> 43:51.240
private recognition or public praise? I'm a dancer. I might get me in trouble. No.

43:53.240 --> 44:00.200
Maybe it. No, I mean, like, depends. If you're like, I'm doing something for my family or

44:00.200 --> 44:06.520
close friends. Like, I don't need any public. But I mean, like, I don't know. Like, you being on this podcast,

44:06.520 --> 44:10.200
you want everyone at the company to send you an email being like good on. Yeah. Yeah. And

44:10.200 --> 44:17.640
am I coming from on you? I'm on all the recognition for being here. Speaking of recognition,

44:17.640 --> 44:24.920
where do you find inspiration? What are the questions from? I wrote down a bunch of interesting

44:24.920 --> 44:30.520
questions. Do you pray and where do you find inspiration? It's like the 40 questions you asked

44:30.520 --> 44:34.200
to fall in love with somebody or thing. No. Jeff, are you going to see are you there? God,

44:34.200 --> 44:39.640
it's me, Margaret. Well, you were saying, God, friend, did you? What? Did you ever accept

44:39.720 --> 44:47.080
last week? Yeah. I might see that. That special. Just speaking of praying and God.

44:48.120 --> 44:53.640
Jeff doesn't strike me as someone that goes to the theaters. Like, I can't see you there. Like,

44:53.640 --> 44:57.400
I can't see you at a movie theater. Does that true? Like, when was the last thing you actually,

44:57.400 --> 45:03.000
like, went to a movie theater, bought, like, a ticket and, like, eight popcorn while watching a film.

45:03.000 --> 45:07.160
It just does. That's true. I can't pick it up. Well, I just can't see it. What did you see?

45:07.160 --> 45:13.320
Yeah. Like, what movie could you possibly have enjoyed? What was it? Evil dead rise? Did you like it?

45:13.320 --> 45:20.200
Like, I can't imagine you liking a movie. Why? So, okay. Name two things you could imagine.

45:20.200 --> 45:23.720
Because you said I can't be making it. You said I can't be in a movie theater and joy right.

45:23.720 --> 45:27.880
Why are things that you think I do? I could imagine you at a bowling alley alone.

45:30.680 --> 45:34.600
Like, Highland. Under my breath. Something to us. Yeah. And you just see him and he has his own

45:34.600 --> 45:37.880
lane and you're just kind of like, okay. Yeah. Like, more people in terms of, like,

45:37.880 --> 45:42.760
quarantine really good or is he bad? Yeah. I think, I think he's practiced that.

45:42.760 --> 45:47.080
Oh, my God. If I do get invited to a movie. He's getting there. He's bad, but he's like,

45:47.080 --> 45:49.320
trying to learn how to do the spin. No!

45:54.840 --> 45:59.160
Yeah, you guys, center me in this narrative that fits your guys' asses,

45:59.160 --> 46:02.280
just because you guys are anxious to sit next to each other. Because you guys all don't know

46:02.280 --> 46:06.040
a very, each other very well, right? So, you have to like gang up on me because you're facing

46:06.040 --> 46:09.720
towards me because that's the only thing that you guys can like, oh, like, you know, when

46:09.720 --> 46:13.720
Republicans are never crashing, come together when there's a war, right? It's not like I'm saying

46:13.720 --> 46:21.160
you're a gutter's up guy. Oh, that's funny. Yeah, it's a real.

46:27.320 --> 46:31.480
This would be perfect if I had a rice. Oh, I just got straight into it.

46:31.800 --> 46:38.120
I love the rice, son. Um, here we go. That was actually the end of my question.

46:39.960 --> 46:46.200
About the man. Um, I have therapy in three minutes. It seems like good timing.

46:47.800 --> 46:51.160
Oh, wow. Do you want to start now? I might do in the studio, my record.

46:52.600 --> 46:56.200
We should live stream it. I think we should, yeah, it should be batch recording. We can do it at

46:56.200 --> 47:00.600
another episode. It's me and Lily and how to dream about her last night, too. Oh,

47:01.720 --> 47:06.040
like a sexy dreamer, just a regular life. This is the first time anyone's ever asked me

47:06.040 --> 47:12.920
questions, so I don't want to. Well, yeah, let's finish out with that. I'll clean therapy.

47:13.320 --> 47:20.520
I went last night. Yeah. I also cried last night. Oh, yeah. Because why? It's therapy, you know?

47:20.520 --> 47:24.680
You're supposed to cry. Real therapeutic. Is therapeutic to cry? I'll give it a shot.

47:24.920 --> 47:31.240
Uh, ercopy got therapy or no therapy. I did not go to therapy. Allie? I don't, but someone told me.

47:31.240 --> 47:35.640
I should ask her back. I used to, but I don't anymore. Because you were fixed.

47:35.640 --> 47:41.160
Uh, no, because the pandemic sort of ended our in-person sessions, and then it was a natural

47:41.160 --> 47:48.120
dissolution of the relationship. Do you feel better? No, not really. Maybe she'll go back. I should.

47:48.360 --> 47:52.360

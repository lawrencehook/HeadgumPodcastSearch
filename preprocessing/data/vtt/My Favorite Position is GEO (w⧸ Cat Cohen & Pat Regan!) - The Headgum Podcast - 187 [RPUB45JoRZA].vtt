WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Wow, right?

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
I didn't do it.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
That's what we were writing down.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
I make this look quieter.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
I'm here to do that for you.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Christmas came early this year.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Another guest on the show, new show to the network.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
We're not new show to people's ears, right?

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Hopefully not.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
I hope it's not.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
I said hopefully not.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
So, but hopefully because then the numbers go up.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
You gain new listeners.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Yeah.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
You add packages.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Suddenly you're wearing a Rolex.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Totally.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Freaking gay, dude.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
I've had a lot of time at it.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
I said, let's go, dude.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
What's that?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
What's that?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
What's that?

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
Jeffrey has a sound board of people saying what he's already saying.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
So it's a little confusing.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Oh, and if you don't really know his voice either.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Yeah.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
So you hear whatever that.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
And it could be Jeff saying it or it could be somebody else saying what's that.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Exactly.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
You had a recording handy of someone else saying what's that?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
What's that?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Who's that?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
That's Casey, who's a producer of Flash podcast host here too.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
It's kind of like it's a good thing.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
We're throwing you into the movie.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
I want to be on the board.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
I want to be on the board.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Wow.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
That might be the sound.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
That might be on the board.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Yeah.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Well, chairman of the sound board.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
All right.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Just one second.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
All right.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Just one second because I actually want to dive into the deal.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Right?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Because you guys are new to the network.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
But in an existing show with a kind of big fan base.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Totally massive.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
We have 30 fans.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
We have 30 listeners.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
We have a community.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
We have a community.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Yeah.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Super community.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
We call themselves the 30.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
I'll make the 300 but last.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah, but less than that.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
But more muscular and sharper.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Also, if you have 30 fans that truly buy every product that I've

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
ever done.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
I tell you more people using the coupon code than on any other show.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Can I tell you a toxic relation?

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
A toxic conversation.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
I had one time in Miami Florida.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Go on.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm at a gay event in Miami Florida for a new year.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
It's almost exactly a year ago.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Yeah.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
A gay person I had never met was kind of nagging me or near constantly.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
And he said at some point.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
He was talking.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Oh, well, first he like just your towards my friends and was like,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
It's great that they like you go on their podcast.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
I mean, I think you've been just being like.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
A viable podcast guest is probably really helpful for your touring.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
And I was like, well, I have my own podcast.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
He was like, I didn't know that.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
And I was like, I do.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
And he was like, yeah, well, I'm sure that's helpful.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
I mean, it starts with porn.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
You know, if you have a thousand people who are going to pay five dollars

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
a month to watch you have sex, like, that's a good living.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
And I was like, I don't do porn.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
But yeah, and he was just super, you only have a thousand of stars.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm really traumatized by the phrase viable podcast guest.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
I know.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Like, congratulations.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
You're a viable podcast.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
And you could imagine who he was just touring towards.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
I can't imagine exactly.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
You could use your imagination.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Oh, my imagination's a big thing.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
And let's go first and last.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
And this is just, check it.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Let's go first and last name of who you're talking.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
I was like, keep bringing free.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Keep bringing free.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Keep bringing free.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Keep bringing free.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Could be my catchphrase.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
So are you going to spend the whole hour just trying to make you porn?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Yep.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
And that's as good too.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
I actually like viable podcast guest is my Twitter bio.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
And then I will say, I think, a party we're in Miami and Rojas is of

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Miami.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
It's like the moment, right now.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
So we kept doing this bit to each other where we were.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Every time someone went to the bathroom and they came back,

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
people would be like, Oh, my god,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.600
you just misluck, uh, Larissa and Marissa over here.

03:38.600 --> 03:39.960
Who are two of that, how fast?

03:39.960 --> 03:41.400
And like, since we kept doing it,

03:41.400 --> 03:42.960
like, you should know like they're pranking you,

03:42.960 --> 03:45.000
but when it happens to you each time,

03:45.000 --> 03:46.360
like, oh my god, where are they?

03:46.360 --> 03:49.000
And so, that me wanted to do this gay party.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.320
It's Luria gay neon party of gay people wearing neon.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.640
And then I'm walking and I'm Luria thinking I'm like,

03:54.640 --> 03:56.040
seeing an oasis in a desert,

03:56.040 --> 03:59.240
because I see Jill Zaryn's daughter, Ali Shapiro

03:59.240 --> 04:00.080
from your house as a child.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.280
She had a really seasoned.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.280
And I'm like, what, like, why is she here?

04:03.280 --> 04:05.960
And I tried to talk to her and she's visibly disgusted by me.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.360
And her boyfriend's like,

04:08.360 --> 04:09.640
she loves it. She's really overwhelmed.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.960
I was like, Ali, I'm a huge fan.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.160
She cares?

04:12.160 --> 04:13.000
What?

04:13.000 --> 04:13.840
She cares about you?

04:13.840 --> 04:14.840
No, she didn't care about me.

04:14.840 --> 04:15.840
I care about her.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.440
And I wanted to interact with her as someone.

04:17.440 --> 04:18.440
I didn't care.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.440
She loves the attention.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.440
She loves the attention.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.440
She loves the attention.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.840
She loves the gay community.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.800
She loves you as a gay man, you know, who she is.

04:24.800 --> 04:25.760
I was like, okay, cool.

04:25.760 --> 04:26.960
So then now I'm in a position.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.200
I'm alone in the party.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.680
I see Ali Zaryn at this gay neon event.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.880
Now I have to go to my friends after you've been pranking.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.240
You're all day saying we saw Larissa Pippin.

04:35.240 --> 04:38.800
And I have to say, Ali Shapiro Zaryn is here.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.480
And I can ask them to believe me.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.480
So that was my class.

04:41.480 --> 04:42.880
I was truly boy who cried well.

04:42.880 --> 04:43.680
Yeah.

04:43.680 --> 04:44.720
Boy who cried Ali.

04:44.720 --> 04:45.880
Ali Ali.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.320
Ali Shapiro Zaryn is here.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.760
Larissa Pippin.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.800
Yeah, famous in the sports world now.

04:50.800 --> 04:51.320
Sure.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.560
She's a Michael Jordan son.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.440
Scottie Pippin's ex wife is dating Michael Jordan's son.

04:55.440 --> 04:58.080
Yeah, she's had an incredible journey on her son.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.920
Yes, they're engaged.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.520
They're like, he's like three years.

05:01.520 --> 05:02.840
They'd be married, really not.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.640
Do you know her housewife's journey?

05:04.640 --> 05:07.840
I don't know anything about her beyond that she's Scottie Pippin's ex wife.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.680
And going to marry Michael Jordan's son.

05:09.680 --> 05:10.680
Yeah.

05:10.680 --> 05:14.960
So when she was on, so Larissa Pippin from your 2010 to dismal numbers.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.120
And she was in the original cast.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.600
And then she was still married to Scottie.

05:19.600 --> 05:23.240
And then Larissa is a man who was canceled after three seasons.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.160
She kind of disappeared from the zeitgeist.

05:25.160 --> 05:28.320
And then it came back in 2022 or something.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.760
Larissa Pippin returned.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.120
And she had been in a word, yassified.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.120
Yeah.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.120
And then I looked completely different.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.120
Yeah.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.120
The biggest ask anyone's ever seen in her life.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.680
Did you get any or fake real out?

05:40.680 --> 05:43.480
Well, so it's been the source of controversy.

05:43.480 --> 05:47.520
A lot of the, a lot of the housewife's family, Arletina.

05:47.520 --> 05:50.880
And so when she came back, she had this amazing ask.

05:50.880 --> 05:54.320
She spent a lot of time with the Kardashians in the Kardashian compound.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.120
And so everyone's like, you're going to their doctors.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.120
And she's like, it's real.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.120
It's from working out.

05:58.120 --> 06:03.080
And then this woman, Adriana, accused her of having a Brazilian butt left.

06:03.080 --> 06:05.600
And she said that that was actually appropriate because she is Brazilian.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.880
And so that she should be the one who has a Brazilian butt left.

06:07.880 --> 06:08.880
Right.

06:08.880 --> 06:09.880
Yeah.

06:09.880 --> 06:13.520
I think now that I was spending a couple of days in LA, I want to return to New York,

06:13.520 --> 06:14.520
yassified.

06:14.520 --> 06:15.520
Yeah.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.040
How do you do that so quickly?

06:17.040 --> 06:18.680
You've got to go to the Kardashian compound.

06:18.680 --> 06:19.840
I need to go have surgery.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.680
Well, then Larissa Pippin posted on Instagram.

06:21.680 --> 06:22.520
Like, this is my butt workout.

06:22.520 --> 06:23.680
So I obviously started doing it.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.280
And then I like said at work, I was like,

06:25.280 --> 06:27.000
I'm doing Larissa Pippin's butt workout every last time.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.320
And they were like, it's fake.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.320
And I'm just so naive.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.600
Like, if you tell me your butts, we all like, I'll believe you.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.920
How's your butt?

06:32.920 --> 06:35.280
My butts actually getting so good.

06:35.280 --> 06:36.280
Really?

06:36.280 --> 06:37.280
Yeah.

06:37.280 --> 06:39.160
Well, I go to Ferris down the road.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.920
And like, but then I go on.

06:40.920 --> 06:45.920
So it's Ferris has their classes like Mondays Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays

06:45.920 --> 06:47.200
for my build-up program.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.800
And then, and so Mondays were squats.

06:50.800 --> 06:51.800
And but Thursdays were deadlift.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.560
So there's like two, like, ass days kind of built in.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.160
But then on Saturdays, I go.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.600
And I just do my own thing.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.560
And I really just do chest and ass.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.560
Not just me.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.680
You know, not even my chest and ass.

07:03.680 --> 07:07.120
And my ass and ass muscles are like trusted chies and for gay guys.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.680
It's chest and chest and ass.

07:08.680 --> 07:09.680
Yeah.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.680
But it's like getting there.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.400
I took some amazing images in my hotel room like two days ago.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.440
It was part of my personal brand for a minute.

07:15.440 --> 07:16.440
It's Ferris.

07:16.440 --> 07:17.440
Not Ferris.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.440
Uh, asses.

07:18.440 --> 07:19.280
Ass.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.760
Really, I've never had a good ass in my life and I'm just getting it.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.680
I posted my ass on Mayan.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.600
Really, I'm getting to a place where like, I want to do that.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.120
But like, I want to be taken seriously as an intellectual.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.360
But like, that's not what happened.

07:32.360 --> 07:36.120
And then you're what having a, um, having a bad ass and then building a good

07:36.120 --> 07:38.440
ass is like being a bad ass and being a bad ass and being a bad ass.

07:38.440 --> 07:39.480
Fucking go.

07:39.480 --> 07:40.640
Is that you?

07:40.640 --> 07:43.120
They want to return to everyone you've ever had sex with and say, like, look at

07:43.120 --> 07:44.920
me now 100% you don't name me.

07:44.920 --> 07:45.520
I'm worse.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.120
I like worse than I do.

07:47.120 --> 07:51.040
I just want those who rejected me in the past to see my current out.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.360
You're taking on a revenge body.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.000
I'm talking about a revenge specifically.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.800
Guys, you're back to the Kardashian compound.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.560
You're giving revenge, boy.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.560
Yeah.

07:59.560 --> 08:00.560
I'm here.

08:00.560 --> 08:01.760
Have you ever had a revenge body?

08:01.760 --> 08:02.760
No.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.320
I've never had anybody, unfortunately.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.400
I used to go to the gym.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.440
Was that to transition or worse?

08:11.440 --> 08:14.880
It did that thing where it's like kill the page and so I had to kill the page and

08:14.880 --> 08:19.800
then refresh and then when I refreshed it automatically press the button that I got it.

08:19.800 --> 08:20.800
And that was unrelated.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.400
But also I'm not that interested in what you have to say.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.400
Okay.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.400
I am.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.320
Well, I was just saying I used to go to the gym to lift weights and stuff before

08:27.320 --> 08:28.320
the pandemic.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.320
Pandemic happens.

08:29.320 --> 08:30.320
I don't go anymore.

08:30.320 --> 08:35.120
And I find it hard to get the energy and desire to lift weights because it's

08:35.120 --> 08:36.120
not as fun.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.960
And I'm like, yeah, tennis and basketball, like stuff that gets you running, but, like,

08:38.960 --> 08:39.960
by accident.

08:39.960 --> 08:40.960
Can you play the sport?

08:40.960 --> 08:41.960
Can I ask you two questions?

08:41.960 --> 08:42.960
Sure.

08:42.960 --> 08:43.960
One is, are you single or partner?

08:43.960 --> 08:45.400
I just got married last month.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.400
Okay.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.400
Congratulations.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.400
Thank you.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.400
Congratulations.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.400
How do you mean?

08:50.400 --> 08:51.400
We met through a dating app.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.400
Okay.

08:53.400 --> 08:57.400
And then secondly, so being partner makes it hard, I think, to get motivation to

08:57.400 --> 08:58.400
go to the gym.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.400
Because you don't need to have a revenge body anymore.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.400
Yeah.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.400
Like you don't need to be peacocking and you don't need.

09:04.400 --> 09:05.400
Yeah.

09:05.400 --> 09:10.400
I think that the two ways to feel motivated to get the gym is either to be single

09:10.400 --> 09:16.400
and like, sad about it or to be gay, but like partner to someone who's hotter than

09:16.400 --> 09:17.400
you.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.400
And then that's why I don't go to the gym.

09:20.400 --> 09:23.400
And then my second question.

09:23.400 --> 09:29.400
Oh, my second thing is, oh, what's fun about Ferros is that it's like,

09:29.400 --> 09:36.400
I'm a big runner and I get very motivated by like numbers and like, well, you know, four weeks ago,

09:36.400 --> 09:39.400
I did the same workout and these were my milestones.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.400
So like, what can I do in eight weeks or something like that?

09:42.400 --> 09:43.400
Yeah.

09:43.400 --> 09:48.400
And so I think for me, just lifting it's hard to get motivated, but if I really keep track of what I'm doing,

09:48.400 --> 09:49.400
I'm going to be motivated.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.400
Athletically that's why it was a real program.

09:51.400 --> 09:55.400
When I hear the word, Ferros, now like the way you brought it into my life.

09:55.400 --> 09:59.400
I like the laser over and like my body, my body, my body.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.400
It's a great name.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.400
Ferros for a gym.

10:02.400 --> 10:03.400
Yeah.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.400
It's unlike any other gym name.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.400
Yeah.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.400
So long.

10:12.400 --> 10:13.400
I was really long.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.400
Sorry about that.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.400
A bond of the week.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.400
What's that?

10:16.400 --> 10:18.400
The second one we've done that everybody hates.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.400
From the moment that Daniel Craig was out as bond,

10:21.400 --> 10:23.400
we've been every week loving.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.400
I think I know about that.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.400
You're crazy.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.400
What is that?

10:26.400 --> 10:28.400
Daniel Craig was double us.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.400
Okay.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.400
I think he's so hot.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.400
He's not.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.400
He's not.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.400
He's not.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.400
He's not my type.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.400
We have really different type.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.400
And every now that we've been overlapped.

10:37.400 --> 10:40.400
But Daniel Craig is like, very my type and very not your type.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.400
It's just like eagle.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.400
What?

10:42.400 --> 10:43.400
Pretty eagle.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.400
What's eagle?

10:44.400 --> 10:45.400
It's like the eagle handsome.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.400
There's the bear handsome.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.400
There's like like Instagram presents you with those.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.400
Infographics about what kind of power.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.400
Is that for the gay community?

10:52.400 --> 10:53.400
I think it's just not.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.400
Is this for men who are by supplements?

10:55.400 --> 10:58.400
Probo by not be a who buy supplement.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.400
Yeah.

10:59.400 --> 11:00.400
Yeah.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.400
By sexual supplement.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.400
Yeah.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.400
There's supplementary.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.400
Sublimentally.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.400
Sublimentally.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.400
I'm so sorry.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.400
Sorry.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.400
We just did a pod.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.400
Sublimentally.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.400
At work.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.400
My new drag name.

11:12.400 --> 11:17.400
I guess he's an eagle.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.400
I can't remember the infographic.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.400
He's just muscular and like has broad shoulders.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.400
So every week since he's been out as bond.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.400
We've been lobbying up our casting decisions for the next double low.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.400
Okay.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.400
This week my pick is Jane Fonda because she's been the James Bonda.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.400
Oh, that's great.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.400
I would say Sarah Mitchell Geller.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.400
That's really good.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.400
Do you say or Jim I'm a Kirk?

11:39.400 --> 11:43.400
Do you say James Bonda or James Bonda?

11:43.400 --> 11:46.400
We do have to take a break.

11:46.400 --> 11:51.400
This show is sponsored by Better Hope.

11:51.400 --> 11:56.400
You know, guys, there's a few things about myself that I love to keep the same.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.400
In 2024, I want to keep the same energy.

11:59.400 --> 12:02.400
You know, keep that same energy.

12:02.400 --> 12:07.400
Uh,

12:08.400 --> 12:09.400
of the podcast.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.400
I'm not going to let up.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.400
I'm not going to go easy on anyone.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.400
I'm not going to go easy on a mirror.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.400
I'm not going to let Casey keep getting away with his brothers.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.400
I'm not going to let Marie could take the reins anymore or less than she should.

12:20.400 --> 12:24.400
It will be exactly how much and how often I want her to take the reins.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.400
Does that make sense?

12:25.400 --> 12:31.400
Uh, but you know, people often want to reorganize their life around the new year.

12:31.400 --> 12:35.400
Uh, people get obsessed with how to change themselves.

12:35.400 --> 12:39.400
Instead of just expanding on what they're already doing right, right?

12:39.400 --> 12:41.400
And I'm doing a lot of things right with the show.

12:41.400 --> 12:46.400
I have to say maybe, you know, somebody has finally organized one part of their space,

12:46.400 --> 12:51.400
but they want to tackle another or maybe they're taking their supplements every morning.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.400
And now they just want to actually eat breakfast too.

12:54.400 --> 13:00.400
Well, therapy can help you find your strengths so that you can ditch the extreme resolutions for the new year

13:00.400 --> 13:02.400
and make changes that really stick.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.400
I'm in therapy twice a week, actually.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.400
And, uh, it's beneficial.

13:07.400 --> 13:10.400
I have to say that, uh, you know, it's a grounding force.

13:10.400 --> 13:16.400
And what is otherwise, uh, chaotic, teeter-tottery wavelength that I'm constantly on.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.400
She's the only one that gives me going.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.400
Uh, so I couldn't recommend it enough.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.400

Hey.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.400
It's so loud.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.400
Sorry about that.

14:59.400 --> 15:03.400
Do you guys have any James Bond of the week or James Bond of the week?

15:03.400 --> 15:04.400
So it is you did say James.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.400
Who is that actress who brought up yesterday?

15:07.400 --> 15:12.400
Well, when someone asked you about someone on Ryan Reynolds's tier.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.400
Oh, Quitting Hogg.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.400
And he's a great guy.

15:14.400 --> 15:20.400
I was in a game or I was in a book meeting for a short-term gig where I

15:20.400 --> 15:24.400
found myself sitting on a zoom being asked by a straight man.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.400
Are there any celebrities we're not thinking of to which I had to reply?

15:27.400 --> 15:31.400
No, are there any a-listers we're not thinking of like Ryan Reynolds's level?

15:31.400 --> 15:34.400
And I had to say, do you mean just name celebrities?

15:34.400 --> 15:36.400
And he said, yeah.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.400
And so I paused for five seconds and said,

15:38.400 --> 15:39.400
Courtney Cox.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
Yeah.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.400
Yeah.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.400
Yeah.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.400
Yeah.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.400
I hear Ryan Reynolds, I think.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.400
Courtney Cox.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.400
No.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.400
No.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.400
Amir, about the week?

15:50.400 --> 15:55.400
Not a person, but just a name that I happen to like is Alison Felix.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.400
Oh, sure.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.400
Yeah.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.400
Was that a person or was that just in there?

15:58.400 --> 15:59.400
Just a cool name.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.400
It also is a person.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.400
Is it?

16:02.400 --> 16:04.400
She's like a many, many time Olympic champion.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.400
That would be a few.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.400
Let's be that team.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.400
Yeah.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.400
She's the most famous being probably.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.400
Are you always like this?

16:14.400 --> 16:15.400
Yep.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.400
She's probably the most famous.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.400
Yeah.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.400
Yeah.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.400
I'm so sorry.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.400
I'm going to HSP.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.400
How do you sense it?

16:21.400 --> 16:22.400
Yeah.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.400
So you don't want to hear giant metal being dropped in the ears?

16:25.400 --> 16:26.400
Yeah.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.400
I don't do like one off or like maybe keep it down here.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.400
I think one of the kind of singers go to like,

16:31.400 --> 16:32.400
Yeah.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.400
Yeah.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.400
I'm also that.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.400
I'm also the HSP.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.400
Whatever.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.400
Alison, if you'd like.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.400
It's must have been in my head from like an Olympian.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.400
Yeah.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.400
She was.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.400
She's huge in the news.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.400
In the last twenty-one.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.400
Yeah.

16:44.400 --> 16:47.400
That would be because Spentor's choirs were shorter and obviously it's like 16 years,

16:47.400 --> 16:52.400
17 because of COVID and she went pro as like a 17 year old as a 100 meter runner,

16:52.400 --> 16:55.400
and then she's been to every Olympic since I guess Beijing.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.400
Maybe Athens event.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.400
Okay.

16:57.400 --> 16:58.400
Let me think of a new name then.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.400
I'll say just creating one off the top on the fly.

17:02.400 --> 17:06.400
Not really a real person, but Jackie Joyner cursey for her.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.400
Yeah.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.400
Jackie Joyner Lucas.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.400
Who?

17:10.400 --> 17:11.400
Forget it.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.400
Okay.

17:12.400 --> 17:16.100
This brings us to our first segment, which is worse.

17:16.100 --> 17:18.460
So I'm going to present you guys with two things,

17:18.460 --> 17:23.460
both that are either really bad or really neutral or good.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.940
You have to say which of the two is worse.

17:25.940 --> 17:30.460
So number one is charity for a cause that doesn't matter,

17:30.460 --> 17:36.460
or chastity for a cause that does, which is worse.

17:36.460 --> 17:38.820
Chastity for a cause that does, right?

17:38.820 --> 17:40.020
Because that doesn't help the cherries.

17:40.020 --> 17:43.780
I think that charity is so, for a cause,

17:43.780 --> 17:45.220
it doesn't matter, is so funny.

17:45.220 --> 17:48.480
Like, I think of not that this doesn't matter,

17:48.480 --> 17:50.300
but it's, it's, it ruck in, it's,

17:50.300 --> 17:53.300
I'm horking this back to homeless,

17:53.300 --> 17:54.900
not toothless from real house,

17:54.900 --> 17:55.800
I was a Beverly Hills.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.100
Yeah.

17:57.100 --> 18:02.780
Which is where they give unhoused people like Vineyards.

18:02.780 --> 18:04.180
Vineyards.

18:04.180 --> 18:05.520
That's awesome.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.740
Have you guys ever donated to a charity

18:07.740 --> 18:09.060
that you thought mannerly.

18:09.060 --> 18:11.740
Oh, wait, sorry for being finished all the same.

18:11.740 --> 18:12.580
Forget it.

18:12.580 --> 18:16.580
Number two is Madison Square Garden's carbon footprint

18:16.580 --> 18:20.620
or monosodium glutamate's character assassination.

18:21.860 --> 18:26.220
So, you know, how much power does MSG take

18:26.220 --> 18:27.340
and how does that affect the environment?

18:27.340 --> 18:29.780
And then also the fact that MSG was sort of bastardized.

18:29.780 --> 18:31.340
Yeah, against his.

18:31.340 --> 18:33.900
I think, well, I feel like I answered the last one.

18:33.900 --> 18:34.740
I don't know.

18:34.740 --> 18:35.740
I think the latter.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.020
That's really tough.

18:37.980 --> 18:40.540
I think the latter, because I don't like when there's,

18:40.540 --> 18:44.380
like, I feel like in the nutrition community,

18:44.380 --> 18:46.740
there's always like, like,

18:48.900 --> 18:52.260
fatty, like, fatty, like things that are said

18:52.260 --> 18:53.420
where it's like, sugar's so bad.

18:53.420 --> 18:54.700
And then like five years there's like,

18:54.700 --> 18:55.460
actually it's really good.

18:55.460 --> 18:56.700
And then it's like fat so good for you.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.340
Actually it's so bad for you, actually whatever.

18:58.340 --> 19:03.340
And it's like, actually stop trying to like over simplify it.

19:03.340 --> 19:04.180
Yeah, I agree.

19:04.180 --> 19:05.620
And also Madison Square Garden,

19:05.620 --> 19:06.780
you might be leaving a carbon footprint,

19:06.780 --> 19:08.540
but it's like bringing the fun.

19:08.540 --> 19:09.380
Exactly right.

19:09.380 --> 19:10.220
Oh, yeah.

19:10.220 --> 19:12.020
Like when I famously saw Louis C.K.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.860
live in Madison Square Garden,

19:13.860 --> 19:15.060
it was as much as it was.

19:15.060 --> 19:15.660
Very nice.

19:15.660 --> 19:17.700
When I say this last week, last week, yeah.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.300
I was in my straight friends wedding party.

19:20.300 --> 19:22.060
And like, why do you specify straight?

19:22.060 --> 19:24.340
Like, I feel attacked almost because you said that.

19:24.340 --> 19:26.140
And then it's like straight into the Louis C.K.

19:26.140 --> 19:30.380
Well, it's Germany because it's not your favorite.

19:30.380 --> 19:32.980
Because because of the straight wedding,

19:32.980 --> 19:35.180
all the other groomsman were straight.

19:35.180 --> 19:38.820
And so they were giving like, they were giving like,

19:38.820 --> 19:40.500
thank you, whatever experiences.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.220
So they brought all the other ones to a hockey game.

19:43.220 --> 19:44.780
And then I think because I was gay,

19:44.780 --> 19:46.220
they were like, let's do something in the arts.

19:46.220 --> 19:47.700
And so they did a few of them.

19:47.700 --> 19:49.660
So that I had this at two hours of Louis C.K.

19:49.660 --> 19:53.460
Like waxing poetic about like women's reproductive life.

19:53.460 --> 19:53.980
Yeah.

19:53.980 --> 19:55.780
Would your other have seen hockey again?

19:55.780 --> 19:56.620
I don't know.

19:56.620 --> 19:57.140
Yeah.

19:57.140 --> 19:57.980
I don't know.

19:57.980 --> 19:58.580
I would have rather probably see,

19:58.580 --> 20:00.620
I was like 20s, 40s sober.

20:00.620 --> 20:02.540
And I was like, can you just just let me out?

20:02.540 --> 20:06.900
Oh, I'm like 40 for this.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.340
All right, number three.

20:09.340 --> 20:12.700
Which is worse, two people with the same name dating each other,

20:12.700 --> 20:14.100
but they are compatible.

20:14.100 --> 20:15.940
Are they same sex?

20:15.940 --> 20:16.740
It doesn't matter.

20:16.740 --> 20:17.420
Unspecified.

20:17.420 --> 20:18.260
It's not always about that.

20:18.260 --> 20:21.560
I know, but it actually, to me, that it's actually your main.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.580
Let's say, again, you're from God.

20:23.580 --> 20:24.660
Let's say it.

20:24.660 --> 20:25.660
Same thing.

20:25.660 --> 20:27.340
Okay, same sex couple dating same name.

20:27.340 --> 20:27.980
Yep.

20:27.980 --> 20:31.140
Or which is worse, two people with different names,

20:31.140 --> 20:34.500
not dating each other, but they are compatible.

20:34.500 --> 20:37.380
What's worse? Probably the same name dating.

20:37.380 --> 20:39.700
Really? Yeah, because the second thing is nothing.

20:39.700 --> 20:43.300
I don't know why I'm like, I like can't, I'm not processing a single word you're saying.

20:43.300 --> 20:44.180
I don't know why.

20:44.180 --> 20:46.100
Everything you say, I'm like, what does that even mean?

20:46.100 --> 20:47.540
I'm like, I don't know why.

20:47.540 --> 20:54.020
I'm sleeping private. I'm like, dude, I think Jeff is like the cotton candy of men.

20:54.020 --> 20:57.140
So like he says stuff and then it just disappears before we just...

20:57.140 --> 21:00.500
Oh, no. Do you see all of you this boo?

21:00.500 --> 21:02.100
I said, ooh.

21:02.100 --> 21:04.100
That sounds yummy.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.500
Well, I think that's the sugar part.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.900
So it's not just cotton.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.980
Yeah. Cotton swab.

21:10.980 --> 21:13.220
I think that's all we can rob.

21:13.220 --> 21:17.460
The first one's worse, but if they were, I think it's really cool when there's like a

21:17.460 --> 21:20.180
tele-locked situation where like he's dating a tele-locker.

21:20.180 --> 21:22.500
Yeah. And that's really cool and good.

21:22.500 --> 21:26.660
But when two gays the same name day, I think that's actually like harmful.

21:27.700 --> 21:30.500
That's never happened to you, we were a lost one.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.500
I think that's why my brain isn't processing it.

21:34.500 --> 21:35.620
Oh my god.

21:35.620 --> 21:36.420
Number four.

21:36.420 --> 21:41.780
Which is being an acoma, but during a period of time that was worth missing,

21:41.780 --> 21:45.860
or two, having a barbecue, but on a really, really hot day.

21:46.900 --> 21:47.860
What's worse?

21:47.860 --> 21:48.260
Yeah.

21:48.260 --> 21:49.060
The second one.

21:49.060 --> 21:50.100
Oh, 100%.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.460
Oh, no, I think we're giving a barbecue.

21:51.460 --> 21:52.900
I think I never got a hot day.

21:52.900 --> 21:55.300
I said that thing happens lovely.

21:55.780 --> 21:56.500
Number five.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.700
I would love to be an acoma.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.060
I know you would.

21:59.060 --> 22:01.060
Medical induced.

22:01.060 --> 22:03.140
I would take a medically induced.

22:03.140 --> 22:06.500
So I'm prescribed me a coma for what?

22:06.500 --> 22:09.380
I think I just need to like skip a chunk of life right now.

22:09.380 --> 22:09.940
Right.

22:09.940 --> 22:10.980
Currently?

22:10.980 --> 22:11.700
Yeah.

22:11.700 --> 22:12.740
I like to get a coma.

22:12.740 --> 22:13.940
Like, you're doing amazing.

22:13.940 --> 22:16.180
I know, but I think that's a lie.

22:18.180 --> 22:21.300
But don't you think if I could skip the next month, I would be even better.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.980
I don't know because I think you'd wake up from a coma.

22:23.140 --> 22:24.580
Starting where you are now.

22:24.580 --> 22:26.740
When you go to a coma, do you process a cliff?

22:36.420 --> 22:37.140
Which is worse.

22:37.140 --> 22:38.900
We're wearing a bandana as a shirt,

22:38.900 --> 22:44.900
but it's too big to be sexy or wearing footed pajamas to an okay

22:44.900 --> 22:45.700
darty.

22:45.700 --> 22:46.580
It's a darty.

22:46.580 --> 22:48.340
Everything about footed pajamas is bad.

22:48.340 --> 22:49.380
And we got darty.

22:49.380 --> 22:50.340
But it's a darty.

22:50.340 --> 22:51.380
It's a day party.

22:51.460 --> 22:53.460
Oh, yeah, that's gotta be worse.

22:53.460 --> 22:54.100
That's not it.

22:54.100 --> 22:54.260
Yeah.

22:54.260 --> 22:58.340
But there's nothing better than a fucking snatched girl.

22:58.340 --> 22:58.500
Yeah.

22:58.500 --> 23:00.180
So I've always heard where's her um,

23:01.300 --> 23:03.860
where's her like tribal buff as her like tube top?

23:03.860 --> 23:04.020
Yeah.

23:04.020 --> 23:05.700
There's nothing I'll ever beat that for me.

23:05.700 --> 23:06.340
Yeah.

23:06.340 --> 23:07.300
I wish.

23:08.340 --> 23:11.380
I just wish that my body type allowed to like have a backlash.

23:11.380 --> 23:12.980
But yeah, it's okay.

23:12.980 --> 23:14.180
Like in my next life.

23:14.180 --> 23:16.180
Or if I go to the compound and get,

23:16.180 --> 23:18.180
if I go to get some surgery, I can make that happen.

23:18.180 --> 23:20.180
Let's, you and I will cool skip that.

23:20.260 --> 23:21.780
Yeah, I was the beginning of a beautiful flat.

23:21.780 --> 23:22.900
I don't want that to happen to me.

23:22.900 --> 23:23.620
You know, carpool.

23:23.620 --> 23:25.780
I don't, we're beautiful, we're cool.

23:25.780 --> 23:28.180
Cool, it's cool, it's so scary to me because it's like uh,

23:28.180 --> 23:28.980
Linda, evangelizing.

23:28.980 --> 23:30.180
Yeah, and a lot of people have like these side hurts

23:30.180 --> 23:31.140
where they get all lumpy.

23:31.140 --> 23:32.500
And no offense, that's beautiful too.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.500
Well, I also said that about the Panera charge

23:34.500 --> 23:35.540
lemonade, not on my foot.

23:35.540 --> 23:36.820
I want that so much.

23:37.780 --> 23:41.220
I cannot be going on here.

23:41.220 --> 23:42.900
Tell you what happened to you.

23:42.900 --> 23:46.100
I want to, I want the caffeine lemonade from Panera that killed someone.

23:46.100 --> 23:48.100
Exactly, but more than one, more than one.

23:48.100 --> 23:49.620
No, I think two people.

23:49.620 --> 23:50.100
Okay.

23:50.100 --> 23:51.060
Oh my god.

23:51.060 --> 23:53.060
All right, which is worse, cheating on your partner

23:53.060 --> 23:58.260
on the exact same night that they decide also separately to cheat on you.

23:58.260 --> 24:02.740
Or being monogamous, but being generally satisfied by that.

24:02.740 --> 24:04.020
Hmm.

24:04.020 --> 24:05.140
The first one.

24:05.140 --> 24:06.020
The first one.

24:06.100 --> 24:08.420
First one's interesting because you never really hear about that.

24:08.420 --> 24:10.180
Well, the first one is like, you just need to be open

24:10.180 --> 24:12.020
and about having an open relationship, right?

24:12.020 --> 24:12.900
You just need to be communicate.

24:12.900 --> 24:13.940
That's all cheating, I think.

24:13.940 --> 24:14.260
Yeah.

24:14.260 --> 24:16.020
You either don't want to be with the person or you want to be open.

24:16.020 --> 24:16.900
Yeah.

24:16.900 --> 24:19.300
It's almost better when it's double.

24:19.300 --> 24:25.140
Yeah, being open, it's like, it doesn't work for me personally.

24:25.140 --> 24:26.340
And no, it's for fun.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.580
A lot of people I know it does work for.

24:28.580 --> 24:29.780
Straight.

24:29.780 --> 24:33.060
I don't, um, I know one's straight couple.

24:33.060 --> 24:34.820
But their both buy is the thing.

24:34.820 --> 24:36.020
I think you both need to be buying.

24:36.020 --> 24:36.500
Yeah.

24:36.500 --> 24:39.060
So if you're a real patient, if you're sure you can have an open relationship,

24:39.060 --> 24:39.620
if you're buying.

24:44.500 --> 24:49.540
All right, which is worse, buying a dog from a breeder or not speaking up

24:49.540 --> 24:51.540
when your voice could really help someone in need.

24:53.140 --> 24:53.940
Which is worse.

24:53.940 --> 24:55.220
Number two, sweetie.

24:55.220 --> 24:56.820
That's what I, that's not the number two.

24:56.820 --> 24:58.180
The dog's already alive.

24:58.180 --> 24:59.220
Yeah.

24:59.220 --> 25:00.420
The dog's already alive.

25:00.420 --> 25:02.180
Um, that was which is worse.

25:02.820 --> 25:04.340
Uh, thank you guys so much for playing along.

25:04.820 --> 25:05.780
Difficult for me.

25:05.780 --> 25:07.140
Thank you to this side of the room.

25:07.140 --> 25:07.540
I'm here.

25:07.540 --> 25:08.740
Why don't you really participate?

25:08.740 --> 25:09.220
I know that you're.

25:09.220 --> 25:09.540
I'm here.

25:09.540 --> 25:10.420
I'm here to go home with you.

25:10.420 --> 25:11.780
I'm here to tell you about what it's supposed to be.

25:11.780 --> 25:13.060
Are you still cracking open?

25:13.060 --> 25:13.460
I'm fresh.

25:13.460 --> 25:16.420
Well, whenever I talk, you sort of cut me off with a really loud sound cut you off.

25:16.420 --> 25:18.180
Because I'm always trying to kind of love you in response.

25:18.180 --> 25:20.980
But it's not going to sort of be creating this negative feedback.

25:20.980 --> 25:21.780
It's a negative feedback.

25:21.780 --> 25:23.940
I'm going to grow a sense of advice to weight.

25:23.940 --> 25:24.180
Yeah.

25:24.180 --> 25:25.060
It's sort of hurts us.

25:25.060 --> 25:26.580
Because what you do is you get fired.

25:26.580 --> 25:27.940
We're training will be quiet.

25:27.940 --> 25:28.820
It's hitting.

25:28.820 --> 25:30.100
It's actually working.

25:30.100 --> 25:33.700
What I'm trying to do is I'm trying every time you try to talk.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.380
Are you trying to get a word in that one?

25:35.380 --> 25:37.140
You're not going to make it a negative means for you.

25:37.140 --> 25:40.180
You're going to ask for a word in his head.

25:40.180 --> 25:42.820
Because now the energy of the room is starting to swirl in this sort of likelihood.

25:42.820 --> 25:44.580
Yeah, infinity loop.

25:44.580 --> 25:45.940
Yes, it's a negative feedback.

25:45.940 --> 25:47.940
It's hard to have a guest on.

25:47.940 --> 25:49.300
Right, and I didn't want to do that.

25:49.300 --> 25:50.900
That's why I was giving them a space to answer.

25:50.900 --> 25:52.420
I think the four of us should go get tattooed.

25:54.420 --> 25:55.700
Another good set for that.

25:57.700 --> 25:58.580
To commemorate this episode.

25:59.540 --> 26:01.460
Are you annoyed that you're here and not playing tennis?

26:01.460 --> 26:03.300
No, I'm playing tennis, but at four.

26:03.300 --> 26:04.180
So this is a good.

26:04.180 --> 26:07.380
I'm getting an hour at talking and then an hour of playing.

26:07.380 --> 26:10.020
I don't have to go do a place over there.

26:10.020 --> 26:11.220
Three buddies of mine.

26:11.220 --> 26:12.980
Oh, name, I'm Sutton's track.

26:12.980 --> 26:15.380
Name, I'm what I've ever done last year.

26:15.380 --> 26:16.500
Do you know that name, I'm?

26:16.500 --> 26:17.300
No.

26:17.300 --> 26:18.020
Oh, God.

26:18.020 --> 26:20.340
Not to keep bringing up house-wise, but it's an iconic scene.

26:20.340 --> 26:22.340
We're like, Kyle Richards is sitting down with Sutton's track.

26:22.340 --> 26:23.540
Oh, you saw Sutton that name.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.180
Yes, and Kyle's like, you're always acting so crazy.

26:26.180 --> 26:27.300
So many times you act crazy.

26:27.300 --> 26:29.860
So I end and Sutton goes, name them.

26:29.860 --> 26:32.900
But Kyle's story is naming them, but she keeps coming off,

26:32.900 --> 26:34.660
like, name them and he has like,

26:34.660 --> 26:36.260
I put them and he doesn't name them.

26:36.260 --> 26:38.740
But why do you want me to make it to name them?

26:38.740 --> 26:41.220
I don't like how you really want to talk about that.

26:41.220 --> 26:41.700
Yeah.

26:41.700 --> 26:42.740
You really are swimming on that.

26:45.620 --> 26:46.660
This is an ad.

26:46.660 --> 26:47.140
I bet.

26:57.540 --> 27:01.060
This is Jeopardy!

27:10.900 --> 27:11.540
Oh, God.

27:15.780 --> 27:17.540
Jeopardy is the name of the game.

27:17.540 --> 27:19.940
It's sort of the headgum podcast version of Jeopardy.

27:20.980 --> 27:21.780
Sort of.

27:21.780 --> 27:22.500
Sort of, yeah.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.820
Everything you see on here will be for an actual cache.

27:24.820 --> 27:26.260
I'm bringing the money back.

27:26.500 --> 27:29.060
So, but you could also end up in debt.

27:29.060 --> 27:31.620
So let's be careful here because there are negative point values.

27:31.620 --> 27:33.300
It looks like your computer's almost dead.

27:33.300 --> 27:34.100
Really?

27:34.100 --> 27:35.220
Oh, scary.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.340
Well, we have to be out.

27:36.340 --> 27:38.180
I timed it perfectly with your heart out.

27:38.180 --> 27:39.620
So, well, still have to.

27:39.620 --> 27:41.380
I'm a baby to my new friend, but she doesn't see me.

27:41.380 --> 27:41.860
On you?

27:41.860 --> 27:42.260
Yeah.

27:42.260 --> 27:42.580
On you.

27:42.580 --> 27:43.220
I used to you.

27:43.220 --> 27:44.340
Not so.

27:44.340 --> 27:46.020
I thought that one person was Jake when I first

27:46.020 --> 27:47.380
went to him, but it was Marty looks like

27:47.380 --> 27:47.700
Jeopardy.

27:47.700 --> 27:47.940
Yeah.

27:47.940 --> 27:49.700
Which is kind of confusing because

27:49.700 --> 27:52.340
me, Marty and Jake like started

27:52.340 --> 27:53.940
headgum and work together all the time.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.380
And a lot of people look like me.

27:55.460 --> 27:57.140
And not a lot of people look like them too.

27:57.140 --> 27:57.620
Totally.

27:57.620 --> 27:59.460
So, when you see me and Marty,

27:59.460 --> 28:01.220
you automatically assume it's been changed.

28:01.220 --> 28:02.580
One thousand per cent.

28:02.580 --> 28:05.700
And the weird thing is that there's nobody who really looks like me at the company,

28:05.700 --> 28:08.100
even though if you walk down the street over here, you see 15 people.

28:08.100 --> 28:09.220
You need to hire one of them.

28:10.500 --> 28:14.740
I don't know what happened or what the universe brought Jake and Marty together,

28:14.740 --> 28:16.420
but it's a very confusing situation.

28:16.420 --> 28:17.220
Totally.

28:17.220 --> 28:19.460
Speaking of very confusing situations,

28:19.460 --> 28:20.740
let's get into Jeopardy.

28:21.540 --> 28:24.020
Team one is going to be cat, team two is pat,

28:24.020 --> 28:25.780
and team three is a mat.

28:25.780 --> 28:26.340
That's my name.

28:26.340 --> 28:26.980
I'm Mira.

28:26.980 --> 28:27.700
Yeah.

28:27.700 --> 28:28.500
A morat.

28:29.540 --> 28:31.540
So, let's start with cat.

28:31.540 --> 28:33.220
Why don't you start us off here?

28:33.220 --> 28:35.300
You control the board for some reason.

28:35.300 --> 28:37.620
I don't really know how different.

28:37.620 --> 28:38.980
And I was going to ask that.

28:38.980 --> 28:40.900
I didn't want to insult your intelligence, but

28:40.900 --> 28:42.660
I don't know how intelligent it makes you don't know how

28:42.660 --> 28:43.140
it works.

28:43.140 --> 28:43.540
Really?

28:43.540 --> 28:44.500
Like, do you watch it every day?

28:44.500 --> 28:46.580
My entire life is all part of that.

28:46.580 --> 28:48.740
Oh, like, I'll have something for a hundred.

28:48.740 --> 28:50.500
Oh, I know, I know how this works.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.660
Yeah, our categories are morning joys.

28:52.660 --> 28:55.060
Okay, I'll do morning joys for 200.

28:55.060 --> 28:57.460
Okay, just for the audio listeners, though.

28:57.460 --> 29:02.500
Morning joys, unlikely AfroDiesiacs, railroad gauges,

29:02.500 --> 29:05.540
celebrities who saw their mommy's kissing Santa Claus,

29:05.540 --> 29:08.900
and were affected by it, and do, let's do.

29:08.900 --> 29:11.300
It's sort of, yeah, so.

29:11.300 --> 29:12.180
Okay.

29:12.180 --> 29:14.180
All right, morning joys for one hundred, you said?

29:14.180 --> 29:14.820
Two.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.260
Two hundred, here we go.

29:16.260 --> 29:19.220
When you have a sneaking suspicion that you might order

29:19.220 --> 29:22.020
pancakes for the table and a round of mimosas,

29:22.020 --> 29:23.220
along with your sandwich.

29:24.260 --> 29:26.820
So now I say, like, what is?

29:26.820 --> 29:29.140
Yeah, you have to answer in the form of the question.

29:29.140 --> 29:30.420
And this is the answer.

29:30.420 --> 29:31.460
Okay, let me look.

29:31.460 --> 29:34.100
Um, but we could all answer if we think of one.

29:34.100 --> 29:35.700
Yeah, that's absolutely fun.

29:35.700 --> 29:37.860
Yeah, like brunch is going off.

29:37.860 --> 29:39.220
When you're going off at brunch.

29:39.220 --> 29:40.820
That's absolutely correct.

29:42.020 --> 29:45.220
What is when you have a hunch that brunch might

29:45.220 --> 29:46.580
evolve into drunch?

29:47.940 --> 29:48.580
Bactically.

29:48.580 --> 29:49.860
Which is points for that.

29:49.860 --> 29:50.580
It's close enough.

29:50.580 --> 29:51.460
It has to be close.

29:51.460 --> 29:52.180
What is it?

29:53.300 --> 29:54.340
I can't love your bullying.

29:54.340 --> 29:55.940
Jeffery really, really, really, really.

29:55.940 --> 29:57.140
It's a good thing.

29:57.140 --> 29:58.180
That's a good one.

29:58.180 --> 29:59.780
As far as Jeffery goes, yeah.

29:59.780 --> 30:00.740
You got it right.

30:00.740 --> 30:01.220
Okay.

30:01.220 --> 30:01.940
That's gailing.

30:01.940 --> 30:05.700
The fact that you said brunch, which was one of the words in the answer,

30:05.700 --> 30:06.900
puts you in the top one person.

30:06.900 --> 30:09.060
Um, all right, cats still controls the board.

30:09.060 --> 30:09.860
Oh, I do it again.

30:09.860 --> 30:10.420
Yep.

30:10.420 --> 30:12.500
All right, what you want that one?

30:12.500 --> 30:14.580
I really want the dude to stay at Curiosio.

30:14.820 --> 30:16.820
Okay, well let's do for 300.

30:16.820 --> 30:19.460
All right, 200 is a rare.

30:19.460 --> 30:20.900
What a mere is?

30:20.900 --> 30:23.220
Isn't that funny that I wanted that one?

30:23.220 --> 30:24.220
What is that?

30:24.220 --> 30:27.300
And that I'm putting, I'm having to get in the head of the person who wrote it.

30:27.300 --> 30:28.500
That's what it's done.

30:28.500 --> 30:29.500
That's really good.

30:29.500 --> 30:30.500
Yes.

30:30.500 --> 30:32.660
Or what he has in mind.

30:32.660 --> 30:34.660
Oh, I'm incorrect.

30:34.660 --> 30:38.260
Pat, I don't want to do this to you, but you do owe me $300.

30:38.260 --> 30:39.260
Oh, guys, it's good.

30:39.260 --> 30:41.060
You're going to make it in the money back.

30:41.060 --> 30:43.700
Or your money might go to, you guys know it's a wonderful life.

30:44.100 --> 30:45.780
Oh, guys, you're going to get me all wrong.

30:45.780 --> 30:46.980
I haven't answered your money yet.

30:46.980 --> 30:48.340
You know what he's doing here.

30:48.340 --> 30:50.260
Once again, I'm trying to answer the question.

30:50.260 --> 30:52.260
Okay, yeah, let's figure that out.

30:52.260 --> 30:53.300
Do you?

30:53.300 --> 30:56.020
A dunkle, which is a dunkle.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.260
Uh, no.

30:57.260 --> 30:59.100
Well, uh, uh, uh.

30:59.100 --> 31:00.100
What am you?

31:00.100 --> 31:00.940
Yes.

31:00.940 --> 31:02.340
Cats, you want to pause it, I guess.

31:02.340 --> 31:03.380
I'm your younger.

31:03.380 --> 31:03.740
Pretty good.

31:03.740 --> 31:04.540
Oh, thanks a little.

31:04.540 --> 31:06.340
I'm just trying to make profit off this episode.

31:06.340 --> 31:07.460
I can't pay you anything.

31:07.460 --> 31:09.460
What is?

31:10.260 --> 31:12.460
Do, do, do, do.

31:12.460 --> 31:13.460
Hmm.

31:13.460 --> 31:19.580
Also incorrect, the answer we're really looking for is what is duplicitous.

31:19.580 --> 31:22.780
Oh, yeah, because he'll come here and say, oh, I'm so great.

31:22.780 --> 31:23.780
That's a great word.

31:23.780 --> 31:27.020
You know, but really all he's thinking about is cracking open that fucking can.

31:27.020 --> 31:29.100
This thing, I can have it while we're doing the episode.

31:29.100 --> 31:30.340
That was balls of tennis ball.

31:30.340 --> 31:31.340
Got it.

31:31.340 --> 31:32.340
Pretty good.

31:32.340 --> 31:33.940
I almost like, what is that tennis brand like?

31:33.940 --> 31:34.940
10.

31:34.940 --> 31:35.940
No.

31:35.940 --> 31:36.940
Dun mop?

31:36.940 --> 31:37.940
Yes.

31:37.940 --> 31:38.940
Oh, yeah.

31:38.940 --> 31:39.940
Yeah.

31:39.940 --> 31:40.940
I don't know.

31:40.940 --> 31:41.940
What is Dunlop's brand ambassador?

31:41.940 --> 31:42.940
I do.

31:42.940 --> 31:43.940
Yeah.

31:43.940 --> 31:44.940
All right.

31:44.940 --> 31:45.940
Pat controls the board.

31:45.940 --> 31:46.940
Oh, I do.

31:46.940 --> 31:47.940
Do I?

31:47.940 --> 31:48.940
Okay.

31:48.940 --> 31:49.940
I'll take, I'll likely have a DCX for 100.

31:49.940 --> 31:51.940
Unlikely have for DCX for 100.

31:51.940 --> 31:52.940
Fibrous Wheat Wafers.

31:52.940 --> 31:54.940
Perfect for carboloding before.

31:54.940 --> 31:56.940
Say it with me now.

31:56.940 --> 31:57.940
Sashin.

31:57.940 --> 32:00.940
Wheat Wafers.

32:00.940 --> 32:02.940
Oh.

32:02.940 --> 32:04.940
What is a trisket?

32:04.940 --> 32:07.940
Correct.

32:07.940 --> 32:09.940
We're looking for trisket.

32:10.940 --> 32:16.940
These are sort of a sickeningly, uh, not obvious effort, EGAC and my experience.

32:16.940 --> 32:17.940
Yeah.

32:17.940 --> 32:18.940
Because they're dry and gross and salty.

32:18.940 --> 32:20.940
No, they're actually so good.

32:20.940 --> 32:21.940
Wait, they're right.

32:21.940 --> 32:22.940
You like trisket, EGACs?

32:22.940 --> 32:23.940
In a way, unlikely though.

32:23.940 --> 32:24.940
Yeah.

32:24.940 --> 32:26.940
In a personal experience or, uh, speaking broadly.

32:26.940 --> 32:28.940
Some of these are informed by my personal life.

32:28.940 --> 32:30.940
Some of them are informed by, I would say, the cultural conversation.

32:30.940 --> 32:33.940
I don't think there's any sexual conversation around trisket.

32:33.940 --> 32:34.940
True.

32:34.940 --> 32:37.940
Imagine kissing a man like Jeff with trisket.

32:37.940 --> 32:38.940
Oh, my gosh.

32:38.940 --> 32:39.940
All right.

32:39.940 --> 32:41.940
Amir controls the board.

32:41.940 --> 32:43.940
Uh, let's stick with Aphrodisiacs.

32:43.940 --> 32:46.940
Cause I don't think I've ever gotten the correct answer before, so this is exciting.

32:46.940 --> 32:48.940
I'm likely Aphrodisiacs with 200.

32:48.940 --> 32:52.940
The seeds you spit out before spitting out their seed.

32:52.940 --> 32:53.940
Hmm.

32:53.940 --> 32:54.940
Oh, ding.

32:54.940 --> 32:56.940
Uh, what is poppy seeds?

32:56.940 --> 32:58.940
Uh, no.

32:58.940 --> 32:59.940
Really?

32:59.940 --> 33:01.940
Seeds you spit out.

33:01.940 --> 33:02.940
Like a snap.

33:02.940 --> 33:03.940
So sunflower seeds.

33:03.940 --> 33:04.940
Oh, yeah.

33:04.940 --> 33:05.940
Good job.

33:05.940 --> 33:06.940
Oh my god.

33:07.940 --> 33:08.940
I'm happy.

33:08.940 --> 33:09.940
I'm almost like winning.

33:09.940 --> 33:10.940
I'm happy to see you.

33:10.940 --> 33:11.940
I'm happy to see you.

33:11.940 --> 33:12.940
Okay.

33:12.940 --> 33:13.940
Let's do Aphrodisiacs with the 100.

33:13.940 --> 33:14.940
Oh, my god.

33:14.940 --> 33:15.940
The category that we say.

33:15.940 --> 33:16.940
Thanks for 300.

33:16.940 --> 33:17.940
Why?

33:17.940 --> 33:20.940
Made from red grapes.

33:20.940 --> 33:23.940
I mean, what is red wine?

33:23.940 --> 33:24.940
Oh, wait.

33:24.940 --> 33:25.940
Do we all get answered?

33:25.940 --> 33:26.940
Yeah.

33:26.940 --> 33:27.940
But as far as I.

33:27.940 --> 33:28.940
Don't tell me now.

33:28.940 --> 33:29.940
What is it?

33:29.940 --> 33:31.940
What is it?

33:31.940 --> 33:32.940
Mama.

33:32.940 --> 33:35.940
The correct answer is.

33:35.940 --> 33:36.940
Champagne.

33:36.940 --> 33:37.940
It's not true.

33:37.940 --> 33:40.940
Do you guys know that champagne mostly is made from red grapes?

33:40.940 --> 33:41.940
No.

33:41.940 --> 33:42.940
That's crazy.

33:42.940 --> 33:43.940
Right?

33:43.940 --> 33:44.940
That's your right.

33:44.940 --> 33:45.940
Or it might be wrong.

33:45.940 --> 33:46.940
That's a cat.

33:46.940 --> 33:47.940
That's crazy.

33:47.940 --> 33:48.940
You're wrong.

33:48.940 --> 33:49.940
Oh.

33:49.940 --> 33:50.940
Um, okay.

33:50.940 --> 33:52.940
Let what about.

33:52.940 --> 33:54.940
What about morning joys for 300?

33:54.940 --> 33:55.940
Morning joys for 300.

33:55.940 --> 33:57.940
Something Jeff does every.

33:57.940 --> 33:58.940
Consider is doing.

33:58.940 --> 33:59.940
Sorry.

33:59.940 --> 34:00.940
Every morning.

34:00.940 --> 34:02.940
Something Jeff considers doing.

34:02.940 --> 34:03.940
What is jerking off?

34:04.940 --> 34:07.940
Jeff considers it.

34:07.940 --> 34:08.940
Who's Jeff?

34:08.940 --> 34:09.940
That's me.

34:09.940 --> 34:10.940
Oh.

34:10.940 --> 34:13.940
That's another good.

34:13.940 --> 34:15.940
Noise for the sound.

34:15.940 --> 34:20.940
You also don't have to.

34:20.940 --> 34:22.940
I don't know you.

34:22.940 --> 34:23.940
Right.

34:23.940 --> 34:24.940
Famous.

34:24.940 --> 34:26.940
I just haven't changed.

34:28.940 --> 34:29.940
Um, yeah.

34:29.940 --> 34:31.940
I don't think I'm going to answer because I don't want to risk my points.

34:31.940 --> 34:32.940
I'm so close to being in the lead.

34:32.940 --> 34:33.940
What is crunches?

34:33.940 --> 34:36.940
The correct answer was what is making a fucking run before it.

34:36.940 --> 34:39.940
Oh, it's just getting in the car and just.

34:39.940 --> 34:40.940
Famous partner.

34:40.940 --> 34:41.940
Why?

34:41.940 --> 34:42.940
Not from her.

34:42.940 --> 34:43.940
She's lovely.

34:43.940 --> 34:44.940
Yeah.

34:44.940 --> 34:45.940
Your life.

34:45.940 --> 34:46.940
Ah.

34:46.940 --> 34:47.940
Thank you guys.

34:47.940 --> 34:48.940
Have a good thing going.

34:48.940 --> 34:49.940
It's monetizable.

34:49.940 --> 34:50.940
Yeah.

34:50.940 --> 34:51.940
Is it comfortable?

34:51.940 --> 34:52.940
No.

34:52.940 --> 34:53.940
Totally.

34:53.940 --> 34:54.940
Sorry.

34:54.940 --> 34:55.940
I would never have guessed that.

34:55.940 --> 34:57.940
Now I see why I was so good at the brunch one.

34:57.940 --> 34:59.940
All right, Pat.

34:59.940 --> 35:00.940
Okay.

35:00.940 --> 35:01.940
Wow.

35:02.940 --> 35:03.940
Um, all right.

35:03.940 --> 35:04.940
Do you want to get your head?

35:04.940 --> 35:05.940
Well, let's do celebrities each other.

35:05.940 --> 35:08.940
Mommy kissing Santa Claus and we're affected by it for 100.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.940
So celebrities who saw their mommy kissing Santa Claus and we're affected by it for 100.

35:11.940 --> 35:14.940
Where the sidewalk ends would not have existed.

35:14.940 --> 35:15.940
Had it not.

35:15.940 --> 35:16.940
It's so machine.

35:16.940 --> 35:17.940
Wow.

35:17.940 --> 35:19.940
Just for the audio listeners though, would.

35:19.940 --> 35:20.940
Where the sidewalk.

35:20.940 --> 35:21.940
Oh, sorry.

35:21.940 --> 35:23.940
Oh, I kicked my friend.

35:23.940 --> 35:25.940
Where the sidewalk ends would not have existed.

35:25.940 --> 35:28.940
Had it not been for this poet walking in on his mom engaged in

35:28.940 --> 35:33.940
Amorous Congress with Father Christmas and the correct answer is shall silver steam.

35:33.940 --> 35:34.940
Yes.

35:34.940 --> 35:35.940
I'm fully winning.

35:35.940 --> 35:38.940
Uh, Pat is in the lead with zero.

35:38.940 --> 35:39.940
Okay.

35:39.940 --> 35:40.940
Let's do on minus 100.

35:40.940 --> 35:42.940
Let's do celebrities for 200.

35:42.940 --> 35:47.940
Celebrities who saw their mommy kissing Santa Claus witnessing his mother's infertility at a young age.

35:47.940 --> 35:49.940
Drove this man to invent the fucking phone.

35:49.940 --> 35:51.940
Oh, who's a guy again?

35:51.940 --> 35:53.940
Who is Alexander Grumbell?

35:53.940 --> 35:56.940
Oh, sorry to this man.

35:57.940 --> 35:58.940
Oh, I'm losing.

35:58.940 --> 35:59.940
Chat controls the word.

35:59.940 --> 36:00.940
Okay.

36:00.940 --> 36:01.940
Let's do it.

36:01.940 --> 36:04.940
Do for 200.

36:04.940 --> 36:05.940
I'm not sure.

36:05.940 --> 36:06.940
We're living the higher one.

36:06.940 --> 36:09.940
What Jeff is constantly under as the host.

36:09.940 --> 36:10.940
What is your ass?

36:10.940 --> 36:11.940
Oh.

36:11.940 --> 36:14.940
I wish I hadn't chosen a father who was by buzzing.

36:14.940 --> 36:21.940
As soon as you got excited that you were winning, I was like, I want to win too.

36:21.940 --> 36:22.940
I know.

36:22.940 --> 36:23.940
And it went for me.

36:23.940 --> 36:24.940
I wouldn't.

36:24.940 --> 36:25.940
Okay.

36:26.940 --> 36:28.940
What for me is a loss for you.

36:28.940 --> 36:29.940
And that means the world.

36:29.940 --> 36:33.940
Let's do celebs for three handy.

36:33.940 --> 36:34.940
Celebrities who say a lot.

36:34.940 --> 36:35.940
It's awesome.

36:35.940 --> 36:37.940
Kissing Santa Claus and we're affected by it for 300.

36:37.940 --> 36:39.940
It's no wonder why this recluse of a mirror.

36:39.940 --> 36:40.940
It doesn't look like it's in.

36:40.940 --> 36:41.940
Wow.

36:41.940 --> 36:42.940
Okay.

36:42.940 --> 36:44.940
Do we have to buzz my only question?

36:44.940 --> 36:45.940
I think just yo.

36:45.940 --> 36:46.940
Okay.

36:46.940 --> 36:47.940
Sorry about that.

36:47.940 --> 36:49.940
It's no wonder why this recluse of American poetry.

36:49.940 --> 36:50.940
It's the life in solitude.

36:50.940 --> 36:53.940
And as she once watched in horror as her mother,

36:53.940 --> 36:54.940
eight Santa's ass.

36:55.940 --> 36:57.940
Wild nights indeed.

36:57.940 --> 36:58.940
And the answer was.

36:58.940 --> 36:59.940
Okay.

36:59.940 --> 37:01.940
I would really have to go into overchive.

37:01.940 --> 37:03.940
Back to cat.

37:03.940 --> 37:04.940
Um.

37:04.940 --> 37:06.940
What is.

37:06.940 --> 37:08.940
Do for a hundred.

37:08.940 --> 37:09.940
Do for a hundred.

37:09.940 --> 37:11.940
A classic diner in Los Angeles,

37:11.940 --> 37:14.940
where Jeff almost said hello to someone who looked like,

37:14.940 --> 37:16.940
but wasn't actually a deaf Jeff Dunham.

37:16.940 --> 37:17.940
Oh my god.

37:17.940 --> 37:18.940
I know it.

37:18.940 --> 37:19.940
Yeah.

37:19.940 --> 37:20.940
I don't know.

37:20.940 --> 37:21.940
I can't remember the name of it.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.940
I'm your grew up here as entirely.

37:23.940 --> 37:24.940
You saw one of the most often.

37:24.940 --> 37:25.940
I know they're one time.

37:25.940 --> 37:27.940
I mean, I have three guesses,

37:27.940 --> 37:29.940
but I don't know if I get an arrow down to one.

37:29.940 --> 37:30.940
A classic diner in LA.

37:30.940 --> 37:31.940
I mean, I guess.

37:31.940 --> 37:32.940
I'll guess.

37:32.940 --> 37:33.940
Mel's driving.

37:33.940 --> 37:37.940
The category is Duke.

37:37.940 --> 37:38.940
I think I know it.

37:38.940 --> 37:39.940
But I can't.

37:39.940 --> 37:40.940
I'm sorry.

37:40.940 --> 37:41.940
I forgot the do part.

37:41.940 --> 37:42.940
Yeah.

37:42.940 --> 37:43.940
But you're a thief.

37:43.940 --> 37:44.940
I was going to say what Jesus said.

37:44.940 --> 37:45.940
Oh.

37:45.940 --> 37:46.940
I missed.

37:46.940 --> 37:47.940
What is do part?

37:47.940 --> 37:48.940
What is do part?

37:48.940 --> 37:49.940
That's not fair.

37:49.940 --> 37:50.940
That's fair.

37:50.940 --> 37:51.940
I know.

37:51.940 --> 37:52.940
That was awesome.

37:52.940 --> 37:53.940
I was thinking.

37:53.940 --> 37:54.940
And my brain.

37:54.940 --> 37:55.940
This was still the Santa Claus category.

37:55.940 --> 37:56.940
I thought it was that one.

37:56.940 --> 37:58.940
I watched that happen to you.

37:58.940 --> 37:59.940
Yeah.

37:59.940 --> 38:00.940
Well, listen.

38:00.940 --> 38:01.940
Let's just round up.

38:01.940 --> 38:03.940
Let's do a round up here for a second.

38:03.940 --> 38:04.940
Cat.

38:04.940 --> 38:05.940
You're going home with 700 bucks.

38:05.940 --> 38:06.940
Right.

38:06.940 --> 38:07.940
Maybe last maybe a little bit more.

38:07.940 --> 38:08.940
Pat.

38:08.940 --> 38:10.940
If you guess wrong, you're going to be in debt.

38:10.940 --> 38:11.940
So you're like safe for now.

38:11.940 --> 38:12.940
If you don't answer.

38:12.940 --> 38:13.940
Yeah.

38:13.940 --> 38:14.940
And I'm here.

38:14.940 --> 38:16.940
The company has to pay me for doing this already.

38:16.940 --> 38:18.940
But you might want to slide me.

38:18.940 --> 38:19.940
A 200 stack.

38:19.940 --> 38:20.940
Two bands.

38:20.940 --> 38:21.940
Two bands.

38:22.940 --> 38:24.940
Cat controls the board.

38:24.940 --> 38:27.940
What is morning joys for a hundred?

38:27.940 --> 38:28.940
Morning joys for a hundred.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.940
Something that might make you smile.

38:31.940 --> 38:33.940
Huh?

38:33.940 --> 38:35.940
This is so hard.

38:35.940 --> 38:36.940
Nope.

38:36.940 --> 38:37.940
You don't know what he has to do.

38:37.940 --> 38:38.940
It might make you smile.

38:38.940 --> 38:40.940
What is a bowl of cereal?

38:43.940 --> 38:44.940
What is?

38:44.940 --> 38:45.940
What is?

38:45.940 --> 38:46.940

You have too much to lose.

38:52.940 --> 38:53.940
Yes.

38:53.940 --> 38:58.940
The correct answer we were looking for is.

38:58.940 --> 39:00.940
What is when you wake up and win the lottery?

39:00.940 --> 39:02.940
Oh, that's a really good answer.

39:02.940 --> 39:03.940
Might make you smile.

39:03.940 --> 39:04.940
Because it may not be your reaction.

39:04.940 --> 39:06.940
And because people and because everyone's people's lives.

39:06.940 --> 39:07.940
Yeah.

People get hurt.

39:09.940 --> 39:10.940
Or they just become greedy.

39:10.940 --> 39:11.940
Backbreak.

39:19.940 --> 39:22.940
Some of the widest standard rail gauges in the world.

39:22.940 --> 39:25.940
Again, you do not have to answer, but I would encourage America to.

39:25.940 --> 39:27.940
Just so I can keep making money.

39:27.940 --> 39:28.940
Twelve inches.

39:28.940 --> 39:30.940
Well, that's just the widest.

39:30.940 --> 39:32.940

A system for operating railway wagons on two or more gauges to overcome

39:47.940 --> 39:49.940
difference in the track gauge.

39:49.940 --> 39:50.940
It's so specific.

39:50.940 --> 39:51.940
So guess.

39:55.940 --> 39:59.940
System for operating railway wagons.

39:59.940 --> 40:02.940
Two or more gauges.

40:02.940 --> 40:04.940

40:21.940 --> 40:23.940
The silence in between.

40:23.940 --> 40:25.940
It was like a picture of oxygen.

40:25.940 --> 40:26.940
And final one.

You know, the only thing is when you're like giving information over the phone or out the DMV.

41:14.940 --> 41:17.940
It's like, no, it's actually GEO and I'm like GEO.

41:17.940 --> 41:20.940
I used to think as a child, which I would prefer since I had a wrong decision.

41:20.940 --> 41:22.940
My hair position is GEO.

41:22.940 --> 41:23.940
That's really good.

41:23.940 --> 41:24.940
Yeah.

41:24.940 --> 41:26.940
I love that moment.

41:26.940 --> 41:27.940
Yeah.

41:27.940 --> 41:29.940
That was like radical.

41:29.940 --> 41:30.940
It was punk.

41:30.940 --> 41:31.940
Yeah.

41:33.940 --> 41:34.940
He said GEO.

41:34.940 --> 41:35.940
No.

41:35.940 --> 41:37.940
Or in kind of a set was on like Howard Sterner.

41:37.940 --> 41:38.940
I was here a sex decision.

41:38.940 --> 41:39.940
There you go.

41:39.940 --> 41:40.940
What's your favorite position?

41:40.940 --> 41:41.940
And should see you.

41:41.940 --> 41:42.940
Got it.

41:42.940 --> 41:43.940
But then GEO is played.

41:43.940 --> 41:44.940
That's a sound.

41:44.940 --> 41:45.940
That's a sound.

41:45.940 --> 41:46.940
That means nothing.

41:46.940 --> 41:48.940
That means nothing.

41:48.940 --> 41:49.940
That means nothing.

41:49.940 --> 41:50.940
That's another good for the sound.

41:50.940 --> 41:51.940
For the conditioning.

41:51.940 --> 41:52.940
Yeah.

41:52.940 --> 41:54.940
You're auditioning for a host of that.

41:54.940 --> 41:55.940

41:55.940 --> 41:56.940
Guys, we did it.

41:58.940 --> 41:59.940
Oh, God.

41:59.940 --> 42:00.940
This is a short and sweet episode.

42:00.940 --> 42:01.940
I think it was tight.

42:01.940 --> 42:02.940
I think it was just right.

42:02.940 --> 42:04.940
And I don't think we should push it for the most thing because I have nothing else

42:04.940 --> 42:05.940
prepared.

42:05.940 --> 42:06.940
Yeah.

42:06.940 --> 42:07.940

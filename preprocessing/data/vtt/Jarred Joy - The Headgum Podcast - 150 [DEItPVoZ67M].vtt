00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:02.000 --> 00:29.900
The heart is begging.

00:29.900 --> 00:35.180
first sip feeling. That's how I'm feeling today. Have you guys seen this?

00:36.540 --> 00:40.700
I don't think so. It's printed on Starbucks cups.

00:44.380 --> 00:51.020
Yes, I've seen it. First sip feeling. It says, let us add a little joy to your day. So I think that

00:51.020 --> 00:54.700
some marketing person at Starbucks listens to the show.

00:59.900 --> 01:00.740
Don't come out.

01:00.740 --> 01:01.620
Get started.

01:01.620 --> 01:02.740
Get started.

01:02.740 --> 01:03.740
Get started.

01:03.740 --> 01:05.540
Get started.

01:05.540 --> 01:07.700
Get started.

01:07.700 --> 01:08.220
Yeah.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.340
That Friday feeling though for real.

01:11.340 --> 01:11.700
Thank you.

01:11.700 --> 01:11.980
Thank you.

01:11.980 --> 01:14.540
Friends are so spindly.

01:16.220 --> 01:16.820
Japs.

01:17.820 --> 01:18.700
And Japs.

01:18.700 --> 01:19.140
Sorry.

01:19.140 --> 01:19.660
Oh.

01:20.660 --> 01:21.180
Oh.

01:21.180 --> 01:21.540
Oh.

01:21.540 --> 01:22.660
Oh.

01:22.660 --> 01:23.260
Oh.

01:25.260 --> 01:26.660
That's for the Patreon.

01:26.660 --> 01:27.820
Blood for this one.

01:27.820 --> 01:29.340
But we're going to start.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.020
No free foot content.

01:34.300 --> 01:35.980
Are you guys feeling that Friday feeling?

01:37.260 --> 01:38.940
You didn't answer the little thing. Yeah.

01:39.100 --> 01:39.700
Yeah, big time.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.860
Now I am big time.

01:40.860 --> 01:41.980
Big time.

01:41.980 --> 01:42.540
Yeah.

01:42.540 --> 01:44.460
Brad, you've been coming in with a certain joy.

01:44.460 --> 01:45.340
Do you want to speak to that?

01:46.700 --> 01:49.420
Just in a good mood for now for now.

01:49.420 --> 01:50.060
For now.

01:50.060 --> 01:52.620
I think we're going to either sour it or enhance it.

01:52.620 --> 01:53.900
Let's keep things going.

01:53.900 --> 02:03.220
Some uh, it's bond news.

02:03.220 --> 02:08.820
The casting office working on the new James films said that it's not going to be, well,

02:08.820 --> 02:10.940
first of all, they've only been saying it's going to be a guy.

02:10.940 --> 02:14.460
So they're saying it's not going to be a guy in his 20s because they don't have that

02:14.460 --> 02:15.460
grovy toss.

02:16.460 --> 02:20.820
Uh, so I don't know, like Brad, you're in your 30s.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.180
I'm not, what do you guys think?

02:22.180 --> 02:23.940
Let's go at Ali and then Marieka.

02:23.940 --> 02:25.900
Who do you guys think has more grovy toss?

02:27.180 --> 02:28.740
The junior you and Brad?

02:29.380 --> 02:30.060
Yeah.

02:30.780 --> 02:31.620
Okay.

02:32.020 --> 02:35.060
Um, I'm going to go Brad for sure.

02:36.540 --> 02:39.220
Cause you're kind of wearing heart shaped glasses right now.

02:39.220 --> 02:41.820
And that to me isn't really gravitas.

02:42.220 --> 02:46.100
Yeah, I've got a hole in my jacket, which is kind of humble.

02:46.740 --> 02:48.020
That's humble.

02:48.020 --> 02:51.020
It begs the question, like, where has he been?

02:51.020 --> 02:52.620
What has he been up to?

02:53.060 --> 02:55.460
And you know what they say about having a hole in your jacket.

02:56.780 --> 02:57.260
It's better.

02:58.260 --> 03:03.100
It's better to have a hole in your jacket than a jacket in your hole.

03:04.220 --> 03:04.780
Closet.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.180
Like my son.

03:07.180 --> 03:11.340
No, it's better to have a jacket in your closet than to have a whole red coat.

03:11.340 --> 03:16.020
No, yeah, you just want to catch Marika saying no.

03:16.100 --> 03:19.660
I wanted to catch her outside with a jacket on.

03:20.660 --> 03:23.340
Well, my bond of the week was going to be Brad, but I'm going to make it.

03:23.340 --> 03:24.580
Maybe take it back now.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.820
Take it back now, y'all.

03:27.620 --> 03:29.060
What have this time?

03:31.060 --> 03:32.660
Uh, that wasn't me getting the number wrong.

03:32.660 --> 03:33.980
That was me saying peace and love.

03:34.500 --> 03:35.940
Uh, my bond of the week is Ringo star.

03:36.820 --> 03:37.380
That's cool.

03:37.380 --> 03:38.340
My bond of the week.

03:39.340 --> 03:41.540
I got to give it to Joe Allen.

03:41.540 --> 03:43.700
Cause like give him a job.

03:43.700 --> 03:44.340
You know, I mean,

03:45.300 --> 03:46.700
sorry, it's roughly for him.

03:46.940 --> 03:51.220
You want him to be bond because he's an unemployed actor.

03:52.340 --> 03:53.980
He's not unemployed actor.

03:54.020 --> 03:58.460
He, it's just, there's been a lot of like tweets and discussion going on.

03:58.860 --> 04:04.020
Post break up with Taylor Swift, like that he's just never going to work again,

04:04.420 --> 04:05.620
uh, which I don't believe.

04:05.780 --> 04:09.020
And so why don't we give him, you know, why don't we give him bond?

04:09.940 --> 04:14.260
Well, and also in this acting gig economy, maybe he is on a play right now.

04:15.060 --> 04:16.740
Alley's reading from no cards.

04:16.740 --> 04:18.260
She's scripted this out.

04:18.260 --> 04:19.700
This is so fucked up.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.860
Chicken is feeding her lines.

04:21.860 --> 04:22.260
Yeah.

04:22.260 --> 04:25.540
We should also say for the, I mean, the audio listeners haven't heard his ass,

04:25.540 --> 04:28.420
but the visual listeners have seen his ass or lack there up.

04:28.420 --> 04:30.420
I'm here's been setting up for nine minutes.

04:31.380 --> 04:34.740
He owns a podcast company and it takes him that long.

04:35.380 --> 04:37.860
Uh, we're in, baby.

04:37.860 --> 04:38.660
There he is.

04:38.660 --> 04:40.100
Uh, Brad, who's your brother the week?

04:40.100 --> 04:42.100
Did you say I did not.

04:42.180 --> 04:43.620
I'm going to go with Steven.

04:43.620 --> 04:45.140
Yeah, that's pretty good.

04:45.140 --> 04:46.420
That's a really big alley.

04:46.420 --> 04:46.980
Who do you got?

04:49.460 --> 04:49.940
What?

04:49.940 --> 04:50.980
You're more didn't know?

04:50.980 --> 04:51.460
Yeah.

04:52.020 --> 04:52.740
I was going to elaborate.

04:52.740 --> 04:53.140
I didn't.

04:54.100 --> 04:54.980
The goal at it's fine.

04:54.980 --> 04:56.580
Go, row, no, yeah.

04:56.980 --> 05:00.100
I looked like I'm hung over, but I didn't, I got dinner last night.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.940
That's not like a hungover thing.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.300
It's kind of funny.

05:04.340 --> 05:08.420
Didn't they also say that it not only is it going to probably be someone in their 30s,

05:08.420 --> 05:10.020
but it's someone unknown.

05:10.980 --> 05:12.580
Relatively unknown.

05:12.580 --> 05:13.620
Relatively.

05:13.620 --> 05:14.020
All right.

05:14.020 --> 05:16.900
So my bond of the week is Jeff and five years.

05:19.540 --> 05:20.900
I could do the accent.

05:20.900 --> 05:21.140
Yeah.

05:23.060 --> 05:24.260
The name is Jeff.

05:24.260 --> 05:27.620
Five years to, you've got five years to James Bond.

05:27.620 --> 05:32.020
Yeah, she's saying that you're still going to be relatively unknown in five years.

05:32.660 --> 05:34.020
Kind of an insult, too.

05:34.020 --> 05:34.820
Really.

05:34.820 --> 05:39.220
I thought I was sort of a Conahey style where it's like my hero is myself in five years.

05:40.100 --> 05:46.020
That's just, I think, a way to just self-diagnosed narcissism.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.980
No, that's speech made me laugh.

05:48.980 --> 05:51.860
I think about that probably quarterly.

05:54.260 --> 05:55.300
So it's about a ton of time.

05:55.300 --> 05:58.100
That's like 25 more times than I have.

06:00.580 --> 06:01.940
Amirial is doing his taxes.

06:01.940 --> 06:04.740
It seems we got Freddie Freeman.

06:06.740 --> 06:07.620
Let's move on.

06:07.700 --> 06:13.060
A French court approved Mac calls unpopular plan to raise the retirement age in France.

06:14.660 --> 06:15.060
Thought?

06:15.060 --> 06:16.900
Yeah, how was, how was France?

06:16.900 --> 06:18.100
We talked about it last week.

06:18.660 --> 06:21.060
We talked about it last week, so we don't have to keep going on in France.

06:21.060 --> 06:23.460
We're asking if it was a friend.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.220
It was awesome.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.020
Yeah.

06:28.020 --> 06:33.780
I sort of appreciate the French culture in terms of sitting on a patio, really,

06:33.780 --> 06:37.220
and indulging in a beefboard in yarn for lunch.

06:39.220 --> 06:41.380
Yeah, that's a fair French.

06:41.380 --> 06:43.460
That's the thing in France, they have a heavy lunch, right?

06:43.460 --> 06:48.660
Because you might take a two hour lunch, which is kind of unheard of.

06:48.660 --> 06:54.420
For us, we go to what tacos delta just to make it fast and cheap versus in France.

06:54.420 --> 06:59.220
They'll spend $80 or sorry, you're out on their own lunch.

06:59.860 --> 07:09.060
Yeah, it's fun visiting a country that is indominated by capitalism, like people just take long vacation, stores are closed in the afternoon.

07:09.060 --> 07:14.020
They're not supremely just motivated by maximizing cash until they die.

07:14.020 --> 07:19.300
Yeah, if anything, I'm sorry to say, Brad, but they're about maximizing cash.

07:19.300 --> 07:21.300
I had some of the best sex in my life in France.

07:24.740 --> 07:26.420
And that was directed at me.

07:26.420 --> 07:32.580
Why? I was apologizing sort of as like a trigger warning to you, because I didn't want to offend.

07:33.300 --> 07:38.020
You've been on the show a lot less than the other three, so they were just kind of used to it in terms of, um, cash.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.900
Okay, appreciate that.

07:44.740 --> 07:53.700
While I was in Paris, uh, Pavey actually ended up at a Macron protest, but it wasn't because I necessarily care

07:53.780 --> 07:59.220
about the pension age in France, but it was because I was walking in the same general direction, right?

07:59.220 --> 08:03.220
So it felt like I was joining the stream of sea turtles in finding Mimo.

08:05.060 --> 08:06.260
What is the ancient?

08:07.220 --> 08:08.260
From the toilet.

08:08.260 --> 08:12.020
They bumped it up from 62 to 64, which I think is fun.

08:14.580 --> 08:17.060
Yeah, I disagree. I don't think it's fun.

08:17.060 --> 08:23.300
Well, it's not ideal, but it's, you know, it's not like 62 to 70, right? Like you can do 24 more months.

08:24.340 --> 08:30.580
Don't you have to be 65 to get a senior discount at the movie theater here?

08:30.580 --> 08:31.780
In America, yeah.

08:31.780 --> 08:33.620
Yeah, so that's what I'm saying.

08:33.620 --> 08:33.780
That's what I'm saying.

08:33.780 --> 08:42.180
That's what I'm saying. Exactly, right? Exactly, right? Also with like expand, like life, life expectancy continues to go up.

08:42.180 --> 08:45.380
So I don't know. It's like, it's like adjusting for inflation.

08:45.700 --> 08:48.900
Marie, what do you got?

08:48.900 --> 08:50.820
And see, is going up?

08:50.820 --> 08:54.500
Is it not? I don't know if that's true. Really?

08:57.540 --> 09:01.460
I thought it was a cut by like a quarter. It was like three years down, right?

09:02.500 --> 09:06.100
I don't know at this point. From, we should all, yeah.

09:06.100 --> 09:09.940
Yeah, um, and be a playoff. What do we think in a mirror?

09:10.020 --> 09:17.860
Sun's versus bucks, the rematch, and be a finals. Really? That's my prediction.

09:19.300 --> 09:20.900
Western conference finals. Who you have though?

09:22.020 --> 09:25.620
Phoenix over Denver. Phoenix over Denver. That's not possible.

09:27.860 --> 09:35.860
It would, that would be the semi finals. Let's go. Sun's over warriors in sixth. Do you believe

09:35.860 --> 09:40.900
the Lakers can even win one series? Yes. So you think it'll be, they're going to fall to the

09:40.900 --> 09:46.900
warriors? I mean, hopefully not, but yeah, I think that's the most likely scenario.

09:47.540 --> 09:51.140
Are you putting money on it? I put money on. Other teams to win.

09:51.780 --> 09:55.700
Are you going to see any games while they're playing an LA?

09:56.580 --> 10:02.020
Am I going into the games, you mean? Yeah. No. Okay. Where do you think you might watch the games?

10:02.500 --> 10:08.260
Probably with a buddy. I said, where? Oh, either at his house or mine or. Why are you

10:08.260 --> 10:10.980
talking about something? What's that? Nothing.

10:15.300 --> 10:20.420
Are you going to wear a jersey to support or purple and gold at all? Maybe a Lakers shirt. I don't

10:20.420 --> 10:28.260
have a Lakers jersey. Yeah, you're doing some purple wine in that liquid gold. Hi, I see.

10:29.220 --> 10:34.740
Just as like a gift. What do you? A mirror. What do you think about Tristan Thompson

10:34.740 --> 10:42.660
going to the Lakers? I guess they needed one last big body to play third string center. I don't

10:42.660 --> 10:48.020
think he'll get that many minutes, but at least he has high defensive IQ and some camaraderie

10:48.020 --> 10:53.460
with Lebron James. So the very least he'll be able to impart wisdom from the bench. And if he's

10:53.460 --> 11:00.180
playing, then things have either gone horribly right or wrong that game. It's cuffing season and

11:00.180 --> 11:05.620
Tristan is a Laker. He is a big boy. He's a big boy. I need a big boy.

11:08.660 --> 11:10.740
Done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done,

11:14.020 --> 11:21.060
why? Um, Marie, can you want to talk about jar joy for a minute?

11:24.420 --> 11:30.900
I assume you're referring to the screenshot that you texted me at 2 a.m. my time last night

11:30.900 --> 11:42.180
that was a restaurant slash ghost kitchen that I assume serves cake jars. Did you order any?

11:42.740 --> 11:50.580
I didn't get any, yeah. I think you should. Yeah, maybe. Have you guys talked about Jeff's ring yet?

11:50.740 --> 12:01.460
No, no, where'd you get it? I got it on Rubel 3 in the fourth out on these

12:01.460 --> 12:07.220
mole, Dupelli. It was actually across the street from Jim Morrison's last residence.

12:07.780 --> 12:12.260
Oh, we did talk about that last time. We did, but I edited it out because it was not interesting.

12:12.260 --> 12:17.860
So here we go again. Did you go to that store looking for a ring or did you just like see a ring

12:17.860 --> 12:23.380
and you're like, oh, that could be kind of cool to wear that ring? Uh, the second one. I like it

12:23.380 --> 12:29.860
because it says PG on it, which I sort of turned into Paris Jeff. Yeah, so when I put it on,

12:29.860 --> 12:36.420
I feel like I'm in Paris or should I say Gaperie? Is it a, which is another GP? Is it another

12:36.420 --> 12:42.580
all time thing or are you like, where'd if the outfit calls for it? It's if the outfit calls for it

12:42.740 --> 12:50.020
is, if I'm in the mood to be gay, whether in Paris or not, and yeah. So do you take it off at

12:50.020 --> 12:54.420
night and put it on in the morning? Like, I can get off of my finger, which depends if it's colder

12:54.420 --> 13:00.020
hot in the room. Yeah, it was hot. Hot right now. Yeah, because it's hot. And if it's not hot,

13:00.020 --> 13:04.740
it almost falls off. So I don't know if it's the right size or what? Interesting. Can you slide it

13:04.740 --> 13:11.860
up and not off right now? Or it's kind of tightly on there. Taking a look, he's sort of rotating

13:12.020 --> 13:19.460
on there. Yeah, it's really a past and not cool. Right. Um, I sent Marieka this screenshot, right?

13:20.340 --> 13:28.420
Of Jarjoy and not to be confused with Jarria. This is what it looked like.

13:32.020 --> 13:39.780
Like an appetizing image. Not at all. No, it looks a little bit. It looks like

13:39.780 --> 13:45.940
nocturnal emissions. Let's just call it what it is. Uh, my question is also $13 for Jarjoy.

13:45.940 --> 13:51.540
That's pretty steep. I wanted to know what your guys' Jarjoy was. Jar of joy.

13:51.540 --> 13:56.420
Jarjoy. Sorry, Jarjoy actually, not to be confused with scarred, sorry,

13:56.420 --> 14:04.820
charred soy. We'll get to that. My, what a cliff. Jarjoy currently. Have you guys been on water

14:04.820 --> 14:13.300
talk? Like, tick talks about water. Yeah. It's a new thing. I can't keep up with anybody

14:13.300 --> 14:17.860
younger than me at this point. Well, I feel like they're not younger. I feel like they're like

14:17.860 --> 14:23.540
women in their 30s that are going around being like, let's make my water for the day and it's

14:24.180 --> 14:28.740
they'll they'll fill this is this is just regular water in my Stanley cup, but they'll take

14:28.740 --> 14:35.700
those Stanley cups and they'll pour packets of flavoring in there like three or four. They'll

14:35.700 --> 14:43.060
they'll pour sugar free syrup. I just saw on today that was a lady making a pink wedding cake

14:43.060 --> 14:51.780
water. Uh, gross. But if you're putting syrup in your flat water like you're not always

14:51.860 --> 15:01.940
something else. Yeah. Jar in season and all the cake is in jars. I need a jar joy. I need a jar joy.

15:05.940 --> 15:11.620
Yeah. So that's my jar. Yeah. So that's jar. Your jar joy. Yeah. Allie, what's your jar joy?

15:14.100 --> 15:19.140
I haven't seen. I haven't really been interacting with a lot of jars lately.

15:19.460 --> 15:27.300
Uh, I don't, I don't know. I guess just I've been making my whole, I don't know.

15:31.460 --> 15:34.180
That's fair. You don't need to have an answer. I guess just uh,

15:34.820 --> 15:40.660
we're going to make it around robin of sorts. I appreciate you asking and checking in. What about

15:41.620 --> 15:46.340
a favorite condiment? Well, that comes in a jar. That's completely different than jar joy.

15:46.340 --> 15:51.460
Unless you're jar joy is this condiment. So let's maybe not redirect the whole fucking round

15:51.460 --> 15:58.340
table until everyone's got a chance. I was just kidding. I, I just keep thinking of jar joy,

15:58.340 --> 16:05.140
jar jar banks. That's just new. Yeah. Jar joy banks. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like that's it. That's his sister.

16:05.700 --> 16:14.100
Okay. Jar jar banks. It's jar joy banks. Oh, hell out.

16:16.180 --> 16:20.420
Oh, who invited jar joy with the ED jar.

16:21.300 --> 16:27.940
Yeah. I also like to think of it as like a cake in a tin, but on top of a roof. So it's a jar

16:28.020 --> 16:34.420
joyle. Oh, God. What, Brad, you're even having an answer for your jar joy.

16:34.420 --> 16:38.020
Last week I asked you if you would found your beach and you didn't have an answer for that.

16:38.020 --> 16:43.220
You yes, I did. Really? You haven't asked me yet today and I answered you last week. What's your jar

16:43.220 --> 16:48.420
joy? I've been experimenting with pickling a lot. I pickled an avocado.

16:49.220 --> 16:55.700
Yeah. It's real. No, it's a real thing. It's actually pretty good on a sandwich. Pickled avocado.

16:55.700 --> 17:01.140
Was it? Is the catchest and see the same on a sandwich? Does it stay creamy, my friends?

17:04.260 --> 17:10.980
What? I can ask if a pickled avocado stays creamy, my friend. My pickling. My friend's

17:10.980 --> 17:16.580
part of it, but basically credit tore. How are you on a sandwich?

17:18.100 --> 17:23.300
Yeah, we got the sandwich. For sure. How are you, my friend? The jar.

17:24.260 --> 17:27.620
How am I putting it in the jar? Slices. Is it hot?

17:27.620 --> 17:31.940
Oil, oil, oil. A lot of avocado. Cram is on.

17:33.460 --> 17:40.980
Get a bigger jar if you have to cram it in there. You've got to really mush it in there and then it's good on a sandwich.

17:43.220 --> 17:49.140
That's what I get. Yeah, there's never any question or another. Yeah, put some seasoning in there.

17:49.540 --> 17:53.060
Yeah, on the sandwich I mean on the sandwich. Yeah.

17:53.540 --> 18:00.820
What are you pickling the avocado with? Like what's your vinegar spice combo? Great question.

18:01.940 --> 18:08.420
Well, distilled white. Okay. On a sandwich. That's when I wanted

18:09.860 --> 18:16.580
Walter White's daughter to be named. Distilled. Yeah. That's actually

18:16.580 --> 18:20.660
jar jar binks his sister's name. Distilled on white binks.

18:24.660 --> 18:29.620
Binks. And yeah, she's kind of a minks.

18:31.780 --> 18:36.260
Speaking of, how do you guys stay sex ready? You didn't ask me about my jar joy.

18:38.100 --> 18:43.860
Buy your jar joy. I had a pretty good answer.

18:44.340 --> 18:51.380
So, so say it. That was your chance. Well, I don't know if you're going to move on entirely or

18:52.180 --> 18:57.300
we were done with the segment. Just don't worry about the structure. Just say it if you have one.

18:58.180 --> 19:06.100
Lingers, Matsubal soup gets delivered to you in a ball jar. Does it

19:06.420 --> 19:14.420
creamy my friend? No, that's so creamy. It stays salty. There's a nice ball some egg noodles,

19:14.980 --> 19:21.620
broth, and that's it. That's a good answer. That is a really good answer actually.

19:21.620 --> 19:28.900
It's a fantastic answer. Yeah. You okay? A ball jar.

19:29.220 --> 19:44.740
Binks. How do you guys stay sex ready? Like how do you like, you know, stay ready to just kind

19:44.740 --> 19:50.420
of be there with not only emotionally but physically, like how do you stay ready to sort of swing that

19:50.420 --> 19:57.300
thing, have liquid hips, and like, you know, you also got to make sure that your lips aren't

19:57.380 --> 19:59.060
chapped. And by that, I mean, all four.

20:10.660 --> 20:18.500
According to Silicon Valley.com, time flies when you're drinking good beer in San Jose.

20:20.260 --> 20:27.220
Thoughts. I've been to San Jose. I don't know. It just, they

20:27.540 --> 20:30.980
was the headline. Time flies when you're drinking good beer in San Jose.

20:32.660 --> 20:38.260
Did you like San Jose a year? I mean, it's nice. It's a fairly big bay area city. I wouldn't say

20:38.260 --> 20:41.300
it's super special, and I don't really like beer, so I disagree with the headline.

20:43.300 --> 20:48.180
You know, in my head, I was just confusing. Yeah, so straight to commercial.

20:50.180 --> 20:53.460
Our next sponsor is a product that I use literally every day, and that's AG1 by athletic

20:53.540 --> 20:57.380
greens, right? I used to take a bunch of different pills and supplements to look out for my health,

20:57.380 --> 21:02.180
but now I get it all from an all-in-one nutritional insurance, which is athletic greens. All right. It's

21:02.180 --> 21:08.500
just one scoop in a cup of water every day. I wake up, get out of bed, put some water in my stomach.

21:08.500 --> 21:12.180
All right, and then I do the AG1, and then I have my cold brew, and I'm off to the races, right?

21:12.180 --> 21:16.020
The rat races, and honestly, the horse races, which I've lost a lot of money yet.

21:16.740 --> 21:20.900
It's hard for me to keep up with a supplement routine. Like I said, it was expensive. It was

21:20.900 --> 21:26.420
cumbersome, and now you can get it all from one delicious scoop of athletic greens. All right.

21:26.420 --> 21:30.340

22:04.900 --> 22:32.100
All of the rice. All of the rice ruin the rice in here, baby. Extra jar, and I want y'all,

22:32.100 --> 22:39.380
the skulls, soy. Burn up the rice in here, baby. You know about grains, once you're to drink poison

22:39.380 --> 22:47.860
sauce, once you're to char all of the grains. Dark jar, rice and jars, all of the rice, all of the

22:47.940 --> 23:00.180
rice. Until it's beeny on, where we are, all of the rice. Sooooooooooooo! If you want rice, you can spill

23:00.180 --> 23:10.500
poison all over the sand. If you eat grains, you will ruin the rest of your life, something wrong.

23:10.500 --> 23:19.380
My stomach churns. I cooked the rice, but it didn't burn. I ate the rice. She called the best. I did

23:19.380 --> 23:27.460
that time and ate that bread. I'm just kidding, it wasn't bread. It was ancient grains,

23:27.460 --> 23:33.620
slathered and soy. To my surprise, consistency of sand, I had to take rice to that

23:33.620 --> 23:40.340
ghetto university rice. White rice, brown rice, fried rice, black rice, sticky rice,

23:40.340 --> 23:46.740
all of the rice, all of the grains. Jasmine, bomba, parboiled, long grain, arms,

23:46.740 --> 23:54.580
be all of the rice. Some rice in here, baby. Extra soy, I want y'all, the skulls sand.

23:54.580 --> 24:00.900
Scoop up the jar and rice, baby. You know about grains, once you're to hoes, always in sauce,

24:00.900 --> 24:18.180
and watch you to charle the grains. I think the fascinating thing about that album that you're

24:18.180 --> 24:27.220
now putting together, so that no album always has the same lyrics. I loved that you couldn't find

24:27.220 --> 24:34.100
just a backing track and we just cure the actual song in the background. And that bars, by the way,

24:34.100 --> 24:44.980
bars, chargers, chargers, chargers. I want to feature on one of those. If you wouldn't let me,

24:44.980 --> 24:50.100
if you wouldn't mind letting me do a verse. No, that's that. That would be absolutely great. I mean,

24:50.260 --> 24:58.740
how much is it? Absolutely great. Yeah. I'll do it pro bono. I'll do it pro bono.

25:00.740 --> 25:09.060
YouTube parody, which is free as long as you pay me as good as bono. Do you guys have any notes?

25:10.740 --> 25:19.460
Not a one. It was perfect. Really. I love the four. I love that. And I'm prompt to performance.

25:19.460 --> 25:32.340
You're like, pretty on beat, um, lyricism is like classic. Yeah, you hit all the notes. You hit the

25:32.340 --> 25:38.820
consistency of sand. There was an arms B reference in there, I believe. And sing great. It's been

25:38.820 --> 25:44.340
really insane. Yeah. Jar. Yeah. Do you guys have any questions about the lyrics? Because there

25:44.420 --> 25:50.260
anything you couldn't hear? I couldn't hear a lot of it. Yeah. It's here again. Let's get a

25:50.260 --> 25:56.420
report thing. Or do you just want to hear me speak? I want to. I do have a question about, I like the,

25:56.420 --> 26:04.020
the verse that listed all of the grains. Yeah. Yeah. Like I liked, I liked when you got to the all

26:04.020 --> 26:10.900
of the grains or all of the rice part of the song. But I felt like that wasn't repeated as the chorus.

26:11.780 --> 26:22.020
In terms of all of the grains. Like all of the grains. Yeah. All of the grains and all of

26:22.020 --> 26:29.860
the rice. Okay. Well, you're wrong. Sorry to be like aggressive, but it's actually rice, white rice,

26:29.860 --> 26:36.820
brown rice, fried rice, black rice, sticky rice, all of the rice, all of the grains. Jasmine,

26:36.820 --> 26:43.860
bomba, parboiled, long grain, arms be all of the rice. And then it's ruined some rice in here, baby.

26:43.860 --> 26:50.980
Extra soy, I want y'all to scald sand. Scoop up the child in rice, baby. You know about grains,

26:50.980 --> 26:57.860
wants you to house hoisin sauce, wants you to char all of the grains. We're forever. I also, I feel like

26:57.860 --> 27:04.340
all of ending that for ending that with all of the grains instead of all of the rice.

27:05.220 --> 27:13.140
What was the choice behind that? It's the first one also ended with all of the grains. So that is a

27:13.540 --> 27:19.940
rep, that's like a right, but the corrects of the regular song are all of short lights. But sometimes

27:19.940 --> 27:26.260
live the rice, all of the grains. Sometimes the dissonance is a good thing. Yeah. Sometimes

27:28.020 --> 27:34.260
are you wanting more asonants in the consonants or is the dissonance not resonant with your

27:34.420 --> 27:42.740
ass? What's your stance on the resonance? The dissonance doesn't resonate. Okay.

27:44.340 --> 27:49.780
I mean, in time it will. I thought it was perfect. You got, you have no notes from Brad.

27:49.780 --> 27:54.660
Alley, you said that you were just happy that it's back. Do you have any notes? They've been so long

27:54.660 --> 27:59.300
since no notes, they've been so long since something new has happened to me and this was new.

27:59.700 --> 28:05.460
Can we just speak through these lyrics and then I'll see if you guys have any last minute notes?

28:06.100 --> 28:09.460
I would love to hear. It's all of the rice, all of the rice.

28:09.460 --> 28:16.180
Rice, rice, all of the rice. Ruin the rice in here, baby. Extra chart. I want y'all to scold soy.

28:16.740 --> 28:21.620
Burn up the rice in here, baby. You know about grains. Want you to drink poison sauce. Want you to

28:21.700 --> 28:27.860
char all of the grains. Dark char, rice and jars, all of the rice, all of the rice.

28:27.860 --> 28:36.260
Until it's Benny Hanna, where we are, all of the rice. So, oh, boy. If you want rice, you can spill

28:36.260 --> 28:42.580
hoisin all over the sand. Yeah. Right. That doesn't make sense. Well, sorry. What's the one that stuck out

28:42.580 --> 28:47.700
to me? What do you mean? What's wrong with that? Poison sauce is like a thick plum sauce, right?

28:47.700 --> 28:52.820
So, you spilled out on sand. That's not even close. If you want rice, you can spill hoisin on sand.

28:53.380 --> 28:59.860
That's I think. I think that line would kind of like flow better if yeah. Because the actual

28:59.860 --> 29:03.860
line is if you want it, you could get it for the rest of your life. Something like you could get it

29:03.860 --> 29:10.180
for the rest of your rice. Something like that ending it with rice. If you want rice, you can spill

29:10.340 --> 29:21.140
hoisin all over the sand. That's better. Yeah. Same. It's also not what I said, but if you eat

29:21.140 --> 29:30.420
grains, you can ruin the rest of your rice. If you want grains, you will ruin the rest of your life.

29:30.900 --> 29:37.620
Hmm. Something wrong. My stomach churns. I cooked the rice, but it didn't burn.

29:38.420 --> 29:45.220
I ate the rice. She called the feds. I did that time and ate that bread. I'm just kidding. It was

29:45.220 --> 29:51.300
in bread. It was ancient grain. I do live in a song where they're like just kidding. Yeah.

29:52.500 --> 29:59.460
It was ancient grains slathered and soy to my surprise consistency of sand. I had to take

29:59.540 --> 30:06.980
rice to that ghetto university. Yeah, that part kind of didn't flow. Rice, white rice, brown rice,

30:06.980 --> 30:10.980
fried rice, black rice, sticky rice, all of the rice, all of the grains. Jazz with the wrong part.

30:13.460 --> 30:21.620
I agree. Jasmine, bomba, parboiled, long grain, arms, be all of the rice. So I have a question about

30:21.700 --> 30:29.940
that list. Bomba. Yeah. I believe it's like, I believe it's um,

30:32.420 --> 30:44.180
it's like that yellow rice. Bomba. Bomba rice. Yeah. I see it as a type. I guess

30:44.340 --> 30:50.740
in high A, right? Yeah. That kind of saffron. Exactly. Right. Yeah. Ruined some rice in here, baby.

30:50.740 --> 30:54.820
Extra soy. I want y'all to. So I need to do these back to back so you can hear the differences.

30:54.820 --> 30:59.780
The first one is Ruined some rice in here, baby. Extra charred. I want y'all to scold soy.

30:59.780 --> 31:04.020
Burn up the rice in here, baby. You know about grains. I want you to drink poison sauce.

31:04.020 --> 31:09.220
I want you to charl of the grains. Second one is Ruined some rice in here, baby.

31:09.860 --> 31:17.060
Extra soy. I want y'all to scold soy. Scoop up the char in rice, baby. You know about grains.

31:17.060 --> 31:20.740
I want you to house poison sauce. I want you to charl of the grains.

31:26.740 --> 31:33.380
I do think it's interesting then. Your list of rice. It's all kind of rice except for parboiled

31:34.260 --> 31:40.580
and all the speed. Yeah. And also a restaurant that doesn't exist anymore, right? All right. All right.

31:40.580 --> 31:48.340
All right. I'm sorry to get sensitive because you guys are having notes. Also, I feel was a lyric earlier

31:48.340 --> 31:55.860
in the song, Rice and Jar. Because the char. Rice and Jar. So I feel like we should start a business

31:55.860 --> 32:04.900
called Rice and Jar. And it's Mason Jar's of Rice. Yeah. Bulls. Okay. Jar. So in we could call it,

32:04.900 --> 32:11.940
what was it? Ice and Jar joy. Jar joy. Or maybe it was Jar joy. It was Jar joy.

32:12.900 --> 32:16.180
Joy. Joy. Joy. Joy. Joy. Joy. Joy. Joy. Joy. Joy. Joy. Joy. It's joy. It's joy. It's joy. It's joy.

32:17.060 --> 32:23.620
Because it's a one by one. But it's jar. It's not. It's jarred. I'm trying to put together a

32:23.620 --> 32:27.380
fucking album. All right. The last thing I need to be worrying about is a business venture

32:27.380 --> 32:31.700
separate from all of that. Unless it's going to be a marketing like Papa. Are you saying it's a virtual

32:31.700 --> 32:38.420
brand like when a fucking what's his name? Another wing DJ Khaled. Yeah. If it's that, I'm in, but I don't

32:38.420 --> 32:42.580
want to do any work for it. That's going to be a marketing play on your ass. What I have to focus on is

32:42.660 --> 32:49.380
the lyrics, the beats, the mastering, the mixing recording in that room. Yeah. We have to move on.

32:58.660 --> 33:05.140
According to CNBC, you shouldn't ask how are you? You should ask these eight questions instead.

33:05.140 --> 33:11.540
So this was an article, uh, at least by CNBC this morning. And I wanted to ask y'all these eight

33:11.620 --> 33:16.580
questions and see what your response was. So basically the article argues that you shouldn't just

33:16.580 --> 33:20.420
ask people, how are you? Because nobody ever gives a real answer to that. But they might give a

33:20.420 --> 33:27.940
real answer to these. Let's start the first one. How are you really? That's just the final one.

33:27.940 --> 33:33.060
Or you go straight to that first one. Hey, how are you really? That's the first one. It's

33:33.060 --> 33:45.460
hey, how are you really? I'm really fine. Really. That's fine. Brad, you're asking me how I am really.

33:45.460 --> 33:50.740
How are you really? I thought what your shirt says actually? Yeah. Hi. How are you? Yeah.

33:50.740 --> 33:58.900
Really. Really. I think I would answer that the same way that I would answer. How are you? Which is fine.

33:59.540 --> 34:14.100
Marika, how are you really? Fine. Allie? How are you? You're really? How? How are you really?

34:15.940 --> 34:23.460
I'd be like, really? You want to know? All right. That was sort of a flop. Maybe a CNBC should have

34:23.620 --> 34:28.980
ran it by the editors one last time. Here's the second one. These are real, by the way. I didn't

34:28.980 --> 34:34.180
make these up. This is from the article. This is the second one. How are you doing right now?

34:38.180 --> 34:43.140
They're they're telling you in this article that you're supposed to ask these in succession.

34:44.580 --> 34:49.780
No, I think they're all alt. Okay. How are you doing right now?

34:50.660 --> 34:57.460
Where are you going? Fine. Brad, how are you doing right now?

34:58.420 --> 35:03.300
Also, also fine, man. Allie? How are you doing right now?

35:05.300 --> 35:10.500
Hey. Oh, mirror. How are you doing right now? How are we not CNBC?

35:11.700 --> 35:17.060
Yeah, it's funny. It's I like this. It's fun to be here. I'm happy.

35:17.620 --> 35:22.500
Here's the third one. What's been on your mind lately?

35:26.580 --> 35:33.460
That's like such a getting. Yeah, it's getting a little bit. What's been on your mind lately?

35:38.580 --> 35:43.060
Anyone? Brad's shirt is basically these questions. That's funny.

35:44.020 --> 35:50.420
It's cool down. Hi, how are you? I've been thinking a lot.

35:53.460 --> 36:01.220
I was being carried into outer space. I flowed away and cutting that out. That exchange wasn't funny.

36:01.220 --> 36:10.180
What the fuck is wrong? Sorry. How are you? I'm not sorry. Cannot sleep. I cannot be tonight.

36:10.180 --> 36:18.820
I cannot sleep. I cannot burn the rice. Hey, don't burn your rice. It's so hard.

36:18.820 --> 36:25.540
I'm just being hoisin' inside of the jar. Just for next season.

36:25.540 --> 36:30.500
It's a little teaser for next season. That was really good. Don't waste your rice on the

36:31.060 --> 36:47.140
jar already. It's joy inside my jar. How are I? I'm so sorry, etc. What's been on your mind lately?

36:47.140 --> 36:49.620
Do you guys want to pass? There's a couple more that we have to get to.

36:52.100 --> 36:55.860
Is there anything on your mind lately? Yeah, actually.

36:56.100 --> 37:06.900
I'm not at liberty to talk about it on this forum. I guess you use vague sort of references

37:06.900 --> 37:10.740
to it so that when it does happen or become public, we'll be like, oh, that's what he was

37:10.740 --> 37:17.940
alluding to. I had a big professional opportunity happen yesterday and I'm really hoping that by the time

37:17.940 --> 37:25.620
this episode comes out, there's some news around that. Is it like an audition? It's time for a

37:25.620 --> 37:33.060
James Braun. That's brown bond. Actually, that could be funny. James Brown as Bond.

37:33.940 --> 37:46.020
So it's like, dead. Get up! And the bad guy is like, when do you think you'll hear about the

37:46.020 --> 37:51.380
huge opportunity? I think in the next week, these things move fast.

37:51.780 --> 38:00.660
Like acting, writing, directing, which genre of creativity are we talking? Poetry,

38:00.660 --> 38:11.460
Poesy, heresy, you're up for a heresy job. If you were being completely honest with me,

38:12.180 --> 38:14.180
how would you describe your feelings lately?

38:14.180 --> 38:27.940
Yes, it was just a way to say how are you? That's really probing. What's feeling good? And what's

38:27.940 --> 38:36.020
feeling hard? That's what she said. Nice. Nice. That's kind of inappropriate.

38:36.580 --> 38:40.900
All right, that's what I meant. Oh, sorry. Are you still sick, Jeff?

38:42.420 --> 38:47.300
I'm, I, no, I wouldn't say I'm sick today. I'm still a little congested, but not sick.

38:47.940 --> 38:53.700
You had like a cold or something? I had a non-COVID flu game.

38:55.620 --> 39:00.580
And you think it's not COVID because you tested ones, tested every day, or just didn't feel like it was

39:00.580 --> 39:10.180
COVID. I tested once twice, three times, no COVID. That's a Commodore's reference.

39:11.620 --> 39:16.980
The last time we talked, you were dealing with insert problem. How has that been lately? So,

39:16.980 --> 39:24.980
I, I tailored these to y'all. America, the last time we talked, you were dealing with not getting

39:24.980 --> 39:34.660
into see every Broadway musical ever. How has that been lately? You know, it's rough, but I'm

39:34.660 --> 39:39.540
powering through. Allie, last time we talked, you were, you were dealing with matters of the heart.

39:40.420 --> 39:45.140
How has that been feeling lately? Better. Thank you.

39:48.020 --> 39:52.740
Brad, last time we talked, you were dealing with me ghosting your ass. How has that been lately?

39:55.140 --> 39:58.900
I mean, I haven't forgiven you. That's what you're asking.

40:00.980 --> 40:05.300
I'm here. Last time we talked, you were dealing with COVID induced directile dysfunction.

40:11.300 --> 40:13.540
Not hard, right? Nice.

40:25.940 --> 40:31.220
Plugs. Let's get to our weekend. What do you guys have going on? What do you want to point to people towards?

40:32.500 --> 40:33.220
Let's start with Allie.

40:34.900 --> 40:41.940
We're going to have our next Allie, based how come happy hours show on May 11th at the Dynasty Type

40:41.940 --> 40:49.060
Raider, which is very exciting. And besides that, you can follow me on Instagram at LACon

40:49.060 --> 40:54.900
and at Letterbox and Twitter and my Venmo. By my sandwich.

40:57.300 --> 41:00.420
That sounds good. Does anybody sent you any cash on Venmo?

41:01.220 --> 41:06.340
Yeah, enough to buy a sandwich from this show. Is that legal? I want to know the

41:06.340 --> 41:11.460
legality of that. Can I just solicit cash? Sure. I don't know. Actually, you guys said it was okay,

41:11.460 --> 41:16.660
so I kind of just did it. Why would that be illegal, Bradder?

41:19.460 --> 41:22.100
Bradder human on Instagram and also Venmo.

41:26.500 --> 41:32.580
Venmo. Allie DashCon. What do we think? Yeah. And that's K-8.

41:32.580 --> 41:37.220
Let's see if we can get Allie $250 this week. How's that for a sandwich?

41:37.220 --> 41:44.020
If every listener of the show Venmo, you would be able to buy the richest person in this

41:44.100 --> 41:52.260
fucking Zoom by a lot. Are you okay? You should be the richest one. Exactly.

41:52.260 --> 41:58.100
Right. Compounding interest. Your courties. Yeah. I've had the most time to amass wealth and it's a

41:58.100 --> 42:08.340
mouse to nothing. It's a mouse to nothing. Yeah, as then I started with a mountain and made it a

42:08.340 --> 42:23.140
molehill. I basically put my entire net worth and my whole Amirussy into the F-T-A-Risk lower

42:23.140 --> 42:33.140
word stock portfolio. I did not diversify your honor. I invested in my dog pile mail before they

42:33.140 --> 42:45.460
went IPO. Or should I say, I peed. Oh. I peed out my cash out of my cash. I'll be telling her otherwise.

42:46.420 --> 42:59.220
I don't know what's wrong with me. Very good. Venmo Allie and follow me at Marie Gailon on Instagram,

42:59.220 --> 43:07.460

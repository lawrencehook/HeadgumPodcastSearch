00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
There it is again, right? The fucking balloons?

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
I think it's like a little bit.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
I think when I put up two peace signs, things happen.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You guys should try it.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
It's like a zoom thing.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
But I didn't turn it on.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
I thought it was standard.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
If you guys don't do this, I can't hear anything.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Can't hear me.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Hello?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I can hear anything.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Not really.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
By that time it was doing something crazy.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Did you guys see the balloons?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yeah.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Wait, Jeff.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Just like that.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Does it happen on yours?

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
The thumbs up starts to load.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
No, you have to hold it for like three seconds.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
That's a quality podcasting.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
No.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Nothing.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I really wanted Will to be like,

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
and you get shot.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
No, not like that.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
No, that's not it.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
That can't be it.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Will?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
For sure.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
There's only your second appearance, right?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
See? Yeah.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
People love you on the first one.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Sorry.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
People love you on the first one.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
They've been begging for your return.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
But you could disappoint them on the second go around.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
You might not get a third, right?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
But really if they're disappointed,

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
and I don't come back,

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
it wouldn't be a huge problem for me.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
And I have to write it down.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Yeah, like this.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
This showed us.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
No, not like this showed us.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
You don't know Will.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
You don't know Will.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Like Brad and I know Will.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Is that true?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Will.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Is that.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
I don't know.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
He's not.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
He's not denying it.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
You're not.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
I can't.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
I would.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Yeah.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Brad.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Maybe Jeff.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
There's no way.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Smile.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Smile.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Now we're fucking talking.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
All right.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Look how he really smiles.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Smile.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
I've never let you go.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Everyone just smile.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Then we looked great.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Then we looked happy.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Then we looked.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Borderline.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Chappy.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Like we're all chams.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Chams.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Chams.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Chams.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Chams.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Chams.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Okay.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Colorado or Colorado.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Are you in Utah?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Do.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Baby.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
No.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Go into that.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Don't.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Calm down.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
I'm going to Utah later.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
When.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Right after this.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I stayed in town for this record.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Fish.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
That doesn't seem worth it.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
And that's not my fault for asking you to do.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
I was.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
I was.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
You don't have the negative.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Sorry.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
I don't have the negative.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
No.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Sorry.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
One second.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Really?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Me too.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
And I'm regretting it.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Really?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
A little bit.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
But we'll see you.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
So I'm happy.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I'm happy to be here guys.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Thanks.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Thank you.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Right.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Are you happy to be here?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Are you happy to be here?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Are you happy to be here?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
I.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Yeah.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
I'm happy.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm not as happy as.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
It seems like you are artificially.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
But it's been fun so far.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Well, let's talk about it.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
AI.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Right.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Artificial intelligence.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
What about our AJ.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Artificial joy.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Is it still being joy?

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
If it's artificial as it's still getting wise.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
If you're using chat GPT.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Last time I was on it was chat GPGFBT.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Chat.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Chat.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Has it come back?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
I haven't.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
I mean, maybe every time you're on the show, we'll do chat.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Jeff PT.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
We could do that later if you want.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
But just know that if it goes sour, it's going to be like, yeah.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
What's that?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
It's not about what I want.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Stay tuned or day two.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
I said stay tuned.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Okay.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
And you don't know what to say.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Day two.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Day two.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Boy.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Yeah.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Oh.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
This has to be some setting.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Yeah.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
All right.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
For me and nobody else.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
I'm using a special alpha version.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
It's only in here point.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
It's so fast.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
But first I wondered if it was triggered by just like zoom recognizing that the background is like a bad house.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
But that, you know, this is the office.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
So it's like, it could be you anywhere.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
And I wonder if it's, you know, really to the human.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Hmm.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Because like you didn't do any renovations when you moved in, right?

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
It was just kind of a white box, turn key, but not that interesting.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Uh, it was.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah, I didn't do many reservations.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Reservations.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
Oh, man.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Come on, dude.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
This is the low point of my life.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
It's awesome.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Are you guys all in your 20s?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
No.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Jeff and I are almost the same age.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Really?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I think Jeff, are you 26?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
What's that?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Are you 26 years old?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Pay attention.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
25.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
97.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
97, man.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
Yeah, it's old for sound, though.

05:46.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah, the soundboard's not coming through.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
If that was a soundboard bit, we can't hear the soundboard.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
You can't hear any of the soundboard.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
No.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Are you kidding me?

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
What number episode is this?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
It changes all the time.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
No, damn it.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Holy shit.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Oh my god.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I think it's that was a grab.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
He was heard.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
He was heard.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
He was heard.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
He was out.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
He was out.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
We heard the clap.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
There it is.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
Okay, because I've been playing a ton of stuff, including, I did, like, a song mashup just now.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Between careless whisper and bad day by Daniel Pewter.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Let's hear it.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Powder.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Powder, really?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Can you add about egg?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
I'm so hot.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Yeah.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
I'm so bad.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
You say you don't go, tell me don't lie.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
That's not really a mashup.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Yeah, it's.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
It's more of just playing two songs on top of it.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
What do you think a mashup is?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
That is a mashup.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Not really.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Yeah, mashup is usually a more cleverly interviewer.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Library, it's just wind.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.560
It's Ryan and this is B clever now. It's B joy. We were adding to the mantra of the show

07:04.560 --> 07:11.880
Did you did you hear the new ones that we added? It's B joy get wise and bellish faith and then there was a fourth one that I've already forgotten

07:12.880 --> 07:16.000
Faith the faith the faith the that's really good

07:22.240 --> 07:26.760
Let's get into some shit. Let's start with the fucking thing we have to do every episode

07:28.000 --> 07:34.880
Bond of the week. I'm going with Garrett light

07:36.640 --> 07:43.440
Who he's the sunglasses guy, right? So it's gonna be instead of James Bond. It'll be frames bond

07:48.080 --> 07:50.840
There's something there. No fuck you guys

07:50.840 --> 07:53.800
Just like it's a lot of effort into the shit every week

07:57.840 --> 08:03.560
Garrett light is you putting a lot of effort into this every week. Okay. Let's get yours

08:04.120 --> 08:07.960
Out of the way and then I have something I want to talk to you guys about he made a mash up

08:13.080 --> 08:16.120
Mine is David burn in a big old suit

08:17.080 --> 08:20.760
Time for James Bond to be wearing a big old suit

08:21.400 --> 08:25.840
Yeah, so it's insane. I want to mark you and he's shaken not stirred

08:25.920 --> 08:31.200
But his shoulders are like four feet wide. Yes, and he sounds like shown company

08:35.400 --> 08:40.080
Well, Kevin McCarthy that's good because he needs a drummer speaker

08:40.080 --> 08:42.080
And

08:42.440 --> 08:44.440
Curried a lot

08:44.440 --> 08:47.200
Group on you have the broccoli's gonna love him

08:48.080 --> 08:52.440
What did you just say the broccoli's they're gonna love us

08:53.160 --> 08:55.160
Susan or whatever yeah

08:55.160 --> 08:58.560
Is it no way broccoli that family they did

08:58.560 --> 09:03.640
Yeah, we created they're the erases of broccoli fortune. Do you get a

09:03.640 --> 09:09.440
A raise a jewel every time someone buys or makes broccoli if you invent a vegetable

09:09.720 --> 09:11.720
I think it's on every stock

09:14.320 --> 09:17.320
Stocks points on the problem

09:22.120 --> 09:24.120
Now we're somewhere

09:25.120 --> 09:28.000
That's really good Brad Bond of the week

09:28.000 --> 09:33.840
Fuck I already said who did you say I said David burn in a big suit. Oh, yes, sorry

09:33.840 --> 09:38.800
It's just indicative that it's already you right now. I'm in my heart. Oh, no, like

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
emotionally

09:42.000 --> 09:47.320
It's hard because I started it really tired and now I'm getting caffeinated

09:47.760 --> 09:52.800
That from Alfred recipe for success. It's not from Alfred. It's from Gogettom Tiger and

09:53.040 --> 09:57.840
I was I went there. We were supposed to meet there and you didn't show up remember?

09:57.840 --> 10:00.680
No, you didn't say let's meet there at 12 and then I didn't show up

10:00.680 --> 10:04.720
You said let's hang out on Saturday. I said I'm down and then I never thought it's not good

10:04.720 --> 10:07.520
It's not ideal, but it's not as bad as what you just made it sound like

10:10.080 --> 10:13.120
Yeah, where am I mentally now I'm getting pissed right?

10:14.400 --> 10:18.960
There's a real bullet point that I had I said let's talk about Brad's descent into madness slash failure

10:19.200 --> 10:21.200
So no bond of the week for me

10:22.800 --> 10:28.960
Chance I did not did that out of my chance you went back to Brad instead of me and then you moved on

10:31.200 --> 10:34.000
That segment I was trying to get you out of doing it the way

10:37.760 --> 10:39.760
We're here

10:49.760 --> 10:52.160
I'm here who's your fucking bond of the week man

10:52.400 --> 10:54.400
You don't deserve it now

10:56.080 --> 10:58.080
You skipped me

10:58.080 --> 11:02.560
That didn't bring it up so that you would circle back. I'm giving you a live note

11:05.920 --> 11:11.280
Is it a live note or are you you just didn't have one, but you want to have a big stink out of it. Yes, stink

11:11.920 --> 11:15.920
So Brad's descent into madness slash failure. I have one out of fear and just did

11:17.280 --> 11:20.160
Now that I had a beat to think about it

11:21.120 --> 11:26.880
You could have had to think about it before we moved on, obviously you kind of dig dug your heels in you said

11:26.880 --> 11:30.880
I don't have one now. I kind of don't even want to tell you what it is

11:31.200 --> 11:33.200
You don't have one

11:33.200 --> 11:35.200
I do now

11:35.200 --> 11:37.200
So let's fucking hear it

11:37.600 --> 11:39.600
Don't even let her not tell you

11:39.600 --> 11:41.600
I don't care

11:41.600 --> 11:43.600
The segments bad

11:43.600 --> 11:46.480
It was fun when they were talking about bond

11:46.960 --> 11:48.960
You know Daniel Craig's exit

11:49.600 --> 11:52.880
Now it's been a year and a half nobody gives a shit, right?

11:53.520 --> 11:58.080
It's not fun. It's not fun whether you say it, but you know what we have to see it through

11:58.560 --> 12:00.560
Otherwise the whole thing is worse

12:01.040 --> 12:03.040
It's damaged control

12:03.440 --> 12:06.560
We could like come back to it like after the break or something

12:07.600 --> 12:09.600
Or the week

12:09.600 --> 12:15.440
Interesting just completely switch it up. I mean my would probably work for both just because it's a person

12:16.000 --> 12:17.760
Okay, well, what about crews of the Tom?

12:18.240 --> 12:23.440
What's that? So who's gonna be the next Tom crews in mission impossible the white crews of the Tom?

12:24.080 --> 12:27.920
Can we just like let some shit happen the way it happens?

12:27.920 --> 12:30.320
Audibly the national test

12:31.680 --> 12:34.320
This was going to happen today and it happens

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Wow

12:38.000 --> 12:43.120
Every funny if it was it was international test, but it was they're supposed to be in an international test

12:43.200 --> 12:47.680
But then the notification pops up on your phone and it's clear that I've kidnaps a child

12:49.200 --> 12:56.000
Set a nuclear bomb in Hawaii and nobody is just always attention to man five eleven thin ankles

13:00.160 --> 13:02.160
Breven

13:02.160 --> 13:03.200
night

13:03.200 --> 13:05.200
Who is that?

13:05.200 --> 13:10.880
Breven night? Yeah, the only name that's been said new bond

13:13.280 --> 13:19.840
Oh, he was on the calves. Yeah, he was on the calves. I'm surprised. He didn't know slush care. I wasn't alive when he was

13:20.560 --> 13:24.720
Went to stand for that matters. It doesn't all right

13:26.560 --> 13:30.800
Well, you've moved to the at the big apple. We're not doing Brad's descent

13:32.880 --> 13:34.880
We can skip that

13:34.880 --> 13:38.640
No, you're right. Let's talk about Brad's descent into madness slash gladness slash yeah

13:39.840 --> 13:41.360
Having a Brad day

13:41.440 --> 13:43.440
Getting points on the Brad end

13:43.440 --> 13:46.800
What do you think about like a PTI style rundown of the show?

13:48.320 --> 13:49.440
PTI?

13:49.440 --> 13:51.440
Pay time in the interruption

13:53.440 --> 13:55.440
Next next next

13:56.000 --> 14:00.480
Oh, you mean like there's like the tracker thing yeah, and you see what's going to come up next

14:00.880 --> 14:05.920
Yeah, we could do that. It's just I'd have to figure out how to do that organically in the zoom on the day in the room

14:06.800 --> 14:12.960
Because otherwise it would just be for people watching the end products which kind of isn't is interesting

14:12.960 --> 14:18.640
Oh, I could give you guys like an itinerary going into it. Yeah, just part of it. Sorry. Not yeah, just let me finish

14:19.200 --> 14:24.240
Part of it is like the element of surprise part of it is like you guys not knowing what's gonna happen

14:24.240 --> 14:28.160
I'm a spoke earlier and everyone laughed at me and then you said something stupid

14:28.160 --> 14:35.120
He said could you not pick a part everything I say? So which one is it? Do we laugh at people that make mistakes or do we not pick a part

14:35.120 --> 14:39.440
Whatever they say or is it more of a double standard? I think there's like a perfect middle ground

14:39.440 --> 14:44.640
Where we're like letting shit happen as it's supposed to organically and we're also like comedically

14:44.960 --> 14:51.680
For comic effect being oh shit will set something crazy, you know? Yeah, but there's a difference between that and like tearing

14:51.680 --> 14:56.240
Some one apart like lighting them ablaze at the stake. Yeah, you also made fun of my house

14:58.080 --> 15:03.440
It makes just a bite. You're not gonna do the value. No, Brad's house is good, but you're a rental bread

15:03.920 --> 15:05.920
No, I own the house

15:07.200 --> 15:10.560
We might have a whole lot of it. We might have to start talking about how like

15:11.440 --> 15:13.440
Because you didn't move in and do a lot of renovations

15:13.440 --> 15:16.160
Huh, I actually do sense of the renovations

15:16.160 --> 15:20.160
I'm gonna try to figure out how you add, right? So like you know the number one

15:20.160 --> 15:24.320
Yeah, I'm gonna build some personal finances for y'all

15:25.040 --> 15:27.040
I thought I build wealth for you

15:27.920 --> 15:30.800
That don't need you to do that. What does that have to do with the renovation

15:31.760 --> 15:38.160
Because we're talking about Brad's descent into madness slash failure and let me tell you what a failure could be

15:38.720 --> 15:40.720
It could be being in a market like

15:42.320 --> 15:44.320
Sorry, I'll leave that

15:46.960 --> 15:48.960
No, you can't just cut your mistakes

15:49.440 --> 15:51.440
You have to do this

15:55.600 --> 15:59.600
In a market like Los Angeles in a market like Portland, right? These aren't

16:00.240 --> 16:05.920
All what constantly appreciating housing markets and so if you don't maximize that

16:05.920 --> 16:09.520
Brad tensile that a mere tensile if you don't end

16:10.640 --> 16:15.920
500 grand higher than what you bought in that that's a fucking failure on Brad's part

16:16.320 --> 16:21.120
Points on the Brad end. I don't think so because guess what inflation outpaste your ass

16:21.680 --> 16:26.720
Right, what are the value ads for the house of Brad's right?

16:27.440 --> 16:31.760
Square footage extra square footage retiling the bathroom

16:32.160 --> 16:35.760
Right picking out a fucking grout. Are we

16:36.320 --> 16:43.600
prelaying the tiles Brad are we buying and sheets where these hex tiles are just so

16:43.680 --> 16:47.120
And all you need is the fucking sheets of grout

16:49.120 --> 16:53.520
So this is this is so bad stop talking

17:02.720 --> 17:06.080
Brad, which was how long I could talk at you until you broke

17:11.200 --> 17:13.200
This is an interesting to you guys

17:13.600 --> 17:15.600
You just about yelling out

17:16.800 --> 17:22.480
You have not just you can own a home and not add any Brad you can know but like oh, I added Brad

17:29.040 --> 17:33.520
Did you do any work whatsoever Brad on the house? Yeah quite a bit yeah really what you do

17:34.080 --> 17:36.080
He luck sorry. I'm sorry to ask but he luck

17:36.960 --> 17:39.520
He lock home equity line of credit in terms

17:43.600 --> 17:47.920
No, this is not a half conversations of art. I live in a studio

17:49.120 --> 17:57.040
Yeah, you're honest about this shit because yeah if you buy into with a partner, maybe you know if you get the house for the right price right interest rate

17:57.760 --> 17:59.760
Maybe it's possible

17:59.760 --> 18:01.760
You bring it up alone

18:02.400 --> 18:06.400
You're a lot of renovations

18:07.840 --> 18:09.840
You said a lot I

18:09.840 --> 18:11.840
paid cash. I

18:11.840 --> 18:17.280
Got to figure out how to save money more because Brad seems to be like rolling in it and he has the CRT in the background

18:17.280 --> 18:20.640
He has like the trips to Colorado don't which is also known as Utah and

18:21.680 --> 18:26.160
You know will sitting here. He's beside himself. He's befuddled. He's been used. He's loving it

18:26.880 --> 18:28.880
He's glowing really

18:28.880 --> 18:30.880
It's really a rental

18:31.680 --> 18:36.000
Yeah, I'm in the office today. It'd be really

18:36.560 --> 18:39.680
Cute if I hung up pictures like of a mirror in a live show

18:42.960 --> 18:48.720
I'll send you some yeah, I did for a second forget you were in the office and I was like wow

18:48.720 --> 18:52.160
Will some sex with head go my home printer

18:53.200 --> 18:55.200
It's home away from home

18:55.920 --> 18:58.640
I have it in one of our station a lot

18:59.600 --> 19:05.200
How did you find an apartment in New York how does that work now a day old? I mean I had an easy

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Old roommate had a room of ale

19:08.480 --> 19:10.480
So I just fill it in

19:10.480 --> 19:16.320
Slide into his that's the living rooms. That's the easiest and the street-est thing that you could have done

19:16.560 --> 19:20.960
Rather than looking on street easy the street easiest way to find an apartment is to have a friend

19:21.360 --> 19:26.240
That was the place it's house the place of apartment

19:27.040 --> 19:35.120
It's good. It's an adjustment. It's an adjustment. It's a strange toggle level. Yeah Chicago. I was up on top

19:36.960 --> 19:41.120
Covered in trees big daddy that I've been yeah, now

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
That big daddy you a

19:49.040 --> 19:55.040
Yeah, like it's got all yours out top floor. I be big daddy kind of thing. I'm sorry

19:55.040 --> 19:57.040
What was that?

19:57.040 --> 19:59.040
Sorry continue

19:59.440 --> 20:04.320
But it's an adjustment. I'm loving it though. There's so much going on here. You know

20:04.800 --> 20:08.480
Where are you in town? We'll bleep it up at just for my records. Don't tell him

20:09.760 --> 20:11.760
Does it help if I stop slow?

20:12.480 --> 20:14.480
No

20:14.480 --> 20:21.360
It's a pull it's like up. It's mortal is the M-stop, but then there's qualt skiers white golf

20:22.880 --> 20:24.880
Not quite cough

20:27.360 --> 20:30.640
Come on. It's like something that you guys do on this show all the time

20:35.280 --> 20:37.280
You guys

20:41.520 --> 20:43.520
I liked it well

20:44.320 --> 20:51.760
Like off with that I don't I don't think I heard what you said because there was like a zoom blip and that's not

20:51.760 --> 20:57.920
I think I'm gonna excuse I really was like I didn't know if you said a pun on why you don't need to give an excuse

21:04.880 --> 21:06.880
Um

21:07.520 --> 21:09.520
That hurt his ears

21:10.720 --> 21:12.880
We uh we have to take a break. We'll be right back

21:14.560 --> 21:20.400
Time to advertise a show that is I think hates women. Are you a millennial who misses what life was like in the

21:20.400 --> 21:26.160
2000s? Have you had a hard time finding new or curated music? Are you interested in multiple

21:26.160 --> 21:32.640
Perspectives on relationships and dating and are looking for hosts that offer a non-male bashing perspective

21:33.040 --> 21:36.000
But also a whole both sex is accountable

21:36.720 --> 21:43.440
Then you're gonna love see the thing is a podcast hosted by Grammy award-winning R&B artist Bridget Kelly and media

21:43.440 --> 21:46.000

The opinions on the show are real and they're brought to you by the genuine connections that the ladies have with the guests that they like to call their friends with benefits

22:08.640 --> 22:14.800

I have here written down at the time to talk about amir's never wasness

22:46.320 --> 22:48.320
So

22:50.320 --> 22:52.320
Basically

22:56.320 --> 23:04.680
Figure out where he went wrong in his career. Is that fair you said I never went right so according to never wasness

23:04.680 --> 23:11.960
No, I didn't say never went right. It's just that you never quite got there. There's a huge difference

23:12.120 --> 23:18.600
Right? Well, the difference between a has been and a never was is that it has been had something and lost it and

23:18.600 --> 23:25.560
A never was never had it at all. So which one do you think I am? I think you were on your way well on your way by the way

23:26.120 --> 23:33.640
And you fucked it all up and I want to know the exact moment where that happened. Are you ready? Sure

23:35.080 --> 23:37.080
I am on amir's IMDB

23:38.040 --> 23:46.280
We're gonna go in we're in chronological order from the beginning of your career according to the internet movie database

23:47.080 --> 23:48.360
This says

23:48.360 --> 23:53.400
That the first television appearance. Well, first of all, we should say that the first thing you ever did was chicken

23:53.400 --> 23:54.760
I'm here, right?

23:54.760 --> 23:56.760
That's one IMDB

23:57.160 --> 23:59.160
Yeah

23:59.160 --> 24:00.440
It was on IMDB

24:00.440 --> 24:01.400
It was a hit

24:01.400 --> 24:02.600
What can I say? I mean

24:02.600 --> 24:06.280
Enemy is one of the greatest web series of all-time probably of the early internet and

24:07.080 --> 24:10.840
You guys kind of struck this balance right between absurdity and groundedness

24:11.400 --> 24:17.240
That push and pull right Jake's like every man and you're like fucking dumbass shit

24:18.280 --> 24:20.280
I don't know I think a lot of people found it amazing

24:21.400 --> 24:23.400
Thank you

24:25.480 --> 24:27.480
It's good a commercial again

24:27.880 --> 24:29.160
I

24:29.160 --> 24:32.200
Have to stop saying we never do this because we do it a lot

24:49.880 --> 24:51.880
Um

24:51.880 --> 24:53.480
That movie came out when you guys were born

24:55.560 --> 24:57.080
Got me

I saw it a drive in theater

24:59.560 --> 25:01.560

25:02.760 --> 25:05.800
Fucking credit is Jake and Amir and again it was a hit

25:06.680 --> 25:08.680
Next thing I'm seeing

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
I'm going to

25:51.000 --> 25:55.080
Pop this up on screen share and we'll see if maybe this interview is what did you wrong

25:55.640 --> 25:57.640
There's that big side

25:59.640 --> 26:02.840
Come on next guest we'll stop at nothing to humiliate really we did it

26:03.640 --> 26:09.720
Yeah, let's see how that job and not someone like me the point is these guys have done terrible things to each other

26:09.720 --> 26:13.800
You can see their prank wars on the college human website and they're showing MTV's called prank

26:13.960 --> 26:16.600
Please welcome Amir Bloom and fell in streeter side out

26:21.080 --> 26:23.080
Right there, right?

26:23.080 --> 26:25.080
Let's talk about the outfit

26:27.640 --> 26:32.120
Under shirt tee shirt under shirt yeah button down oxford tucked into

26:33.240 --> 26:35.240
Selvish denim

26:35.240 --> 26:39.080
And sure it's sort of the same is what streeter was wearing

26:39.080 --> 26:46.520
This is streeter looks great. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is great. I mean, this is oh nine so yeah, it does feel that's what I'm saying for oh nine

26:46.520 --> 26:49.080
It's like streeter could wear that today and he would look good

26:49.160 --> 26:55.160
Obviously the materials would be slightly different. We're talking linen shirt maybe like an earth tone instead of that black but for 2009 that was great

26:55.160 --> 26:57.800
I'm saying even for the time you look like garbage here

26:59.560 --> 27:01.560
I think what would you change

27:03.240 --> 27:06.920
Definitely not V-neck. Sorry. I was gonna just let it ride and I was gonna stop being normal

27:07.880 --> 27:11.240
Is streeter just said Danny to be done. I should have done V-neck

27:12.120 --> 27:14.600
Amir was like maybe I should have done V-neck because you have a word

27:14.840 --> 27:21.400
Your hand I'm saying no undershirt no undershirt. No undershirt no undershirt. Here we go

27:26.680 --> 27:28.680
We've hugged a little man

27:30.680 --> 27:33.160
Yeah, bigger man than you, but yeah, great

27:33.400 --> 27:39.480
This is seven minutes. Are you doing why don't you put your arm around Davida like I feel you're not

27:40.360 --> 27:42.360
No, you're being

27:42.680 --> 27:47.080
You you look nervous first of all. Let's be honest about that. Well, this is a first talk show

27:47.080 --> 27:52.520
This is like an exciting moment. I was I'm not saying I'm saying it's fine to be nervous. That's fine. I'm saying it's fine to be nervous

27:52.520 --> 27:56.360
I'm just saying you look really nervous streeter's also nervous

27:56.360 --> 28:00.040
But he's like looking Jimmy in the eye. He's not putting his arm around an a-list

28:00.040 --> 28:02.520
I haven't done or said anything to the clip yet

28:03.480 --> 28:08.120
See you guys alive. I'm glad to see you in one piece because I know that eventually is gonna get out of hand

28:09.640 --> 28:15.240
Daddy haven't seen this house. I want to do this. I was stuck around for two reasons. Yes. I want to find out how

28:15.800 --> 28:20.680
You do this. What are you doing? And also there's a lot of women show a left. Yeah, we got to do it

28:20.680 --> 28:23.720
Oh, we're shy. Pass that down. Hey, yeah, I thank you

28:24.600 --> 28:29.560
There's a little thank you for you and now tell us about some of the things that you've done and uh

28:29.560 --> 28:36.520
We'll toast them. I'll explain it. All right, right tell what you do to each other. I'll see you. I have less to veto hanging

28:37.480 --> 28:40.360
Yeah, you didn't cheers to veto, but you could put your arm around him

28:40.760 --> 28:44.840
This looks like Jimmy Kim will just made your kill list. No, I'm not

28:48.840 --> 28:55.480
You're leaning in glaring at him. Look how real you're really looking to every single thing with a fine tooth

28:55.480 --> 28:57.480
This is just a predator

28:58.200 --> 29:04.120
I won't be mad. I won't be mad if we spend the rest of the episode on this clip alone because I think you might have done it

29:04.120 --> 29:06.120
I think you won't be

29:07.400 --> 29:09.400
I'm

29:09.400 --> 29:12.040
Trying to manage the things he's wanted to have. There you go. Jesus Christ

29:13.000 --> 29:17.560
I tricked him to think he won $1.5 million taking a blindfolded basketball shot

29:18.360 --> 29:20.040
What else? I just

29:22.680 --> 29:27.800
Really embarrassing audition tape and I showed it to everyone. Well, I mean, they're no hitch pranks like I've got my other deck

29:28.120 --> 29:31.880
You're getting defensive online television. It's sort of we were playing the character of like

29:32.440 --> 29:36.440
Buddies that were mad at each other even the street is basically that character

29:36.520 --> 29:41.000
We had to basically tell Jimmy Kimmel that they were all real when in fact they were not Jimmy Kimmel

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
He didn't know

29:43.000 --> 29:46.840
You went to a Yankee game with his girlfriend and I put a marriage proposal from Steve to his girlfriend

29:47.480 --> 29:49.480
But it was not me

29:50.200 --> 29:52.200
She said yes. She slapped him

29:53.160 --> 29:57.000
He said no and then and you're not still together. They're not together

30:01.880 --> 30:06.120
So there's a lot of pressure to perform because these have become very popular in the internet

30:06.120 --> 30:08.360
It's like a yeah, there's a build and skip ahead to the video

30:08.920 --> 30:10.920
Next one so he's gonna spend it

30:11.720 --> 30:14.120
So this is a skydiving thing. What do you guys do?

30:14.120 --> 30:16.120
No, it's classic

30:17.320 --> 30:19.800
Okay, you made him believe that he didn't have a parachute

30:22.680 --> 30:25.080
Yeah, he didn't believe that he didn't have a parachute

30:25.080 --> 30:27.880
Let's see what Jimmy Kimmel and let's see how you react

30:29.160 --> 30:31.160
I'm laughing it's fun

30:31.640 --> 30:33.640
Yeah

30:34.200 --> 30:40.120
We're choosing okay, well, let's take a poll. I don't want to just you know and view what I think will Brad

30:40.120 --> 30:45.320
Do you think this is the moment where a mere kind of doomed himself to be less dumb at best?

30:46.680 --> 30:52.840
Be like this this had to feel great. Yeah, I'm proud of you. I'm here. Thank you. Yeah

30:53.400 --> 31:00.920
What's your career highlight we'll point within the prank war was this were there more pranks to come was this promo or was this

31:01.800 --> 31:04.040
I look this was for RSS TV show

31:05.080 --> 31:09.400
This was to I think this was the like I'm not the host. I'm starting to feel so sorry

31:10.680 --> 31:17.480
You'll pick it up to everybody. No, I want everybody. Yeah, I just I'm just I just I just want the feeling to be acknowledged and then we can

31:19.480 --> 31:24.280
All right, are you done making fun of my jeans or something because we'll add an actual question

31:25.080 --> 31:27.080
I'm done

31:27.160 --> 31:31.560
This was after the final prank war episode. Yeah, I was to promote the clip on college humor

31:35.000 --> 31:37.240
All right moving on on your I'm David on

31:38.360 --> 31:45.720
The next thing is let's talk about something more interesting which is categorized as a video what is this?

31:46.280 --> 31:48.280
No idea

31:48.520 --> 31:52.440
Stevie and Melania sarcastically interview various celebrities

31:53.400 --> 31:58.520
Yeah, maybe another web video that we did like an interview. Oh, it's just a web bit. Okay. I'm trying

31:58.920 --> 32:02.920
Great because we already tackle Jake and Amir which I by the way very general see said was a hit

32:03.400 --> 32:07.720
So I'm trying to say like you breaking into the mainstream media

32:07.720 --> 32:12.280
Which hasn't happened yet as we go through your um oh here we go last call with Carson daily

32:13.880 --> 32:19.800
You were on this yeah, this was like after it was a even a talk show they just had like me and Jake

32:19.880 --> 32:22.280
Introduced some clips and stuff like that who was very

32:24.760 --> 32:31.400
Unavantful last call Jake and Amir here we go. It's not nothing coming up so they don't even have us

32:31.400 --> 32:35.160
Yes, social media. We didn't even make Carson it was very low-fi

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
All right here we go

32:40.520 --> 32:43.560
Box Angel is what is that a podcast

32:45.880 --> 32:47.880
It's

32:48.200 --> 32:55.400
It says what where did it even go box Angel is it says self guest so it's it like another interview

32:55.400 --> 33:02.120
Yeah, like I said I was a guest on a box Angel is I'm gonna see if this is where you fucked it

33:03.080 --> 33:08.120
You're gonna watch a fucking two hour long interview with me not the whole thing, but we'll just kind of skip

33:09.480 --> 33:11.480
Shit, okay

33:11.480 --> 33:14.920
It says I'm your blue and filled I try funny

33:15.880 --> 33:17.880
What is this

33:21.880 --> 33:23.960
Well, this definitely wasn't where you broke through

33:26.360 --> 33:31.640
Okay, first one describe what you're doing three words. This is depressing set by the way

33:31.640 --> 33:33.640
Why do you have all of us

33:33.640 --> 33:35.640
I had a lot of like bassists

33:35.640 --> 33:39.400
Yeah, he's Davenport as you know the he's Davenport interviews

33:39.400 --> 33:43.800
Oh, he's Davenport in the show the most famous guy around here is

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
That this is where you broke in man

33:48.120 --> 33:52.360
What let's get real. This was a low point. Let's walk. I'm funny. Oh

33:53.000 --> 33:57.640
Yeah, I've got it quick and succeed. Sorry. I try funny. I try yeah, oh

33:57.960 --> 34:00.360
Amendment because whether you are funny or not that's subjective

34:01.480 --> 34:03.480
How do you try for you?

34:03.480 --> 34:08.680
Yeah, I was sweet pre-comic videos. I will write articles. I will make videos

34:08.680 --> 34:12.760
I will have podcasts. I tried funny said videos. Well. Yeah, I'll cyberpimps left

34:13.560 --> 34:14.760
Why was that clip down?

34:17.160 --> 34:21.320
I think he was just trying to make his many this was like pre-tick-talk in Instagram

34:21.320 --> 34:25.640
Reels he was just like making shorter YouTube content to try to get his numbers up

34:25.640 --> 34:29.000
YouTube ad blitz sorry to interrupt. YouTube ad blitz. What is that?

34:30.520 --> 34:32.520
That was

34:35.400 --> 34:38.840
Some like super bowl something that YouTube was doing to

34:39.800 --> 34:42.280
I don't know I don't really remember they were

34:42.760 --> 34:45.320
Oh, it was like after the Super Bowl YouTube would show every

34:46.120 --> 34:50.920
Super Bowl commercial or something so called the YouTube ad blitz and they only were in a Super Bowl

34:50.920 --> 34:56.440
Fluenters. No, I was an a commercial for the product that would just show other people's commercials

34:57.400 --> 34:59.400
Oh

34:59.800 --> 35:01.800
Yeah, oh

35:01.800 --> 35:07.800
Saying I was like oh, he shit Super Bowl commercial would have been a great fucking moment to be like, oh, maybe you maybe are more successful than I thought

35:08.120 --> 35:11.800
But again, I'm saying you didn't quite make it to your potential

35:12.440 --> 35:14.440
How much commercial

35:21.800 --> 35:24.680
We're 33 minutes into this. We have more time. So let's keep going

35:26.760 --> 35:31.640
Harold and Kumar. Let's say that that's where you kind of that was the closest you got to the sun

35:32.040 --> 35:36.200
That was bizarre. That was that was before most of the stuff. Yeah

35:36.600 --> 35:42.280
The I your I and to be is all over the place. We were kind of chronological. Yeah, I'm tired

35:46.200 --> 35:51.720
You've told the story about this before the director knew the Jake and Amir or something and he wanted you in the video

35:51.720 --> 35:57.880
Yeah, Todd Strauss Charleston did a bunch of like college humor shorts. So he was in our universe then he got this movie

35:58.680 --> 36:03.720
And they needed help casting it so he recommended me 100% and then

36:04.520 --> 36:09.400
What happened after didn't do a good job didn't like doing it was it your choice that you didn't do another movie

36:09.800 --> 36:13.400
I was fun and it was half my choice half Hollywood's decision

36:13.400 --> 36:17.320
So I would like audition for stuff after and then I would just not do anything and then I'd be like

36:17.320 --> 36:21.640
I don't want to audition anymore. I don't like auditioning and I honestly didn't love doing the movie

36:21.640 --> 36:27.080
It was fun to be in a film, but I wasn't like this is my passion side. Yeah, and what is your eyes?

36:27.880 --> 36:33.320
I think I like eating people and being like oh should we get this hot like I like doing my own comedy

36:33.320 --> 36:40.120
Not necessarily like reading other people's lines over and over and a really slow three month process and then waiting

36:40.120 --> 36:49.160
Yeah, I remember there was one time in 2017 or something you were like hey

36:49.160 --> 36:54.680
I need to like shoot the self tape. Can you help me out? I was like sure we went up to the studio in the old loft office

36:55.240 --> 36:58.680
And you like didn't put any effort into it

36:58.680 --> 37:02.520
You hadn't memorized the lines and I remember being like do you want to do more time with it?

37:02.520 --> 37:04.920
And you're like no, I don't want to get the job

37:04.920 --> 37:09.480
I just have to do this because my agents keep yelling at me that I'm not submitting right exactly

37:09.480 --> 37:12.440
I eventually just let go of agents and managers and

37:13.320 --> 37:15.320
Estude that part of my

37:15.720 --> 37:19.400
Representation. I was like, I don't need to do these commercials. I don't need to do these

37:20.280 --> 37:23.800
Auditions anymore. I don't like doing it, but I don't want to get the roles anyway

37:24.680 --> 37:25.880
Yeah

37:25.880 --> 37:29.400
How much of your life you would you say you wasted on sending in auditions that you didn't want?

37:31.320 --> 37:33.320
Hours maybe three four hours

37:33.480 --> 37:38.920
That's it total. Well cuz each audition was well cuz each audition you made you know if you meant that yeah

37:40.200 --> 37:42.200
Did I say maybe you're there

37:42.200 --> 37:44.200
Because so maybe it's

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
So

37:47.400 --> 37:52.680
No, I'm just saying maybe that's where you fucked it all up right there's four people but like I feel like I'm being

37:54.680 --> 37:58.200
Happy and really started like that and we'll are just sitting here

37:58.200 --> 38:01.880
I think that there are a reason that the Christmas bonus is what would go away

38:01.880 --> 38:08.520
I feel like you but I'm not salaried right kind of her salaried Brad is salaried that's how he was able to do the major gut reno

38:09.480 --> 38:11.480
Let's pre-head you know

38:13.480 --> 38:15.480
Where are you working then Brad?

38:15.480 --> 38:20.600
Where are you working and don't say the Oregon College of Health and Sciences

38:22.120 --> 38:24.120
What is it?

38:24.120 --> 38:27.320
That's yeah, I won because I thought where I was working

38:28.280 --> 38:30.280
Well, where are you from Milwaukee?

38:30.920 --> 38:32.920
Me

38:33.000 --> 38:39.320
Will in Florida in Florida Orange County Florida moved to Orange County California

38:40.120 --> 38:41.640
Went to college

38:41.640 --> 38:43.640
Which is ours are

38:43.880 --> 38:47.880
Orange County most common county name in the country

38:49.080 --> 38:51.320
Got it all right um just

38:53.240 --> 38:55.240
Or your record

38:55.800 --> 38:58.600
Well, can we all take a vote where do we think of mirrors

38:59.560 --> 39:01.560
Career went down the toilet

39:01.560 --> 39:04.680
Because I think it was when you fired your representation. I think we eventually got there

39:04.680 --> 39:08.520
It's that you haven't even had the at bats since what 2018

39:11.160 --> 39:13.160
Yeah, it's been five years

39:14.280 --> 39:19.080
Overlapping dialogue we had it last week and I wonder if it was because Marika because you were in a better mood

39:19.880 --> 39:22.520
It's because you spent the last 15 minutes

39:23.080 --> 39:25.080
dissecting my career

39:25.880 --> 39:30.440
In a negative fashion. I don't feel the need to jump in and join you

39:31.080 --> 39:33.080
Jovioli

39:34.760 --> 39:39.960
You've done well for yourself. I feel like that's how we can end this segment on a high note is that you're pretty rich

39:45.000 --> 39:50.040
Like at least for what you do you like you know you make well above six figures which is pretty

39:50.600 --> 39:56.680
Uncommon good you don't know anything you don't know anything so that doesn't mean anything

39:57.160 --> 39:59.160
Because you don't know anything

39:59.160 --> 40:02.840
Refinanced in 2021 at the 2.9% interest rate

40:04.600 --> 40:07.240
Did you not because why would not do one need to anyone

40:07.720 --> 40:11.720
You got a 25 is he let you go make what you want them

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Get back to it

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
Um, I'm just trying to figure out how to make a name slash

40:19.960 --> 40:24.680
Wall it for myself. You are just trying to figure out how to

40:25.320 --> 40:30.520
But maybe don't spend the actual show just trying to figure out how to

40:31.320 --> 40:39.560
Maybe before the show starts you should just figure out how to and then show starts you fucking do the thing that you figured out how to

40:48.280 --> 40:51.800
Let's finish up by hearing about your time in New York your time

40:52.200 --> 40:56.600
Working out of the headgum office because you haven't been able to do that for your entire tenure until now

40:57.320 --> 41:00.280
Yeah, I'm visited briefly, but this is the first

41:01.400 --> 41:07.720
Extend that I'm not a visitor wearing briefly which is sort of like a new sponsor where it's trying to like get

41:08.680 --> 41:14.120
Men to go from the box or briefs to the just straight up brief cut trying to get like got middle package

41:16.760 --> 41:18.760
Yeah, it's been good

41:22.600 --> 41:25.880
Um, do you ever go to the Johnson's that's my favorite bar?

41:26.600 --> 41:28.600
No, I gotta go

41:28.600 --> 41:33.000
Send me a pin drop me a pin pros and pin killers pros and pin killers pros and pin killers

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Uh-huh

41:37.800 --> 41:41.720
Are you good? I'm fine. I'm gonna good time. I'm sorry

41:43.800 --> 41:45.800
Are you good at hosting?

41:47.080 --> 41:50.680
You tell me I think we've been having a good time. I think the episode is gonna be

41:51.320 --> 41:57.720
Really don't even know to share a lot about gash cab people loved that now. I was like money yourself

42:01.320 --> 42:05.640
We'll do the next episode in person. We'll do the next episode in person because we get to do it

42:08.200 --> 42:10.200
For a mirror's wedding

42:10.200 --> 42:12.200
Yeah, no

42:12.200 --> 42:16.840
I love pointing out that a mirror's getting married soon to people at the company who weren't invited you do

42:20.680 --> 42:23.080
That's hard because it was a small wedding, right? We should say that you

42:23.800 --> 42:25.800
Thousands of people are attending

42:26.200 --> 42:27.400
Oh

42:27.400 --> 42:32.040
Tencent my husband's really so where was my invite and definitely where was my boss?

42:33.240 --> 42:40.040
The problem is the people that were invited got a plus 100 so everyone sort of got to invite a full wedding of people to the wedding

42:40.440 --> 42:46.280
And then I invited 10 people I invited a hundred and they invited a hundred each. It's a multi-level marketing

42:46.280 --> 42:48.920
Sam slash day of my life

42:50.680 --> 42:54.920
I would love if your wedding was a publicly ticketed event at so far

42:55.400 --> 42:59.000
Well, we are monetizing it. Oh, we are monetizing it. What do you mean?

43:01.320 --> 43:08.120
You know it's a big one and then ask a question you chose the answer and it was to make one so no question

43:10.200 --> 43:13.080
Well, I first of all, you know, just because I've been trying to

43:13.640 --> 43:15.640
And be more gratitude into my life

43:15.640 --> 43:17.640
I want to leave

43:20.040 --> 43:25.240
I want to thank Brad for making the time because I know that you're on a trip, you know, you're on a vacation

43:25.240 --> 43:28.680
So Brad thinks for offering up these 40 minutes

43:30.200 --> 43:33.880
For this, you know, which I know that is always the most fun experience, especially for you

43:34.600 --> 43:36.200
Let's ride out

43:36.200 --> 43:37.560
Will

43:37.560 --> 43:40.600
Yes, sorry. Let's do plugs and then let's do one last thing

43:41.320 --> 43:43.320
So let's start with the well plugs

43:44.040 --> 43:46.040
If you're in New York, let me know

43:47.400 --> 43:49.400
Weird

43:50.200 --> 43:52.200
I will

43:52.200 --> 43:54.200
Thanks for having me

43:54.200 --> 43:56.200
Let me know if you're in LA

43:56.200 --> 43:58.200
This is for the listener or

43:59.000 --> 44:00.200
Will

44:00.200 --> 44:02.600
What I'm all right Brad plugs

44:04.440 --> 44:09.000
Go follow my new podcast on Instagram at Hill King's pod

44:09.160 --> 44:12.440
We might have an episode out soon. Great and

44:13.560 --> 44:19.240
No follow up on the podcast or what it is and what is the podcast about I feel like that's on King of the Hill

44:19.640 --> 44:21.640
Rewage podcast

44:21.640 --> 44:23.640
That's tough for me to swallow

44:24.360 --> 44:26.040
It's pretty fun

44:26.040 --> 44:28.040
It's a video pod

44:28.040 --> 44:32.680
We've got visual gags. I know how to screen share which is a plus

44:33.160 --> 44:35.160
That's

44:36.920 --> 44:38.280
And I do know how to share

44:40.280 --> 44:42.440
That sounds great most of the last thing he said

44:43.880 --> 44:45.880
Let's ride out with a

44:47.320 --> 44:48.920
Historic moment on the show

44:50.600 --> 44:52.600
It's the first

44:54.360 --> 44:56.360
Head gum staffer

44:56.760 --> 45:01.640
Some bit in the right song from Brad's band

45:06.440 --> 45:09.480
Not sharing out of you. No, can't hear it

45:12.440 --> 45:15.240
Can you hear it now? Yeah, yeah, it's good

45:17.480 --> 45:18.840
Wait, no, this is an original

45:20.120 --> 45:22.120
It's not it's a

45:22.120 --> 45:24.120
Pretty

45:25.720 --> 45:27.720
You play the whole thing

45:43.320 --> 45:47.320
It's the first one that's listenable. I would put this on in the car

45:52.120 --> 45:54.120
Don't get over a rice though

46:14.760 --> 46:16.760
Sounds better

46:22.120 --> 46:26.760
We're going to write out on this eventually, but what I want.

46:26.760 --> 46:28.640
Can you walk us through these lyrics?

46:28.640 --> 46:29.640
Do you have them pulled up?

46:29.640 --> 46:30.640
Yeah.

46:30.640 --> 46:31.640
I have them right here, actually.

46:31.640 --> 46:32.640
Right.

46:32.640 --> 46:33.640
Down, handwritten.

46:33.640 --> 46:34.640
Let's see.

46:34.640 --> 46:40.000
Handwritten in my little note, but there we go.

46:40.000 --> 46:44.520
You'll have Jasmine long grain or not, sure.

46:44.520 --> 46:50.880
Some sticky rice that I'll cook in a pot, you know, you know, I'll eat rice.

46:51.120 --> 46:55.440
You took the rice right out my mouth.

46:55.440 --> 47:02.360
A side of soy, I said without any doubt, you know, I'll burn rice too.

47:02.360 --> 47:08.280
And then we have the chorus and I'll eat rice and over that burn rice baby, parboiled

47:08.280 --> 47:17.000
the side of soy, parboiled rice baby, scoop up a ricey boy, sand baby, run rice,

47:17.080 --> 47:22.880
any hana, bomba, baby, oh girl, you know, I want to and that repeats.

47:22.880 --> 47:23.880
I like it.

47:23.880 --> 47:24.880
What?

47:24.880 --> 47:26.880
It's real good.

47:26.880 --> 47:31.680
It's as cacophonuses any one I've ever done and mirrors immediately like I love it.

47:31.680 --> 47:39.440
Well, he was able to sort of take your chicken shit and turn it into chicken salad on rice.

47:39.440 --> 47:40.440
Let's go.

47:40.440 --> 47:43.560
There's no way that doesn't mean anything.

47:43.560 --> 47:44.560
Let's go.

47:44.720 --> 47:45.720
To do.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.440
Did you say I got rice clout, so I keep grains in.

48:03.440 --> 48:04.120
Okay.

48:04.120 --> 48:07.880
As in, I keep grains in fashion and style.

48:07.880 --> 48:10.920
I have rice clout.

48:11.240 --> 48:12.400
Beat it again.

48:12.400 --> 48:17.200
I said without any doubt, you know, it's on speed.

48:17.200 --> 48:19.920
As in, I'm keeping grains in fashion.

48:19.920 --> 48:21.480
Oh, there it is.

48:33.480 --> 48:36.200
I want grains made in the south.

48:36.200 --> 48:37.560
Something about birds.

48:37.560 --> 48:40.640
Some burnt up grits that'll ruin my mouth.

48:44.640 --> 48:47.520
So you're eating it immediately off the pan.

48:47.520 --> 48:48.520
Yeah, bird.

48:51.080 --> 48:52.560
Then the chorus again.

48:52.560 --> 48:54.200
We can skip it.

48:54.200 --> 48:55.360
Skip this, okay.

49:07.120 --> 49:09.600
Jeffery, I can't chew it.

49:09.600 --> 49:10.600
Yep.

49:15.600 --> 49:16.800
Awful.

49:16.800 --> 49:19.200
It sounds so bad there.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.600
This is the chorus again.

49:31.600 --> 49:32.600
Right?

49:36.200 --> 49:38.800
Say that again.

49:38.800 --> 49:45.120
It's the head gun podcast.

49:45.120 --> 49:47.120
Jeffery's out of his mind.

49:47.120 --> 49:48.120
Okay.

49:48.120 --> 49:51.600
How come every time Jeffery bales when we climb?

49:51.600 --> 49:52.600
Leaning?

49:52.600 --> 49:55.040
You bale every time I try to hang.

49:55.040 --> 49:56.040
Okay.

49:56.040 --> 49:57.240
That was a metaphor.

50:06.200 --> 50:16.760
It's just, it's less funny because it's a good song.

50:16.760 --> 50:21.760
And it's produced well.

50:29.760 --> 50:33.720
Good episode, but very uneven.

50:33.720 --> 50:36.000
The song was great.

50:36.000 --> 50:43.880
But Jeff kept dragging the entire flow of the hour down and we would resuscitate.

50:43.880 --> 50:47.640
And then he would be like an anchor dragging us down and grounding us down and grounding

50:47.640 --> 50:48.640
us.

50:48.640 --> 50:49.640
Yeah, an anchor like me.

50:49.640 --> 50:50.640
No, we're holding it down.

50:50.640 --> 50:52.640
Drown, holding us down, drowning.

50:52.640 --> 50:53.640
Drown, dig us.

50:53.640 --> 50:54.640
Really?

50:54.640 --> 50:58.480
Yeah, pulling me under water against all odds.

50:58.480 --> 51:02.640
It was a good show to credit wheeling.

51:03.560 --> 51:06.200
I was going to say, yeah, the spike wills best efforts.

51:06.200 --> 51:07.200
No, no.

51:07.200 --> 51:08.200
We don't.

51:08.200 --> 51:10.680
Not even, uneven episode.

51:10.680 --> 51:11.680
Bumper.

51:11.680 --> 51:12.680
Yeah, bumps in the road.

51:12.680 --> 51:15.080
You're a bump of a guy.

51:15.080 --> 51:16.880
I try to be good.

51:16.880 --> 51:19.080
You're a rough.

51:19.080 --> 51:20.080
Yeah.

51:20.080 --> 51:22.280
You are the rough.

51:22.280 --> 51:23.680
That, yeah.

51:23.680 --> 51:24.680
Yeah.

51:24.680 --> 51:26.120
And it's right there.

51:26.120 --> 51:47.680
With you agreeing.

51:47.680 --> 51:49.000
That was a hit-dum original.

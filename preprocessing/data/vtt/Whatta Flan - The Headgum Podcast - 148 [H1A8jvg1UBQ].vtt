WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
music

00:07.000 --> 00:15.000
music

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
music

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
sharing sound

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
now you can hear

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
I got to talk to Mike Comote or one of these fucking audio engineers to figure out how to get loop back going on my new laptop, right?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
because I tried to share

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
the security settings that would allow it to basically create a MIDI device, right?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
like I used to

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
but these new fucking M processors.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
I mean, it doesn't matter how fast they are, they won't let you look at hacking to do

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
pre-production

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
during the show

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
nobody wants to hear it

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
nobody gives a shit

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
do it before we get started

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
or don't do it all

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
but this is not the time to sort of

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
commiserate about what is or isn't working audio video-wise

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
we couldn't hear

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
all right, I did hear that one actually

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
um

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
spring is sprung

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
I don't know what else to say

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
it is a new season

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
of dreams

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
and

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
what are you guys looking forward to?

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
what do you guys want to leave in winter?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
um

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
cold and rainy still so it's hurt for me to

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
yeah, I feel

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I feel almost the opposite

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
like it's been to warm

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
warm, yeah

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
here

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
but I definitely want to leave in winter

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
like

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
wetness

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
um

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
tired of that

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
tired of rain, tired of

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
sleep, tired of snow

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
yeah, I met like personally

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
oh

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
um

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
you know, I think just

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
uh

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
the internet in general

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
kind of

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
or any of the internet behind

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
that's winter

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
yeah

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
for our audio only listeners

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
they wouldn't even know the

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Danes on the show today

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
because he hasn't said anything yet

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
but he doesn't introduce

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
you guys felt very comfortable

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
talking before I introduced your ass

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
it's welcome to the show

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Dan Cardio

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
how's it going?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
um

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
it's really for to my garden

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
we're doing some

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
seed planning right now

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
so the lettuce and the onions

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
and the bell peppers

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
um

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
yeah, it's going to be good

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
would you say a rice?

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
one of the hardest things to grow

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
right?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
it's not

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
don't need to flood like the grass

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
yeah, you do

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
weeks

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
no, you don't

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
then how do you grow rice

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
marica

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
you can grow rice in a pot

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
man

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
we're going to fuck up

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
some rice

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
this has been stuck in my head all week

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
yeah

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
he goes like

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
no, it's my dad's whole thing

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
he loves to tell people

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
they can grow rice

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
at home

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
in a pot

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
that's true

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I remember that new segment

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
I thought that

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
that's really nice

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
when you make your parents

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
saying your thing

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
yeah

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
yeah

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
and like thinking about

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
like not being a parent

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
that's the one thing that I'm like

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
sad about

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
is like

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
kids taking on my thing

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
absolutely

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
and just to go off that

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
for a second

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
my mom was a

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
second grade teacher

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
so if I could

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
dumb things down for your

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
guys to ask is

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
let's all regroup

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
let's all come

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
to this with joy

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
because people

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
don't want to hear

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
animosity

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
right

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
I need to explain it

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
to you like you are

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
five

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
because if your kids

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
became dodger fans

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
just to

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
mirror what if you

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
shut the fuck up

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
I want to hear

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
the answer

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
let me do

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
no I mean I think

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
I would do a good job

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
to steer them away from that

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
also not living

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
they would probably become

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
metz fans

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
or yanky fans

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
first

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
okay with that

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
or you'd be the kind

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
of disappointed

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
no I'd be okay with that

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
for sure

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
you'd be okay with them being

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
yanky fans

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
you just have to let them

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
do their own thing

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
I think at the end of the day

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
you can try your best

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
off parenting

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
yeah I think so

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
me too

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
me too

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
it's like

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
you feel like I wish

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
I wish my parents

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
had instilled more

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
like

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
pop culture of their

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
time knowledge

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
if I could

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
if I could have changed

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
anything

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
about my parents

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
parenting style

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
then I think they

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
didn't pretend

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
good job

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
if that's your business

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
plan

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
no I feel like all my friends

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
are like

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
yeah I love

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
the Beatles

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
because my mom loved

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
the Beatles

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
or something like that

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
and

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
I know that my mom

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
liked the Beatles

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
but she never

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
forced me to listen to them

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
so I like

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
don't care

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
you know what I mean

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
you're okay

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
no

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
of course

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
um

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
just getting

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
I listen

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
to reggae a lot

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
in my dad's car

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
so I guess that

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
yeah

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
and what was your favorite

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
was it

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
I really like the harmony house

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
uh

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
two seed volume two

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
CD

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
uh

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
just a compilation album

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
of some of

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
reggae's greatest

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
music

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
music

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
music

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
music

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Steven Merchant

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
like it doesn't

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
fucking matter at this point

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Barbara Rockley cast a fucker

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
it doesn't matter

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
if they're a woman

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
or a person of color

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
at this point

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
I'll take the widest

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Brit you've got

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
just so we have a name

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
and I can stop doing this

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
shit

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Steven Merchant

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Lucas Hudges

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
awful

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
awful

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
music

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
he just got cast in a

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
um

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
he just got cast in a play

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
very famous

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
broke back the knock

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
I saw that

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
I saw that

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
that reading it

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
to the next generation

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
at the end

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
to the west end

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
play with music

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I did

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
by tickets this morning

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I've never been more excited

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
about that

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
why doesn't Japan have like an east end

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
you know I don't know

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
I've heard that. I've heard that. Really? No.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I'd never seen broke back Mountain.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Me neither. And this will be my first time seeing it.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Life on stage.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Dana and Amir, what are your guys' bonds of the week?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Say them at the same time, please?

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Alex and James.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Sorry, I couldn't hear either of you.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Right.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Did you say that last?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Dana, who did you say?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Alex and your German.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Who's that?

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
He plays Utrid, son of Utrid in the last kingdom.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
It's a good pick.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
And then Amir, you said a sweaty white guy.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Austin Reeves, yeah.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Because he had a good game last night.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
He's playing well. He's playing really well.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
He's well.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
That's this basketball.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Yeah.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Team waxing basket ball.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
We're chatting basket ball.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
That's my team names.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
My team name references.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
What song?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah, should we check in on the headgun bracket challenge?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Let's do it.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
Turn him oldie over by the time this comes out though, right?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
That's yeah.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
That is absolutely true.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Currently I'm sitting in fourth.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
It's solid.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Not on wood.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
My God.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Speedcassers in first.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
I don't know who FDIC and Shared Bracket is.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
That's you.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
That's me.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Hell yeah.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Dan's in second.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Big winner will.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
And third and big winner Jeff and fourth.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Amir, you're in 12th sitting shitty.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
Well, I like to focus on max points possible going forward.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Which, by the way, is how this is.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
That puts me in really.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Oh, no, it's not.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Yeah, you did pretty good with max points.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
Your first to do is get everything else correctly going forward.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
But actually, you kind of pick with your heart though.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
More so.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Yeah, I see a lot going all the way.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
So in the future, if you guys are listening to this, you'll know how I did.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Based on whether or not you see a one the tournament.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
And I had Houston going all the way and Houston.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Me too.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
So Murray, can I might win?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
I'd be pretty cool.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Why do I take Houston to win?

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
I picked all of my teams based on one website that I don't remember the name of.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
Uh, streets in New York.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And in first, the University of Houston.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
Uh, my final four, the only one still in it is Houston.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
You have a, I had you have a in Houston in the championships.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
So that sucks.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Yeah, Arizona lost a Princeton.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Those fucking nerds in the first round.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Can you believe that there are already smart.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And now they're just beating.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Nationally ranked basketball powerhouses.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Well, you have to assume you've a just didn't take it seriously enough.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Right.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
They were out partying on it before for sure.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
It is a party school.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
The fuck is that supposed to mean?

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
It's known for their social events.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Greek life.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
And uh, party general party atmosphere.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Didn't we learn that?

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
Were you in the, uh, and Uber when we were in Scottsdale?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Because that's where it is, right?

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
I feel like our Uber driver told us that exact information.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I really, I think it's in Tucson.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
But yeah, it's all just around there.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
I, I got deja vu some first some reason.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
deja Tucson.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Nice.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Um.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Um.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
G.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Oh.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Oh.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Oh.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Oh.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Oh.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Oh.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Is that real?

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
It's not real.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Oh.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Oh.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
There's no way.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Sorry.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Oh.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
What?

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
I said, you don't fart all day during this show.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
I don't.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Really.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Uh, you, you guys are familiar with Phoma, right?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Yeah.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Fear of missing out.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
What about Jomo?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
The joy of missing out?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
That's actually really cool.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
If it was an acronym, but I was thinking it for like a boys name.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
The jeans of missing out.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
The jeans of having them.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Jaff.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Is your shirt open all the way?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Or does it button at the way, way, way bottom?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
It buttons halfway down.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
I see.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Fine.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
I'm going to France.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
So I'm starting to dress like I'm Parisian.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Yeah.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
They don't dress like that, really.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Yeah.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
They have.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
I was going to say, do you have like new balances?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Like, really.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Okay.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
You got to bring those.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Bring those for sure.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
What else?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Let me know.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Just like jeans.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
I mean, definitely for sure.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
I'm wearing jeans, man.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Okay.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Yeah.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
I couldn't see them.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
I knew you were laying down on a bed as you want to do.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
I'm sitting here.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Sorry, Dan.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I'm sitting here.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Ready to converse with you without calm.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
I love that.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
That's a big of you.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Sorry, one second.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
What do you think he's texting?

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
Um, I kind of feel like he's bringing up the notes app.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Um, tag yourself.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
She and Putin.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
I think it mirrors kind of a sheet.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
She.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
She.

12:42.000 --> 12:49.000
Let's get to some really important stuff.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
HDD.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
How does Dan do?

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
Please fill us in.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Me?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Dan!

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
Um, how do I do in one way?

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Loud fart during that.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
Dan, how does Dan do?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
What are some of your principles?

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Ways that you live by?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
No, I don't have a lot actually.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Really.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
I feel like I had a lot of, um,

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Well, I do still have some of this in like over context.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
It's like needing to like control things.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
And I'm trying to like let go of that.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Hmm.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
I think I'm doing an okay job.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
My last job.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
It was really bad.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
And like my mental health was not good because of it.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
But, um,

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
I feel like we talked about some of our like year.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
What it will like year resolutions.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
And one of them was to pop in.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Right.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
I've been doing the pop.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I've done a couple of poppins.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
I also had a dinner.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
I made a bunch of dinner less weekend.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Yeah.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
And there's probably the best meal I've ever made for like a vegan audience too,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
which is tough.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
A lot of constraints.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Um, spicy potato floutas,

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
um,

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
basket tacos,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
avocado corn salad.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
There's really good.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Oh, off.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Yeah.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
That sounds really good.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
I'm starving right now.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
So that's extra year.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
What's a basket taco?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
It is.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
You just fold the taco with some fillings.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
And like a make your own situation.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Hmm.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
It could be.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Yeah.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
And there's like some like chili red sauce on the inside and the outside of it.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
So it's like more red red looking.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Fun, fun.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Dane, do you feel like they're getting what you're saying?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Like do you want me to go to bat for you?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Because I will.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
It looks fast.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
It's not a girl.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
It's a big question.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
Um, how else does Dane do?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I haven't.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
I don't journal.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
So I don't know these things about myself.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
I haven't really done a lot of self reflection this year to the honest.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
So that's fair.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
I mean, where where was the where is the time?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Yeah.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Where's the time?

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Where's the motivation?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
More so.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Why do any of this work?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Yeah.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
It doesn't matter.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
Well, there's a tenant right there is maybe care a little bit less about, you know,

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
your job and adopt a little bit more of an Italian file.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Mine, sir.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Oh, what?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
My gas just comes out the other end.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Why is that any better?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Why is that any better?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
It's a little less gross.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
It's less funny.

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
What kind of mindset do you say?

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
Uh, an Italian mindset just in terms of like,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
you know, the thing with Europeans is off.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
They don't value work.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Like Americans.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
And by the way, Americans don't even want to work.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Did you guys know that?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
We did.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
So it's this weird juxtaposition where it's like Americans value work too much.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
But obviously, they don't want to go to work.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
And it's hard to like, you know, no one wants to work anymore.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
Basically is the thing that I've started to hone in on being my reason why the world sucks.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Uh, and Europe.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
It's got changed that for you.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I got embarrassed.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
My whole deal is going to change.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I mean, it already is like how French I look.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Yeah.

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
What's the one thing that you want to take back with you from France?

16:26.000 --> 16:33.000
Um, don't know much about the French you look.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Would you participate in any of the protests?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
That could be fun.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
Maybe I want to come back with a greater understanding of why.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
Like a militant just past activism.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Yeah.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I want to storm the barricade.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
I've never thought this.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
But today, I woke up being like,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Macron passed the blue blue.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
It's fucking on because I'm almost.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I'm staying near the best deal.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
You're not going to France.

What a plan.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
What a plan.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000

What a plan.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
What a plan.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
What a plan.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
What a plan.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
What a plan.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Pressing the beat for sure.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
What.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
That's the third mood.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
The division.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
How can head gum become climate neutral.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
So delicious.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
To the plan now.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
We have to move on.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
We have to move on.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Do you want to talk about the plan song?

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
I want to talk about the song, but I do want to say that.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
When you brought that call

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
water

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
wet flan water all over the

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Oh my

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Sure

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
What to caramelize sugar

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
one and two chip

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Pressing the soundboard as it cleans the

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
keyboard

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
computer

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Oh yeah

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I was just trying to show you how

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
this is it

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Yeah, so what I was trying to say was when you

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
brought it over and you took a piece of it out of the pot

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
My first thought was that you were eating like

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
gelatinous

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
broth

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
That's that's the vibe it was getting

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
This isn't this isn't vanilla pudding

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
Was this was the background vocal like weird and off beat

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
or was that just your singing?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
No, it was he was rushing

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
at for sure

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
So the background was the actual from the song

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
but Jeff was singing it weird or was like a weird out of tune version of that song

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
and he was singing to that beat

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
The former

19:47.640 --> 19:51.000
Can you guys ever just like take something i do at face value?

19:51.000 --> 19:57.000
Why do you have to like dissect its meaning and what i did to prepare for it or not?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Let's hear just the song part

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
What am I do good flan?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Yeah, so this is correct

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Somebody might be a good flan

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
What a flan

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
What a flan

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
I might be a good flan

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
How much was that flan?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Uh

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
$3 i think i don't know

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
$5 i didn't look at the item i was received i just was at

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Gelsen's last night and i bought it

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Yeah

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
It's like a six pack

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
4 pack

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Three more flan

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Honestly it's not bad it looks grosser than it is

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
Um three more in flanagan's

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Nice

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Real Monday energy to this episode

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
I think it's going fine

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
How is that? What's happening?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
What is it? What are you doing?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Is that your dog?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
No this is not my dog

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
It's a tag

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
It's a tag

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
It's that your dog

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
This is not my dog

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
This is a tag

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I'm asking again

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
If you think this is my dog

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
I didn't see it like that i just saw this kind of dark blackish gray looking thing

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
You're the camera and we'll ask

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Time that up in the me it was a cat as fostering

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
Great episode for the audio only listeners for sure

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
Yeah, the meers holding a tag and i asked him if it was his dog

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Um

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Listen

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
How long have we had america you and i mostly you host the pit wall

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
And f1 podcast for casual fans right?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Sure

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Can you answer in like a strong affirmative?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Yes

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
I am one of the hosts that has been on it more than you have

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Uh

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Very fun show

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
If you like formula one i think there's a lot of um good puns

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Uh good banter

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Uh there's a whole bit the other week about uh how

22:21.000 --> 22:27.000
Who was who was that in who was on i just think Casey saying if blank is that he land strolls on

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Yeah, that was good

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Um you know, got a quicky one liners

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Got a quicky one liners

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
But you know we have a lot of room to grow and improve because the show is still pretty young and we

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
Aren't always weekly i think now we're weekly but there are last season we weren't

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
So i just thought that we could listen to a little bit of last week's episode

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
And try and get your guys' feedback and notes

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Does that make sense?

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
Uh sure you weren't on this episode

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Right which is why i'm like you know

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
There's no conflict of interest there because i wasn't on it so i'll be objective

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Right so it's just kind of like um

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Uh bombardment of me

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
We're gonna fuck up some rice

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
All right uh here we go

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Is a head gum original?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Good so far. Yeah, that's normal

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Great theme song

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Casey made that

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Yeah

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Sort of 80's side by

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Roll

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Roll

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Beep beep

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Love the energy from Casey

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
To the pit wall

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
This is my first episode back have all the intro's been like this

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
No no yes

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
And then break a line so these things face

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
If we saw right there to be stopped right there

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Spear out of the power too

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Ha ha

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
I feel like people come to podcast for honesty

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Would you disagree?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Pants on the podcast

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
It's wondering what you got me there

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
You got me there

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
It has been the same

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Damn i love it the new Casey

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Yeah

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Trying to open up the show

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
With a lot of energy trying to scare people when they come back

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
I'm the record

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
So far so good

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
Uh welcome to the pit wall everybody this is uh

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
Is this going for a little one podcast for casual fans?

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
I'm the pit wall principle the podcast principle

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Can I just jakes not here? Can I give jaken up?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Sure

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
He's not speaking with the gravitas to somebody

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
He's been in podcasting for almost a decade

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
Right like he sounds nervous to be on the show

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Maybe he was

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Right and I'm just like yeah

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
I'm here can you call jake?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Call him out

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Call him right now

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
No and say what

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
And just put him on speaker and then

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Let him hear me say

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Why don't you call him?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
You have his number and then you can see direct

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
The tune how it if I called him how would he hear you?

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
You could put the microphone up to the fucking earphones

25:15.000 --> 25:21.000
What is weird about this request?

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
Right seems it seems like there's a middle man here

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
You can just calm directly

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
All right he's not going to pick up my call

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
That's my thing, but yeah, let's just try

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Things to eat

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Yeah, and he's right too

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
God

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
The worst episode of right

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
Yeah, he blocked you for sure

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I might need to do not disturb one

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Like I didn't even ring one

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
If you call again, it might penetrate the do not disturb shield

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Let's just keep going

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Okay, see donning you

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
Sorry, it's this is the first thing I'm doing all day today

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
I am the pit let's get behind

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Right

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I was at Lamont

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
And I

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Sorry stop

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Is this a bra?

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
It's hard like to tell which is like last week's real

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
Yeah, it's like nearly impossible to decipher when the clip ends

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
And you you guys start talking anything

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
All right, do you have a better idea of how to do this than because we have to do it

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
It was

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
It wasn't bragg

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
I don't know, for me the one's a bragg

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
It was just space, right, forget race

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Are you participating in that or

26:43.000 --> 26:49.000
I'm just trying to take advantage of as much as I can

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
So if I have an opportunity to brag about going to

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
An esteemed race

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
On the

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
East side of France

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I'm going to do it

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
I'm just watching hi

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
How is this good?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
This one

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Fine, you know, let's just skip ahead to the end of the episode

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
And we'll see how we wrap things up

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
And then we'll wrap the segment up

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
I'm going to I'm going to sponsor

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Williams for

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
$50,000

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
What's one is it?

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
Sorry, I'm getting confused about if Maria is speaking or if it's the episode

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
From last week

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I'm actually throwing my voice

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Meaning

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
You know, like how Ben Triliquist do

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
Because you can see her lips aren't moving

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Uh-huh

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
It just froze and I think it's for the better

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
You're probably right

28:03.000 --> 28:11.000
Welcome to the price of Sprite

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
You know it

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Uh, the price is right rules

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Uh, here's what we're going to do

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Right, where do you think most people consume Sprite

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Of the gas station

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Right

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I don't know about that

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
I don't know about that

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Yeah, restaurants are something

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Bottles are something

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Bottles are something

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
Because you're talking about soda fountains which is a different sort of economic model

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Sure, sure, sure, sure

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
Like a 20-ounce bottle, a glass bottle, what are we talking

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Like yeah, 20-ounce

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
Okay, I'm thinking now I think the the driving force of the Sprite economy is a two-liter

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Yeah

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Yeah, I agree with that

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
So pizza places

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Yeah

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
All right, unless they're doing Pepsi

29:03.000 --> 29:09.000
Well in my head and this whole segment was based around this was that people mostly drink Sprite that they buy a gas station

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Sure, I'll take that

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
So what we're going to do is

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Prices right rules

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I'm going to list out five different gas stations

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
You're going to say what you think the cost of a bottle of Sprite is there

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
And then I'm going to give them a call

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
And cross reference and get the actual answer

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
Okay, wait, can some of these are all in LA

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
These are all in Los Angeles, California

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Yeah, great

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
So there might be a little bit of a price difference right

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Uh, 20-ounce

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
What's that?

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
20-ounce

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Uh, yeah, 20-ounce

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Whatever the normal one is it, is that 20-ounce's

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Yes

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Yes, okay

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
So here we go

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
76

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
What do you guys got?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Which one?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
What's that?

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
What area?

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Hollywood

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Hollywood

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
2019

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
2019, we've got 2019 from Maria

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
310

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
310

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I'm here already got

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
279

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
All right, somewhere in 9

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Here we go

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
I'm calling them

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Hey, you reached Jake

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
Hi

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Hi, I was just calling to see

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
How much do you guys charge for a bottle of Sprite?

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
For what?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
For a bottle of Sprite

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
I don't know

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
I'm not, I'm not the 4 guys

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
I'm the canister

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Okay

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
So should I just pop in

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Then

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Oh, that'd be great

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Oh, that'd be great

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Do something

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Do something

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Yeah, okay, thank you so much

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Okay

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Day and I'm sorry

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
You uh

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
You didn't get it

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
That's real time so it's pushing me over

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Let's uh, let's give it to

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Miran Marieka

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Uh, for guessing to something

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Which is what they said it was, so that's exactly right

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Uh, taking things over to axon mobile

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Uh, here we go

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Uh, given them a call

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
What do you guys think axon mobile

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Or just for a bottle of Sprite

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Where?

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
In Hollywood

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
2019

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
And are we sure all of these have stores of them?

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Uh, we are

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Adam here

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Go to 79

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
I'm sticking with 3-10

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Hi

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
What do you guys charge for a bottle of Sprite in your quick mark?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Yeah

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Yeah

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
Uh, maybe

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
3-10

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Okay, thank you

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Oh great, thank you so much

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Thank you

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
24, he said

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Wow, that's going to give it to

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Uh

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Wait, what did you guys even say?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
I'm here. Yeah, I'm your got it closest

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I feel like that's a plus tax

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
That's with plus tax, that's just because you want to be more right

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Shell

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
What are you guys thinking?

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I mean, now I'm going to go 284

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I don't think it's going to differ that much

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Between gas station

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Dane

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
I'm here

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
299

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
And I also think you should clarify

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
20 ounce bottle

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
20 ounce bottle

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
27 day

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
20

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Hi, uh

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
Hey, uh, what do you guys charge for your 20 ounce bottles of Sprite?

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
20

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
What do you guys charge for your

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
Uh, bottles of Sprite in the quick mark?

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Like how much is a bottle?

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
What do the bottles order?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Yeah

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
What kind of soda you need?

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
What kind of soda you need?

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Oh, just just a 20 ounce bottle of Sprite

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
269

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
269

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Okay, thank you so much

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I think that was Mariko, wasn't it?

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Dane, you sent 270

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
27 day is almost exactly correct

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
That's actually really impressive

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Arco?

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
What are you guys thinking?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Come on, let's keep the energy high, right?

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
I don't understand

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
The energy

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Arco

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Never heard of that

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Arco is a great

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
You don't have Arco?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
No, but do you have compirling farms?

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
No, but at least I'm not shocked

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
at the notion of they're being a regional gas station

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
You're like, I wasn't

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
What?

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
I wasn't shocked, you said it so weirdly

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
That I can't even hear

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Wow, you know what?

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
I try my best to make a fun game for you guys to play on a Monday afternoon

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
All right, the price of Sprite

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
I think that's kind of fun

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
You guys are sitting at me time?

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Yeah, Mariko's doing one smiling

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Dane looks like he would

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I'm in fun, I don't know what you're talking about

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
All right, I'm merely like, oh yeah, whatever

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
I already, yeah, this is fucked up

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Arco, let's do it

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Arco, let's do it

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
I'm here, what's wrong?

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Just fucking call him 259

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
259, thank you, Dane

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
282, 282, Maria?

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
Can you, can you get them to actually scan it?

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
How's it?

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
272

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
272, all right

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
And a reminder, this is Arco

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
These are the movies

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
The person you have Skyled can't take your call now

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
At the cones, they're gonna record your message

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
When you have finished recording, simply hang up

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Or press the pound table for further actions

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
I was just calling to see

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
How much you charge for a 20 ounce bottle of Sprite

35:30.000 --> 35:37.520
Um, that doesn't matter. No leave them that's good.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.000
Can I say your phone number?

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Yeah. Yeah.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Oh, man.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Got them.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
I forgot.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
I'm so now I'm nervous that we're live any time.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
I'm about to burn myself.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
Traumatized.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Okay.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Chevron.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Bring us home, right?

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
We should say that who's in the lead here, right?

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
No idea. No idea.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
I think it's Marie.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
It's not enough.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
I don't think I've gotten this single one.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
That's true.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Chevron.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
I'm going to go fucking to 19 again.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
All right.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
245.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
That has been disconnected.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
No longer in service.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
Guys, the gas and fossil fuel industry is not thriving.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
I honestly started a lot better than I thought it would.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
I thought no one was going to pick up the phone.

36:28.000 --> 36:33.000
Well, I think a mere one.

36:33.000 --> 36:39.000
But if that's incorrect, I'll fix it in post.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
Americans really are paying at the pump.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
First, right?

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Nice.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
The hell is this?

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
What is this?

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
I try so hard to come up with new inventive segments that

36:54.000 --> 36:59.000
are not just like, oh, like Jesse or Paul McCartney who said this shit.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
You're calling gas stations.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
Yes.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Bullshit.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Right.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
It's basically who said this.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
Jesse or Paul McCartney bullshit.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
That's the same.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
Vinnie Thomas just tried to call me.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
But I think that he tried to call his cousin because he keeps doing that.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
He's like, oh, sorry.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
I meant to call my cousin Greg.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
Um, anyway.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Plugs.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
What do you guys got going on?

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
When you want to point to people too.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Unless there's something else you want to do.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
Because this was supposed to be a little bit longer than this, right?

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Yeah.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Yeah.

37:37.000 --> 37:44.000
I, I want to know what everyone mixes.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Sprite with.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
Like if you were at a, if you're at like a cook free cell machine.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Yeah.

37:50.000 --> 37:55.000
What do your flavor of choice be?

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Or raspberry ice teak and a guy.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Yeah.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
So not a side.

38:00.000 --> 38:06.000
I was going to say to keel up, but I don't think they provide that.

38:06.000 --> 38:12.000
I mean, you know, at an AMC with the bar, it's highly possible.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
I like the cherry, the cherry derivatives.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Yeah.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
Take a minute and we're going surely temples a lot recently.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
That's fun.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Which is what Granny means, right?

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Yeah.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Yeah.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Pardon my French.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
But I think it'd be nice to have like a petri dish with one bit of spit

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
from every lover I've ever had mixed into the spray.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Mm.

38:37.000 --> 38:42.000
What do you regionally call the drinks where you added all of the sodas?

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
I see what said.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Oh.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
What was that called for you?

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
I don't know why I had a name for it.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
We call them suicides.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Same.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
I've heard that one.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
But we're the fuck did it make sure.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
This is literally about to be over in five minutes.

39:02.000 --> 39:08.000
I came up with a punch up for the flan song.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Okay.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Actually two.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
One is much shorter and worse.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Let's start with that one.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
Flan, flan, flan, flan.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Like the thongs on.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
Correct.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
Nice.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
And then this one I like a little bit more.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Sorry.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
I'm going to try and find a karaoke version of it because otherwise it's not going to work.

39:45.000 --> 39:51.000
I like that you said you thought of a punch up and then you were like this is shorter and worse.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
The flan.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Have you had flan?

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
Truly Jeff sent me a text like a few weeks ago.

40:04.000 --> 40:10.000
That was a video of a thing of Reynolds rap foil.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
And it's him picking up the foil.

40:14.000 --> 40:19.000
And it's like when you say have you used this?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
The Reynolds rap.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
We had to use this.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
It made me laugh so hard.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Plugs.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
What do you guys got going on?

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
I'll just plug my shit up top because I got like to get the ball rolling at you.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
Every James on Instagram.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
That's all I ask of you.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
And this is a pit wall.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
It's better than this made it seem exactly right.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
I kind of butcher the bitch.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
This comes out April 7th.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
So yeah, I have nothing to plug.

40:53.000 --> 40:59.000

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
Listen, the pit wall.

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
Watch all of the headgum sketches that are coming out.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000

Some new off days.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
And you'd read the dumb ass.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Some new day in the strive we should say.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Oh, huge.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Spad Riley coming back.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
She's been back.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
You haven't been watching.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
She hasn't been there.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
She was there once.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
I'm at the her.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
I met her whole series that we started and posted one episode.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
I think there's like two of those coming.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Nice.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
We love that.

Been back for like a year.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Yeah.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
So how long can you say we're back?

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
It's like if I wish you a happy new year in March.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
It still surprises people.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
That's true.

42:35.000 --> 42:41.000
That pesky pandemic sort of interrupted the whole workflow.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
Yeah.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
Expectations of once a week.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
Every Friday.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Yeah.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
I don't know.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
It's been three years.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Really.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Yeah.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Mm.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Mm.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Mm.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
Usually you end on like a button.

43:05.000 --> 43:13.000
I want to see the car that I bought this model car.

43:13.000 --> 43:19.000
This was my I survived Jeff's 24-hour live stream.

43:19.000 --> 43:24.000
A purchase for myself.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
Meaning you survived watching.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
I know producing producing a lot of production for it.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Work for sure.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
For sure.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
Ultimately.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Yeah.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Ultimately.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
You know, I didn't stay up the full 24.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
It was more like 18 a break.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
Yeah.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
Another day.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
But.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Honestly seated by sleeping a little bit.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
It's probably harder than not sleeping.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
That's why I didn't sleep.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
That's why I didn't know I was sleeping for that.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
Yeah.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
So we could technically had it harder.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Because she was like.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Toiling with RAM.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
And then it was staff.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
I'm constantly toying with her.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
As established by the text.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
I sent it 330.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
Um.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
The other day.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
For sure.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
Yeah.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
Yeah.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Yeah.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Yeah.

44:23.000 --> 44:34.000
That was a hit dumb original.

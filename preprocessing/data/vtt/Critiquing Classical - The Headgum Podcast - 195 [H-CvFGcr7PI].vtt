WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Ready?

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Kind of, but like, why?

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
It's not that for me.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Did it, did it, did it?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
That for a while.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
But you know, you don't have the torture,

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
it's not a torture.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Beyond the show, is that where you're in the plane?

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
I'm implying that hearing a loud, clanging metal pipe is torturous.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
It's not torturous, that's how we come back from the break.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Yeah, it's torturous and how we come back from the break.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Yeah, I, I'm sorry.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Would you mind putting on your headphones?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Well, that's what I was saying.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
I don't, I feel like I don't need to wear the headphones

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
because I can hear you guys.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
We're all here. There's no Zoom aspect.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Oh, you don't feel like you need to wear the headphones.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Correct.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Then why am I wearing them?

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
So you can hear the sound effects?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Yeah, you're, the producer, the engineer.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Yeah, making sure the levels are fine.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
That's what I was going to say.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Are you recording?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Ali has both cans on.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Casey has won.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
You have none.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
So it's a nice gradient.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
We have everything covered.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
I heard the clap.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Don't eat.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
The sound effects are mixed so loudly that I could hear it

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
ambiently through other people's time.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Okay. Well, what about this one?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
A softer one.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
What's that?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Those cases saying what's that?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
How did you hear that?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Because I can, it's loud.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
All right.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Really?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Let's just, yeah.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
There's no way around it.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
You have to go through bond of the week.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
But here it is bond of the week.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
My, my pick is, um,

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I'm sorry.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
I didn't edit it from last week.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
So it still says James Bond Street.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
So why don't you guys go first and I'll figure out what the

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
on the way?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Yonic Center.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Hmm.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Who?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Yonic Center.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
He just won the Australian Open.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
He's Northern Italian.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Very tall.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Very slender.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
I had a hair.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
I thought you said great.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
And I'm not done.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
It looks great in a suit.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Hmm.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Speak's multiple languages.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
I thought you were going to see.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
He's a professional skier and a professional tennis player.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Yeah.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
He's.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Yes.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I thought you were going to say unique to center.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
What's that?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Somebody who has.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
For lack of a better term kind of.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Castred.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Don't get stunned.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
So many times that they don't deserve.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Balls to have.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
To have.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Beautiful singers.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Yonic singers.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Yeah.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Again, we just got to make it through.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Yeah.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Well, broccoli.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
We were calling upon you.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Have you guys ever called upon someone to do something?

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Because that's what's happening right now is that I'm begging broccoli

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
to make the choice.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
You know, it's like Roy Wood Jr.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
At the Emmys.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
I can't tell you're melding.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Please hire a host.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Oh.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
And then they just went back with John Stewart.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Yeah.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Yeah.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
So.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
What is this?

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
I don't know who Roy Wood Jr is.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
He's a comedian who is a correspondent on the daily show.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Everybody thought he was going to be the next host.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
And then they just went back to John Stewart because his apple show got canceled.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Because of apples corporate interests.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Yeah.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Yeah.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
They could handle the show for the three years in-between presidential elections.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
But, oh, yeah.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
It would actually help apple for another Trump presidency to happen.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Why?

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Yeah.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Why?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Looser sanctions.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Looser sanctions.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
That's my world.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
That's my world.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
You're one of the weakest looser sanctions and unit center.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Yeah.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
That's what I meant to say.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
I feel like I don't mean to trace it all back to this.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
But it's the fact that the walls are not-

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Oh, my God.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Oh.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
That I've been off my game the past few weeks.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Die at sea.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Looser sanctions are looser sanctions.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
It's a good question.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
My hair position is geo.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Uh,ality of a bond of the week.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Uh, Andre Agassie.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Okay.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
On the other tennis player.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Yeah.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Casey.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Victor Wimbyama.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Nice.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
It's all in skis.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Finally we made it past.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Um, I wanted to talk to you guys about something.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
What?

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Feel like we didn't delve into the victor of it all.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Wimbyama.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Wimbyama.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Fine.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
What more do you want to say about it?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Not me.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm here with us.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
I'm here.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Have I had a-

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
I feel like I'm actually pitching before.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Okay.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
It's not a familiar.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
So we don't need to dive into it.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Check the database.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Yeah.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Um, for already adds Lewis Hamilton.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Yeah.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Replacing Carlos signs.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
You guys hear about this?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
No.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
I saw you post.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Jeff.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Is this what this is?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Yeah.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
I mean, Casey.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Plug the pit wall and then also how do you feel?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Uh, yeah.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
The pit wall is a formula one podcast for casual fans.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Lewis Hamilton is a formula one driver.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Maybe the best to ever do it.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Seven-time world champion.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Looking for his eighth.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
And he's been driving with Mercedes for years.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
And he's leaving the team for Ferrari.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Wow.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Ferrari.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
That's crazy.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Yeah.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Exactly.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Why did he leave?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Why didn't you change?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
We don't know yet.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
I'm guessing.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
What did you say?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
You said why did he leave?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
And I said why didn't you change?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Because I was saying.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
And you didn't join.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I did not.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
That is.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Anyway, why did he leave?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
I'm guessing.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
I'm guessing.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
I'm sorry.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Yeah.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
I'm guessing he didn't think Mercedes was going to be competitive for a bit.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Did they pay him?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Is that how it works in F1?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Yeah.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
They definitely get paid to drive the cars.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
So how much did he get paid like before versus now?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Oh, he's definitely one of the highest paid drivers.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
I don't know exactly what their contracts are.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
But it's somewhere between like 50 and 80 million.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
A year?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
I think.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
I think that's over like four years.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Okay.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Over like four years.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Before years.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Before versus for our years.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
Before versus for our years.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Sure.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Moving on to permanent jewelry.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
What do you guys think?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
I can't stomach it.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Right?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
No, not for me.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Not for me either.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
What would what would be permanent?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
What kind of jewelry is permanent?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Bracelets, necklaces.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
You'll go.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
You'll go to the jeweler.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
And they almost like they use like a little burning thing.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
It's like gotter.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
It's gotter.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
They've gotterized it.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
So yeah.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Into your skin?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
No.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Idiot.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Around your wrist.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I'm trying to learn.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
It's just like welded around your wrist.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
So it'll never.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Yeah.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
It'll never fall.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
And then if you decide you're over it and you want to get it taken off.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
You have to go back to a place and have them like.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm not permanent at all.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Yeah.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
It's like a tattoo.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
You can get it removed.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
But it's not easy.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
What is permanent?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
And you know, if you're lazy.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
The only idea that I could see this being useful is in terms of chest.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Meaning.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
Just, you know, the permanent belts of it all just like welded onto your glands.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Does that make sense?

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
I don't mean to go to class early in the episode.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
I just am saying, that's, oh, I can see how that would be useful.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Yeah.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
So those who wish to stay chased.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
I think it's mostly like little bracelets.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Uh-huh.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Yeah.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
I get that.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I get that.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
I get that for sure.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Um.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
I mean, you know.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Yeah.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
Do you think chassis belt wares are the ones who want to be wearing it?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
You don't.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
You don't believe that someone else is making them wear it?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I think they want someone else to make them wear it.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
I'm pretty sure.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Someone else is making them wear those things.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I know, but they want the person to make them wear it.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
I mean, it was the Jonas Brothers parents that wanted them to wear their chest,

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
it rings.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Which honestly could have been permanent jewelry.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Not really.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
But a ring that's permanent just has to be sized thus that you couldn't have slid it on

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
and you can't get it past the knuckle.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I don't want to have this conversation.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
Please, moving on.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Um, moving on to, uh,

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Kirby enthusiasm is back and then gone.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
What, how do we feel?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
And also what's going to replace it?

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
I feel like we could have it a mere style show.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
That'd be cool.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
Instead of Kirby enthusiasm, it's like, curb, curb stop your boss and have an orgasm.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
It didn't exactly work.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
I just was wondering, like, yeah, if your teeth are gone gone and work at all.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I know, but I was like, it was a threat.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
It was a pitch.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
I would say Kirby enthusiasm is one of the funniest television shows of all time.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I agree.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
12 seasons is a lot.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Okay.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
So he gave it more than enough.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Uh, he did a great job and I'm sat to see it gone.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
But 25 years on TV.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
That's a lot.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Yeah, but only 12 seasons in 25 years.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Yeah.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
So takes time to reload and get inspired.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
I don't know.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Yeah.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I haven't really seen the last like six seasons.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
They're good.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
Uh, for whatever reason when they changed from like it looking shitty to it, looking a little nicer.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
I was like, I don't think I want to watch this now.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Also HD version.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Yeah.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
I feel like he's, you know, I love Larry David, but he has got looks started to look worse.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
So it's like that's when you really should be softening.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Yeah.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Yeah.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Yeah.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah.

09:48.000 --> 09:55.000
I really think I would have watched curve all the way through if they stayed in like standard definition.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Even today.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Interesting.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
Like if you want to spend more money on the aesthetic, you should shoot on film.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Sure.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Sure.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Yeah.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Did you see the sign fell to reunion season?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Yeah.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
I did watch that one.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Yeah.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
It was fantastic.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I think that one still looked shitty.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Yeah.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Exactly.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
I like the one where they read.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
They put up the producers.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Yeah.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
It's been stillers in it.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I mean, every season is great.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Yeah.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Was that your idea for that segment right there?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
No.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
I actually think we could pitch in a mirror vehicle, but you know, nobody wants to play along with

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
me today.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
So let's just move on.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
I guess.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
All right.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Here we go.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
This is not a segment.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
It's just something that I wanted to share.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Yeah.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
So video of people making a belt.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
You wanted to show us this?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Just let's all watch.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
I guess it's kind of cool.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
No audio, leather working.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
So nice looking belt.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
This is like, this is like a classic TikTok.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
You get surfer.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
It's like, why am I watching this?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
And it's a love 49.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Yeah.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
49 PM.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
I actually go to bed.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Watch this.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Watch this.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Keep watching it.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
And you realize it's like 45 minutes.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Pretty good.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
Like the process of watching this is.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Oddly satisfying as you don't know what to say.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Yeah.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
But what I wanted to run by you guys is.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
The.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
The final belt kind of looks like shit.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Right.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
It's like four inches wide.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Like no one's going to wear that.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Yeah.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
That was like a size.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
12.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Think it's shit.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Yeah.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
And we're about the process of making it.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
When they punch a hole, does it separate?

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Or is it literally removing that leather as a circle?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
If that makes sense.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
There's also.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Like text on the screen that's really small.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
That's like Mary and then Jeff turned it off.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Yeah.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Yeah.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
And then I go.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Um.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Now I don't need the headphones on.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I hear the sound effects outside of that.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Right.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Yeah.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Okay.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Pretty good episode.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
So far.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
So far we've done bond of the week.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
It looked at a belt.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
And I think that's the perfect time.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Two.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Yeah.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
See you later.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Here.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
This show is sponsored by better help guys.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
If you had an extra hour in your day, how would you spend it?

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
Because I would absolutely.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Fix all of my problems with the extra hour.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
That's the issue is that there aren't 25 hours in the day.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
So I can't become a better version of me.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Does that make sense?

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
But maybe you would want to go for a run or go for a nap.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Or go for reading a book.

13:06.000 --> 13:12.000
Because a lot of us spend our times wishing that we had more time in our day.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
And the question is time for what?

13:14.000 --> 13:21.000
Because if time was unlimited, how you would use it would infer your mental health and your happiness and your joy.

13:21.000 --> 13:28.000
The best way to squeeze that special thing into your schedule is to know what's important to you and make it a priority.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
Therapy can help you find what matters to you.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
So you can do more of it.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
I'm in therapy every week.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I've definitely benefited from it.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
And I would highly recommend it to anybody who has access to it.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
And better help makes it easier.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
So if you're thinking of giving therapy a try, start with better help.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
It's entirely online designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule.

13:50.000 --> 13:56.000
Just fill out a brief questionnaire and get matched with a licensed therapist and switch therapist at any time for no additional charge.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
Learn to make time for what makes you happy for what makes you get joy.

H-E-L-P dot com slash.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
What's that?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Thanks, better help.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
There it is.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
There it fucking is.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
We're back.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Yet again with that Friday feeling on a Thursday.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
But I'm just coming out.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Next Friday.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
We select February 9th or something.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Sure.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Yeah.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
So we'll have survived the atmospheric river.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Are you from my neighborhood?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Yeah.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
The moisture belts just whipping through California, creating a restaurant.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yes.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
A super storm, creating five, six, seven, eight inches of rain.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Absolutely.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
Which is like usually an entire winter's worth of moisture, just all happening.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Absolutely.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
In one, three to four days.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
It felt smooth, I would say.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Is that crazy?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
And we've got a sample of it today.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
It was an any teaser sampler platform.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Correct.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
And the torrential down.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
By the time this gets released, we'll have either survived or not.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Or not.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
That's what I was going to say.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Yeah.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Especially with your house.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
We input patients of it are potentially devastating.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
You're having a slight off the hill.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
From San Diego to San Francisco.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Yeah.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
San Diego to San Diego.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
All the same.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
All the same.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
All the stands are turning into sand.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
Because it's basically creating this wet, dirt, mud, sliding, moist, dry,

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
every day.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Unrelenting.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Unrelenting.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Why are there systems going to say it?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Where?

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Because?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
And nobody, nobody, nobody.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Nobody is going to ever.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
It's capable of how to happen until it happens.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
Because the next Friday, let's say the fucking Nazi.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
That's what we'll know.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Exactly.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
If we had survived this.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
So we're quite in this now.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
So you don't have to worry about power, electricity going out.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
I don't win.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Mind.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Yeah.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
Gale Force wins whipping, creating power line outages, internet outages.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
It's all in play.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
Um.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
This is a segment I like to call critiquing classical.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
You're yelling.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
You're not wearing your headphones.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
It's very loud.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
You really need your headphones for this one.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Um.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Before continues.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
This is a segment I like to call critiquing classical.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Um.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
I think something that they say when you're like, you know, writing a piece, right?

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
Whether it's music, whether it's a script to put people together,

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
characters together that have instant tension, you know?

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
Like for instance, um, there's nothing that like,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
I don't know.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
Peter MacArthur, you know, would say that I would agree with.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Really?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Nothing.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
Like he and I are like two opposite end of the spectrum in a certain way.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Have you ever met him?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I think I've said forward to the guy.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
But that's because we don't have much to talk about.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
You want to be?

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
You said forward.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
And you don't think he agree with anyone.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I can see it in his eyes.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
So my point is like, if you put Peter and I in a room, that's instant tension.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
And there's going to be some like, you know, interesting conversations.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
If nothing else.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
If not, you know, hilarity and suing.

17:06.000 --> 17:12.000
So I thought that what we could do is pair classical masterpieces with modern

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
dumbassery, which is to say we're going to listen to some

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
classical music on the show and see how that informs the rest of the show.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
If you have any critiques about me, the piece or each other or the world,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
that large, say them while the music plays.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Sure.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
And we have been having discussions here about, you know, playing music,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
but that's copyrighted music.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
So this is not copyrighted.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
Public domain, public domain.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
And like the performances are also not those are copyrighted.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Yeah.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Yeah.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
The piece is not the recording is.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
So we don't really know the legal ramifications of what's about to happen.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I know, but we also don't know how fun it might be of.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Yeah.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
It doesn't sound like it's that.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Good.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Just because you're saying, let's listen to classical.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Yeah.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
My understanding is you want us to just do the show while classical music is wax,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
but it's also kind of a draw the situation.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I wanted to see if I created this,

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
what I like to call it a container and arena that we can all play within.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Where it's like, okay, now we give it's happening.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Versus just like what the fuck are we all talking about?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Sure.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I also want there to be a critical bend to this.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
So, you know, let me see what I can kind of pick you guys apart for.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Oh, you're going to criticize.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Oh, I thought we were criticizing the song.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Or the song.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Criticize anything.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Okay.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Yeah.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Casey, have you ever been to Waltz?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
You wear this Waltz hat all the time.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Oh, yeah, I got a Waltz over time.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
That's what I was going to say.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Yeah.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Would you wear that hat at Waltz?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
No, never.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
And that's the thing.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
So whenever you're not with that Waltz, you have the hat.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Whenever you're at Waltz, you don't have that.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
I don't wear the Waltz hat at Waltz.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Correct.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Okay.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
And you know what?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
They don't make the yellow anymore.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
You're right.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
I'm not living the way that the music is swelling there.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
You put the music on.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
No, I know.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Oh, you're petite.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Right?

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
It's a little in your face the music.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I'm saying like, maybe like, there's subtlety.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
There's beauty in subtlety.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
So you want to stick critique the music now?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I'm critique anything that you're thinking of.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Okay.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Yeah.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
See?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I don't think this is a good idea.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
This segment.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Yeah.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
See, that's a good jumping off point.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
What would make it better?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
No classical music.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
But the whole segment is like the classical music.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Yeah, it's been to it.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Does that accent?

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Yeah.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
That's what I don't like about it.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Okay.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Well, that's a good start.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Do you know what this piece is?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
It's in my life to look at my laptop.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Sure, sure.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
It's Don Giovanni's overture for Mozart.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Okay.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Yeah.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Okay.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
It's good.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Thank you.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
No, that's the wrong thing to do, actually.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
You're supposed to be critiquing shit.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
It's like a Casey's brothers.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
America's brothers.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
And America's brothers.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
And Ali's brothers.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
But nobody's saying anything.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
It's just kind of staring at me.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Because we're trying to wrap our heads around.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
What is happening?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Well, isn't it more difficult because of the classical music?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
It is exactly right.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Yeah.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
It's a good thing.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Good thing.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
I did.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
I said the segment's not good.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Okay.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
But that's not good.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
I was just negative.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I was saying you should stop playing the classical music.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Then it's not a segment.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Then it's just like talking.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Right.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
That's fine.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Is it?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
I don't think you should make a mistake.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
The music makes it a container.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I said an arena to play with this.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
It's playing.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
It is.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Now it's more fun.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Thank you.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
And now there's like a little bit of whims you going on.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Which I'm not sure.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Yeah.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
I like the song.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
You can just put it on the show.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
You can just put it on the show.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Because everybody's just staring me to dead up the eyes.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Let's be honest.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
The song slaps.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Don't say anything.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Okay.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Okay.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
All right.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
This is actually pretty dope.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Yeah.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
We want you to do say Mozart.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
I have a note for him.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
You don't have a note for Mozart.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
What about a note for the show?

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
No, for Casey.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
You know, for a mirror.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
A note for your ass.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
We did get a note for the show.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
I feel like I fear that you guys both took the headphones off.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
And it's like it here.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I can hear it from the headphones.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
I know.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
But then it's like, you're not.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Yeah.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
I'm not immersing myself in the music.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
What are you talking about?

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
What are you talking about?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Do you read it?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
You're not in the arena.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
If you don't have headphones.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Do you love Mozart and the jungle?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Are you sad about canceled?

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
I don't know what that is.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Have you seen it on the day?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Yeah.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
On the day is.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Do you see it?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Have I heard of it?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
I have that.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
I have that.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I have that.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
I have that.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Yeah.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Yeah.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
See.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Now it's a time where it's swelling in the, in that

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
It's so loud the way you put it in our headphones.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
So I like the way it sounds from the distance.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
Are you going to edit that audio in or just have it bleed through our microphone?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Were you in bands growing up?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
I had to play the clarinet growing up.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Okay.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Had to.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Yeah.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Why?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
You had to learn an instrument in school.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
So I learned that in high school.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
I chose the last school order.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
They got rid of instrument.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
They don't have any instruments.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
No music.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
No.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
No.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
It's foot loose.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
No dancing or singing.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
It's a strict, no rejoicing.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Right?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
You said you had to play the clarinet.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
But it seems like you had to play it.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
And you chose the clarinet.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
I chose the clarinet.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
But what am I going to play the viola?

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Play guitar.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
That was not an option.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Believe me.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
I would have played the guitar.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
I did French horn.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Yeah.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Yeah.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
That was going well.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
It's not going well.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Really.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
I feel like it was half-baked.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Yeah.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Not an idea.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
No.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
It's now kind of to me sounding like Jeff's internal soundtrack.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
I see.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
That is crazy.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Yeah.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
This is what it.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
This is a little too sophisticated for what is actually happening in Jeff's head.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Yeah.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
But I think the emotions.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
I thought that there would be excuse me out of distance.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Yeah.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Yeah.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
I don't even know when your sentence is end because it's so loud in my headphones.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
So take it off.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
I can't.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Because I'm not in the arena.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Yeah.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
It's like he's resenting the arena that he put us in.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
I, yeah.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Container he created.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Yeah.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
It's hard because I did so much to help you guys.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Right.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
And I start to resent how much I did to help you.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Right.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Yeah.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
What did you do to help us?

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Just kind of set up the container container.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Yeah.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
To play in.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Right.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
So then it's like that's half-baked.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Let's look at the belt video.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Yeah.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
I think there was some more there to mine for us.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
We left that pretty fertile soil.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
There was two more songs.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
But it went so poorly that I feel like we have to figure something out.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
You want to see this for another 10 minutes?

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
I thought it was going to be like 20 minutes a second, where we were all just going

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
to dive into each other and kind of argue over classical.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
We did want to argue, but I don't think the music was making us want to.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
And also you kind of made it seem like you wanted us to point out things about each other

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
that we don't like.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Yeah.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
I don't mind that.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Yeah.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
And then you said to note myself, I don't, I'm not giving any notes.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Well, I got it.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
It's good that you brought that up because I could do this again.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
I took this little video.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I'll take a photo now.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Yeah.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
On the last recording we did of your wearing same boots that we did.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Correct.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Correct.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
The last recording.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
And I noticed on how your ankles.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Only feel like half of the screen.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Half of the screen.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Yeah.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Yeah.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
No, I don't know if you guys took a photo.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
I'll send it to you.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
A lot of the vibe between the heel and the grip.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
This is what I'm talking about.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Yeah.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
Because it's hard to find shoes that have a thin opening like that.

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
Well, it's hard to find out that case has been thinking about this for a week.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Three days.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Okay.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Yeah.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Because we did this on Tuesday.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Yeah.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Oh, that camera's not facing you anymore.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Are you using the GoPro?

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Yeah.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
It does look better a little bit on these monitors.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
What the GoPro?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Yeah.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Yeah.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
Set up everything to look correct.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
I appreciate it.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
We're pointing in the right direction.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
That's what I was going to say.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
And if it's the show heading in the right direction.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
This one goes.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
All right.

24:56.000 --> 25:01.000
Here's something you'll all respect your sample.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Okay.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
Slack or text it.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Yeah.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Yeah.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
You could really, if you zoom in, you could really see how much space is in there.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
And that boop.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Yeah.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Yeah.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
So.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
That's interesting.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
That's hard.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Because like, let me send you whatever mind to you.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Yeah.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
Because these boots are my size through the foot.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Not through the ankle.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Yeah.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
And you can't know that from ordering boots online.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
They don't have an ankle size.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
You can email customer support.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
You think I'm going to email those fuckers?

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
I do.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
I think you'll email them right now.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
Hindsight 2020.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
I would have ordered half size down.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
But any smaller than that, I would have me blisters for sure.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
It would have been me blisters for sure.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Oh my god.

25:53.000 --> 26:00.000
They put it to a fan vote if they want the new NBA logo to be that or Kobe.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
And that edges it out.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
Can you see the similarities, though?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
I get it.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
You sort of have that.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
I see the similarities.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
I see the similarities.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
In the area.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
Yeah.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
For sure.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
You wanted criticism.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
You're not that personal.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Right?

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
You know I'm something about my fangles.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
What do you why?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
This is body shaving.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Right?

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
I wanted you to be like, oh, you know,

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Jeff's hair is off.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Jeff's like waste.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I hear looks good.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Now you're mad at me.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
No, let's just.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Yeah.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Did you say the way it recently?

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
It does look like.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Curlier almost.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Yeah.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
I shouldn't put it today.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Sorry.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Oh.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
It's supposed to record a good podcast right now.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
You have.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
You have an alert for recording.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
That's a half hour after recording.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Yeah.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
I get the the alert being like you are exactly where you're supposed to be.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Uh-huh.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
Um, you know, I was reading this article today that said the psychology of

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
New Year's resolutions with which two weeks ago we told out resolutions.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
Uh, I figured A we could kind of check in on those because it was saying that

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
it's more successful to set a goal for the New Year in February statistically.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Then it isn't January.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
So I wanted to check in.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Amir, how's that?

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
How's that youth?

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Are you embodying young?

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
Um, that wasn't my resolution.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
That's the one I gave to you.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Yeah.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Yeah.

27:30.000 --> 27:35.000
Well, I got I had the flu and then I've been sick for all of January really.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Yeah.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
It's probably embodying young sort of feeling old.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Hmm.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.000
Yeah, but in a way kids get sick often because they're still building that immunity.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
Do you feel like you're on the upswing of your immunity or do you feel like you're on the

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
downswing of life?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Well, I turned 41.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
So that feels like I'm.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Yeah, just slightly over that.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Yeah.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Hill.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Okay.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Average age wise.

27:59.000 --> 28:04.000
Well, I think by the time like you're 80, they're going to come up with like some medicine

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
some science stuff where you'll be able to live to like 120.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Yeah.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
And you think that the medicine's going to be colloidal silver or I haven't looked into

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
the science.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Yeah.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
I don't know exactly how they're going to make it happen, but I do believe.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
We are all going to be living and working into our hundreds.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Yeah.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Yeah.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Oh.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
Imagine being 108 and going to an office.

28:28.000 --> 28:37.000
That's some point that song's going to be like a greatest hit.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Yeah.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
It's going to be a classic winery version.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Yeah.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Yeah.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
The oldies channel will be playing Freddie Walk.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
I got frogs in Atlanta.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Yeah.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
What?

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
This is one of the best.

28:53.000 --> 28:59.000
I was in here when we did the New Year's resolution episode.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
You were here for the first time.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
My wrist hit the trackpad.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Yeah.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
It's a problem of your angles with your wrist.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Yeah.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Yeah.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Yeah.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
They kind of protrude like.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Yeah.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Yeah.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Like a Tetris piece.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
You were there.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Well, I brought in the flame.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
You brought in the flame.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Yeah.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
And you want me to do a lot of resolution for you.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Yeah.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
I'm worried that every episode of this year is going to be meeting like dulling our

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
resolutions, checking your work.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
You're worried about that.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Yeah.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
So don't do it.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
You're in charge.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
If you're worried about something about this show, just do the opposite.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Yeah.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Yeah.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Yeah.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
I was going to say that.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
We did talk about on that episode that you've been to a lot of places where

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
the veil is thin.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
The veil is thin?

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Yeah.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
You know, even though high, you've been to Topang River.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Oh, yeah.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
You know, my fear for you is that you're not grounding yourself enough in this spiritual

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
dimension this realm.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
That's fair.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Yeah.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
What's that?

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Yeah.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Yeah.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Yeah.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I just like you want to be so far.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Yeah.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Yeah.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Yeah.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Yeah.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
My head's hurt.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
My head is too in that class.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Well, beyond the clouds.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
I mean, it's out of the stratosphere.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Right.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
That's my fear for you.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
I'm listening.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Yeah.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
You're not agreeing.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
I want to see where you're going to go with it.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
I'm already almost there.

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
This way, you should have been agreeing or not.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
I can't agree.

30:23.000 --> 30:29.000
I want Ali to go to places where it's like, you're nowhere near the veil.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Okay.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
So, you know, veil.

30:32.000 --> 30:40.000
Fucking Cincinnati Louisville.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
San Diego.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
What's that?

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Have you been a Cincinnati?

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I have been in the airport.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Have you been to Louisville?

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
I have been there.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Did you go to the Louisville slugger factory?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
No.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
I went to the library of our.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Okay.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Okay.

30:56.000 --> 31:01.000
So, you places where there's like, is it kind of a spiritual or a thicker air?

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Yeah.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Sort of something that's weighing you down physically.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
And for the I theme, but think theme parks think commerce.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Right.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Yeah.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Okay.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
That sounds awful.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Not like a resolution I've ever heard of for sure.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
It sounds like not like a resolution.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Yeah.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
It sounds like an itinerary.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
It sounds like a mandate.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
That's yeah.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Yeah.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
So you want Ali to like go to apkott.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Go to veil.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Go to apkott.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Place where the veil is thick.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Yeah.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
So thick air.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Yeah.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
So how has that been going for you so far?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Well, it hasn't happened yet.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Oh, January.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
I think since I've been set out on my quest so far, I'm doing it.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Okay.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
I've never been available.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
I've been to Louisville.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Louisville.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Yeah.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
In terms of this year's resolution.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
No.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
I've just been here here.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
This will month.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
I've just been here.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Especially this episode.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
Yeah.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
What's that?

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Um, Casey, your resolution was go Hollywood.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
How's the funding coming for the two movies that you have?

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
What is kind of on a bigger scale?

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
What is on our scale?

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
Uh, yeah, uh, working on them.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Uh, something will be made this year.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
I promise you that.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
I make that promise.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
I'll make that promise to the listeners.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
Hold me accountable.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Yeah.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Gonna make a movie.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
It's happening.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
I had a meeting last week.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
When?

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
My producers.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Okay.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
Figuring out, you know, the pre-production stuff scheduling.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Yeah.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
And you think that these, you think they actually are the real dealer.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
You think that they're going to string you along.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
And they're not going to get the money.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
And then it's going to be like, guys, guys, where are you?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
You know, where are we at on this?

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
And they're like, oh, yeah.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
We're almost there.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
We're almost going to start producing this.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
These guys know, these, uh,

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
I'm making a movie with a close group of people.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
And how are you doing?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Getting into that closeness circle?

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Not well.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Right.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
I invited him to the table.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Yeah.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Uh, interesting.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
And then I would have heard him play one of the parts.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Oh, my god.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Considering casting him.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Wow.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
And then I come.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
You're not sure.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Yeah.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Didn't show up at all.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Did he say it was going to come?

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
I don't remember.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Did you say you were going to come?

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
And you just flaked?

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Or I said, I could come to one of the days.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
And then you did it on a different day.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
No, wait.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
No.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
I remember, uh, I did it specifically on the day that you said you could.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
And then you said you were tired.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
No, no, no, no.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
It's that my dad is severely immunocompromised.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
And he asked if I could lay low before it traveled home.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Hmm, interesting.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
You didn't relay that to me.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
I think I did.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
I don't think so.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Uh-huh.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
He would have remembered severely immunocompromised.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Yeah.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
It's a pretty terrifying two words.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Well, it's hard.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
You know, I mean, let's be honest, as long as we're critiquing.

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
Casey's been absent for the past couple months.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
All you can think about is projects, which is, by the way, part of the reason.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
His nearest resolution that I'm giving him is to go Hollywood.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
It's like, just make the movie so you can stop talking about it.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Sounds like he can.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
I think you talk about it more than I do.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
That's true.

34:03.000 --> 34:12.000
I'll have a new shampoo here once a week.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Yeah.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Yeah.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
You guys never ask me any questions about me.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Let's get some questions for good old Jeff.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Do you think Asian?

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Yeah.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Do you have a skin care regimen?

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Do.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
What is it?

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
It's...

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Drop it, King.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Drop it, King.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Drop it, King.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
It keeps happening.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
It gets more happening.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
I'm going to wake up in a cold sweat.

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
Um, Sarah V.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Yeah.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
Sorry.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
I do the same.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
Sorry to make it about me.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Talk about the movie.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
I don't want to.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Tell me what kind of Sarah V.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
How much money do you have?

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
How much money do you need?

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Let ask.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
How much money do you need to stop talking about the funding?

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
To stop talking about the beatings with producers.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Anyway, it's happening.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
What is happening?

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Sarah V. in the shower.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Filming face.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
Lotion wise.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
Are you so happy about the Michael Sarah campaign?

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
I'm indifferent.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
I don't like it.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
I don't like it.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
It makes me cleansing my face.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
If there's a celebrity endorsement or not.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Oh, it makes every difference to me.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Do you like it?

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
I love it.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
I love it.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I love celebrity endorsement.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
I love it.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
I'll buy something.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
I'm susceptible.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
If I think that someone cool likes it, I'll get it too.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Interesting.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
You're an alpha consumer.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Yeah.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Don't just repeat what I'm saying.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
I'm trying to be more like your ass.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Is that alpha?

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Is it beta?

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Because it's kind of follower.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Yeah.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
That's someone that just repeated what I said.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Yeah.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
I'm just gonna later.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Yeah.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
It's Sarah V in the shower.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Like filming face.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Or there's a lot of different.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Sarah V.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
So she could be using.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
How is it a drama?

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Is it a drama?

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
I obviously want to talk about the movie.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
You better not sing me that.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
And you're trying to make it.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
I'm trying to get more details out of your routine.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
By routine.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
But it's really just about how much cash you want us to write you checks.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
I have not mentioned money at all.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
You mentioned movie and meetings with producers.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
You brought it up.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
You mentioned the table read.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
The ceremony.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
Non-foming ceremony in the shower.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Great.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Fucking moisturizer.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
One kind.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
It's doctor something.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
That's every day.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
That's perfect.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
That's for feet.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
You've been putting foot moisturizer in your face.

36:45.000 --> 36:52.000
My term has said that my facial skin and structure is a little thin to a foot.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Okay.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
No, I'm pulling up the actual name of it right now.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
You guys are free to talk amongst yourselves so that the onus isn't always fucking on me.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
And don't say, oh, but you host the show.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
I can't make something out of nothing.

37:05.000 --> 37:10.000
You just said, why don't you guys ask me questions.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Then we did.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Now you're mad.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
It's like lorosh posse or something.

37:15.000 --> 37:20.000
I always, yeah, yeah, I call that lorosh posse.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
No, yeah, I can see.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
Because there's like a little bit of posse left.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I want to get high off.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
And you wear that on your face.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
Is that an everyday thing or pride?

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
I wear it on my face and pride.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Okay.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Okay.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Okay, French.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
French.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
I'm believable.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Um, that's nice.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Good for you.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
What are your guys?

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Drop your guys' face routine or whatever.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
I'm still trying to pull it up because it's some.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
It's not lorosh to posse.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I actually don't think it's something else.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
It's docked or something.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
Are you serivy, foaming facial cleanser in the shower?

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
And then serivy moisturizer.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
I kind of gathered ducks.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
You're really, really hoping that he was using foaming two.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
You really took the floor right there.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
You just said time about hour.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
You're still cleansing how you're comfortable.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
You were in taking the floor.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
There should be some tips.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
I was taking back in off the fact that you.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
I'm a serivy.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
Do you serve me because Alex Alban is a skin flu answer for it?

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
Are you serivy?

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Serivy?

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Because Alex Burkeman mentioned it.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Why did you pick a player in that?

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
You see more Obo.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Because they didn't have the Obo.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
The school had the fucking instruments.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
You just had to bring your own reads.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Lou or other.

38:39.000 --> 38:44.000
This is not going on.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
You don't think it's going well.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
No.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
I walked into the office.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
I said it was going to be an amazing episode.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Why?

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Did you have a plan?

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
It was developed.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
So that you guys would have fun during it.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
It was loose.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Yeah.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
It wasn't like, oh, jafferty.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
It wasn't like quote match.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
It was like, what about something that's a little bit looser.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
We get to talk about our skin routines.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
Right.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
I'm talking about it.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
It's fucking funding.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
You said you had a perfect segment for on.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Yeah.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
I said I have a perfect game going for on.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Radio for you.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
Yeah.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
And that she should come at the 20 to 40 minute mark.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
Did you think the classical music section was something that she

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
would really like slash want to participate in?

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
He loves Mozart.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
And that was a Mozart original.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
She does.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Yeah.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
It was on her.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
It was her second most listened to artist on her spot.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
She was a Mozart for Halloween.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
That's right.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Yeah.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
There's such a thing.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
Old Faden MD vital boost moisturizer.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
It's not cheap, but it works well.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
No free pub.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Uh-huh.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Yeah.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
I'm going to black.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
I'm going to black out.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Of my memory.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Of the episode and a black part.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Bam.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Bam.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
Old Faden MD bright eyes for dark circles.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Oh.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Yeah.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
It's so nice.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
And then I usually use skin suitors.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Sudicals vitamin C serum, but it's.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
That's too expensive.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
So I've been not using that.

40:04.000 --> 40:04.980
Yeah.

40:04.980 --> 40:07.980
What about you guys?

40:07.980 --> 40:08.980
I actually don't use anything.

40:08.980 --> 40:09.980
You don't wash your face?

40:09.980 --> 40:10.980
No.

40:10.980 --> 40:13.980
I don't mean I wash my face in the shower, but I don't use a face wash.

40:13.980 --> 40:14.980
And I don't use a moisturizer.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.980
You're saying this, like, we're going to be like, really?

40:16.980 --> 40:17.980
Yeah.

40:17.980 --> 40:18.980
We know.

40:18.980 --> 40:20.980
Because I seem shocked.

40:20.980 --> 40:24.980
I'm a very, like, oily skin by default.

40:24.980 --> 40:29.980
So, like, the idea of putting stuff on there always kind of scared me.

40:29.980 --> 40:33.980
Like, when I wasn't more of an acne-ridden teen, I used to, like, get, like, the, you know,

40:33.980 --> 40:36.980
specific face washes and medications and stuff.

40:36.980 --> 40:40.980
But now it's an older man and older, older gentleman.

40:40.980 --> 40:44.980
Did you ever get a kill done intense pulse light therapy or something?

40:44.980 --> 40:49.980
It's like, it's for dry eyes, but it also helps with pariodonticalization.

40:49.980 --> 40:52.980
I guess if I had that I would.

40:52.980 --> 40:54.980
I guess if I had that I would.

40:54.980 --> 40:55.980
You have it.

40:55.980 --> 40:56.980
It's unbelievable.

40:56.980 --> 40:57.980
I have it.

40:57.980 --> 40:58.980
But it could return to any moment.

40:58.980 --> 40:59.980
I would have to do the IPL.

40:59.980 --> 41:00.980
I mean, the lights are pretty bright.

41:00.980 --> 41:01.980
So I don't know what you see.

41:01.980 --> 41:02.980
Yeah.

41:03.980 --> 41:06.980
You're under a microscope on the show, not only emotionally, but also physically.

41:06.980 --> 41:07.980
You think I have what rosacea?

41:07.980 --> 41:09.980
It's not me thinking it.

41:09.980 --> 41:11.980
It's just a comment section, man.

41:11.980 --> 41:14.980
Everyone's talking about it.

41:14.980 --> 41:15.980
They're saying, all right.

41:15.980 --> 41:16.980
Now we're getting somewhere.

41:16.980 --> 41:19.980
You can feel the energy waves getting a little bit better.

41:19.980 --> 41:20.980
We're all on the same wavelength.

41:20.980 --> 41:22.980
That's not a lot of, by the way, this is what I'm seeing.

41:22.980 --> 41:23.980
It's time three.

41:25.980 --> 41:26.980
Yeah.

41:26.980 --> 41:27.980
Yeah.

41:27.980 --> 41:28.980
Okay.

41:28.980 --> 41:29.980
We're accusing us of having skin diseases.

41:29.980 --> 41:30.980
I'm not accusing.

41:31.980 --> 41:32.980
You don't go to the doctor.

41:32.980 --> 41:35.980
And you're like, do I have a dissected carotid artery?

41:35.980 --> 41:36.980
And you're like, I'm a kid.

41:36.980 --> 41:37.980
You're not a doctor.

41:37.980 --> 41:38.980
Yeah.

41:38.980 --> 41:39.980
Not an doctor.

41:43.980 --> 41:44.980
I am not a doctor.

41:44.980 --> 41:45.980
Mm-hmm.

41:45.980 --> 41:48.980
That being said, I have been at the doctor a lot recently.

41:48.980 --> 41:51.980
So I think I can speak with a certain edge.

41:51.980 --> 41:52.980
How are your eyes?

41:52.980 --> 41:53.980
Not well.

41:53.980 --> 41:54.980
Really.

41:54.980 --> 41:55.980
Yeah.

41:55.980 --> 41:56.980
They look cloudy.

41:56.980 --> 41:57.980
Yeah.

41:57.980 --> 41:58.980
They always do.

41:58.980 --> 42:00.980
I have a pinguecula.

42:00.980 --> 42:07.980
Which means, which means it's like a non-cancerous growth due to UV light and dry eyes.

42:07.980 --> 42:12.980
Um, but I might have a needle stuck into that eye.

42:12.980 --> 42:13.980
Oh, my god.

42:13.980 --> 42:14.980
Right through the middle?

42:14.980 --> 42:18.980
I guess near this tissue that would inject like it.

42:22.980 --> 42:24.980
I'm not like infallible.

42:24.980 --> 42:26.980
You're staring at me like that shouldn't have messed me up.

42:26.980 --> 42:27.980
Yeah.

42:27.980 --> 42:29.980
I'm talking about a very invasive medical procedure.

42:29.980 --> 42:32.980
But I might need to get 12 times in a row.

42:32.980 --> 42:33.980
12 times in a row.

42:33.980 --> 42:34.980
In a year I said, not a row.

42:34.980 --> 42:35.980
You said it in a row.

42:35.980 --> 42:36.980
You said it in a row.

42:36.980 --> 42:40.980
I said in a year I meant you also are constantly getting procedures.

42:40.980 --> 42:42.980
So this shouldn't rattle you.

42:42.980 --> 42:43.980
I got probed.

42:43.980 --> 42:44.980
Greg.

42:44.980 --> 42:45.980
Yes.

42:45.980 --> 42:46.980
With a rod.

42:46.980 --> 42:47.980
Yeah.

42:47.980 --> 42:48.980
Where?

42:48.980 --> 42:49.980
You're fucking eyelid.

42:49.980 --> 42:50.980
Yes.

42:50.980 --> 42:51.980
He talked about it all the time.

42:51.980 --> 42:52.980
You do like a weird.

42:52.980 --> 42:54.980
Why is this not a shot in that dress?

42:54.980 --> 42:55.980
Yeah.

42:56.980 --> 42:58.980
Another thing on your would love.

42:58.980 --> 42:59.980
Right?

42:59.980 --> 43:00.980
Right.

43:00.980 --> 43:01.980
She's here.

43:01.980 --> 43:02.980
She won't do the show.

43:02.980 --> 43:05.980
She was like, I have to go live at five.

43:05.980 --> 43:07.980
And I was like, this show's going to be over by five.

43:07.980 --> 43:08.980
Yeah.

43:08.980 --> 43:09.980
And she still wouldn't guessed.

43:09.980 --> 43:11.980
And then she said, what time do you need me to come on?

43:11.980 --> 43:13.980
I said 420 to 440.

43:13.980 --> 43:14.980
It's 447.

43:14.980 --> 43:16.980
She knows that it's 447.

43:16.980 --> 43:17.980
And she refused to come.

43:17.980 --> 43:18.980
Okay.

43:18.980 --> 43:19.980
Okay.

43:19.980 --> 43:20.980
I guess maybe that's the thing.

43:20.980 --> 43:22.980
When you guys respond with like, okay.

43:22.980 --> 43:24.980
It's like, then the audience is like,

43:24.980 --> 43:26.980
Jeff is like going off the deep end today.

43:26.980 --> 43:27.980
You are.

43:27.980 --> 43:28.980
No, I'm not.

43:28.980 --> 43:29.980
You said I have the ankles.

43:29.980 --> 43:31.980
You said they had cloudy eyes.

43:31.980 --> 43:33.980
You said, oh, fun my movie for free.

43:33.980 --> 43:34.980
No points on the back end.

43:34.980 --> 43:36.980
Then why would I call you this?

43:36.980 --> 43:38.980
I'm not going to give you the check.

43:38.980 --> 43:40.980
I'm not here to be patronizing the art.

43:40.980 --> 43:41.980
Scaticy.

43:41.980 --> 43:42.980
I said, go all you want.

43:42.980 --> 43:44.980
I said, you have two scripts.

43:44.980 --> 43:45.980
Make one or both.

43:45.980 --> 43:47.980
I've got three scripts.

43:47.980 --> 43:49.980
So make one of the three.

43:49.980 --> 43:50.980
I think it's weird.

43:50.980 --> 43:51.980
It's weird.

43:51.980 --> 43:53.980
It's a mirror called to make show me movie.

43:54.980 --> 43:55.980
I know.

43:55.980 --> 44:00.980
But then just get out of your own way and make the bitch.

44:00.980 --> 44:02.980
It's not about how much money you have.

44:02.980 --> 44:05.980
It's kind of about whether the producers are ready.

44:05.980 --> 44:08.980
It's go Hollywood or don't.

44:08.980 --> 44:09.980
Okay.

44:09.980 --> 44:11.980
You're right.

44:11.980 --> 44:15.980
That's the tone of an inspirational speech.

44:15.980 --> 44:17.980
It was like kind of gibberish.

44:17.980 --> 44:19.980
Yeah, lacking any sort of direction.

44:19.980 --> 44:21.980
It doesn't matter if you have money.

44:22.980 --> 44:23.980
It was a military.

44:23.980 --> 44:24.980
It was a military.

44:24.980 --> 44:25.980
Yeah.

44:25.980 --> 44:26.980
It was a milkshake.

44:26.980 --> 44:29.980
Because it's somewhat lacking a nutritional value.

44:29.980 --> 44:30.980
What I was saying.

44:30.980 --> 44:31.980
Totally.

44:31.980 --> 44:32.980
But there is some truth.

44:32.980 --> 44:34.980
There's some calcium.

44:34.980 --> 44:35.980
Yeah.

44:35.980 --> 44:37.980
It's a fairly vitamin D deficiency.

44:37.980 --> 44:42.980
I think you're right about how that speech was as useful as a milkshake is healthy.

44:42.980 --> 44:43.980
Well, no.

44:43.980 --> 44:46.980
You can't change the advocacy there.

44:46.980 --> 44:47.980
It has to be.

44:47.980 --> 44:50.980
It was as useful as a milkshake was useful.

44:50.980 --> 44:53.980
It's actually healthy.

44:53.980 --> 44:54.980
So.

44:54.980 --> 44:57.980
You're useful in terms of health is healthy.

44:57.980 --> 44:58.980
Yes.

44:58.980 --> 44:59.980
Yeah.

44:59.980 --> 45:00.980
Right.

45:00.980 --> 45:04.980
I mean, do you feel inspired at all by what I say?

45:04.980 --> 45:05.980
Yeah.

45:05.980 --> 45:07.980
But I've already been.

45:07.980 --> 45:10.980
I'm going to make a move like a real small move.

45:10.980 --> 45:12.980
That's more than I've heard you say.

45:12.980 --> 45:15.980
We're looking at like 10 day shoot schedule.

45:15.980 --> 45:16.980
Yeah.

45:16.980 --> 45:18.980
I'm going to be real low five.

45:18.980 --> 45:19.980
You could do it for like 50 grand.

45:19.980 --> 45:21.980
Because then you don't need five grand a day.

45:21.980 --> 45:22.980
Yeah.

45:22.980 --> 45:23.980
That's about what we're looking at.

45:23.980 --> 45:24.980
That is what he said.

45:24.980 --> 45:26.980
But what if you could get 100.

45:26.980 --> 45:27.980
If we get 100.

45:27.980 --> 45:28.980
Yeah.

45:28.980 --> 45:29.980
That's 10 grand a day.

45:29.980 --> 45:30.980
Yeah.

45:30.980 --> 45:33.980
And that would allow us to play a little bit more with some stuff.

45:33.980 --> 45:34.980
Yeah.

45:34.980 --> 45:36.980
I mean, I know you want Casey to go Hollywood, go Hollywood.

45:36.980 --> 45:38.980
What about when he's gone Hollywood?

45:38.980 --> 45:39.980
Oh, yeah.

45:39.980 --> 45:42.980
Then don't forget the people who inspired you along the way.

45:42.980 --> 45:44.980
Valley, mirror, me.

45:44.980 --> 45:45.980
I don't know.

45:45.980 --> 45:47.980
I think you might miss these times.

45:48.980 --> 45:49.980
You specifically.

45:49.980 --> 45:52.980
I wish somebody would have told us that these were the good old days.

45:52.980 --> 45:57.980
That's how I feel about the beginning of this show before I was forced, by the way, to make a video podcast.

45:57.980 --> 45:59.980
Because I used to edit the shit out of this stuff.

45:59.980 --> 46:00.980
And that's why people loved it.

46:00.980 --> 46:01.980
It was tight.

46:01.980 --> 46:04.980
All this stuff that, you know, basically this whole episode would have been.

46:04.980 --> 46:07.980
It would have been cut other than me, maybe screaming at Casey and maybe, yeah.

46:07.980 --> 46:10.980
I thought there was always like a video component would zoom.

46:10.980 --> 46:14.980
We did it over zoom, but there was no video until I think episode like 80.

46:14.980 --> 46:15.980
Interesting.

46:15.980 --> 46:16.980
Yeah.

46:17.980 --> 46:20.980
And we're losing them now that it's the video because you can't cut shit out.

46:20.980 --> 46:22.980
You can't cut the silences.

46:22.980 --> 46:23.980
When I say, okay.

46:23.980 --> 46:24.980
Really?

46:24.980 --> 46:26.980
That's why there's multiple cameras so you can.

46:26.980 --> 46:27.980
You've got to cut something.

46:27.980 --> 46:28.980
Yeah.

46:28.980 --> 46:29.980
You've got to cut something.

46:29.980 --> 46:30.980
Yeah.

46:30.980 --> 46:31.980
You just don't want to do it.

46:31.980 --> 46:32.980
No.

46:32.980 --> 46:33.980
Well, it's just, you know, I don't have the time or energy.

46:33.980 --> 46:35.980
You don't have the energy.

46:35.980 --> 46:36.980
Sorry.

46:36.980 --> 46:37.980
Yeah.

46:37.980 --> 46:38.980
Definitely have the time.

46:38.980 --> 46:39.980
Yep.

46:39.980 --> 46:40.980
Yeah.

46:40.980 --> 46:41.980
Because I don't do anything else.

46:41.980 --> 46:42.980
Yep.

46:42.980 --> 46:43.980
Great.

46:43.980 --> 46:44.980
I inspire.

46:44.980 --> 46:45.980
I actually resent the occasion.

46:45.980 --> 46:46.980
I don't do anything else.

46:46.980 --> 46:48.980
Go ahead and inspire.

46:48.980 --> 46:49.980
Who?

46:49.980 --> 46:50.980
Casey.

46:50.980 --> 46:52.980
Casey.

46:52.980 --> 46:53.980
Casey and others.

46:53.980 --> 46:54.980
Do you want me to inspire you?

46:54.980 --> 46:55.980
I'm okay.

46:55.980 --> 46:56.980
I'd love it.

46:56.980 --> 46:57.980
To inspire.

46:57.980 --> 46:58.980
I'm yours.

46:58.980 --> 46:59.980
Inspire you know.

46:59.980 --> 47:00.980
No.

47:00.980 --> 47:02.980
Inspire me.

47:02.980 --> 47:05.980
Let me guess.

47:05.980 --> 47:06.980
Okay.

47:06.980 --> 47:11.980
Someone along your journey said you couldn't do it.

47:11.980 --> 47:13.980
Am I wrong?

47:14.980 --> 47:20.980
I'll take your silence as I've never been so inspired.

47:20.980 --> 47:23.980
Oh.

47:23.980 --> 47:25.980
Sorry.

47:25.980 --> 47:26.980
Was there music?

47:26.980 --> 47:27.980
Was that it?

47:27.980 --> 47:28.980
There was music.

47:28.980 --> 47:29.980
Yeah.

47:29.980 --> 47:30.980
There was music.

47:30.980 --> 47:31.980
But as soon as I tried to listen it.

47:31.980 --> 47:34.980
I was way easier than I thought it was going to be.

47:34.980 --> 47:36.980
Thank you.

47:36.980 --> 47:37.980
Did that not work?

47:37.980 --> 47:38.980
We can try one more time.

47:38.980 --> 47:39.980
Sure.

47:39.980 --> 47:40.980
Try one more time.

47:40.980 --> 47:41.980
Headphones?

47:41.980 --> 47:42.980
Okay.

47:43.980 --> 47:45.980
Let me guess.

47:45.980 --> 47:57.980
Someone along the way as you launched toward you.

47:57.980 --> 48:02.980
Said, I don't think that wench has what it takes.

48:02.980 --> 48:07.980
But are there words poison to you?

48:07.980 --> 48:11.980
Or are there words joys in to have?

48:11.980 --> 48:22.980
Because, outchemically, you can take dirt and let it grow into a beautiful mass of flowers.

48:22.980 --> 48:28.980
A stem from which joy rises from the ashes.

48:28.980 --> 48:30.980
Phoenix, silly.

48:30.980 --> 48:32.980
New word.

48:32.980 --> 48:37.980
Because the alley can't story.

48:37.980 --> 48:39.980
Ain't overbooks.

48:40.980 --> 48:42.980
For it is just begun.

48:42.980 --> 48:46.980
And for the thousands of haters.

48:46.980 --> 48:47.980
For the dollars.

48:47.980 --> 48:51.980
For the people who say, who's alley can't.

48:51.980 --> 48:54.980
Let them taste the poison.

48:54.980 --> 48:58.980
And they're John Vist comes.

48:58.980 --> 49:01.980
And say, enough is enough.

49:01.980 --> 49:04.980
We need a world stage.

49:04.980 --> 49:08.980
Where alley can't is laying every floor.

49:08.980 --> 49:11.980
Only one woman show.

49:11.980 --> 49:14.980
Because we're all one.

49:14.980 --> 49:18.980
And that one.

49:18.980 --> 49:22.980
It's Casey.

49:22.980 --> 49:24.980
You can't call her a wench.

49:24.980 --> 49:26.980
I wasn't even saying that.

49:26.980 --> 49:27.980
It was the powder.

49:27.980 --> 49:30.980
It was between the leaders.

49:30.980 --> 49:33.980
Your second attempt was much better than the first.

49:33.980 --> 49:35.980
I think the first one was the same.

49:35.980 --> 49:37.980
I just think people didn't understand it.

49:37.980 --> 49:40.980
The second one had joy of the beat.

49:40.980 --> 49:44.980
But I was quoting somebody, but somebody called you a wench.

49:44.980 --> 49:45.980
At some point.

49:45.980 --> 49:47.980
At some point I'm sure.

49:47.980 --> 49:48.980
You're sure.

49:48.980 --> 49:51.980
It was me.

49:51.980 --> 49:54.980
I'm the problem.

49:54.980 --> 49:55.980
It's me.

49:55.980 --> 49:56.980
That's true.

49:56.980 --> 49:57.980
That's true.

49:57.980 --> 49:58.980
Oh, you were singing.

49:58.980 --> 49:59.980
Yeah.

49:59.980 --> 50:01.980
Sorry.

50:01.980 --> 50:04.980
This is so fucked up with plugs.

50:05.980 --> 50:09.980
No, I'm retiring.

50:09.980 --> 50:11.980
I made enough last year.

50:11.980 --> 50:13.980
How much can you say how much I'll bleep it?

50:13.980 --> 50:14.980
How much do you make?

50:14.980 --> 50:15.980
I'll ask to pay taxes.

50:15.980 --> 50:17.980
It's just annoying.

50:17.980 --> 50:18.980
Yeah.

50:18.980 --> 50:21.980
I thought I was making more, but actually now I'm giving some back.

50:21.980 --> 50:22.980
Because I made that money.

50:22.980 --> 50:24.980
You only made money for the US government.

50:24.980 --> 50:25.980
Uncle Sam.

50:25.980 --> 50:27.980
Moving is L.

50:27.980 --> 50:29.980
Patriot.com for slash Riley and Jeff.

50:29.980 --> 50:31.980
We're still doing Zoom parties over there.

50:31.980 --> 50:32.980
Sorry.

50:32.980 --> 50:33.980
Yeah.

50:33.980 --> 50:34.980
Zardis.

50:34.980 --> 50:37.980
So please help pay our rent and help fund our retirement.

50:37.980 --> 50:38.980
Because I take all that money.

50:38.980 --> 50:40.980
I put it into a.

50:40.980 --> 50:41.980
We're on.

50:41.980 --> 50:42.980
Vanguard.

50:42.980 --> 50:43.980
Sorry.

50:43.980 --> 50:44.980
Vanguard.

50:44.980 --> 50:45.980
You put it into Vanguard.

50:45.980 --> 50:46.980
I'll ask him.

50:46.980 --> 50:47.980
Yeah.

50:47.980 --> 50:48.980
So it's compounding interest.

50:48.980 --> 50:51.980
Every dollar you make in your 26th year of life is worth more.

50:51.980 --> 50:53.980
Then like give him your started investing now.

50:53.980 --> 50:55.980
You only has 24 years.

50:55.980 --> 50:56.980
No.

50:56.980 --> 51:00.980
I thought we figured out he has like 80 to 100 more years.

51:01.980 --> 51:04.980
Well, you think the retirement age is going to be raised?

51:04.980 --> 51:05.980
Yeah.

51:05.980 --> 51:06.980
To 120.

51:06.980 --> 51:07.980
God.

51:07.980 --> 51:08.980
That would be.

51:08.980 --> 51:09.980
Plus.

51:09.980 --> 51:10.980
Even plugs.

51:10.980 --> 51:11.980
You guys are staring at me.

51:11.980 --> 51:12.980
Space.

51:12.980 --> 51:13.980
Something.

51:13.980 --> 51:14.980
Plug your shit.

51:14.980 --> 51:16.980
To be honest, my ears are ringing.

51:16.980 --> 51:17.980
I have to make.

51:17.980 --> 51:18.980
Do you really?

51:18.980 --> 51:19.980
From this question.

51:19.980 --> 51:20.980
Yeah.

51:20.980 --> 51:21.980
When I wake up.

51:21.980 --> 51:22.980
Jackson Man.

51:22.980 --> 51:23.980
Nice.

51:23.980 --> 51:26.980
Cut your hair.

51:26.980 --> 51:28.980
Cut your hair.

51:28.980 --> 51:29.980
Cut your hair.

51:29.980 --> 51:30.980
Yeah.

51:30.980 --> 51:33.980
You're going to take another little picture.

51:33.980 --> 51:35.980
Oh.

51:35.980 --> 51:37.980
Oh.

51:37.980 --> 51:38.980
Oh.

51:38.980 --> 51:39.980
Oh.

51:39.980 --> 51:41.980
Listen to the pit wall.

51:41.980 --> 51:42.980
Yeah.

51:42.980 --> 51:43.980
And.

51:43.980 --> 51:45.980
Venmo.

51:45.980 --> 51:46.980
Me.

51:46.980 --> 51:47.980
Money.

51:47.980 --> 51:48.980
For the movie.

51:48.980 --> 51:49.980
I'll have like.

51:49.980 --> 51:50.980
A.

51:50.980 --> 51:51.980
A.

51:51.980 --> 51:52.980
Like an amazing.

51:52.980 --> 51:55.980
Like a cocktail hour at an art gallery opening where you're like, or it's a fundraiser.

51:55.980 --> 51:56.980
Yeah.

51:56.980 --> 51:57.980
You're really not, not like that.

51:57.980 --> 51:59.900
event would cost half the budget, yeah.

51:59.900 --> 52:04.860
Well, just save your money until I'm ready to officially ask.

52:04.860 --> 52:07.580
So it's up until you can donate to your art.

52:07.580 --> 52:09.020
Yeah, but until Casey's ready.

52:09.020 --> 52:10.940
Yeah, I'm ready on Instagram.

52:10.940 --> 52:13.180
Yeah, they're housing people to give you 50 bucks.

52:13.180 --> 52:13.980
At Letterbox.

52:13.980 --> 52:14.380
That's it.

52:14.380 --> 52:16.540
At Elecon, Casey just followed me, huge.

52:16.540 --> 52:17.500
Whoa, yeah.

52:17.500 --> 52:18.220
On Letterbox?

52:18.220 --> 52:18.700
Yeah.

52:18.700 --> 52:23.020
Do you want to soft-pitch the idea for your show and get people talking about it?

52:23.020 --> 52:23.900
No, I can't yet.

52:23.900 --> 52:25.020
Okay, I remember.

52:25.020 --> 52:26.460
I'm here.

52:26.460 --> 52:28.620
I woke up in a new Bugatti.

52:28.620 --> 52:29.580
Oh, my frankly.

52:29.580 --> 52:40.460
I thought you were going to plug the brand of dialysis around.

52:40.460 --> 52:40.780
What?

52:44.780 --> 52:45.500
No way.

52:45.500 --> 52:48.060
That's the thing that actually hurt us feeling.

52:48.060 --> 52:50.860
I feel like there's been so much worse said.

52:50.860 --> 53:11.980
He said I was a cotton candy man, a couple of weeks ago, and you were.

53:11.980 --> 53:13.500
That was a hit-dum original.

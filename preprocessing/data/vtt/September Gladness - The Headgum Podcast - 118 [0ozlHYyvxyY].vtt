WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
Lighting on sleek dimples adorning my cheeks.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
All four

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Jesus Christ.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
That like all four F-O-R, all four of us F-O-U-R.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
It was all four of us F-O-R.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Four of us F-O-R.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
She sang dimples.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Oh, I was wrong at both accounts.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Yeah.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
No, my new apartment has great lighting.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
And I don't know if you guys know this, but a big part of your appearance is the light that you're in.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Right? So, you know, I used to record from a basement.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
And I looked like garbage.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
And now I'm like, the kind of feeling myself in a way.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
I haven't shaved in a while, but also my hair's a little dry.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Yeah, something's in my teeth.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
You don't look any different.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
We've got a stacked cast today.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
We've got Kalimori, already.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I'm your blue and filled.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
Marika Brownlee and making her head-gum podcast debut is English provo.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Oh, no.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
It's not provo, man.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
No.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
We don't work together at all.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
So, this is all taken from a...

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
English prevo.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
There you go.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
On wordle, you'd be like, close, but it would still be one letter left to get right.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
But no, it's sick of that.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
You could have played it off as like, knowing English lived in Utah.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Cause provo's a place in front of it.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
I'm...

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Yeah.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
I had...

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
I was going to do an entire segment about English being in Utah.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
And so...

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Well, there's five years, let me clarify that.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Oh, you did actually live in provo.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Yeah.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
I didn't live in provo.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I lived in Salt Lake.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Okay.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
So you didn't live in...

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Tapped?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Okay.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Like she said, Salt Lake City.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Salt Lake City?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Yeah.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
It wasn't...

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
It wasn't...

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Altta?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Anything.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Other...

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Pents Salt Lake.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Asked it out.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
It answered.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
It wasn't tapped.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
No, she said no.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
And everything.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
We're doing this.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
I'm going to go get my medication that I forgot to take.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Was it dry?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
That's a good call.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Is that going for a beer?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
And it wasn't tool.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Do you have a mouth out with Utah right now?

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
We did a sketch once where it was like...

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
I was guessing...

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
What was it?

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
It was pictionary and Riley drew a picture of an apple.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
And I'm like, oh, is it...

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Is it...

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Is it Ogden?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Is it Ogden Utah?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Or Ogden?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Is it tapped?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Is it West Jordan?

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
So that's a deep cut for the...

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
The listeners.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
English...

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
What do you want people to know about you?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
You and I barely know each other if it all.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Yeah.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
We might add the opposite.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
No, it's kind of a...

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
You live in work in New York.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I'm in Brooklyn.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Who's T-Bringing?

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I'm on the marketing team.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
And Kaylee, you said you're having a terrible day.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Grant.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Thank you.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I want her.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
It's like multiplying negatives.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
If this will turn the day around.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
And it is...

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
We should say 4pm your time, 430.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
So your work is basically over.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Check in with me at the end of this.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
And I'll let you know.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Okay.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
I said, what's it going to be?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
What?

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
You just sent something that somebody canceled your order or something.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Oh.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Yeah.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Oh yeah.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Oh yeah.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Go AC.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
I mean...

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Oh no.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I'm sorry.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Yeah.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Okay.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
I like an explain this.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
You should have come in if you did.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Oh, you don't think I yelled at them in this email.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
It's only more about that.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Hey, is this Danish interior design company that I love?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
And many of us do.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
And so we ordered all these really awesome things for the office back in June.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.040
We still haven't gotten it, and after repeated attempts to get in contact with them, they

04:43.040 --> 04:47.000
finally emailed me back and said, most of our orders out of stock.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
And so I really went into them.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Those dames better fucking watch out cause I'm not in the mood.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
I just want to call them.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Oh, oh.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Greats for our death.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
I wanted to be a little star in it.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I was so fine.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
I was tired crying.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I was tired crying.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
In rage.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
You put out too.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
You were like me.

05:08.000 --> 05:22.560
I say crime. I'm crunched. What? What? People have recently told me that I like pronounce my

05:22.560 --> 05:29.680
sewers with like, and you just did it. That means nothing. What are you talking about?

05:29.760 --> 05:33.760
What's the internet way of saying crime? Crying.

05:33.760 --> 05:40.080
Marika, say crime. Crying. Yeah, yeah, that's the normal way. I don't hear a difference.

05:41.920 --> 05:48.480
My point is that, Kayla, you and I are like, oh, positive. You know, I'm actually a negative, but yeah.

05:49.600 --> 05:55.600
Right. Here's my difference at all. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, that was easy.

05:56.320 --> 06:06.560
Um, still got it. I figured we'd skip bond of the week this week. I mean, like, right?

06:08.400 --> 06:15.600
Yeah. Why? It's a good idea, actually. So,

06:19.200 --> 06:23.760
do you guys have any bond of the bonds of the week? English, this is a segment where we love up our

06:23.760 --> 06:30.960
casting choices for the next James. Um, gender neutral. Ideally white one. But um,

06:32.960 --> 06:40.080
yeah, it's like what we can get. Mine's not going to fly that. Again, just based on the fact that I

06:40.080 --> 06:44.880
currently have a photo of him open for some reason. Yeah. I'm going to go Winston Duke. Who's that?

06:45.360 --> 06:53.360
Um, he's a Baku from Black Panther. Oh, yeah. It's like really stat pretty hot. That's that. Yeah.

06:53.360 --> 06:59.600
Wasn't he in, uh, get us as well? Yes, you both. Oh, wow. Is he British?

07:01.600 --> 07:08.800
I don't think so. He's a gorgeous man. Yeah. Yeah. I bet that's nice. Thank you. Yeah, sure.

07:09.120 --> 07:17.840
Uh, uh, I thought you meant Clark Duke, which is my choice, but thanks for stepping on it.

07:18.880 --> 07:25.200
It's really funny because mine is Clark Abel. That's also really good. He is dead, but uh, I want to

07:25.200 --> 07:32.320
reverse and zombie Clark Gable. Um, this is, I, you know, I'm just going to make this my pick.

07:32.400 --> 07:39.920
Um, Clark Duke is my bond of the week. And if you guys don't know his name, you know his face.

07:42.240 --> 07:49.360
Oh, sure. Yeah. He was in Greek. One of my favorite shows of all time. Yeah. It's time for a, um,

07:50.560 --> 07:57.680
a fine bond. Like someone who could, should be a CPA, but instead they work for the

07:58.320 --> 08:10.240
C-I-F-B-I. Um, like we're armed IRS agents. Yeah. IRS agents carry heat.

08:11.280 --> 08:16.880
Some of them do in financial crimes. Have you not been paying attention to politics lately? It's a whole thing.

08:16.880 --> 08:27.360
The Mara logo thing or what? Not that, but that witch hunt. Yeah. Yeah. We don't need to get into it.

08:28.560 --> 08:34.160
Um, English, I, I, I brush past you introducing yourself to me in the audience. What,

08:34.160 --> 08:38.960
what do you want everyone to know, including me? Uh, I'm the lead graphic designer for

08:38.960 --> 08:43.920
headcom and yeah, I work with Kayla and Marika and we are a powerhouse.

08:45.520 --> 08:52.400
Yeah. Did you work on the pit wall art? I did not. I think that was great. It was a

08:52.400 --> 08:57.440
grace and in me. Yeah. Grace and started at that finish. It was good. Do you have any,

08:57.440 --> 09:03.280
thank you. Do you have any notes or concerns, Jeff? Uh, I thought it was great. I think the,

09:03.280 --> 09:08.960
I have a question. May I ask you? Why did you choose Casey to be the center? I love Casey,

09:08.960 --> 09:16.960
but I'm just curious. I didn't choose that it was, uh, I basically grace and hand it the files up

09:16.960 --> 09:24.800
to me, but I would say probably because he's the lead producer. So I kind of, uh, pushed him into

09:24.800 --> 09:31.920
being also the host. Love that. And that's like, is that friend? Also just serves the alignment.

09:31.920 --> 09:37.520
Yeah. I'm sorry to bring it up again, but also like ethically, it's symmetrical.

09:37.520 --> 09:44.000
I literally said the same thing to me. Yeah. So it just, it does look good. Yeah. Uh,

09:44.960 --> 09:54.240
I love ethnic symmetry too. It's important. What's that? Ethnicly, um, symmetrical. You said,

09:54.240 --> 10:01.120
it's, it's nice. That way to have it. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. The more you talk about it,

10:01.120 --> 10:08.240
the more awkward it gets. For sure. And that's why I'm conversationaly to the next topic. I'm like,

10:09.200 --> 10:16.240
sorry, I get kind of nervous around English, it's all. Why?

10:17.520 --> 10:23.680
Just because she could technically and ethnically fire me. English, now's the perfect time to ask for

10:23.680 --> 10:30.880
it is. You can't say no in this form. I'm not responsible for that, but yeah, I'll talk to somebody.

10:31.120 --> 10:41.360
115k, um, four weeks paid vacation. I'm totally in unlimited. We've been on the video.

10:42.160 --> 10:46.160
How about, uh, my team and a senior in the title and suddenly.

10:49.280 --> 11:00.240
In a house in Santa Rosa. I had some talking points. First of all, gold tone jewelry versus silver

11:00.880 --> 11:09.040
I used to be adamantly silver, and I've embraced gold recently. Not from my wedding band.

11:09.040 --> 11:16.240
I was silver in my loving. Yeah. I was also adamantly silver in high school and then switched to gold.

11:16.240 --> 11:21.040
I like can I know where gold jewelry is. So, I don't know why I'm commenting.

11:21.040 --> 11:26.320
Man, make an announcement. I'm doing my cartilage pierced on Friday with a gold earring.

11:27.280 --> 11:32.480
Wow. That's exciting. Add upon what magic. I don't know. Hold a trigger.

11:32.480 --> 11:37.760
She decided yesterday in the office and I did appointment on the spot. Cartilage is your top of

11:37.760 --> 11:41.440
the ear. You're right. I'm not thinking of like something else. Yeah. That's really big for me,

11:41.440 --> 11:46.160
because I only have regular ear piercings and that's it. I'm not cool, but I'm trying to get cooler.

11:46.800 --> 11:55.040
She decided yesterday in the office. Don't do that. Not one here. Not a free damage. That's my

11:55.200 --> 12:01.840
really good pressure. That's really good, actually. You're going for an impression. It's pretty

12:01.840 --> 12:08.240
spot on. Somebody commented on the pit wall thing saying Marika has spoiled child energy.

12:08.240 --> 12:14.640
I'm like Marika works harder than anyone in the company. I can't stop thinking about this. I will talk

12:14.640 --> 12:24.240
to my therapist about it. I know that it's not true. It's not true. It's not true and I know that,

12:24.240 --> 12:33.840
but I'm like, what do they think that is? Yeah. What defines that on a F1 podcast? Well,

12:34.720 --> 12:40.240
I mean not to get too into it, but they were talking about Lando Norris and I fully understand

12:40.240 --> 12:48.240
that with his personality. Okay. That's fair. That's fair. Well, child energy. Yeah.

12:48.240 --> 12:55.120
And it's shocking that you like Lando for the read that reason. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I think he's fun.

12:55.120 --> 13:00.160
I think he's like a good character. Like in the same way, Chris, I like Christian Horner as a character.

13:00.160 --> 13:08.240
Yeah. He's like a villain. I like Lando Carey scene. Is that? That's just, um, that's just

13:08.720 --> 13:15.600
less spoiled energy. I don't know how they not seen any Star Wars. I don't know. Less than Norris.

13:20.880 --> 13:26.160
So Goldton jewelry seems to be the trend. I could I ask because I've been sort of transitioning

13:26.160 --> 13:34.080
into the gold of it all. This isn't real gold, but it's such a tight band. You're talking about

13:35.040 --> 13:47.280
it look like your wrist is being pinched. My hand is purple. I saw a TikTok recently. This isn't

13:47.280 --> 13:53.120
that interesting. But I thought it was kind of cool that I guess like a lot of the big jewelry

13:53.120 --> 14:00.720
companies are like the director consumer jewelry companies are pretty cheap gold stuff, but you

14:00.720 --> 14:06.880
can get like gold-filled jewelry on Etsy pretty easily. Never do that. That was crazy.

14:13.360 --> 14:20.080
This isn't that interesting. Then don't say it. I mean, isn't that a major killer usually?

14:20.160 --> 14:25.600
Yeah. But I was like, like, you should live by that.

14:32.880 --> 14:39.520
Can't make many of this episode anywhere. How does take pizza topping and don't say pineapple, right?

14:42.480 --> 14:47.600
Like, like, or we don't like, yeah. Like something you like that might be controversial,

14:47.840 --> 14:53.200
you know, when I say pineapple, but say pineapple and onion together. Oh.

14:55.760 --> 15:00.720
I think you can, right? I think you can say it. I mean, the free speech.

15:00.720 --> 15:06.080
That's fine. Exactly. I'm not mad at you for bringing that up. I disagree with the idea of

15:06.080 --> 15:11.680
E. Yeah. I disagree with my other one too, which is black olives. Yeah. But I'll fight for your

15:11.680 --> 15:17.200
writing. I'm proud. I'm proud. I'm proud. I'm proud of you with a group of people, like in the

15:17.200 --> 15:22.480
pizza rea, you know, winter comes by. And then you say, I'll order for the table pineapple and onion.

15:23.040 --> 15:29.280
It would never do that. Everyone on board, right? I'm the person at a pizza place that's so

15:29.280 --> 15:35.040
stressed out about like everyone else ordering meat pizzas and then me wanting an equal amount of

15:35.040 --> 15:40.960
pizza that I can eat that I like, I have to take over and plot everything for everyone. I saw that

15:40.960 --> 15:45.760
except I have to gluten free or I'll die. So I have to make sure that we're going. It's something

15:45.760 --> 15:53.680
I can have now. Can you throw or anti-black olives? Uh, there are my favorite but I'll eat them on a

15:53.680 --> 16:00.080
pizza. Uh, my hot take thing that I like would be, I like eggplants on pizza. That's a great hot

16:00.080 --> 16:04.800
taste. Good eggplants. Yeah. Yeah. I've never even heard of that. Uh, there's a place called

16:04.800 --> 16:11.840
for Nino's in green point. It's an Italian flat but do them gluten free stuff. Yeah. And they do an eggplant,

16:11.840 --> 16:19.200
veggie thing. I don't know if this is a hot take pizza topping but I'm going to say hot honey.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.640
I love hot honey. Why, let me finish with wine.

16:24.800 --> 16:34.160
Like hot honey wine. Oh, you like like a hot meat. I'm dunking it in. It's like gluten free dough.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.600
So you wish can have it. Okay. tomato sauce.

16:38.960 --> 16:48.160
Four cheese blend. Hot honey. It's fine. Okay. I'm sorry. I like the wine. I like the wine. Yeah. What kind of

16:48.160 --> 16:53.520
wine? I'll only care about is the wine. Are you talking about having it with wine or put wine on

16:53.520 --> 16:58.400
then like imagine we're at polinesis. Okay, we're at polinesis in green point.

16:59.360 --> 17:07.840
Fantastic. Okay. Right. Amazing marinara. Three to four different cheeses. This is all going

17:07.840 --> 17:13.200
to go into a wood fire oven hot honey wine. Put it in the oven. I just like you're insulated hot honey.

17:13.200 --> 17:17.120
Is that honey and wine like mixed together as a sauce or are you pouring? I've never

17:17.120 --> 17:24.400
heard of the never heard of hot honey wine. You see putting up a bottle of honey wine into the

17:24.400 --> 17:32.240
wood fire oven next to the pizza. I was the construction of this. Yeah. I feel like I've built

17:32.240 --> 17:39.680
it my own four you guys twice. Here I go three times thin crust unbelievable marinara.

17:40.880 --> 17:48.800
Four to five cheeses. Yeah. Hot honey drizzled on top. I don't know any one can say no to that.

17:49.760 --> 17:57.040
Wine into the oven. I just can you just slow down on the white part. What are we talking about?

17:57.040 --> 18:04.480
That's the last thing. This is like a reduction. Is it a reduction in wine into the oven? No,

18:04.480 --> 18:10.720
you're not putting. Sorry. Can we put a break and like take an actual break? Like not like one of

18:10.720 --> 18:16.640
those quick half breaks. Like I need a commercial to unwind from this conversation. It's

18:16.960 --> 18:24.000
poisonous. It's really good. Yeah. All right. We'll be right back, I guess.

18:30.320 --> 18:34.640
Guys lately I've been listening to this great podcast called Mother Country Radicals.

18:35.360 --> 18:40.960
It's about the weatherman underground in the 1960s and early 70s. It's very interesting actually

18:41.840 --> 18:47.440
and one reason why it's been interesting and great to listen to is because I've been listening

18:47.440 --> 18:53.680
on my neighborhood walks on my Raycon wireless earbuds. Raycon's everyday earbuds look

18:53.680 --> 19:00.480
feel and sound better than ever with optimized gel tips for the perfect in your fit. Raycon

19:00.480 --> 19:05.760
earbuds are so comfortable and they will not budge trust me. I've been like jogging with them.

19:05.760 --> 19:10.560
I don't know why I've started jogging but they do not fall. Like other wireless earbuds often

19:10.560 --> 19:17.040
do. Raycon's offer three sound profiles to match what you're listening to. Plus offer noise isolation

19:17.040 --> 19:22.240
and awareness mode so you can choose to be immersed in sound or be able to hear your surroundings

19:22.240 --> 19:27.920
when you need to so you don't get run over by a car. I've used Raycon and I've also used the

19:27.920 --> 19:34.720
other leading wireless brand and Raycon just offers an overall much better experience. I've been

19:34.720 --> 19:39.040
recommending them to all my friends. They're also much cheaper than a lot of the other options

19:39.040 --> 19:44.560
and they sound just as good if not better. Raycon's give you eight hours of playtime in a 32-hour

19:44.560 --> 19:48.720
battery life and then when you need to charge it super easily you can even do it wirelessly.

19:48.720 --> 19:53.280

19:53.280 --> 19:57.920

Guys the seasons are changing right and that with it comes a lot of transitions a lot of

20:30.960 --> 20:35.920
chains and it can be tough. You know to train your brain to stay in problem solving mode

20:35.920 --> 20:40.240
when facing any challenge in life. But when you learn how to find your own solution,

20:40.240 --> 20:45.120
there's no better feeling. And a therapist can help you become a better problem solver making it

20:45.120 --> 20:50.320
easier to accomplish your goals no matter how big or small. I go to therapy once a week.

20:50.320 --> 20:54.800
Absolutely necessary staple in my life. It makes me a better person. Helps me show up for other

20:54.800 --> 20:59.760
people in my life as the best version of myself. I can be. I highly recommend it if you have the

20:59.840 --> 21:05.200
resources. I think everyone should be in therapy. Even on weeks where I don't feel like I need it.

21:05.200 --> 21:08.880
I always find something to talk about and leave the session feeling better.

21:10.240 --> 21:15.040
It's, you know, I wanted to try therapy because I was in a tough spot, but you don't even need to

21:15.040 --> 21:19.600
be in a tough spot to start up with therapy because then you can build a rapport with your therapist.

21:19.600 --> 21:24.800
And then when the tough stuff hits, you already have that rapport. She already knows you.

21:25.200 --> 21:30.640

21:51.920 --> 21:59.920
All right, this is my real idea that I wanted to run by you guys dessert pasta.

22:01.280 --> 22:09.040
Okay, I don't need to. So pasta dough, you make the pasta dough as normal.

22:10.000 --> 22:15.200
And then you add some vanilla extract and some brown sugar or just normal sugar. I don't know which

22:15.200 --> 22:25.920
would work better. You press out the pasta. You boil it. And then you make separately a Nutella sauce.

22:27.120 --> 22:32.480
Toss the noodles with the Nutella sauce, which is basically the taste of hazelnut chocolate,

22:32.480 --> 22:39.920
but thinner. And then the meatballs are Ferro Roche's. And then the Parmesan is grated hazelnuts.

22:40.880 --> 22:48.880
It was grated cheese. I thought that it was going to be like a pretty loose concept,

22:48.880 --> 22:56.560
but you're just pitching a dish. Yeah, you've just jumped it. Tomato sauce is kind of sweet. So

22:56.560 --> 23:01.440
like it doesn't, it's not actually wrong to do that. And it's like peanut butter and jelly exists.

23:01.440 --> 23:07.200
So I can get peanut butter and jelly, but instead of on bread on pasta. I think I worried about the

23:07.200 --> 23:13.440
consistency of the pasta with brown sugar. Okay, so my biggest hang up is the noodle part of it.

23:13.440 --> 23:18.480
Yeah, you should be putting a little bit of brown sugar in your tomato sauce to really bring out the flavor

23:18.480 --> 23:26.560
of the tomato sauce. Wow. Okay, yeah. Hot taste wise, but like the consistency of the pasta,

23:26.560 --> 23:31.200
that's the thing I'm worried about. This is also the only positive note that's like trying to help

23:31.200 --> 23:35.520
me out. Everyone else is like that sounds disgusting. Nobody said that.

23:37.440 --> 23:43.600
No, he means his like every people he's told. Everyone else I've told in real life.

23:45.040 --> 23:51.680
This is a dish that I'm going to make on Labor Day, I think. Seems heavy for 108 degree

23:51.680 --> 24:02.400
Barney. You actually just can I pitch kind of an alt for this. Can you say it for the end?

24:03.360 --> 24:09.040
What for the end of one? This is a perfect conversation extended. Yes, yes, I just picked it.

24:09.040 --> 24:14.320
One, can you just say what you want? Have you seen, have you seen like, um,

24:14.320 --> 24:22.640
I feel like fried ravioli, that kind of thing. Sounds awesome. I just did a St. Louis special. It's really good.

24:22.640 --> 24:30.000
Pan fried or you're just dropping the ravioli like it's not breaded. You're just dropping it into a

24:30.000 --> 24:36.400
fryer. So you could bread it. You could bread it. But going off of that and the fact that like the noodles,

24:36.400 --> 24:43.440
like are the pasta dough gets bubbly and crunchy. In my case, you could do little noki instead of

24:44.400 --> 24:50.800
there, which we could do. Or sweet potato noki is just like basically. Yeah, or like a pumpkin milk.

24:50.800 --> 24:55.680
Yeah, we almost like a sweet pumpkin pine. Yeah, we instead of like cheese. It's like slough for

24:55.680 --> 25:02.400
marshmallows, something like brown butter and sweet. And I only want to do the Nutella,

25:02.400 --> 25:10.320
Linguini with the Ferraro-Shameet balls. I was okay. Here's your sous-lasagna.

25:10.880 --> 25:16.560
Basically, I was going to say instead of mixing the sugar and the vanilla into the dough,

25:16.560 --> 25:25.200
you can do it like how you make a cinnamon roll and like roll it. So it's like striped through

25:25.200 --> 25:30.640
and then fry it and then do all your other shit that you want to do. What if you make like

25:30.640 --> 25:36.080
tagliatella to like a phyllo dough and then do like melted butter and cinnamon sugar? Is this a

25:36.080 --> 25:43.840
cooking podcast meal? I think we should try all of these. I don't want to like dominate the

25:43.840 --> 25:50.080
discourse of the podcast and also your schedules outside of the show. But I wonder if on Labor Day

25:50.080 --> 25:55.440
we all make a dessert pasta? I'm running out of half-marathon that day. I will not be cooking.

25:55.440 --> 25:58.720
No, we've got a Corbulo. Yeah, exactly.

25:59.680 --> 26:02.720
You do the same thing. And what better way do you do?

26:10.080 --> 26:16.800
Welcome to Ask Jeff. This is like Ask Gives, but instead of it being like a search engine thing,

26:16.800 --> 26:25.920
it's going to be, you guys ideally in an ideal world telling me real issues of the day of your

26:25.920 --> 26:33.280
lives and I will fix them. This has echoes if I re-you, but that's okay. Like an newest podcast?

26:33.280 --> 26:37.440
Isn't Ask Gives more of like a search engine? Like I'd be like, what's the population of New Jersey

26:37.440 --> 26:46.480
and you would say? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's more specific than advice. I want your

26:46.480 --> 26:52.640
problems and I'm going to fix them entirely. And it might even stretch beyond the scope of the show,

26:52.640 --> 26:59.120
where I'll fix it over the next couple of days. Okay. Like a mirror if you had like a house,

26:59.120 --> 27:05.600
I could fix that. Actually, I haven't had an issue with my shower. One of the showers.

27:05.600 --> 27:11.040
Let's get into that. It's warm at first and then it oscillates between

27:11.120 --> 27:15.120
lukewarm and then back to the hot. Okay. Well, I can come take a look at the water tank.

27:15.840 --> 27:20.880
It's not a tank thing. I think there's like a part within the shower. I forget what somebody said,

27:20.880 --> 27:29.120
but it was like a receiver receiver. Yeah. Not the receiver, but it's not exactly that,

27:29.120 --> 27:32.320
but it sounds yeah. Something in the handle that you just got to be something. It's got to be something

27:32.480 --> 27:39.760
well. Yeah. Yeah. The regular. Yes. Something like that regular. That's right. Really? So you'd

27:39.760 --> 27:45.280
have to look to see which one I have, try to replace it and see if that helps. Well, is it a, I mean,

27:45.280 --> 27:52.640
what kind of shower is it? Right? Is it a, is it a bear? No. Is it, um, you mean the shower head?

27:53.760 --> 28:02.080
In the shape of that bear? Yeah. What? What's the brand? Is it a slipstream? Not sure.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.920
You don't know the brand of your shower? I don't even think. Do you?

28:05.920 --> 28:11.040
Shower's have brands. I have a bear. Are you talking with the shower head?

28:12.160 --> 28:21.280
Yeah. Yeah. Not the shower. What's the brand of your four original 1924? Hardwood. What brand of

28:21.280 --> 28:31.120
shampoo do you have? I actually equally have a company complaint. So I like bougie soaps. I will spend

28:31.200 --> 28:36.320
a lot of money on hand soap shampoo with conditioner and body wash because I like small good

28:36.880 --> 28:42.720
and it'll shave it. Well, I've, I've done the ASAP thing. I've done the Lillabo thing. Both great.

28:43.680 --> 28:51.280
But this time around I was like, these are very expensive. Let me get something still fancy, but not as

28:51.280 --> 28:58.800
expensive. So I got the Flamingo estate shampoo and conditioner double pack, which is this local L.A.

28:59.760 --> 29:07.360
Like brand that's based out of this mansion that like in all their products are made from things from the garden.

29:09.520 --> 29:15.360
So it's like natural, which I didn't know. And so I started using it. I was like, great. This smell is amazing.

29:15.360 --> 29:18.720
The bottle looks nice. I like to have it in my shower and like display it.

29:19.680 --> 29:28.400
The conditioner dries my hair out more than the sun. Oh god. My hair. I have. I've started just

29:28.800 --> 29:35.760
feeling of my roommate stuff. But and there's works great. Like it's like this like biotin and

29:35.760 --> 29:41.040
collagen thing. You're yelling at us. Just fucking relax and have a conversation with us.

29:41.760 --> 29:47.840
Chill. No, I'm saying argue. I know what you're saying. It's so combative. We're not saying anything

29:47.840 --> 29:54.800
and you're raising your voice. But what I'm going to do, I just cited is empty out the Flamingo estate

29:55.120 --> 30:01.040
bottle is replace it with my own purple biotin and collagen condition. I'm there.

30:03.040 --> 30:09.920
So I can ride the inner. Yeah. Oh, I'm having a volume as hair. Voluminous hair.

30:11.120 --> 30:21.680
You caused this. You're me. I'm sorry. No, no, no, no. You're giving me a sea section. I think what what is your own

30:21.840 --> 30:28.400
biotin conditioner? Are you making your own conditioner? No, I'm not sure. What are you putting in it?

30:28.400 --> 30:35.520
I'm going to go to Walgreens, right, aid, whatever. Buy the cheap stuff. Put it in the bottle that looks

30:35.520 --> 30:41.840
nice. That's less exciting. I thought you were going to like, man. It's an egg. This is going

30:41.840 --> 30:45.920
to completely different directions. Yeah. Let's go to the point where I'm putting all the

30:45.920 --> 30:52.960
oil in my hair. Yeah. You should do smiley seed oil, I think. Oh, I hope a oil,

30:52.960 --> 30:58.320
Oregon oil, Moroccan oil. Don't give me started on hair oils.

30:58.320 --> 31:05.440
Better started. Does anybody else have any problems of the day that I can kind of fix?

31:07.280 --> 31:12.960
By the way, hours ask very lightly because I brought up the shower thing and he spoke about

31:12.960 --> 31:22.880
conditioner for four minutes straight. Yeah, he's scared. I mean, can you fix this problem that

31:23.680 --> 31:29.920
we're having where all of the containers that we ordered for the New York office are never going

31:29.920 --> 31:34.480
to arrive? I have broken down moving boxes from the Home Depot. I could ship to you guys.

31:35.280 --> 31:41.840
No, that's probably going to do opposite. What we want. So that's not helping.

31:42.000 --> 31:47.600
Yeah. What do you also do? It's not my fault that you're like not open to change. What's that?

31:47.600 --> 31:53.120
Where do you shop for home goods? Like for furniture or like neck nap. If you were, if you were

31:53.120 --> 31:59.040
going to buy a bunch of containers to put stuff in, what is that egg? What vibe are you going for?

31:59.040 --> 32:03.840
I like to buy a second hand because I care about the earth. It's cheaper and you can get it

32:03.840 --> 32:10.160
immediately and you don't deal with these delivery issues. So I would say, oh, immediately. Yeah,

32:10.800 --> 32:15.360
you can go on offer up and be like, this thing's five miles away. I can go pick it up right now.

32:17.120 --> 32:22.240
What have you done with recently? Not in New York. You can. That's true because you don't have a car.

32:22.240 --> 32:28.080
I did that with this rocking chair that you can barely see. I did that with these, the dining

32:28.080 --> 32:36.720
chairs over there. Two by a rocking chair. So I can fucking go. Max, man, and read a good book.

32:37.680 --> 32:48.640
What are we reading today, Jeff? Oh, that's just because that's not a bad nickname for me because

32:48.640 --> 32:56.080
I my skin tone is that of creamy natural. That's right. What was the question?

32:56.080 --> 33:00.160
I don't know. What are you reading? What book? Oh, I'm still reading electric cool aid

33:00.160 --> 33:06.720
acid test. I've been reading it for like a month and a half solid, but I'm halfway done.

33:12.560 --> 33:22.320
Sorry, I was just. Just thinking about what I'm going to get tonight. English,

33:22.320 --> 33:28.720
anything I can fix in your life? How's your husband? He's good. He's good. He's in a

33:28.720 --> 33:35.680
bunch of meetings. Communication issues. Okay. And when you got, but when conflict does, sorry,

33:35.680 --> 33:40.800
I mean, when when when a conflict does arise, do you guys feel like you can approach it

33:41.680 --> 33:46.320
wanting immediately to sort of understand where the other one's coming from, leaving every argument,

33:46.320 --> 33:51.680
every dispute, understanding the other one a little bit more, understanding each other's dynamic,

33:51.680 --> 33:56.960
each other's needs, knowing you can never really meet someone's needs because we're all,

33:57.040 --> 34:02.640
we're all gotten drag, we're all just presenting who we think we are. What if we use our relationships

34:02.640 --> 34:08.640
as a vehicle for freedom, never asking our partners to be different than they are, loving them

34:08.640 --> 34:15.200
for who they are as now, they appear to be to me to have for you on the day, in a way.

34:16.480 --> 34:20.160
You started this show with we barely know each other and you're not.

34:20.320 --> 34:23.440
I'm not going to apologize for what I'm trying to do.

34:26.480 --> 34:30.480
All I really got from that was God and drag. Yeah. I love that.

34:31.200 --> 34:36.720
There was a really long, I think I'm doing drag race because I've been in a place where I'm missing

34:36.720 --> 34:43.520
wrong, that's. I see. From just talks about God and drag. He says we're all a God and drag.

34:43.520 --> 34:49.920
I see. For all God and drag. And he's sort of famous for that or shut up because that doesn't really mean

34:49.920 --> 34:57.040
anything so it's great that you look up to this guy. Soon we're reed his writing and he says stuff

34:57.040 --> 35:00.080
like that and you're kind of into it. Does that have works?

35:04.800 --> 35:05.440
Yeah.

35:20.160 --> 35:24.160
Haha.

35:24.160 --> 35:53.160
Welcome to September Gladness.

35:53.160 --> 36:05.160
I think we're literally approaching six months away from March Madness.

36:05.160 --> 36:13.160
Not that I'm a college basketball fan, but I just wonder if there's something we could do now.

36:13.160 --> 36:17.160
You know, bracket-wise, turning-wise.

36:17.160 --> 36:22.160
Did you do this Photoshop? It's pretty good.

36:22.160 --> 36:26.160
I did.

36:26.160 --> 36:29.160
Yeah, English, what do you think?

36:29.160 --> 36:33.160
I mean, ooh.

36:33.160 --> 36:39.160
I don't pay attention to basketball, but if you're just talking general brackets, we're going into football season.

36:39.160 --> 36:43.160
But I actually meant for my graphic design standpoint.

36:43.160 --> 36:48.160
Oh, sorry. I thought you were talking about the first question. Yeah, it's pretty good. Good job.

36:48.160 --> 36:51.160
Thank you.

36:51.160 --> 36:55.160
Okay, here we go. This is September Gladness.

36:55.160 --> 37:03.160
I have put together a bracket for honestly lack of a better term of things that bring everyone joy.

37:03.160 --> 37:12.160
And I thought that we could come together and vote, which is why there's five of us, to figure out the ultimate joy of the false.

37:12.160 --> 37:17.160
It's just so coming your eyes out.

37:17.160 --> 37:23.160
I want to be a Jeff thing with Adam and A.O. Lee mentioned.

37:23.160 --> 37:34.160
Yeah, so these are our head-to-head's here. Why don't we start with cold-fresh linen sheets versus finding a new A.O. Lee?

37:34.160 --> 37:38.160
Gotta go sheets, right? The number one seed.

37:38.160 --> 37:47.160
Yeah, agreed. All right, that was easy. Especially because I don't like the way you said finding a new A.O.

37:47.160 --> 37:53.160
Discovering, you know, a fucking, um, what was a sambal A.O. Lee, right? Yeah.

37:53.160 --> 37:54.160
Ammoa. Okay.

37:54.160 --> 37:56.160
Ammoa. What he said.

37:56.160 --> 37:57.160
Right.

37:57.160 --> 38:01.160
Right.

38:01.160 --> 38:06.160
Fostoring a cat's insecurities or finishing a page turner.

38:06.160 --> 38:09.160
Yeah, a page turner.

38:09.160 --> 38:12.160
Really? Yeah, the first one doesn't make sense.

38:12.160 --> 38:14.160
Okay.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.160
Ammoa learned to cats.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.160
This one's good for America.

38:17.160 --> 38:22.160
Seeing a Ferrari double-in versus learning of royal family drama.

38:22.160 --> 38:25.160
Absolutely, seeing a Ferrari double-in.

38:25.160 --> 38:27.160
Yeah, I'm going to go with Ferrari double-in.

38:27.160 --> 38:29.160
I don't really care about the rules.

38:29.160 --> 38:32.160
I mean, I love messy drama, but it's fine.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.160
I'm here.

38:34.160 --> 38:36.160
It doesn't fucking matter.

38:36.160 --> 38:38.160
Great.

38:38.160 --> 38:42.160
Okay, drinking a mary or a fresh bouquet adorning the mantle.

38:42.160 --> 38:45.160
bouquet or shunkaking a mary.

38:45.160 --> 38:47.160
I'm going to say drinking a mary.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.160
Yeah.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.160
I'm here.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.160
I'm not an alcohol guy. I saw a go with flowers.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.160
That's a classic 12-over-five.

38:54.160 --> 38:56.160
What an upset.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.160
Ooh.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.160
All right.

38:58.160 --> 39:00.160
Dating someone with A.S. subsopes.

39:01.160 --> 39:03.160
Or honestly, both of these are me.

39:03.160 --> 39:06.160
Or spooning someone with a thick ass.

39:10.160 --> 39:11.160
So?

39:11.160 --> 39:13.160
No.

39:13.160 --> 39:14.160
No.

39:14.160 --> 39:16.160
Yeah, I'm going to go soap.

39:16.160 --> 39:17.160
Wait, so where are we at right now?

39:17.160 --> 39:18.160
Let's go on the line English.

39:18.160 --> 39:21.160
A sub-soper spooning ass.

39:21.160 --> 39:24.160
Oh, go with spooning.

39:24.160 --> 39:27.160
Taylor, you said A sub?

39:27.160 --> 39:29.160
Yeah, so please.

39:29.160 --> 39:32.160
I'll be the typewriter.

39:32.160 --> 39:34.160
I'm going to go with spooning.

39:34.160 --> 39:35.160
Yeah.

39:35.160 --> 39:36.160
Here we go.

39:36.160 --> 39:39.160
Finding cash in your dockers or an acrylic nails back scratch.

39:39.160 --> 39:41.160
Cash.

39:41.160 --> 39:42.160
Yeah.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.160
Cash.

39:43.160 --> 39:44.160
Cash.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.160
That's crazy.

39:46.160 --> 39:48.160
I'll go back scratch.

39:48.160 --> 39:50.160
I also would say back scratch, but it doesn't even matter.

39:50.160 --> 39:51.160
Here we go.

39:51.160 --> 39:54.160
Cleaning out your closet or coming your eyes out.

39:54.160 --> 39:59.160
Coming your eyes out.

39:59.160 --> 40:04.160
This is a real thing that happened to my friend, Cecilie.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.160
She's been on a couple of headgun podcasts.

40:06.160 --> 40:08.160
She's a very funny comedian.

40:08.160 --> 40:16.160
I'm sure she would have no problem sharing this photo because she posted it to Instagram.

40:16.160 --> 40:18.160
So what happened there?

40:18.160 --> 40:21.160
She came her eyes out.

40:21.160 --> 40:27.160
She went to a doctor and he was like, yep, you had an orgasm that was so intense that

40:27.160 --> 40:31.160
you burst every blood vessel around your eyes.

40:31.160 --> 40:35.160
Oh, holy shit.

40:35.160 --> 40:38.160
What a cleaning out your closet.

40:38.160 --> 40:43.160
Imagine being the person that does that to somebody.

40:43.160 --> 40:46.160
Every blood vessel and both eyes.

40:46.160 --> 40:48.160
What do we think?

40:48.160 --> 40:49.160
That one.

40:49.160 --> 40:50.160
I mean my god.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.160
Although then you got to go to a doctor.

40:52.160 --> 40:55.160
Yeah, that's why I'm going closet.

40:55.160 --> 40:58.160
I'm cleaning out my closet.

40:58.160 --> 40:59.160
You only live once.

40:59.160 --> 41:02.160
So let's come on in your eyes out.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.160
I also vote that.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.160
All right.

41:04.160 --> 41:09.160
What about that Friday feeling versus sharing good or bad wine with others?

41:09.160 --> 41:15.160
Here's another photo of Cecilie sort of feeling happy on a Friday.

41:15.160 --> 41:18.160
And she wouldn't mind me sharing this.

41:18.160 --> 41:21.160
The last one is her coming her eyes out.

41:21.160 --> 41:23.160
This one is just her smiling.

41:23.160 --> 41:25.160
I'll go with again.

41:25.160 --> 41:26.160
I'm not an alcohol guy.

41:26.160 --> 41:28.160
So I'll go with seven.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.160
Yeah, we'll go with Friday feeling.

41:30.160 --> 41:31.160
We'll Friday.

41:31.160 --> 41:32.160
Same.

41:32.160 --> 41:33.160
All right.

41:33.160 --> 41:34.160
All right.

41:34.160 --> 41:35.160
Here we go.

41:35.160 --> 41:39.160
Cold fresh linen sheets versus seeing a Ferrari double win.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.160
Sheets.

41:41.160 --> 41:43.160
Give me sheets.

41:44.160 --> 41:46.160
Sheets.

41:46.160 --> 41:47.160
Yeah.

41:47.160 --> 41:48.160
I'm going to go sheets.

41:48.160 --> 41:49.160
All right.

41:49.160 --> 41:50.160
Same.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.160
Fresh brook.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.160
Adorning the mantle.

41:53.160 --> 41:57.160
Or spooning with someone with a lovely romp.

41:57.160 --> 41:59.160
Round.

41:59.160 --> 42:01.160
Round.

42:01.160 --> 42:03.160
Round.

42:03.160 --> 42:04.160
Round.

42:04.160 --> 42:06.160
Round.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.160
Round me.

42:07.160 --> 42:08.160
Guess.

42:08.160 --> 42:10.160
I'll go spooning still.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.160
It wins.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.160
All right.

42:12.160 --> 42:15.160
Finding cash in your doctors are coming your eyes out.

42:15.160 --> 42:18.160
How much cash?

42:18.160 --> 42:19.160
Yeah.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.160
How much cash?

42:20.160 --> 42:21.160
Yeah.

42:21.160 --> 42:23.160
I'll go coming your eyes out.

42:23.160 --> 42:25.160
Well, at most it'd be a hundred.

42:25.160 --> 42:26.160
If it's one dollar.

42:26.160 --> 42:27.160
If it's one bill.

42:27.160 --> 42:28.160
Right.

42:28.160 --> 42:29.160
That's pretty good.

42:29.160 --> 42:32.160
So let's say up to a hundred.

42:32.160 --> 42:34.160
But odds are less.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.160
How many you ever found a hundred dollar bill?

42:36.160 --> 42:37.160
That's a pretty rare.

42:37.160 --> 42:38.160
No.

42:38.160 --> 42:41.160
Then again, I've never came my eyes out.

42:41.160 --> 42:46.160
Well, my thing is, like, how much is coming that hard worth to.

42:46.160 --> 42:47.160
Right.

42:47.160 --> 42:49.160
Keep in mind, you're actually losing money because the copay.

42:49.160 --> 42:50.160
Right.

42:50.160 --> 42:51.160
Right.

42:51.160 --> 42:52.160
Yeah.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.160
Unless she's already reached her max deductible for the year.

42:54.160 --> 42:55.160
Right.

42:55.160 --> 42:56.160
Also.

42:56.160 --> 42:58.160
Right.

42:58.160 --> 43:01.160
And there's that a specialty visit or your general practitioner.

43:01.160 --> 43:02.160
Right.

43:02.160 --> 43:03.160
Right.

43:03.160 --> 43:04.160
Yeah.

43:04.160 --> 43:05.160
All good questions.

43:05.160 --> 43:06.160
Yeah.

43:06.160 --> 43:11.160
This is a hundred dollars in my pants seems like a smart move.

43:11.160 --> 43:12.160
Yeah.

43:12.160 --> 43:13.160
Yeah.

43:13.160 --> 43:14.160
Because I got it.

43:14.160 --> 43:15.160
Yeah.

43:15.160 --> 43:17.160
I got it with pants coming your eyes up.

43:17.160 --> 43:22.160
I think I could go either way if we need to push it for.

43:22.160 --> 43:23.160
Well, keep in mind.

43:23.160 --> 43:24.160
This is September gladness.

43:24.160 --> 43:25.160
Okay.

43:25.160 --> 43:26.160
It's nothing.

43:26.160 --> 43:31.160
I just feel like if we if we push forward coming your eyes out.

43:31.160 --> 43:33.160
It's going to win.

43:34.160 --> 43:36.160
You know, I mean, so I feel like no guarantee.

43:36.160 --> 43:39.160
I'm going to, I'm going to say a finding cash.

43:39.160 --> 43:42.160
I'm going to go cash.

43:42.160 --> 43:45.160
I'm going to go with cash because if you get a, if it's a hundred dollars,

43:45.160 --> 43:50.160
you could go to a really nice restaurant and you could come your eyes out from the food being good.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.160
It's true.

43:51.160 --> 43:52.160
Yeah.

43:52.160 --> 43:53.160
Good.

43:53.160 --> 43:54.160
All right.

43:54.160 --> 43:55.160
All right.

43:55.160 --> 43:56.160
You could find a new way.

43:56.160 --> 43:57.160
Here we go.

43:57.160 --> 44:00.160
That Friday feeling or finishing a page turner.

44:01.160 --> 44:02.160
Friday.

44:02.160 --> 44:03.160
Friday feeling.

44:03.160 --> 44:04.160
Yeah.

44:04.160 --> 44:05.160
All right.

44:05.160 --> 44:08.160
Uh, final four.

44:08.160 --> 44:11.160
Uh, four more sections, though.

44:14.160 --> 44:15.160
Let's go.

44:15.160 --> 44:16.160
Trilolo.

44:16.160 --> 44:20.160
He's not going to be able to stop it.

44:20.160 --> 44:25.160
Let's sit in with a daddy chill.

44:25.160 --> 44:29.160
What I was going to go for was, um,

44:29.160 --> 44:31.160
this.

44:31.160 --> 44:33.160
Final.

44:33.160 --> 44:35.160
Final.

44:35.160 --> 44:36.160
Final four.

44:36.160 --> 44:38.160
What is the jicker thing?

44:38.160 --> 44:41.160
Where he's like, the final four.

44:41.160 --> 44:44.160
Oh, yeah.

44:44.160 --> 44:46.160
I'll go with that cheat.

44:46.160 --> 44:49.160
This is a mirror doing a jaken mirror watch.

44:49.160 --> 44:51.160
Oh, yeah.

44:51.160 --> 44:53.160
Oh, yeah.

44:53.160 --> 44:58.160
Cold fresh linen sheets or spooning with someone with.

44:59.160 --> 45:03.160
A Pixar mom level dumpper.

45:03.160 --> 45:05.160
Dumper.

45:05.160 --> 45:08.160
I got to go shoot.

45:08.160 --> 45:12.160
I'm going spooning.

45:12.160 --> 45:15.160
Oh, go with spooning again.

45:15.160 --> 45:17.160
Spooning.

45:17.160 --> 45:20.160
We upset cold fresh linen sheets.

45:20.160 --> 45:23.160
That was the crazy closest for me.

45:23.160 --> 45:27.160
But I'd rather have like.

45:27.160 --> 45:29.160
Normal room temperature.

45:29.160 --> 45:31.160
Week old men and sheets spooning with.

45:31.160 --> 45:33.160
Oh, by the way.

45:33.160 --> 45:34.160
I shouldn't show this.

45:34.160 --> 45:35.160
Speaking of college football.

45:35.160 --> 45:40.160
Look what I saw last night.

45:40.160 --> 45:41.160
What is that?

45:41.160 --> 45:42.160
What is it?

45:42.160 --> 45:44.160
That's the happiest I've ever seen.

45:44.160 --> 45:47.160
If you know, you know.

45:47.160 --> 45:49.160
And I'll leave it at that.

45:49.160 --> 45:50.160
No.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.160
Let's just say he was.

45:51.160 --> 45:56.160
It was a quarterback for USC Jeff's Trojans in like 2000.

45:56.160 --> 45:57.160
No, I know.

45:57.160 --> 45:59.160
I want to say it marks.

45:59.160 --> 46:00.160
Oh, that's Mark Sanchez.

46:00.160 --> 46:02.160
You should have said for the jets.

46:02.160 --> 46:05.160
I had a jets Sanchez jersey.

46:05.160 --> 46:07.160
Um, there you go.

46:07.160 --> 46:11.160
Finding cash in your dockers versus that Friday feeling.

46:11.160 --> 46:12.160
Cash.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.160
Cash in the dockers.

46:14.160 --> 46:17.160
I'm going to go with that Friday feeling.

46:17.160 --> 46:18.160
Yeah.

46:18.160 --> 46:21.160
Oh, I'm here.

46:21.160 --> 46:23.160
There it is again.

46:23.160 --> 46:26.160
That Friday feeling.

46:26.160 --> 46:31.160
That Friday feeling.

46:31.160 --> 46:35.160
All right.

46:35.160 --> 46:37.160
We've made it to the finals.

46:37.160 --> 46:39.160
Some tempered gladness.

46:39.160 --> 46:44.160
Our finalists are spooning with a thick ass lover.

46:44.160 --> 46:47.160
Versus that Friday feeling.

46:48.160 --> 46:51.160
Crazy.

46:51.160 --> 46:52.160
English.

46:52.160 --> 46:57.160
What are we thinking?

46:57.160 --> 47:01.160
I mean, technically you could have both in the same scenario.

47:01.160 --> 47:02.160
That's true.

47:02.160 --> 47:04.160
But we'll go with us for a name.

47:04.160 --> 47:06.160
All right.

47:06.160 --> 47:08.160
One vote for Spooning.

47:08.160 --> 47:09.160
Chayla.

47:09.160 --> 47:11.160
TGIS, baby.

47:11.160 --> 47:12.160
Holy shit.

47:12.160 --> 47:14.160
OTGIS.

47:14.160 --> 47:15.160
TGIS.

47:15.160 --> 47:16.160
No, no.

47:16.160 --> 47:17.160
TGIS.

47:17.160 --> 47:18.160
Friday.

47:18.160 --> 47:19.160
Friday.

47:19.160 --> 47:20.160
Amir.

47:20.160 --> 47:22.160
Spooning.

47:22.160 --> 47:24.160
Holy shit.

47:24.160 --> 47:26.160
America.

47:26.160 --> 47:27.160
Friday.

47:27.160 --> 47:30.160
This is exactly what I wanted.

47:30.160 --> 47:32.160
It's all up to me.

47:32.160 --> 47:34.160
It's just crazy.

47:34.160 --> 47:37.160
Are you okay?

47:37.160 --> 47:40.160
Should we do a cliffhanger?

47:40.160 --> 47:41.160
Yeah.

47:41.160 --> 47:43.160
We should just continue this next week.

47:43.160 --> 47:53.160
Okay, you know what?

47:53.160 --> 47:59.160
I need to talk this out with you guys.

47:59.160 --> 48:02.160
That Friday feeling.

48:02.160 --> 48:04.160
It's different.

48:04.160 --> 48:07.160
I'll be sure to be sure.

48:07.160 --> 48:10.160
And when it is like.

48:10.160 --> 48:16.160
6 p.m. on a Friday where you have a weekend you're really looking forward to sunny day.

48:16.160 --> 48:17.160
Right.

48:17.160 --> 48:21.160
And you're about to go get drinks or dinner with people.

48:21.160 --> 48:26.160
You're in that there's that there's that butterfly feeling that you just don't get from anything.

48:26.160 --> 48:28.160
Let alone spooning.

48:28.160 --> 48:32.160
But then there's that feeling of waking up with a lover.

48:32.160 --> 48:35.160
Not having anything to do until later that day.

48:35.160 --> 48:38.160
So you can stay in bed if you want or you can go do something.

48:38.160 --> 48:41.160
And you know, it's it's a little cold in the room.

48:41.160 --> 48:43.160
So you're grasping to them.

48:43.160 --> 48:46.160
And when you're arm falls asleep, you know.

48:46.160 --> 48:51.160
That isn't even on Friday.

48:51.160 --> 48:56.160
Oh my god.

48:56.160 --> 49:00.160
Oh my god.

49:00.160 --> 49:04.160
Holy moly.

49:04.160 --> 49:07.160
Our winner is.

49:07.160 --> 49:20.160
That Friday feeling.

49:20.160 --> 49:22.160
I wish we was Friday today.

49:22.160 --> 49:25.160
Actually, can I change my answer?

49:25.160 --> 49:32.160
I feel like finishing a page turner.

49:32.160 --> 49:33.160
What do you guys have going on?

49:33.160 --> 49:36.160
What do you want to point to people to head gum related or not?

49:36.160 --> 49:39.160
Social media projects outside of work.

49:39.160 --> 49:40.160
It's the floor is yours.

49:40.160 --> 49:43.160
Let's start with English.

49:43.160 --> 49:44.160
Uh.

49:44.160 --> 49:47.160
I've got a lot of background.

49:47.160 --> 49:50.160
But I'm working on a Halloween coloring.

49:50.160 --> 49:53.160
But I will have available in October.

49:53.160 --> 49:54.160
So.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.160

49:55.160 --> 49:56.160
I love Halloween.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.160
It's my favorite Halloween.

49:57.160 --> 49:59.160
What's your Instagram handle English?

49:59.160 --> 50:00.160

50:00.160 --> 50:01.160
Yes.

50:01.160 --> 50:04.160
My Instagram handle for that is English Marie Art.

50:04.160 --> 50:05.160
Yeah.

50:05.160 --> 50:07.160
Pretty easy to find.

50:07.160 --> 50:10.160
Get orange crayons ready.

50:10.160 --> 50:11.160
Yeah.

50:11.160 --> 50:14.160
Um, follow the head gum everywhere.

50:14.160 --> 50:17.160
Follow gum ball everywhere.

50:17.160 --> 50:19.160
And follow me everywhere.

50:19.160 --> 50:20.160

50:20.160 --> 50:22.160

50:22.160 --> 50:25.160

50:25.160 --> 50:28.160
Schmoo.

50:28.160 --> 50:29.160
Gorkt.

50:29.160 --> 50:33.960
Our head gum is first scripted podcast is a laugh riot.

50:33.960 --> 50:35.160
I was listening to episode three.

50:35.160 --> 50:36.160
There's only been three episodes.

50:36.160 --> 50:38.160
So it's very easy to catch up.

50:38.160 --> 50:42.160
But I was L-O-L and cracking up listening to it.

50:42.160 --> 50:46.160
If you like this style of comedy and you made it this far on the episode.

50:46.160 --> 50:47.160
So I know you do.

50:47.160 --> 50:49.160
You should definitely check out.

50:49.160 --> 50:50.160
Quarkt.

50:50.160 --> 50:54.160
Final episode is the week after this episode comes out.

50:54.160 --> 50:56.160
So then you spend it all.

50:56.160 --> 50:57.160
There's only four episodes.

50:57.160 --> 50:58.160
Only four.

50:58.160 --> 51:00.160
And it's really funny.

51:00.160 --> 51:02.160
And it's a murder episode.

51:02.160 --> 51:04.160
So it'll reveal everything.

51:04.160 --> 51:06.160
Mm-hmm.

51:06.160 --> 51:08.160
Uh, Marika.

51:08.160 --> 51:14.160
Um, listen to our formula one.

51:16.160 --> 51:17.160
So the pit wall.

51:17.160 --> 51:18.160
It's in the same feed.

51:18.160 --> 51:20.160

52:21.160 --> 52:22.160
That we're going to be tiny little boxes.

Shouldn't have done that.

52:23.160 --> 52:24.160
Really shouldn't have done that.

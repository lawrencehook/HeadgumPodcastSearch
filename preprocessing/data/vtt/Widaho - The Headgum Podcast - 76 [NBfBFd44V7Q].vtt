00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head gum original.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Found a be heard this show ever, of them in the live show.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Oh yeah! Okay, cool.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
What was that?

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
That was my friend's song.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
You can call me daddy.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
It's um...

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Jeff, have you ever been called daddy in the bedroom?

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
I'll plead the fifth on any sex questions that I'm fielding.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
F-E-E-L-D, shout out to those who know.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Listen, let's talk about who we've got on the show today

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
because we've got the return of the prodigal son and a new guest.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
First, ever time on the airwaves for this show.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Give it up for Dane Cardell and Bowen Bowles.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Woo! Woo! Woo!

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Is it Cardell or Cardell? I've only said it once.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah, you kind of fuck that up. It's like Cardell.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Fuck.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Dane podcast acquisitions manager.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Right?

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
A little bit above that, but basically.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
CCO.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
VP of that, but...

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
I'm getting no help from him here here.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Uh, yeah.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
You don't deserve help.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
And some sort of leaving you at C without a raft.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Fucking damn it.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Um, and then Fallon, you and I did improv together in college.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Yes, we did.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Oh, good old second nature.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Yeah.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
You can call her daddy second nature.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Um, yeah, we're back in the day at the USC.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
You got the fights on, Anna.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
I'm so happy.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Really good.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
I don't know it by heart.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Here we go.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Should we try and see if we can do it?

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Dane, Dane, Dane, Dane, Dane, Dane.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
How the hell does he know it?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
That might be his CLA's.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
I only know what.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
It's absolute brainwashing.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Hey, you can get in there.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Was this it?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I think this is like the prequel.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Okay.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Oh, this was it, Dane.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Anyway.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
That sounds more familiar.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Um, yeah.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
UCB fame.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
TikTok fan.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Anything else you want to plug in?

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Uh, plug in the the TikTok plugin, uh,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
member of young Douglas, which was a UCB team.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
All right.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
He rested in peace.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Uh, she's she's gone.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
But we're still alive.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
So we're still around.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
And that's, uh, all my plugs.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Assistant Astrid and air.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Extraordinary.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Um, but TikTok mainly.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Yeah.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
That's, that's my claim to fame.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Oh, yeah.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
And then Dane, you were mentioning you went to a mushroom festival or something?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
You know, we do all the like the boutique little like, you know,

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
upstate New York little wool festivals, mushroom festivals festivals.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Nice.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Nice.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Festivals.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
That's good.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
How many how many weekends would you say you're out of festival?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
It's usually every weekend during the summer.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
I actually got a taxi during me, uh, Scorpion at the last festival.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Oh, so much as that run.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Right.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
It was a solid 150.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
It was up here.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Can we see it?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Do you have it?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Yeah.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Scorpions are my biggest tangible fear in this world.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Have we talked about this on the show?

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Oh, no way, man.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
That sucks to see for me in a frame.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
So what is it?

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
What is it filled with when they see it's taxidermy?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Well, I don't know.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
I, I'm using that word very nicely.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
But um, it's a real scorpion and it's preserved.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
It's shadow box nicely.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
It's filled with reserves.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Ah.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I like go back beside it.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
No.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Not anymore.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
You already used that last week.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
It sucked.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
And it was solar.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Really?

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
Apparently it means when are you coming home in Hindu?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Okay.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
That's fair then.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I'll allow it.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Yeah.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
For.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
For Halloween.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
We bought a um, a taxidermy bat.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Second hand on you.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Yeah.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
This is now a hobby then.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
You like you like critters things that go bump in the night.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
It took my dog 24 hours to eat that thing whole.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
He ate a taxidermy bat whole whole.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
And wait.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Isn't that sharp and deadly?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Like how do you?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
There are a lot of bad things that come from it.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
My dog stomach is iron.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Did you?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
So how did you?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Were you there for any of it?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Like that seems like he would take hours to chew through it.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
He was building him.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
One more bite.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Scamp.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Is it a big dog?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Like that sounds very painful.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
It's like 35.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
So, you know, there's just like little bits of things that could be wrong with that.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
You know, but you observe, you know, is a panteen?

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Is it sort of killing over?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Anyway.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
So, you just everything was fine.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Find it.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
And then you were like, oh no, I think the dog ate it.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Or you saw like him chewing on the head as a finish.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
No, no.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
It was just literally nowhere to be found.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
So, not even like the teeth or the feet or anything.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
How could a dog eat a fucking bat and be fine?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
That seems not right.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
You're really fixating on this bat stomach.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
How did they just try to say something interesting?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
And now you're like doubling down.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
I'm curious.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Yeah.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
How big is the bat that he ate it, do you think?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
You have pictures?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Pretty big.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Like seven inches, maybe six inches.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
So, you think he chewed throughout slowly like a bone?

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
No, I probably have like two bites, three bites, swallow.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Oh, like he was just like a thin cracker.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Anyway.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
And you want to have a fun story is about about that.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Fallen jump in.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Okay.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
I do actually have a good dog eating story.

07:10.000 --> 07:17.000
I will say not as good as eating about whole, but I have a phobia of gum chewing gum

07:17.000 --> 07:25.000
because when I was young, I found my Irish terrier just chewing on a piece of gum.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Casually in my kitchen.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
And I, you know, in my mind, I was like, that's not what the dog should be doing.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
But she went through a period of time where she would take gum out of the trash can

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
and just chew on it.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
And that could lead to a phobia in you.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah, now I can't chew gum because it's for dogs.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Gum is for dogs.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
It's probably going to end up on the out of context Twitter account.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
You'll sell it.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
I want a wild ride.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
This is crazy.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
This is New Soundboard, baby.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Oh, we do have a good one.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
You guys just energy is sour.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Found the one that's smiling out of joy.

08:16.000 --> 08:35.000
Dane is smiling out of contempt and a mirror isn't vacant today.

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
So half of like your energy is bad, but one of your guests is good and the other one is fine.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
That seems like pretty good normal decent average for this show.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
All right.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
We have some segments to get to, but I thought we could sort of wax until then.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
I love it.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Yeah.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
What's new in New York, Dane and Fallon?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Different parts in New York, but oh, sorry.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
We definitely don't have those guys.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
You're not New York.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Not New York.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Because in 9-11, you can't fly over the city.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
It's over.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
It's been done.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Yeah.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I forgot that out.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
The mirror tread lightly.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Obviously.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Fuck.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
I finalized before this.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
I had a call found to finalize that I'm coming to New York for three months.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
Can we play that homecoming sound that you have?

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Not that one.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
This girl is off.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Um.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Yeah.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Ferris Cup.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Believe this out.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
But.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
So I'm literally going to be like two weeks for you.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
You're my neighbor.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Yeah.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Please cut this out.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
You're a block to wax away for me.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
We can meet up at Nudes and Chill every day.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Yes.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
That is what we examined that there's a place called Nudes and Chill on the episode that

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
came out today.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
What's Nudes and Chill about?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Like, what's the vibe?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
It's like, fuck, right?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Mm-hmm.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
It's like BYU.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Oh.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Get your fuck.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Sit on the.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
No bathroom.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
No bottles.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
No bathroom.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
No bathroom.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
No bathroom.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Little scary.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
But that.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
It's New York.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Classic.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
It's Manhattan.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
It's absolutely Manhattan.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
It's not.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
It's Brooklyn.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
It's Brooklyn.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
That shouldn't have changed the mood.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
You were wrong.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I was just correcting you.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
It's not.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
You also specified Manhattan.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
You could have just set the York.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
You would have been wrong, but nobody would have known.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
It's no weehawkin'.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Yeah.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
It's not New Jersey.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
That's true.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
That's true.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
So it's Manhattan.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
No.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Not everything.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
That's not weehawkin'.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
It's Manhattan.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Yeah.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
We're not on the same page.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
So don't like agree with me.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
No.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Not a percent or not.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
A hundred percent.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
There's a disconnect that I can't help but remedy for the next 30 minutes.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Yes.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Not remedy, but yes.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
There is a disconnect.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Yes.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
We'll fix it.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
We'll fix it.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Probably not.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Dan.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Have you all thought about a couple's therapy?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Maybe for like friends.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Yeah.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
It's hard to say about this.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
It's hard to say about this.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
It's hard to say about this.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
It's hard to say about this.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Yeah.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
That's for people who want to even get a lot.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
I like the fact that we're not good like that.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Like I don't want to be boys with him.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
That would make me boys and Tim.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Tim.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Yeah.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Yeah.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
And I don't want to be close with you.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
I want to be Glenn closest.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Few.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
You know what I mean?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Where it's like.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Oh, thank god Jeffrey's here.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
So I know somebody.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I'm thinking about doing a studio in New York.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
I think you have.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
It's nice to be able to go down.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Go to some house parties.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Birthday parties.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
A couple of events here and there.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Mm.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
It's nice.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
I miss out.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Do you have a house here?

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
You guys sort of ask the same question.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Do you have a house in Kingston?

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
And do you want to pee at a tear?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Yeah.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
I don't know what that means.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
I'm laughing.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
But I don't know what it means.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
That's a good sound bite.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
You should keep that Jeff for later.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Full steam ahead.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
Um, did you guys see this New York Times article?

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
Uh, talking about how 37 year olds are afraid of the 23 year olds who work for them?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Yes.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Yes.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
I also saw the Twitter spaces audio room that you hosted about it.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
It seemed like you hadn't read it by the way.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
I wanted to continue the discussion from the space.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
And on in terms of the idea of older millennials having some sort of

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
chasm between them and older gen Z,

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
or who are now entering the workforce in sort of what?

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
What does that divide mean for?

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Companies such as I have a video.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
I don't know.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
I don't know.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
I don't know.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
And we should say I have not read the article still.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Yeah.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
But let's have it.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Well, it's not.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
It's none of us have read it.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
I think in this point.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
So we have nothing to discuss.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Have you ever read it?

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
Sadly no, but it's definitely something that's been on my mind.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Yes.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Because you're 26.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Yeah.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
I did that out.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Um.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Not at all.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I'm 36.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I'm 26.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
I'm 36.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Absolutely.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
It's a sound way older.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
Is that young millennial technically or?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Yeah.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
We're on the cost.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
95 and 96 are millennial gen Z costs.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
I get some of this some stuff.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
In fact, that I said I get some stuff.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
Making it obvious at how I'm older.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Well, you're on tech talk.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
So that's that's point in your favor.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Thank you so much.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
A mirror is also on tech talk.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
But point against you.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Again.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
I don't know who to choose.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
This is like Sophie's choice.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Yeah.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Oh, then you off.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Interesting.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Sorry.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
One second.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
No discussion.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
No.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
I'm not even going to say slash sphere.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
We had at one point.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Marty Michael.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
My 37 year old boss and me.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
23.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
And then we had other people that were my age and some other people that were kind of his age.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Found you.

14:51.000 --> 15:01.000
Offer and represent this unique perspective of someone who lies in the in between the days between as they say.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Yep.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
Has they said?

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
What has your experience been in the workplace since you graduated in terms of

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
dealing with these.

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
These are these millennial crusty asses.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Sorry.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Dana's a beautiful.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
I don't feel any older than like you.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
So it's not like I'm insulted in a way.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
We're all just hanging out having a crusty geezer.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
Now that's not how I feel internally.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
So you can answer the question.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
But just know that you're not insulting me.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Well, they goodness.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
Well, my boss will definitely listen.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
So let me tell you, you're not an ancient geaser.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Thank you.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
I needed to hear that.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Two second of her boss.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Yeah.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
For sure.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
For sure.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Yeah.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
To Charlie.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
You know, it's been a lot of let me show you this meme.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
It's been a lot of let me explain this meme to you.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
It's been a lot of how funny is this Instagram reel.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Oh my god.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Your days behind.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
You know, we went through that already.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
But yeah, it's been a lot of hijinks,

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Pranks.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I, as an assistant.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
I do a lot of pranks.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
That's pretty pretty.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
I'm pretty great.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Hiding is a lot of it.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Yeah.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
You go to work and you hide at work or hiding,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
meaning you just don't show up to work.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
I think outside in the bushes.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Right.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
That's what I was worried about.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
No, going to work.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Doing the, doing the work, of course.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Right.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Always doing the work.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
We're all doing the work.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
We're all doing the work.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
We're here doing the work.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
But there was a moment in time where I would hide out and play.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Mario Kart mobile version on my phone.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
So.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Yeah.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Oh, yeah.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Highly recommend.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
And you said your boss is going to listen to this.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Jesus.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I think she already knows.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Now this was a few years ago, few years back.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
But it's been fun.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
It's.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I definitely don't seem threatening though.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I think the interns are more threatening than I.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Right.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Because that's that Gen Z.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Wave.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
I mean, I feel like you're more.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
More Gen or Millennial.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
I would say.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
I read.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I resonate with that.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
You know, my first, you know, media job 15 bucks an hour.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
I would take an hour nap break in the fashion closet every day.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
What company is this?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
This is Connie Nast.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Yeah.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Right.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Connie Nast.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Found a freaking Nast.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Did you ever get con day nasty in the office?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Like.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Just wondering in terms of.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
No.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Start the show.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
I think I think the waxing thing.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Didn't go quite according to your plan.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
The con day nasty thing was sort of the nidier of the entire event.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
So why don't we call it?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Yeah.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
That's good.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Welcome to.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Yeah.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Bond.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Bond.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Yeah.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
We can tell the next James Bond is cast.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
We're going to offer up who are bonds of the week are.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Dane, do you have a bond of the week?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Have we said Harry Styles yet?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
That's really good.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
The question is, is Styles bigger than Bond already?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
No.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
I don't think he is actually.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
I think the, I think Bond is bigger.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Yeah.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
I get that.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
And that was like, you guys all took like a pregnant pause there.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Let's try to avoid those because we can't really edit the show.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Dane, you came in at the absolute last second.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
And you saved it.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
But if anybody had waited one more beat,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
we would have had to start the whole fucking thing over again.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
So let's just kind of be conscious of that.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Harry Styles lives at.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
He lives.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
He does.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
He does.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
That's true.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Yeah.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
It's an unbelievably not private house.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
I don't understand why they live there.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Do you guys have any bonds of the week?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
So Dane, you offered up Harry Styles.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
I think that's an amazing choice.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Yeah.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Yeah.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Because my pick is Robes Pier.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Who?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Who?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Robes Pier.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
He's a dead French revolutionary isn't it?

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Yes.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I was going to say he's sort of a radical French revolutionist.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Who?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
He has that killer type.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
I think that's true.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
I think that's true.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Okay.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Well, you know what?

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Everybody keeps telling me that Bond doesn't have to be British.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
It's only let's open it up to fucking anything then.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Dead or alive.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Robes Pier.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Because he has the killer instinct and he values virtue over evil.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Yeah.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
He died in 1794.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
So yeah.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Oh.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Yeah.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
I just think he would rock the suit.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
He doesn't know what movies are.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
There's no way he could act.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
He's French.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Right.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Doesn't speak English.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
And again, he's been dead for over two centuries.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Most of it.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
I think let's just keep him on the selects for now.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
And we'll do like a round of callbacks.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
So to be here.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
He's not a mix.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Robes Pier.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Yeah.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
He's not worth giving a chemistry read to.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
I think it is.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
He doesn't have a fine.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Who's your bond of the week?

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
Aaron Rogers.

20:44.000 --> 20:50.000
Star quarterback who's been sort of taking it to the woke liberal elite.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
Today for calling him out for not getting vaccinated.

20:55.000 --> 21:04.000
And he's sort of the hero we deserve to sort of do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
And he has a.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
And he has a strong.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
That's not funny.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
It's the worst chuckle to hear.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
It's a hard.

21:11.000 --> 21:17.000
It's a hard sort of a tight grip in a really nice spiral.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
That's not anything that James Bond needs.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
You can.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Yeah.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
We're super boring.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
During.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Aaron Rogers has a good glance.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
I think that's that's important.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Great.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Yeah.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Yeah.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Yeah.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
And he's dating Shaley Woodley.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
He is.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Which is for now.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Maybe.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Yeah.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Do you know something we don't know.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
I don't know.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
But I imagine this is probably problematic for their relationship.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Do you want to be associated with this guy?

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
I don't.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Maybe she likes it.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Yeah.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Maybe she's like that too.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Could be.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
I mean.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
What does she have part of the Bernie campaign though?

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Yeah.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Why she?

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
It's a weird fit.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Yeah.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Yeah.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
I don't get it.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
But I think she's anti-vaxx as well.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Not to start rumors.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Yeah.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Oh, really.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
She doesn't.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
Aaron said that he's not anti-vaxx today.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
It's so much dumber when people are not vaccinated.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
But they're like, well, I'm not anti-vaxx.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
So you're.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Then you're fucking idiot.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Okay.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
Well, tread lightly because this is the next bond potentially.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
You don't want to lose favor with James.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
Jeffrey James Bond.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
Besides you, I think, um, a Dell.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
But that was before I know you didn't have to be British.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Yeah.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Yeah.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Yeah.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
A Dell would be good.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
And she's already done the song.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
So she's kind of in the verse.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Yeah.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Fantastic.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
James Bond extended cinematic universe.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Ian Fleming.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Oh, she'd be so good.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
She'd be amazing.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Yeah.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
Uh, we just moved on to our next segment.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
Are you guys ready?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Yeah.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
I think we exhausted the, uh, bond options.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Yeah.

23:12.000 --> 23:39.000
Oh, we just have to take a break.

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
Jesus, man.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
Do it before the theme.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
This podcast is sponsored by Better Help Online Therapy.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
Check out BetterHelp.com slash what's that?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Guys, life is full of stressors.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Ain't it?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
It doesn't matter who you are or what you have.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
Your life is probably stressful.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
You may not be feeling totally down and out in the press or like you're out of total loss.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Your stress is high.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Your temper is shorter than usual.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
Or even if you started to feel strain in any of your relationships.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
You could probably use the chance to unload.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
So unload the stress and get it out by talking to somebody who's completely unbiased about

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
your life.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
Someone who isn't going to judge you or take sides on anything.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
And when there are things you feel like you can't tell anyone or feel like you can't unload

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
to family and friends and you need to unload it.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
That's what therapy can be.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
Better help comes in exactly then.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
By being customized to online therapy that offers video phone and even live chat sessions

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
with your therapist.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
So you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
It's also much more affordable than in person therapy.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
And you can start communicating with your therapist and under 48 hours.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
So unload the stressors and get some unbiased feedback.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
You'd be pretty surprised at what you might learn.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000

25:48.000 --> 25:53.000
I have used one of the other competitors of HelloFresh.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
I'm not going to mention who it is.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
And I've also used HelloFresh and HelloFresh is ingredients.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
I must say are much cleaner, much more fresh, tasteier.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
And easier to use in cook.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000

On to a buck.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Here we go.

26:41.000 --> 26:46.000
Welcome to foul and bulls or falling bulls.

26:46.000 --> 26:52.000
The name of the game is foul and bulls or falling bulls.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Here we go.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Do you guys know how to play?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Have you guys played this before?

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
We played similar games that you've invented.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
But not specifically this one.

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
Okay, so I'm going to play the sound of something that's either foul and or a bull.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
I'm ready.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
This is for actual cash by the way.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
$100 for every right answer.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
$100 owed to me for every wrong answer.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Winner takes all.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Winner takes all.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
I don't want to go with any.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Correct.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Dane is correct with bull.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
That was a bull following off of a kitchen table.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
All right.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Here we go.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
When I want to feel like Bimbo Baggins.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
I take a dump at Sunday in Brooklyn.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
This bathroom is the shire.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Look at that stone sink.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
What glass?

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
Pables or a stack?

27:49.000 --> 28:02.000
I don't want to Venmo you, but it's a bull.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
That was you.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Obviously.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Now you have to Venmo me.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Now you owe me $100.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
All right.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Sending it now.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
You're just sent it to Dane at this point.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Here we go.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
You guys ready for the next one?

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
This is crazy.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Yeah.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
If you haven't got to the bathroom and Mr. Fong's, you're literally no one.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
This bathroom is iconic.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
It's got running water.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
It's got paper towels.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
It's got to be found.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
It's got to be found.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
A mirror is tied with Dane.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Both at 100 here we go.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Next one.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Jesus man.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Bull.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Correct.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Dane is cleaning house.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
All right.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Can I guess before?

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Yes.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
I'm going to go with Bull again.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
I put you back at 100.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
I'm sorry.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
You're tied with me.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
It was going to be.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
It was going to be found.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
So I guess.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Here we go.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Last one.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
No.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
This is the next one.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Uh.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
I'm going to say Bull.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Correct.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
All right. You guys all got a hundred dollars.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Actually found you broke even and Dane in a mirror.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
You got a hundred dollars.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
So we're going to have to do a.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I guess this is a winner takes all around.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
This is all off the top.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Here we go.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Ah.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Wasn't prepared for this.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
If you're not having this piece of your life,

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
you've got to come and cry about.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Speak.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Can't wait to say beef.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
That's going to be wrong.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
I'm here.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
You're going home with a hundred.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Clams, man.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
I'm going to go up a sunny.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
What's funny?

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
I'm sorry, but what's funny?

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
I'm not going to send you to cash back for that.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Don't send it to me.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
And I'm going to keep it if you send me a hundred dollars.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
This is so fucked up.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Oh, not really.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Oh.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
What a game.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
What a game.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Huh?

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Oh, it's official.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Oh, it's official.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Are you ready for it?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
We'll get into our next segment in a second.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
This one's going to be a lot of fun.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
This is very open to your guys.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Creative minds.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
And all of which I respect.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
It's a very degrees.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
So we'll get into it, actually.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Let's see what this might hold.

31:03.000 --> 31:12.000
Welcome to name that state.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Welcome to name that absolute state.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
So this is the continent.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
No, it's the 48 continental states.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
Um, a lot of you really good at this.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I think I know them all.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Okay.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
That's actually not what the game is.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
Okay.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
I don't know why I thought so because you said it was named that state.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
The correct.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
The name of the game is named that state.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
The idea is that a lot of these names that we have currently.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Yeah.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
They're not quite cutting it for me.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
I say you want to rename that state.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Sure.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
So like not sure.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
That's the name that the game is renamed the state.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
You're not doing me a favor.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
If this is how it's going to be.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Let's show right now.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Obviously.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Let's end it.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Sure.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Sure.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
It's like you're letting it slide for me.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
I am.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
Because you thought it was named every state.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Instead, it's let's rename the states.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Right.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Right.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Yes.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Yeah.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Exactly.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Like what if Idaho was wide of.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Sure.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
That's an example of a state being slightly different.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
I like that one because it's really not.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Mouse.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Mouse.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Mouse.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
I'm over it.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
All right.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
So basically what I'm going to do is I'm going to shout.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
I'm going to point to a state and shout out one of your guys's names.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
You guys are going to just give it the first name that it comes off your thing.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
We'll kind of keep going until we kind of fill out the map here.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Here we go.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Idaho is going to stick.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
So I'm not going to point there.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Fallen.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Mm-hmm.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
New name for Indiana.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Oh.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Um.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Oh.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Uh.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Oh.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Um.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Uh.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Catholic.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
So the Indianapolis.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Yeah.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
All right.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Um.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
You're going to write it down or you're just going to sort of just remember it.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
There's only 48.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
I'm pointing to Tennessee and let's see what day it has.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Um.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
This is the same.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Should be so much faster than this.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Ten to be.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
That's pretty good.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Ten to be.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Ten to be.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Ten to be.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Ten to be.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Ten to be.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Ten to be.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Ten to be.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Ten to be.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
As in Jeffrey's games.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Ten to be.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Ten to be.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Pretty bad.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
No, that's not funny.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
As I put a lot of work into these.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Not really.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
He's just sort of uploaded a.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
I'm writing ten to be down.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Ten to be.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
All right.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
I'm here.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Texas.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
New name.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Uh.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Fincilvania.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Fincilvania.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
No, because it doesn't.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
Yes.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
You guys aren't here at this.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Here we go.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Why don't we go as one.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Why don't we like it?

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
What about instead of Nevada?

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
It's trepidacious.

34:02.000 --> 34:11.000
Why is that any better than ten to be?

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
This is so balanced.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
It's not how I wanted.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Catholic was great.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Thank you.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
All right.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
It's not a hard science.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Illinois.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
They're all fine.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
What do you mean they're all fine?

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
They're all fine.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
They're all equally.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Yeah.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Exactly.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
But you don't have to yell that like.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
Dan's was bad or mine wasn't good.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
And then sneakers were the best.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Why do I hose the best?

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
I like Las Vegas trepidacious.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
I know you do.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
That's the problem.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
Let's get one for Illinois Amir.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Illinois.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
Like a knee swath salad.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
All right.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
It's another one.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
It's not quite far enough from the state already that I would like to be.

34:57.000 --> 35:02.000
Why the hell is adding a single letter to Idaho?

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
Mine was a lot further.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
West Virginia.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Let's go vest Virginia.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
Yes.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
Very similar.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Yeah.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
So it's like Virginia but with a vest on it.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Take me home.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Country Road.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
To a flame.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
I have a side.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
Best Virginia.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Yeah.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Mountain.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Yeah.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
Take me home.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
Country Road.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
That was important.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
Dan, let's get one for Florida.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Lipstick.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
It's really good.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Miami Lipstick.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Okay.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Now we're thinking.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Fallen.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Let's take it all the way to New Mexico.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Oh.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Oh.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Oh.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
New Mexico.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Oh.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
New Mexico.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Let me go.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Turquoise.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
That's good.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
True to the region.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
Absolutely.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
I love that.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Amir, your home state.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
California.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Let's hear it.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Dates.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Dates too.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
West Nevada.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
But Nevada at this point is trepidacious.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
So is it West trepidacious or is it West Nevada?

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
That's trepidacious.

36:20.000 --> 36:28.000
Technically, it's West trepidacious if we're naming California after Nevada.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
West trepidacious.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Kind of.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Kind of slabs.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
I'm blind.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
So trepidacious is good, but West trepidacious is bad.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
You're bad at improv.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
All right.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
I'm going to hit us with a new name for Utah instead of Utah.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
What if it was like flounder?

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
What if it was?

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Man.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
That's better.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
By the way, you had a week to think of this.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Right?

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Because you know the name was coming.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Go on Tuesday.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Yes.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Tuesdays.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
We did up time.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Three days.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Still years are worse than ours.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
And we're coming up with them on the spot.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Flounder?

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
Founder.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
I didn't think about it until then.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
It's an improv.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
All right.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Colorado.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Fallen.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
What do you got?

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Colorado.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Baldwin.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
So it would be bolder, Baldwin.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Yes.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
This is really good.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Now we're really starting to think I love lipstick.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
I love bald men.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Let's do Wyoming.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Man.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Where is Wyoming?

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
Is there?

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
I'm here.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
Your man.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Why doming?

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
Are you kidding me?

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
What?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
That's what wide a ho is.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Yeah.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
I'm so important.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
I'm running with it.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Why doming?

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
There's a bunch of states that start with new.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
And now there's a bunch of states that start with wide.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
All right.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Fine.

37:52.000 --> 38:00.000
Dan, a new one for Michigan.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Michigan.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
New.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Perfect.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Yeah.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
I think Michigan is a good one.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Shiny.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
Shiny.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Absolutely.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Word of the week.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Danger's got a thousand dollars.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Well, I see.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
It was absolutely shimmy.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Pretty sure you went.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
We can review the tape.

38:22.000 --> 38:27.000
But I think you went for the soundboard before Dan said shimmy.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
All right.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
I'm just going to.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Here we go.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Oh my god.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
What a.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Log into your chase.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Bank account.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
What a burden.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
This is going to be.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Huh.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
I want you to log into your chase account right now.

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
And we can just sort of take a look at what's going on in there.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Take a look at my bank account.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
I see it.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
One I got.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Yeah.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Hawaii.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
Let's read him.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Hawaii.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
To what?

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
To what?

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Warm.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Town.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
So be hot.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
No.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
We're not a town.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
It's a town.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
So it's a town.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
That's not a town.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
It's not just a city.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
It's not just a city.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
It's what about pansus?

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
No.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Because then you're only changing when we're lettering.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
If you're not going to play the right way then don't play.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
Yeah.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Because I think you did.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
You did a one letter one earlier.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
I think.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
Did it?

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
Didn't you do vest virginia?

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
Was that you?

39:32.000 --> 39:44.000
Let's revisit Ohio for the first time or homestay. Yes, I wonder if Dane could give us a name for Ohio.

39:44.000 --> 40:02.180
Um, let's go with, um, um, um, kiss from Ohio. Let's go with, uh, Jim. Jim who, just Jim, well, I'm going to say

40:02.180 --> 40:14.580
to Jim Ohio, but, uh, yes, you said, let's do Jim. Yeah. So Jim Brown Columbus, Jim. Yeah. All right.

40:14.580 --> 40:18.740
Yeah. Um, let's round it out. Let's do Louisiana and then we'll finish it out with the best

40:18.740 --> 40:30.100
state of all, maim. We all laugh at the thought. You want to finish this out, Fallen? Okay. Um,

40:30.100 --> 40:43.740
what about, maim, maim. Spell the same, maim. Yeah, maim. Portland, man, MA, YA, and E. One

40:43.740 --> 40:51.820
matter switch. I like that. Let's innovate. Yeah. Listen, we made, we've covered a lot of ground today,

40:51.820 --> 41:03.820
but I wanted to ask if you guys had any questions. Excuse me. If we had any questions for you,

41:03.820 --> 41:07.100
what could you possibly know? They covered a lot of ground. I'm wondering if you have any

41:07.100 --> 41:18.460
questions, like I know I was going kind of fast. We played a game where, yeah. Yeah. Please walk away.

41:18.460 --> 41:23.900
We've played falling balls or Fallen balls and you want to know if we have any questions for you.

41:23.900 --> 41:32.620
You're taking a chord. It's going. Yeah. Yes. The card is computer. Confused. That's fair. That's good.

41:33.580 --> 41:39.020
It's nice. That's happening. Yeah. Right now. Should have been, should have been charged already,

41:39.020 --> 41:47.980
of course, but we'll take it at the forefoot. Yeah. It's funny. That was easy.

41:50.780 --> 41:55.740
Well, got it. So you, uh, so let's do, yeah, let's do questions. What do you guys got?

41:56.620 --> 42:05.420
Fallen. I have a question for you. Yeah. What, uh, what, what, what game, ski ball or

42:05.420 --> 42:14.540
darts? Oof. I'm going to take a second there. Darts. Let's go. Should we?

42:14.620 --> 42:26.940
Right now. That's the game that the three of us will play when Jeff is in town. Perfect. I

42:26.940 --> 42:37.100
knew it's a chill. The fall place. We'll bring a dartboard. The bull's eyes are noodle.

42:37.580 --> 42:45.020
Um, so you guys seriously didn't have any questions? No. I mean, we did. I got a question for

42:45.020 --> 42:55.740
Dane. Oh, okay. Uh, how to show up state. Uh, eight months. Okay. And you love it.

42:56.780 --> 43:01.580
I don't know. I feel like there's, there's something to be said about like chasing happiness. And then

43:01.740 --> 43:07.180
not chasing happiness. And like, this is a version of not chasing it. I would say

43:08.300 --> 43:14.060
Cliff, like, city is like, you know, you're like Jeff, you're absolutely chasing happiness.

43:14.060 --> 43:18.220
By going to the city for three months. Yeah. That sounds miserable to me.

43:18.220 --> 43:23.660
Sorry. Well, the problem is that Jeff is always where he is. Like, you can leave LA, but it's

43:23.740 --> 43:31.340
looking to be, well, you. Um, what you need to do is sort of not change your city, but be a

43:31.340 --> 43:38.140
different person, a happier person. You're not exercising or practicing joy. You're just sort of

43:38.860 --> 43:44.300
being miserable in California than moving 3,000 miles and being miserable there. Yeah. Well,

43:44.300 --> 43:48.860
it's hard because like, I spread so much joy. And it takes so much out of me. You don't

43:49.420 --> 43:58.460
you're a giver. No, he gives. He's not giver. I would say. Yeah. So I'm ancient.

44:04.460 --> 44:11.580
What is this? What is this fucking smear campaign? You guys are inspiring against me in a

44:11.580 --> 44:18.060
private chat. 100% you are. I spread nothing but joy and liable. And I get both

44:18.780 --> 44:25.100
nerian return liable. You enjoy and I spread joy. I spread joy and legs.

44:28.860 --> 44:38.060
Incredible. I have a question for a mirror. Yeah. Yes. The painting behind you.

44:38.540 --> 44:47.340
The sky. Yeah. This guy. It's actually a picture. It's like a giant IKEA photo. Or it's like a

44:48.220 --> 44:55.980
giant photo art that you can get at IKEA. So instead of painting this giant white wall,

44:55.980 --> 45:02.300
we put it up there. A lot of it. You don't have to say that. It's absolute garbage and a horrible

45:02.300 --> 45:06.780
choice for the space because the issue is like you just went to IKEA and said, oh, what would fit

45:06.860 --> 45:11.020
this wall instead of trying to make the wall work for your personal memories and keep

45:11.020 --> 45:16.300
safe like Dane. Dane goes to festivals. Dane thinks taxidermy insects and critters put someone

45:16.300 --> 45:21.260
wall for joy. Yeah. You put a rope ridge on the wall which causes me anxiety anytime. I have

45:21.260 --> 45:26.300
to podcast with you. This one's nice. I'm on a teardottering wall. Oh, that's nice. I love that. That's nice.

45:26.300 --> 45:33.740
Yeah. So that's sort of like that. It's not just nice. It's the way the way the room comes together.

45:33.900 --> 45:40.460
Yeah. Lots of other things. It's a whiteboard and a prop for mess and hell that I took when

45:40.460 --> 45:51.980
I was there. So there is some sort of keepsakes around the room. Yeah. All right, plugs. What

45:51.980 --> 45:55.660
do you guys work on? What do you want to point the people to social media? The floor is yours. Let's

45:55.660 --> 46:03.180
go Fallen Dane Amir. Okay. I just want to take a second. I want to plug this shirt that I bought.

46:03.180 --> 46:16.140
It's called Miaodi. Wow. It's cats with Western cats with guns. I'm not plugging guns.

46:18.780 --> 46:25.100
And then my TikTok. I've been posting a lot of if you want to bathroom recommendation in

46:25.100 --> 46:32.460
York. I got you covered. What's your TikTok? I'm on TikTok. Oh, I got a, I got a, I got a

46:32.460 --> 46:37.580
fall. Yeah. It's just my name. You know, boring. But I might change it up soon. Okay. Okay.

46:37.580 --> 46:45.020
Okay. Ballant, foul and bulls. Okay. But I did do a lot of it's called the NYC. Am I allowed to

46:45.020 --> 46:53.740
curse on this? Please. NYC, shit list. Uh, it's an identity IP list. And that's me. And I also do a lot of

46:53.740 --> 47:01.900
meme cosplay. And I killed her. You're very more ashamed. And you're very more. Yeah.

47:02.460 --> 47:08.860
So if you want a little mix of crazy content, I got you covered. You got some viral hits in here.

47:08.860 --> 47:17.980
You got some 100,000 plusers. Oh, yeah. That's not easy. Thank you so much. I'm honored to see here.

47:18.460 --> 47:26.780
Yeah. Good work. Good job at you. Thank you. How, yeah. Howding myself on the back.

47:27.340 --> 47:32.620
Jeff, you started posting to TikTok like about a year ago. And then you sort of gave up. Was it?

47:33.260 --> 47:38.460
You didn't want to see the, you didn't want to try because you were afraid to fail. Well,

47:38.460 --> 47:44.940
it got to be funny. But fail. Yeah. Go bank. Yes. Yeah.

47:45.900 --> 47:51.580
But instead of using that to power me through on the day to day of it all, I use that as a way to just not even try.

47:52.300 --> 47:59.260
Yeah. I don't think my brain works in terms of TikToks. I'm not good at characters.

48:03.180 --> 48:07.980
I don't think in terms of what's hot off the presses. I think in terms of what's evergreen for

48:07.980 --> 48:15.420
all ages, genders, creeds, religions. And I just, what this show has become is sort of a

48:16.220 --> 48:23.980
topical evergreen show for the ages slash family, friendly. It's an arena to listen to,

48:23.980 --> 48:32.060
orally. I'm sort of an oral master joy. Yeah. That is your new Instagram profile bio, isn't it?

48:32.860 --> 48:36.060
That's all my answer to why I haven't posted a TikTok in like a year.

48:37.020 --> 48:39.660
Because you're the oral master of the way.

48:45.100 --> 48:50.380
Dane, what do you got? You know, I'm going to plug our friendship, Jeff. Because if you

48:50.380 --> 48:57.900
like, it's a floor of the, you know, that and the YouTube comment section and plug the

48:58.620 --> 49:07.420
section of the show. I see you had gum, staff sees you. Keep it coming. Hell yeah, I'm here.

49:08.460 --> 49:14.060
I just want to say that a lot of people talk shit about Jeff for like hosting this show in a stupid way.

49:16.860 --> 49:22.940
Thank you for, um, what's your service? I know it was just sort of giving a voice to those

49:22.940 --> 49:33.020
voiceless. Because they don't necessarily have a lot of Instagram Twitter followers and so I'm

49:33.020 --> 49:41.740
just, yeah, we might. We see you, we hear you and we will always fight for you.

49:42.780 --> 49:48.860
How you've done the opposite of fight for that. You've given me more time, money, and cloud.

49:49.020 --> 49:53.740
Oh, and we're going to look into that in the coming year.

49:56.140 --> 50:01.500
Not close, not soon. That's sort of, I'm, I'm doing a rough draft with my new year's

50:01.500 --> 50:08.780
resolutions, and that's top three right now. This is sort of sourcing with your flame.

50:10.460 --> 50:14.860
With the pilot at light out, so the cold, the head just seeps through the kidney.

50:14.940 --> 50:21.980
Oh, I, at Jeffrey James on Instagram, at Jeff Boyardy on Twitter, and we'll see you guys again next Friday

50:23.340 --> 50:29.900
until then. Whoa, that's Dawds folks. How are you even saying? What's that?

50:33.420 --> 50:35.900
Consistency is key. We'll see you guys again next week.

50:36.060 --> 50:46.060
Hello.

50:46.060 --> 51:06.300
That was a hit-dum original.

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
music

00:07.000 --> 00:15.000
music

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
music

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
music

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
music

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
music

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
music

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
music

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
music

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
music

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
music

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Binorual audio. By what? Binorual audio.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
awful to hear you say that word. Binorual?

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
Yeah. That's the first time you set it normally.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
I think two years.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
That's the first time you set it normally in two years.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
That's really good.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
No, it's not my buddy. No, it's our body.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Really?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Is this the same audio?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
No, they just started doing ASMR.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Next issue.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Yeah.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
This is, it's 919.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
We're squeezing this in.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
I'm usually not awake before 1030.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
When did you go to bed last night?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Midnight.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Oh, that's not bad.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
I see. That's good for you.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I did well.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Casey, what time did you go to bed last night?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
One?

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
That's not as, yeah.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
One is also early for me.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
One would be early for me.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Let's take a quick moment to your quick break.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
You sort of actually properly remember the queen.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
More and more does not let you rest in peace.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Like me.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
I watched.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
It was long.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
We're in the QD.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
I don't know.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
I remember how was blind.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
But now I see.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
You never.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
You, um, nobody joined in.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
I mean, I'd have public performances of Amazing Grace.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
It was Obama.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Yeah.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
I remember Obama did that.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
And I really sort of stood up as immediately as you started singing.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
And he had this, like, look on his face where he was like, I know that this is cool.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Cool.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Yeah.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
And I get to finally flex this.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Yeah.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
I feel like just past that he's singing for.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
I think it was a shooting.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
It was quite tragic.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Yeah.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
And then he was kind of like a man.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Zing.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I think he was not a shooting.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
It was kind of a cool, fun moment.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
You're interested.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
You're interested.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Bad today.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Underrated.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Everyone else kind of dressed to the nine.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
You can't see Casey right now.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
But he's maybe the best dressed in the room.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Thank you.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
He's got the pearly hat on.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
No.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
It's definitely Kayla Casey.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Maybe.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Maybe.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Yeah.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
But if I wore that exactly, everyone would be like, I'm the worst

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
rest person.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
I'm the worst rest person.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I always did pants.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I always did pants.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Nike socks with what are those Doc Martin's slide on boots?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
No, those are for sure.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
One stones.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Swing.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Silver.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
I.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
It's the socks ruined by outfit.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
If I have.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
It's the shoes for me.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Me.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Mine or no.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Your shoes are really bad.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
The motion is normal.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
I'm a 14 and a half.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Nice.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
The socks are also not great.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I could have much bigger your foot is than mine.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
That's normal to have it that way.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
These are just normal at the issues that we're all the time.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
This is a big style of new ish.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
They're not great.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
The socks actually were a podcast sponsor as was the shirt from the same place.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
The shoes are a decade old.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
The jacket.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Yes.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
These are the colorways.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Dad.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
It's bad.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
It's not dad.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Dad would be better.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Yeah, like Reebok would be cool.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
It's just bad.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Reebok is cool now.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
It's been cool.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Yeah.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I feel like if a mirror is wearing the blendstones.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Here would be a cool.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah, that's what she's right now.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Yeah.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Well, no, because then my outfits on a crimpy bed.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I don't think I might work.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Anyways.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I guess at the socks.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Like the socks or the deta shoes sort of a faux pas.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
But I feel like your pant color.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
God.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
That's crazy.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
That's crazy.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Like.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Um.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I'm just glad we're talking about fashion because all we can

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Are just just dragging me about.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Yeah.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I'm already like a capsule wardrobe.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I mean, what?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
We were at drink class night.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
And he was sitting at the end of the bar on his phone.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Just scrolling through images of capsule wardrobe.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
But it's capsule wardrobe.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
It's like when you have like 20 pieces within the same like three colors.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
And it's the maximum amount of outfits possible.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Like you could choose anything and let it all go together.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
So there's no thought to it.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Marty scares the shit out of me.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
For bad.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
But he also was searching for guns.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
It's a long line.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
I feel like your wardrobe is kind of a capsule wardrobe.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Where jeans are shorts and then a solid tea.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Yeah.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Yeah.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
That's basically accident.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Yeah.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
But yeah.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
The opposite of how Kayla.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Yes.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
She was a little stressed.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
I want to be noticed.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
But it matches.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
And bad I need to be noticed.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
I need external validation because I have nothing inside.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
What do you think this show is?

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Extremely romantic.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Exactly.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Thank you for all the YouTube comments.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
I read them.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
What?

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
It's nice that the New York contingent flew in.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Yeah.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Do this in person.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Well, no.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
You guys flew in for the headgum happy hour.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Yeah.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Which again is tonight.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
Hopefully we made a good show.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
I don't know what else to say.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
I'm here and I are still currently confused.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
This is the show's in less than 10 hours.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Whether we're doing material or just I'm seeing.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Here I'm seeing.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
And then maybe some product work.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Time up top.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
We have the run of show.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
And you've seen the run of show.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
But are we individually performing between comics or we are all three of us in between.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
All three of us.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
You'll be sitting on stools at the side of the stage.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
But if we're just going on stage to introduce the next comic, it seems to be where

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
that it's three people sitting down and then introducing.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
It seemed like one at a time introducing the comics and then all three of us at the top.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
And at the bottom.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
You can do it that way if you want to.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
And then we don't talk today.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
I don't know.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Can you do it like Waldorf and Statler in the Muppets?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Yeah.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Let's sit on the side.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Yeah.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
In the distance at the in a balcony somewhere.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Yeah.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
But very close to them.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
You're heckling them.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Right.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
You're you're just tearing in Carmel apart.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Yeah.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
I mean, we'll figure it out on the day.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
You can definitely heckle.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
I'll be tall.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
That's true.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
I'm sure she'll love that.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
I have a shark tank.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
We don't want to do it tonight.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Yeah.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
I think we need to stand up for you to say.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
It could be either.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
It's like very loose.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
We'll tear it.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Absolutely not.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
We can work out now.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
No.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
I don't want to.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Okay.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Bottom.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
That's a promise.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Solstice with.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
A terminal equinox.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Yeah.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Was.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Oh, wait.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Went.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Today.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
No.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
You didn't know.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
The solstice was on Wednesday.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Full moon.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
I think on.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Right.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
No.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
That was.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
Full moon was like two weeks ago.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I have a really good photo of it.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Which I'm not going to find on my phone.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
I was going to take too long.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
But it was like.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
I was leaving work.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
A little probably a little too late.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Actually, maybe those.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
The sun.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
I'll circle back.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
You.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
It was a full sun.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
It was.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
It was.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
It was like.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
But it wasn't because you know like.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
Man hat and then like it was that it was on the other side.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
So it was the moon for sure.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Long eye on bed.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
It's always fun.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
to do.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Well, me to take a picture of it.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
I was the moon.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Is that orange?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Alright.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Yes.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Yes.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
You can see.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Because it's the hardest moon.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
That's why it's a little bit orange.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Yeah.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
It's always underwhelming to take a picture of the moon.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
But this one actually turned out pretty good.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.040
People stopped that to take photos this was a third street a lot a problem

09:16.760 --> 09:23.120
Perhaps 21st 22nd okay, yeah next time respond fast to what

09:24.840 --> 09:29.120
To me saying like oh 23rd street because otherwise I ended so quickly

09:29.520 --> 09:33.320
Especially for me overlapping dialogue makes the episode faster

09:33.320 --> 09:35.320
All right, let's go

09:37.320 --> 09:42.680
I used to be able to help cut everything on the show. You want to know why we're dropping listeners

09:42.680 --> 09:45.000
It's because I can't edit fast

09:45.800 --> 09:47.800
What's wrong with me?

09:47.800 --> 09:51.160
I was trying to convince like you're a stasis

09:52.440 --> 09:57.880
We're not growing and if we're not growing then honestly, we're not showing up for the network

09:57.880 --> 10:07.080
I'm working my freaking tail off outside of the network. We're trying to get famous so that the numbers show that

10:10.200 --> 10:12.200
We all can make more cash

10:16.200 --> 10:18.200
And it's fucking easy

10:20.440 --> 10:22.440
Get famous

10:22.440 --> 10:24.440
I don't care

10:24.920 --> 10:30.960
It doesn't ultimately matter because we're all on a rock. Yeah, that is

10:33.240 --> 10:35.240
No, he means we're all on cocaine

10:37.240 --> 10:40.360
I'm on I started doing mind bloom. What's that?

10:40.360 --> 10:45.160
Ketamine depression therapy. How's it going? I don't know who I am. So

10:45.720 --> 10:48.920
No, that's where I started from oh I see

10:49.800 --> 10:51.800
Thank you

10:57.800 --> 11:00.840
Oh my god stop is a mess

11:00.840 --> 11:02.840
Oh my dust comes full of gifts

11:04.920 --> 11:11.000
Because I like I've heard there's no gift beyond your laptop. I message so when I want to send a gift react

11:11.880 --> 11:17.080
Right there on the desk. Yeah, I'm you got a folder for that. Sure. I guess like the

11:17.400 --> 11:23.640
It's millennial. It's over. It's over. No, I think they're evergreen because I mean they should be

11:23.640 --> 11:27.080
But they're not they've been they've been called like millennial

11:27.560 --> 11:32.440
Yeah, Gen Z. Well every time I pass both so yeah, every time we post

11:34.440 --> 11:38.280
TikTok everyone comments. Oh, this is millennial humor

11:39.000 --> 11:41.240
This is a direct we've I said some humor

11:42.840 --> 11:44.840
Sorry

11:44.920 --> 11:46.920
Because of you

11:48.920 --> 11:50.920
Year

11:50.920 --> 11:55.720
If it was different here where then they could say was that I'm technically Gen Z. I think I think I think the

11:55.720 --> 12:00.920
Cusp is 95. Yeah, that makes for there's like a window that I'm in but

12:02.440 --> 12:07.160
I'm gonna apologize for finding what I find joyful. Yeah, it's a millennial

12:08.040 --> 12:10.040
Oh, okay, it's a millennial. Yeah

12:10.200 --> 12:12.200
Okay

12:12.200 --> 12:17.720
Everything I am is in between right I'm between two races. I'm called a liminal state

12:18.440 --> 12:20.440
Oh my life is liminal

12:21.080 --> 12:23.080
Honestly my options are limited

12:24.040 --> 12:26.280
I'm a flexible work schedule, but it doesn't matter

12:26.840 --> 12:28.840
Right because you're busy and sad

12:29.560 --> 12:35.880
Even the busy plans. I'm always half-assing every single stream of income. Yeah, every friendship I have

12:36.280 --> 12:40.840
Oh, you're spread too thin. Yes, and you're becoming thin too

12:41.400 --> 12:48.920
Freel. Yeah, you're wasting your way. Yes, in my waist is wasting away right and I love point as any of that stuff like

12:49.960 --> 12:55.240
Upon death. It's not great if you're trying to show ass at 10k

12:57.240 --> 13:01.240
Well, you already check the photo. Yeah, well till death do we sharp because I

13:05.880 --> 13:07.880
Do release your bells when you die. Okay

13:09.080 --> 13:12.360
Here we go. Margot Robbie mortified reported

13:14.680 --> 13:16.920
Set photos from the Barbie movie were released

13:17.960 --> 13:22.440
What why she looks great. Yeah, she's more fight about that. She was yeah

13:23.640 --> 13:25.640
According to the internet

13:26.680 --> 13:29.880
There should be more to fight about yeah, I mean maybe she was like

13:30.680 --> 13:33.080
I assume she's probably produced around the movie

13:33.720 --> 13:37.320
Maybe she was like this is a one-on-one ad for our strategy

13:37.320 --> 13:41.880
Yeah, you want my strategy highly stylized first images, and then it's actually he's

13:42.440 --> 13:46.440
You're going to rob me drinking a lot. Hey. Oh, I was so cool. It wasn't that for sure

13:46.440 --> 13:48.440
It's like I'm friendly. Oh, yeah

13:48.680 --> 13:52.360
I'll fit the current right I'm not saying yeah, so that makes sense

13:52.360 --> 13:56.120
Yeah, they were just like a prize. I'm not like tucking up. Can you for the beach?

13:58.120 --> 14:00.120

Oh, I thought she was bright-wing colored

14:05.320 --> 14:09.400
Meaning she was wearing a bright-wing pistachio dial chronograph

14:10.040 --> 14:12.040
What were you just saying? I

14:12.280 --> 14:14.280
I think I just had a stroke or maybe you

14:16.920 --> 14:19.880
Most of the last time you guys had a medical emergency KC do you want to start us off?

14:37.080 --> 14:39.800
Router did you sort of like fuck it into place?

14:41.800 --> 14:43.800
I fucked it into place

14:45.480 --> 14:47.480
You nailed it

14:47.480 --> 14:51.880
Not one I my medical emergency was that day

14:52.760 --> 14:56.120
It was a previous episode of the podcast so I was bedridden from

14:56.760 --> 15:00.360
Pain oh my back. That's my most recent ever without

15:07.400 --> 15:09.400
Every time

15:10.120 --> 15:15.960
Kayla I was in a pretty scary car accident a year ago. How do you go ER? Come here

15:20.200 --> 15:24.200

15:39.880 --> 15:46.440
T-bone head-on collision driving to this read the driver passenger I was a driver a car cut us off

15:47.320 --> 15:51.400
Lost control the car it hit the cement medium and spun out across four lanes of traffic

15:51.640 --> 15:56.120
We're thankfully nobody he does wow in my car was told them wow

15:56.760 --> 16:01.880
Redraving yeah, and then you went to the ER just like make sure everything was okay. Or like you were

16:02.440 --> 16:06.760
I had like burns on my face and shoulder from the airbag and the seatbelt airbag

16:07.720 --> 16:13.960
Holy smokes so scary. What degree burns? I don't know like you know like

16:14.920 --> 16:17.960
Just but it didn't scar no, okay

16:18.280 --> 16:23.160
Did the airbag helper was it just like an annoying hindrance at that time? I think it was pretty helpful

16:24.200 --> 16:26.200
The car did it's jab and we were all safe

16:27.240 --> 16:29.880
You've been in a car the airbag's one off? No

16:31.000 --> 16:37.320
Apparently when I was little I was in a car that did a full 360 turn on landed on the wheels

16:37.640 --> 16:39.640
Well, that's just awesome

16:40.520 --> 16:45.800
When you were what I was little I'm almost driving a van that you don't remember that at all no

16:46.040 --> 16:53.320
Like the car spun over the other car. Oh, we did a 360 turn in there and landed oh my god

16:54.280 --> 16:56.280
And we should say that your mom's car was a cat

17:01.240 --> 17:04.120
That cat bus that's the thing right? Yeah, that's the cat bus

17:05.640 --> 17:07.240
It's like cat

17:07.240 --> 17:11.240
Yeah, I learned in the world but you guys are still alive. Thank you, I'm here

17:12.200 --> 17:17.720
Um, I don't know about an emergency, but when I drive recently my hamstring is tight

17:18.760 --> 17:20.760
And that ain't right

17:21.080 --> 17:23.080
It's about right for your age

17:24.200 --> 17:26.200
Probably this

17:35.320 --> 17:37.320
Major dealer

17:38.280 --> 17:40.280
Oh

17:42.280 --> 17:44.280
Call me third good

17:44.280 --> 17:46.280
That's the major killer

17:46.920 --> 17:50.040
I I feel like it's it's high time for a new nickname for me

17:50.680 --> 17:53.160
Okay, I'm leaning towards third good

17:53.720 --> 17:57.160
I gave you in Slack. What was it? Dr. Cess

17:58.040 --> 18:04.040
That's pretty good. It's pretty good, but it makes me sound like yeah, you're like you like just a weird name

18:04.680 --> 18:06.680
I see okay

18:06.680 --> 18:10.040
Rodney Desmond Desmond so good

18:12.200 --> 18:14.200
Maxwell could be good

18:14.920 --> 18:16.920
Maxwell billiards

18:18.520 --> 18:20.520
I am often in people's cups

18:22.200 --> 18:24.200
Not the best part of waking up

18:28.200 --> 18:33.680
Coffee stain on your socks or those like it's a dirt it's a dirt stains for my

18:34.520 --> 18:37.640
I didn't know dirt could stain oh like you can't wash it out

18:37.640 --> 18:41.960
Didn't know dirt could stay it's like a dust so I thought that that would come out

18:42.680 --> 18:47.560
But nay and these socks are pretty expensive, so do you have like an oxy clean?

18:48.360 --> 18:51.320
I I don't that probably would have taken care of it

18:51.880 --> 18:53.720
Put it in the dryer though. It's done

18:54.760 --> 18:58.120
Cooks it in seven. Yeah, for sure baked into the cake

18:59.720 --> 19:02.680
We do have to take a quick break. Nice. Nice rhyme

19:03.560 --> 19:05.560
Oh, yeah

19:10.840 --> 19:13.080
Now a word from our sponsor better help

19:13.960 --> 19:18.680
Guys, do you ever get stuck focusing on problems instead of solutions?

19:19.240 --> 19:24.040
I mean how might that situation go better with a different mindset, right?

19:24.040 --> 19:29.720
It can be tough to train your brain to stay in problem-solving mode when faced with a challenge in life

19:29.800 --> 19:36.040
But when you learn how to find your own solutions, there's no better feeling and a therapist can help you become a better problem-solver

19:36.040 --> 19:39.880
Making it easier to accomplish your goals no matter how big or small

19:55.800 --> 20:04.520
Self-actualized version of myself where I know why something bothers me why I'm stressed why I'm in problem-solving mode or not

20:06.280 --> 20:12.120
I highly recommend it everyone with the resources should be in therapy to get to know your self better and

20:55.320 --> 20:57.320
I

21:01.480 --> 21:03.480
Live in the same neighborhood it's harder up

21:12.200 --> 21:14.200
People would hurt me

21:21.480 --> 21:24.360
And I was moving like the next week so thank God

21:24.440 --> 21:30.440
But I do think someone would have done something I've wronged too many people this is veal or no veal

21:31.720 --> 21:34.040
I'm gonna show you guys a photo of a calf

21:35.000 --> 21:43.000
And you tell me whether or not it's veal all right the cutoff for veal is 20 weeks

21:44.440 --> 21:46.440
So

21:46.840 --> 21:51.160
Basically you have to guess whether this calf is veal worthy or not

21:52.280 --> 21:54.280
Is that my time yeah

21:54.360 --> 21:56.360
Okay

21:58.360 --> 22:03.000
Veal or no veal the god. This is depressing. It's pretty good. No veal

22:03.000 --> 22:08.840
The animals like this. So cute. No veal. No veal. I'm gonna say veal

22:11.320 --> 22:13.320
How can you tell

22:13.320 --> 22:18.120
Look at those so flies. They were basically eating puppies. I don't want to play this game

22:19.080 --> 22:21.080
That was veal

22:21.560 --> 22:25.880
Would you guys eat veal to restaurant or would you be like this is too fast? I just I've never had beef

22:26.440 --> 22:28.440
In my life you have beef

22:28.440 --> 22:32.360
But I have beef. I've never eaten beef. What who's your biggest beef with?

22:33.240 --> 22:35.240
You probably

22:35.240 --> 22:37.240
No, it's not you

22:38.840 --> 22:40.840
No

22:41.960 --> 22:45.800
The meat industry maybe like the mayor of New York City

22:46.760 --> 22:51.640
Yeah, I thought it was anyone that went to go see Lee and Michelle's opening performance with plenty of girl

22:52.280 --> 22:54.280
I thought you were soft on that

22:55.160 --> 22:58.120
Meaning I thought you were like been oh we know that's my friend AJ

22:59.960 --> 23:04.040
Somebody completely separate. Yeah. Okay. What does that mean? Well

23:04.840 --> 23:10.760
Oh, it was his take was just that like William Michelle sucks, but she's talented. Yeah, that's so talented also

23:10.920 --> 23:12.920
Uh

23:14.520 --> 23:22.680
Veal or no veal guys come on, but how can you like what are you telling which one was recently killed this one? No, it's not there's two first

23:22.680 --> 23:27.880
So also first we're talking about the brown one. Okay. No veal. No veal

23:30.440 --> 23:36.600
It's not whether they died or not. It's whether they're past the cut off the bear on a week or not more

23:36.840 --> 23:43.240
I see that one looks a little older so I'll say no veal. Yeah, no veal. Correct! How old is that one? How can you tell?

23:43.800 --> 23:50.520
It's it's like five months or something or sorry six months. No. That's very sad. Uh veal or no veal

23:52.680 --> 24:00.840
No veal. It is veal, so we shouldn't eat it. No veal. Really. Yeah, and I'm joeveal

24:00.920 --> 24:09.640
So that toddler cow yields just regular beef is what you're saying. It's tough because it's like

24:10.280 --> 24:17.240
It's gonna what's that between? Yeah, it's like it's it's not gonna be that succulents

24:18.360 --> 24:25.000
But it's gonna be you know some pretty good beef. I think you should have been a ranch Jeff

24:25.960 --> 24:34.360
And move their forever. Yeah, I feel like the vibe that you give off currently just in terms of how you're dressing is like

24:35.480 --> 24:43.960
Open a ranch start a commune type of a thing. Like the Manson thing. Yeah, it's spawn ranch available

24:45.640 --> 24:48.680
I'm wearing like an ox for sure. I don't know what's

24:49.000 --> 24:55.480
Coltty about me today. Maybe it's the socks that are dirty. Why are you looking at her like I'm asking you that?

24:57.480 --> 25:02.040
Yeah, I mean, I think the fact of a socks are dirty, but the boots are like

25:02.440 --> 25:07.800
Pristine as I will just drop them. Also your pants are covered in blood. Really?

25:09.480 --> 25:13.400
You're singing amazing grace. Yeah. Yeah, well, I'm a friend at a musician.

25:13.640 --> 25:22.440
Hmm, that's the beach boys. Yeah, a veal? Oh, I'm sorry. No, I don't know. We should all not eat veal going forward

25:22.440 --> 25:24.440
That's a nice positive outcome of this

25:25.880 --> 25:33.800
Disgusting segment. That's veal though. I'm not killing veal. All right. I'm just doing a segment of is it veal or not?

25:33.800 --> 25:40.040
I'm not taking a stance. What's that? It's got like a little beard. Well, he also has a tag. So it's kind of a

25:41.000 --> 25:46.840
Just waiting for you to show a human calf and ask us if it's veal. Did I have a meal?

25:48.520 --> 25:55.160
My nephew meal is 18 weeks. We still have time. Come on. Wait, is this veal or not? No veal, please.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.160
That's gonna be.

25:58.760 --> 25:59.560
There's our veal.

26:02.440 --> 26:09.080
Veal or no veal? Jesus man. What? This is depressing. I don't think cute animals and cages

26:09.560 --> 26:13.800
bred to be fed. I don't exactly understand what's cute about beef.

26:15.240 --> 26:22.040
It's the animals. Oh, the animals are cute. Yeah, but you know like the meat of them. No veal. Yeah, so looks old

26:25.160 --> 26:27.160
That's veal

26:27.640 --> 26:32.600
Veal or no veal. Yeah, it's so cute. Yeah, that's all bowl and his neck

26:33.480 --> 26:38.840
No veal. That's no veal. That's a pear. That's for sure. That's not veal.

26:39.720 --> 26:49.800
It's older than 20 weeks. Yeah, stop showing this. It's just growing in a person's yard. It does make me stop and think

26:50.920 --> 26:58.120
Should I be eating veal four to five times a week? Oh my god, that's a lot. What? It's too much. Yeah

26:59.400 --> 27:01.400
People eat fish every year

27:02.920 --> 27:06.920
He's got a point. We should be here. Oh, stop. Veal or no veal?

27:07.400 --> 27:09.800
Honestly on the verge of teal. What's that?

27:11.400 --> 27:16.840
I'm the verge of teal. I'm wondering if I should paint my closet or

27:18.360 --> 27:20.360
On the verge of teal

27:22.760 --> 27:24.760
That's a deal for sure

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Not

27:27.000 --> 27:33.000
What are you guys doing? Veal or no veal? No veal. Really? It's a jovial

27:33.480 --> 27:35.480
This is jovial

27:40.280 --> 27:42.280
Not veal

27:44.520 --> 27:46.920
I'm making no veal. He's don't kill my

27:47.560 --> 27:53.800
Different game come on. Stop it. Let's come up with one. It's not this. What's that now? Can we just play a different game?

27:54.360 --> 27:56.360
We

27:56.360 --> 28:02.920
Not like that. The X factor. We have all of your ex-girlfriend. That's really good. I don't know.

28:02.920 --> 28:09.480
Or we could just go full name by full name and just name the most positive thing about them. Okay, but just keep

28:09.480 --> 28:15.480
Scanning through. What is what are my ex's ex factors? Yeah, great. But we have to constitute. Okay,

28:15.480 --> 28:22.040
This is a killer original. We have to constitute what what's an X? Is that you dated gamefully? Is that you

28:22.680 --> 28:30.120
Just had some kind of romantic encounter is that you consider to be an X? Exactly. Why is everybody angry at me?

28:32.120 --> 28:34.120
I'm looking at baby cats

28:36.600 --> 28:38.120
Wait, which those are these?

28:39.400 --> 28:47.240
Move on man. Yeah, you do have very baby cats. They're not very shapely. It's as fangles. It is the fangles.

28:48.040 --> 28:50.040
That was veal or no veal. Sorry guys

28:52.120 --> 29:02.360
It's the people. I guess we should all. Yeah, good mess. That how those ice?

29:03.800 --> 29:06.600
Glass. I'm wearing headphones. I'm wearing headphones.

29:08.840 --> 29:13.400
Case, would you eat me? I do eat me. I've never had wheel though. You've never had. Okay.

29:13.400 --> 29:18.280
For real. The oral reasons are just never been in the situation. Never been in the situation,

29:18.280 --> 29:25.240
but there's no appeal to eating a veal to me. It's such a weird thing. It's like,

29:25.240 --> 29:30.040
do you want the cuter type of animal to eat? No, I'll just have the right thing to do.

29:30.040 --> 29:32.280
Land depressing. Yeah, I'm a sweet.

29:36.760 --> 29:43.640
You say lamb is children. It's a place I'm at the movie. I thought lamb is just the gender of a sheep or something.

29:43.640 --> 29:49.000
Oh, it's a baby sheep. Really? I didn't know lamb was baby sheep. I thought it was the sheep. Right.

29:57.720 --> 30:10.120
No, it's just sheep. It's kind of like bleeding. How do you feel? How do you feel?

30:11.080 --> 30:15.000
That's how I got one of my ex-girlfriends. I was just like, how do you feel?

30:16.200 --> 30:19.560
First aid in the confidence was what got her staggered. Wow.

30:22.520 --> 30:26.840
All right. You know what? Let's move in the next segment. Let's move in together.

30:28.680 --> 30:32.680
Speaking of commutes. Here we're going. Farm.

30:40.920 --> 30:52.920
Welcome to found footage discussions. Sorry. Found table footage discussions.

30:53.480 --> 30:57.960
Found table footage or found footage table discussions. That's probably better.

30:58.520 --> 31:05.320
The footage is about tables or the discussion is. Neither. It's a round table about found footage. Got it. I see.

31:05.480 --> 31:15.000
Um, Danny Salish just walked in. So these are a couple clips. Taking from a PBS documentary

31:15.000 --> 31:22.680
focused on understanding the late 1960s. The cultural aquarium explosion that was the summer at

31:22.680 --> 31:30.120
love. And I wondered if we could talk about it. Sure. Let's play the clip. All right.

31:35.480 --> 31:45.800
I'm afraid to thought and concerned that the young of any previous generation has come in awareness. But children are real

31:45.800 --> 31:53.160
people within individual personalities. What's in our mind? Children are built different. I can

31:53.160 --> 32:01.560
look at it. Children are real people. Yeah. Children use to smoke back then, right? That's the question.

32:01.560 --> 32:09.400
Our children real people. And if not what age are they real people and don't say, I don't know.

32:10.200 --> 32:16.840
And no, I know. They are real people. Really? But they are dumb until like what age 19 or something.

32:16.840 --> 32:22.040
Like you can tell it by 11 year old anything. They'd be like, okay, I believe you because like that's all he knows.

32:22.600 --> 32:26.760
And that would maybe be an argument for eating meal because the calves haven't gotten to an age

32:26.760 --> 32:33.080
where they're real cows. Count your point. Maybe a mere Justin. Interesting. But I have 11.

32:33.080 --> 32:39.640
But like, I mean, I have a I have a niece who's, you know, 14. I could probably lie to her and get away with it.

32:39.640 --> 32:43.480
She doesn't necessarily know whether or not I'm lying or not.

32:44.760 --> 32:55.640
For. Sorry. That was the bullshit. Yeah. I agree. 14 is like your equivalent to your 19. I would say

32:55.640 --> 33:03.640
for a girl. What about Santa Claus? That lie goes much later in life than I would have thought.

33:03.640 --> 33:08.040
Like you can tell your kids that a magical man is delivering gifts until they're 12.

33:08.040 --> 33:12.120
And they're like, yeah, I mean. Well, he's not magical. He's just a hypercapitalist. I mean, he has

33:12.120 --> 33:18.920
explored in the labor of elves. And that's how he gets it all done. The reindeer thing. That's a lie.

33:18.920 --> 33:21.240
But he could definitely make it happen. Believe in a little magic.

33:22.200 --> 33:29.160
Because it shows that you're not a fully formed critically thinking adult smarty yet.

33:29.160 --> 33:35.960
Maybe you're thinking beyond conventional norms and embracing the unknown. Yeah. But no,

33:35.960 --> 33:43.720
it's because your parents lied to you. Don't let them think of it. I was also thinking about

33:44.680 --> 33:53.240
We have to cut this for ads, but also short. Do you believe in tragedy in my life?

33:55.800 --> 33:59.160
All right. So children are real people. Let's go to Venezuela.

34:00.760 --> 34:04.680
We found out in the 50s that if you've got up in the morning and went to work and did a good

34:04.680 --> 34:11.640
days work, the things got better. Well, you got promoted or you got more money. You were able to buy

34:11.720 --> 34:16.920
furniture. You could have more children. The children could have better clothes and life just improved.

34:18.040 --> 34:24.920
We knew it was because you went to work. But I'm not sure our children realized that. They saw

34:24.920 --> 34:30.280
simply that the clothes got better. The house got bigger. The neighborhood got nicer. And I have

34:30.280 --> 34:37.320
a strong suspicion that what happened in the late 60s was that the kids who rebelled took it for

34:37.320 --> 34:46.680
granted that life would improve automatically. So the question then is does life just improve automatically?

34:46.680 --> 34:54.280
Or is it the product of hard work dedication and absentee parenting? That was the opposite life.

34:54.280 --> 35:02.680
It's worse. Yeah. I mean, I work pretty hard. I just got recognized in this industry. Where?

35:02.680 --> 35:09.160
Or add something. Add exchange rate. Rising star for you. Oh, yes, congratulations.

35:09.160 --> 35:15.320
And I'm still very depressed. But imagine how much sadder you'd be if you didn't get that. No.

35:17.320 --> 35:23.320
I don't know if I can't get much sadder. Sure. I'd be wearing a different color dress. It would be

35:23.320 --> 35:28.520
like a black or a dark blue Macau about that. I have a lot of those wait for October.

35:28.920 --> 35:38.920
But, but does depression negate life being good? Well, it's a existential conversation.

35:38.920 --> 35:48.120
I think yes. Really? For like internally, yes. But holistically. holistically. I mean to outside

35:48.120 --> 35:56.280
like some an outside view or probably not. No, no, no, no. No more experience. Like does the question

35:56.280 --> 36:01.080
is just life improved automatically and we're saying it gets worse. Yes. And then we're saying that

36:01.080 --> 36:06.760
you can be working really hard and still be depressed. Yes. So I guess just life doesn't get better.

36:06.760 --> 36:13.160
No. I say I get more depressed the harder I work. I like this thing. Sure. So it's almost like

36:13.160 --> 36:18.680
you're less hard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. To be joyer. You'll be joyer. Yeah. To not have

36:18.680 --> 36:22.680
be, what did you say to be able to buy furniture? And the clothes get better. You said that

36:23.640 --> 36:30.280
it's also weird. I feel like this time period, because they're trying to have the 60s, right? Like

36:30.280 --> 36:37.640
isn't that, but they're time at like in the 60s. Their kids were a bell to whatever, but like

36:37.640 --> 36:42.920
they were a bellion. It was like protesting. Yeah. Like working for something you still. Like

36:42.920 --> 36:48.360
yeah. It's still mattered. Yeah. I'm nostalgic for this decade. I wasn't even alive. But it's like

36:48.360 --> 36:55.080
all that seems great. Like kids are just woodstocks. Imagine a mirror it would start me listening

36:55.080 --> 37:01.240
to Ben Folt on an iPod. What do you think woodstock was? Yeah. That's right. You think that right?

37:03.400 --> 37:08.360
Imagine if the riots at Woodstock 99 had happened during a Ben Folt's five shit set.

37:08.360 --> 37:19.080
Oh, cool. That'd be. Dream be joy. Towers of boys. All right. Now here's a major seat of the 60s.

37:19.640 --> 37:24.840
Because of their profoundly different life experiences, kids had trouble understanding why their

37:24.840 --> 37:31.640
fathers worked so hard. The way many of them saw it, their fathers were engaging in the

37:31.640 --> 37:39.480
single-minded pursuit of material comforts. My dad was always above board in all his business

37:39.480 --> 37:46.360
dealings, but I would say money and getting ahead and making a lot of bucks was his goal.

37:47.960 --> 38:00.440
Does money equal happiness? No. But also, yes. I think yes to a point. You're like this study or

38:00.440 --> 38:05.800
it's like once you make a certain amount of money just like so that you don't have to like stress out

38:05.800 --> 38:11.000
about like shelter and food. Yeah. And then like after that, it doesn't necessarily. And do you know

38:11.000 --> 38:17.640
that number? It's close to a million but not quit. And money does help solve a lot of the

38:17.640 --> 38:24.040
maslow's hierarchy of needs. I think money's oxygen. It's not happiness because when you have it,

38:24.040 --> 38:27.640
you don't think about it and when you don't have it, it's all you can think about. Wow, that's

38:27.640 --> 38:34.200
incredibly profound. Yeah. So. Is that an original thing? No. This fucking guy tearing North

38:34.200 --> 38:42.040
room. I'm not damn it. Even girls who were sent to college often majored in what were called

38:42.040 --> 38:56.360
the domestic sciences. I invented jelly. I want to say a loose jail. There's no way they're going

38:56.360 --> 39:00.920
to use all of that in one sitting. Yeah. Or is that how much bread they made? I think good.

39:00.920 --> 39:06.840
Um, are the, sorry. I was really off top. I was just going to say remember the squirrel jam.

39:07.800 --> 39:14.200
Yes. Yeah. I still go to squirrel. Really? Yeah. I have no idea what you're talking about. Oh,

39:14.200 --> 39:21.320
boy. It was like this hole is an LA restaurant. Very popular. Very popular made there on jam like

39:21.400 --> 39:27.640
to sell online and that sort of thing. And they found out in the kitchen so that there was like a

39:27.640 --> 39:33.320
huge health correlation. There was like people were like scraping mold off the top of these

39:33.320 --> 39:39.560
vats of jam and still using the jam underneath and like, it was wild. What does he have to do with

39:39.560 --> 39:46.040
crazy story? I don't know. It's like the name of the restaurant. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Um,

39:46.040 --> 39:53.080
should people of all genders learn the domestic science? Yeah. Yeah. I feel like it's no longer

39:53.800 --> 39:59.480
domestic science. It's just common sense that people should have common science. In high school,

39:59.480 --> 40:04.600
I won the family and consumer science award. Meaning? Because I just took a lot of child

40:04.600 --> 40:10.680
development and culinary and sewing classes for my, for my extra curriculars in the past 60s. That was

40:10.680 --> 40:15.800
like more recent than that. They were still doing college. I grew up in the 60s. Got it.

40:17.000 --> 40:23.880
But I think I think every high school I should have taken like taxes and pancakes. Oh, yeah.

40:23.880 --> 40:30.280
I wish someone taught me about taxes. Yeah. Laundry and Roth IRA. Mm-hmm. If you have to take a

40:30.360 --> 40:40.680
class on Laundry, it's too late. I want to say die, but I have really strong feelings about

40:40.680 --> 40:44.120
people that can't do their own. Did you do Laundry growing up or only once you were in college?

40:44.680 --> 40:52.200
Uh, I think it's a growing up, but like, even in, I don't know, we had a Laundry line for a while.

40:52.200 --> 40:56.520
So we didn't even have a dryer. Oh, wow. It's like kind of stuff that flows on there. Did you all

40:56.520 --> 41:03.720
grow up with like a sign chores to do every week? Yeah. I did. But it's changed every week. But it's also like

41:03.720 --> 41:14.440
a rotate. Look at the machine and a read. Like, should I be hard to do? Okay. I remember learning

41:14.440 --> 41:21.560
in college with spake. Polky items. You guys still separate whites and colors? Yeah. I stopped

41:21.560 --> 41:31.240
doing that. It's fine. Well, I ideal. I didn't when I had to spend money on Laundry because

41:31.240 --> 41:38.760
that's like, like, in terms of going to a laundry man doing it myself, like, I have since the pandemic

41:38.760 --> 41:47.560
just been sending it out to the locals. Yeah. Washing full? Yeah. That was awesome. Yeah. I was awesome

41:47.560 --> 41:52.120
in New York. You just dropped your shit off in a bag and you get it back in a sack. And it's already.

41:52.120 --> 41:58.200
It's like a perfect week. Yeah. I can't go back. Like, I wish that I had laundry in my house. I'd

41:58.200 --> 42:03.000
wash things all the time. I'd be living my best life. But now I wait like three weeks until all my

42:03.000 --> 42:08.360
clothes are gone and just send it with a man. Any brings it back. Did they have that no way?

42:10.120 --> 42:17.480
They do. But it seems incredibly expensive. Like, I have to go to a Laundry mat. And

42:17.720 --> 42:24.680
they offer a wash and hold service. And it's like 40 bucks to do it. Or seven dollars if I do it myself.

42:24.680 --> 42:29.320
Yeah. It's, I mean, yeah, six expensive, which is why I wait. Yeah, but in New York. Very

42:29.320 --> 42:35.160
last night. It was like 20. For a little bit, I guess. That's why I'm asking. Yeah. That's why I don't have

42:35.160 --> 42:42.200
so. I was living in a suitcase. Yes. So it's not bad for you. But having a car like that, I would still

42:42.200 --> 42:48.440
go laundry mat when I, if I had a car and could drive. You know, it's the folding that's really

42:48.440 --> 42:53.080
nice. They like folded in a way that's holding it. Yeah, for sure. I don't even know what they're

42:53.080 --> 42:58.120
doing. Like, how does it end so thin and uniform? I don't know, man. It's crazy. Well, this is why

42:58.120 --> 43:05.000
everybody should be educated in the domestic sciences. Here we go. There was a song when I went to

43:05.000 --> 43:10.200
college. It's Smith College, which they don't sing before I know that had a difference. What's

43:10.200 --> 43:16.200
like this? It's a sharp as a pinpoint. Your grades are really 10 point. You are deansless

43:16.200 --> 43:22.920
sapphire Smith. But when a man wants a kiss kid, he doesn't want a kiss kid. Oh, you can't get

43:22.920 --> 43:29.960
a man with your brains with your brains. With your brains. Oh, you can't get a man with your brains.

43:29.960 --> 43:39.240
And it had verses that went on and on. First of all, the song is garbage. Good brain.

43:41.080 --> 43:46.200
Oh, you can't get a brain with your man. That way. I'm going to bring it in there, man.

43:46.200 --> 43:53.080
Yeah, she can't get a brain. The question is thus. Yes. Shoot a mirror cover this. I had

43:53.080 --> 44:01.880
good map here already. No way. No. Like sing the song. Yeah. No context. He doesn't have the background.

44:02.680 --> 44:06.920
You don't have the chords. He doesn't have the gall. I don't know the glasses. Although I do kind of

44:07.000 --> 44:11.320
resemble that lady. I can see it. Yeah. That's your view into Smith.

44:14.120 --> 44:18.600
I had towards Smith. I don't remember if I applied to Smith. No, I didn't apply.

44:18.600 --> 44:23.880
If I applied to see a song and you were like, I was like, it's kind of going off. Yeah, yeah.

44:23.880 --> 44:30.280
Yeah. Five Carlton's version. Classic. And a big fan of their dean of social work school. She's

44:30.280 --> 44:38.280
been my dean. Well, you and you, she okay. My dean. My dean. My dean. My dean. My dean. My dean.

44:40.440 --> 44:46.680
What was the question? The question was, should you cover this song and check the map here? Oh, yeah.

44:46.680 --> 44:55.080
I don't think so. Okay. The font sticks while I carry it. Plugs. When you guys have

44:55.080 --> 45:03.240
going on, we got to get out of here. A little rail has a record. Yeah. I will plug my Twitter at

45:03.240 --> 45:10.840
Jepweready. 149 away from 10,000. Wow. You're so close to showing the whole thing. You don't have

45:10.840 --> 45:16.680
to do that. It's a logistical thing at this point, because I don't want to have to do an only

45:16.680 --> 45:21.400
fan situation. I'm going to have to set up a fucking tax corporate. Like, I already have, sorry,

45:21.400 --> 45:26.520
a loan out corporation. I can't tie that with adult imagery. I don't know what the legality

45:26.520 --> 45:36.040
is there. Review review turns into also an only fan for you. Well, I love that. I want to

45:36.040 --> 45:41.000
do an episode of this show called Jeff on porn. Like, girls on porn. Yeah. You should just go on

45:41.000 --> 45:47.320
girls on porn. I would love that. Nobody's like an aspect. Yeah. I'll feel like that. It was

45:47.320 --> 45:55.960
very possible for you. Well, what would the theme be? I think you can choose probably. Yeah. Yeah.

45:55.960 --> 46:03.960
I mean, you, you reveal the one of your fetishes on the show. Did I? Yeah. What did I say?

46:03.960 --> 46:11.960
It wasn't. I need to say it with a straight kiss. Oh my god. It was a

46:12.920 --> 46:23.160
win in porn. Someone moves underwear to the side. I do remember that. No, that wasn't in porn.

46:23.160 --> 46:28.680
That was in life. That was in white. That was in white.

46:31.240 --> 46:38.040

47:01.240 --> 47:11.240

Oh, but he is taking a photo of me because it's him. Right. I don't like this. There we go.

48:05.320 --> 48:11.640

48:25.720 --> 48:34.360
That was a hit dumb original.

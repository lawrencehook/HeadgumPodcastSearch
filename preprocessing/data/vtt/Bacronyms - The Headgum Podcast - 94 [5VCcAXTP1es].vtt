00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.880
Guys, everyone's talking about fake spring and how difficult it is to dress around

00:10.880 --> 00:12.840
this time, but that's because it is.

00:12.840 --> 00:16.760
It can be so difficult to find the right outfit in the spring when every day is different

00:16.760 --> 00:19.000
and the weather can change at the drop of a hat.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.660
Well, luckily, Fairty makes it way easier, because they make the perfect clothes for all

00:24.660 --> 00:26.660

00:31.060 --> 00:32.060

00:32.060 --> 00:36.260
Guys, I gotta be honest, I'm very excited about this sponsorship.

00:36.260 --> 00:41.540
I've been wearing Fairty clothes for years, it's unbelievably high-quality.

00:41.540 --> 00:46.380
I have this reversible, long-sleeved shirt from them, that's like Heather Gray on one

00:46.380 --> 00:51.420
side and then striped Navy on the other, and it's like, it truly is functional and some

00:51.420 --> 00:56.380
of the most comfortable clothing I've ever had, and also they've lasted the test of time.

00:56.380 --> 01:02.700
I've had them for several years and they are, you know, like new, if not a little softer.

01:02.700 --> 01:06.780
And it's that kind of effortless style that you want every time you go dig in in your closet.

01:06.780 --> 01:12.380
That's set, that shirt, that dress, that feels like you've had them again for years.

01:12.380 --> 01:16.300
Maybe it's in a gorgeous print and it looks like it might be vintage, but it fits so well

01:16.300 --> 01:19.700
that it feels like it was made just yesterday, just for you.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.820
Well, that's Fairty.

01:21.900 --> 01:26.940

Two whole servings of a day. You're not supposed to have more than 40 grams, and this is almost

02:33.660 --> 02:38.420
80. In your mind is, you're talking about a root bear for the

02:38.420 --> 02:46.140
world show listeners. Saspirilla, really. Maria Cabralanli and I are drinking, I would say,

02:46.140 --> 02:55.820
sparring, roaring, roaring root bear. Yeah, I'm a bark squirrel. This can is 44 grams.

02:55.820 --> 03:03.020
What's wrong with a W? That's like a big coddle. Yeah. And I think this is like slightly

03:03.100 --> 03:08.300
more than half of that bottle. That's fair. But I have 12 ounces. I'm sorry to interrupt

03:08.300 --> 03:13.500
Johnny, but I had a hanks, and that's like a Philadelphia craft soda, and that was 34 grams.

03:13.500 --> 03:21.580
So like still too much, but fine, ultimately. Yeah. Alley pop. Alley pop is good. Not a fan of the root

03:21.580 --> 03:29.500
bear one. What would you like? This draw bear even? A little one. That one's great. I want to say a

03:29.580 --> 03:37.740
love grape. Oh, I've yet to try. Great. Nice. Nice. That's good. On the show today, obviously,

03:37.740 --> 03:41.580
we have Johnny Villa on the sacks. Marie Cabralanli and the facts in Kalimori are already bringing up

03:41.580 --> 03:46.860
the rear. Potentially in all star line up depending on how it goes. Right? So it might go well,

03:46.860 --> 03:50.460
it might not. It's not going to be at my hand, because I have a really great show for this plan.

03:51.980 --> 03:55.900
Let's check in emotionally and physically and spiritually with everybody. Let's start

03:55.900 --> 04:01.340
emotionally, we'll go down the line. Just a sentence or two. Let's, you know, let's not be

04:01.340 --> 04:06.540
eager to it. In the order, Kalimori could Johnny, let's go emotionally, how are you feeling?

04:07.340 --> 04:12.940
I'm emotionally, I'm excited to be here. My second show last week, the episode was called Worst

04:12.940 --> 04:16.700
episode ever two. So I feel like we can only go up.

04:16.780 --> 04:28.940
Merika. I am excited because I've done really well in Wortell this week,

04:28.940 --> 04:34.940
started out the week with a one. Insane. Incredible. Then a three and then two, two,

04:34.940 --> 04:41.660
isn't a row. It's just an honor to be here to witness it. Yeah, thank you. I wish that you'd gotten

04:41.660 --> 04:50.060
two on February 22nd. I, oh, okay. I wish I had gotten a two after my one rather than one,

04:50.060 --> 04:54.060
three, two, two. That's fair. Johnny, it's, sorry, emotionally.

04:56.220 --> 05:03.260
Emotionally, in a weird place, it's steadily declining. You know, I was just on vacation. Right,

05:03.260 --> 05:08.380
and you know how, yeah, right after you come out of vacation, you kind of see the face of God and

05:08.380 --> 05:14.460
every man, woman, and child. But then you come back to reality and all of a sudden, like,

05:14.460 --> 05:17.820
you're become a little bit sour. You have to go to work. You have to deal with the,

05:18.780 --> 05:25.260
the perils of being in a city. You said you were great. He said you went to like a movie

05:26.140 --> 05:31.420
on vacation. Yeah, I saw the Batman. I couldn't help myself. I saw the Batman that I went to

05:31.420 --> 05:36.700
David Buster's. And that was a high point, honestly. But how does that, that's not avoiding

05:36.860 --> 05:39.500
life's normal perils? That's just doing things you could have done in New York.

05:40.460 --> 05:45.180
Exactly. But I just didn't have to think about being in New York. Now that, that's the issue,

05:45.180 --> 05:52.540
I think. Can I ask, oh, your favorite, David Buster's game is? What's your go to? You may not.

05:52.540 --> 05:56.140
I'm sorry. I don't know if you're asking me or Johnny, but you may not. What's an asking you?

05:56.140 --> 05:58.860
Johnny, what's your favorite? Johnny, what's your favorite? Yeah, you have a favorite.

05:59.500 --> 06:07.980
You just, expand. All right. I guess I played the, the Crossy Road. They have a giant arcade machine

06:07.980 --> 06:13.020
version of Crossy Road. A lot of iPhone games I've noticed. Yeah. But I think the, the one that takes

06:13.020 --> 06:20.460
the cake is the Mario Kart arcade machine. Really? Yeah. If I had, if I had the money and I will have the

06:21.100 --> 06:29.580
money, I will have, I'll get a put for Mario Kart machines in my house. Wow. Pretty good.

06:29.580 --> 06:34.940
Too many. Can I? You should do three to that one person's always excluded or that there's this

06:34.940 --> 06:40.540
empty weird chair next to you in a date. That just feels like it's so much more effort just to be mean

06:40.540 --> 06:49.820
to somebody. Mean, it's culture. Hi. Can I tell an embarrassing, David Buster's story?

06:49.900 --> 06:54.460
Please, yeah, everyone have you may not. I don't know if you're asking me. I'm going to do it anyway.

06:55.580 --> 07:01.740
There's one game at David Buster's and it's a kung fu panda game. And essentially,

07:03.580 --> 07:08.300
you're like presented with a bunch of drums, basically, that are like large buttons that you

07:08.300 --> 07:16.300
push and familiar with this. And I, the first time, I think it was the first time I went to a

07:16.300 --> 07:24.300
David Buster's in Chicago when I was in college. I played that game. And like, the goal is to just

07:24.300 --> 07:29.660
hit the buttons as quickly as possible for some reason I decided to hit it with my fist, like punch

07:29.660 --> 07:36.700
them. And I played the game so many times that my knuckles started bleeding. Oh my god.

07:37.980 --> 07:43.820
Because I needed to get the top score. Because when you hit the jackpot, it's a thousand

07:43.820 --> 07:51.260
tickets, which is great. But I did, uh, I think I hit it once then. And then we went to David Buster's

07:52.220 --> 07:59.260
as a company in New York. It was like me, Marty, Amir, Jake, Micah, and Micah. And I made

07:59.260 --> 08:05.740
all everyone hit a button at like, like, we were all just in charge of one. And then we hit the jackpot.

08:06.380 --> 08:12.380
So that was an amazing moment for me. It's a fun game. Also, the jump rope game. I,

08:13.020 --> 08:18.300
I think we walked into the thing. All you do is like jump over a light. And I immediately got the

08:18.300 --> 08:23.420
jackpot. And that was like the first time I've ever done it. And I was like, that's crazy. It's

08:23.420 --> 08:29.660
only downhill from here. Yeah. We should take this time to say a happy birthday to Beth.

08:31.980 --> 08:37.260
Who? Happy birthday. Beth, I don't know her last name, but somebody, somebody tweeted at me and said,

08:37.980 --> 08:42.060
that this is her favorite podcast. And it's her 30th birthday this week. So happy birthday Beth.

08:43.340 --> 08:49.500
I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy right, belated birthday. Yeah, sure. But wow, you know,

08:49.500 --> 08:53.900
it's like, the fact is we did it. The fact is we're recording it before her birthday. And it's

08:53.900 --> 08:57.100
going to come out after. So bookending it is kind of getting it on the day. In a way.

08:58.860 --> 09:04.220
Yeah. Happy belated birthday, Beth. Did you guys ever play the Matrix game at like a David Buster's

09:04.220 --> 09:11.340
or like an arcade game? I haven't been to David Buster's in like 20 years. So sorry. What was the

09:11.340 --> 09:17.260
Matrix game? You've never heard of it. It doesn't sound familiar. Yeah, it doesn't. Oh my god.

09:18.540 --> 09:25.100
Well, you must not know about Reeves. You must not know about Reeves. He was born and

09:25.100 --> 09:31.980
Bayeroon. Did you know that? Matter of fact, he was raised in Toronto with the six. You must not know

09:31.980 --> 09:39.260
about Reeves. You must not know about Reeves. Talking key on Reeves. He's an actor. But don't you ever

09:39.260 --> 09:53.020
for a second get to thinking he's in the new Batman. He's not. That's all right. I was so prepared for that.

09:55.180 --> 10:02.860
Oh my god. That's a normal. It reminded me of that song from always be my maybe.

10:03.500 --> 10:09.500
That's believe my punched key on Reeves. But 10 times worse for sure. Right. That was good.

10:09.500 --> 10:15.580
Sorry about that. My favorite arcade game was actually at the ESPN zone. And it was you lies.

10:18.860 --> 10:24.460
You lies supine. And it's like a racing game where like your feeling gravity

10:25.260 --> 10:31.100
Oh, wait. Never mind. So it's is it a game? Do you play it? Or is it just like, you know,

10:31.100 --> 10:36.860
it's like a raccoaster things? No, you're like, okay, you're driving. Don't.

10:41.740 --> 10:48.460
Full steam ahead. We did experience some audio issues. You know what I think it is? I think that

10:48.460 --> 10:56.220
my dongle from my USB microphones cord to my laptop is not working super well. But it is super dry.

10:56.940 --> 10:59.020
Because it's going to be unicolostile.

11:01.260 --> 11:06.700
There was such a stretch and it didn't make sense up here. And honestly, so to the genes have

11:07.500 --> 11:16.220
stretch. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Yeah, it's ultimately fine. Yeah, you even felt it. Yeah, that sucked.

11:19.420 --> 11:24.060
Here's what we'll do. We still haven't gotten to physical. So Caleb,

11:24.060 --> 11:27.820
Mertica, Johnny, let's do one word for this one physically. How are you feeling?

11:29.820 --> 11:35.740
Soar. Can I have one word? You may not. Okay. Mertica.

11:38.380 --> 11:43.340
Unwell. Really. Johnny.

11:44.300 --> 11:53.100
A ill. Jesus. But like there is a wrong way to go to school. It's cool. Yeah, but also I am a little just

11:53.100 --> 11:56.940
a little because it's one word. Only. Yeah. Oh, sorry. No, it's all right.

11:57.660 --> 11:59.660
I don't know what I'm going to do. And then we'll do spiritually.

12:00.220 --> 12:00.620
Gala.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.460
Whole. Wow. Wow.

12:06.940 --> 12:09.260
Soar and full and whole.

12:11.180 --> 12:17.740
Mertica. Fulfilled. Okay. Nice. Johnny. I think we can go with ill again.

12:18.300 --> 12:24.620
This one's good or bad. Which one is spiritually ill? That's really hard to hear. Yeah.

12:27.020 --> 12:33.740
All right. Let's move on to our first wax thing. And obviously we're, um, we're no stranger to this segment.

12:34.620 --> 12:42.380
Bond of the fucking week this week. I'm choosing Ryan Couglar. Oh, it's time for him to get out of the

12:42.380 --> 12:50.380
director's chair and into bucking wardrobe for like a better term, specifically Sun spell Polos.

12:50.380 --> 12:59.420
James Bond style double a seven. Yeah. Right behind it. Bye. That's the first time

12:59.420 --> 13:05.100
anyone's ever fully agreed. You think Couglar being a good man. James. Because it could also be James Couglar.

13:05.100 --> 13:08.620
If they weren't a bit like redo the name of the right side. They couldn't get the right.

13:11.820 --> 13:20.780
Yeah. It's fine, man. You can even bring up like the newest items around him. Yeah. Yeah. It's relevant.

13:20.780 --> 13:25.660
But well, I don't want to talk about it. It's sad. But it sounds like they gave him money.

13:29.740 --> 13:33.820
Doesn't make it right. But I've just, I want him to get that bag. Mm-hmm.

13:34.940 --> 13:44.620
Get the bag. It's James Bond. Uh, my bond of a week. Oscar Isaac. Yeah. Yeah. That's good.

13:44.620 --> 13:55.020
Although his Monet is a little, I can't tell the difference. Oh. Yeah. So it sounds like really

13:55.020 --> 14:02.220
perfecting the Oscar Isaac. Uh, English accent. Yeah. It's my favorite thing to do. Johnny.

14:03.580 --> 14:07.900
I'm going to have to go with Daniel Kalua. I don't know if you guys have seen him in the news lately.

14:07.900 --> 14:13.580
But he, uh, he fired everybody from his team. And now he's working with a spiritual advisor named

14:13.580 --> 14:21.740
Air Holiness. What? Really? Yeah. Uh, a spokesperson from CAA was like, yeah, we don't represent him anymore.

14:22.540 --> 14:28.220
And I kind of like that. He's not being represented by, uh, an agency. He's being represented

14:28.220 --> 14:33.100
by a higher spiritual being than us. And I kind of respect that. And I'd want that, you know, my next

14:33.100 --> 14:38.540
bond. Thank you. I feel like Bond is an atheist for sure, though, right? Yeah. At least I know that.

14:39.980 --> 14:46.220
Yeah. Bond is definitely, uh, I think he's like a Christian guy, but like he doesn't go to church.

14:46.300 --> 14:51.420
He's not one, he maybe goes on like Easter or Christmas. It's like a laugh Catholic.

14:52.300 --> 14:56.780
Yeah. Yeah. Dude, this is crazy. And you're not going to fucking believe me, but literally

14:56.780 --> 15:04.460
fucking 007 was in my midnight mass on Christmas. Yeah. You'll never believe it. Um, he was in the

15:04.460 --> 15:10.140
manger that night. And he was, it was in Paris, too. So he was also

15:10.780 --> 15:14.700
manger a manger in Paris. Yeah. He was eating. Yeah. He was eating.

15:19.180 --> 15:24.860
Sorry. We're going to have to cut that out for some. So can we get that again? Um, hang on.

15:27.820 --> 15:33.980
Also, it was in Paris. So he was a manger. Oh, a manger in Paris. Yeah. Not a well-a-guiding.

15:34.460 --> 15:39.260
And then pretty good. That was your line. Okay. All right. Bond of the week, um, gender-bending bond.

15:39.260 --> 15:42.540
I'm going to go with Patricia Arquette's character harmony in severance.

15:43.500 --> 15:49.900
So not Patricia Arquette. It's going to be specifically this. This character harmony. But ultimately,

15:49.900 --> 15:55.340
it'll still be the character James Bond. It's just that she's she's making choices that her

15:55.340 --> 16:00.060
character in severance would make as an actor playing James Bond. Patricia knows she's actually

16:00.140 --> 16:06.060
harmony playing James Bond. That's, um, that's huge. Yeah.

16:11.980 --> 16:16.780
Um, I, when I worked at Carple Carriolki, we did one episode. We only did four episodes

16:16.780 --> 16:20.300
when I was there. And only two of them came out. And one of them was with Patricia and David Arquette.

16:20.300 --> 16:25.100
And they were the only people who came on the show and actually wanted to do everything that we pitched to them.

16:25.180 --> 16:31.900
And I, so I love Patricia Arquette. She's correct. Um, all right. Let's move on. Um,

16:39.020 --> 16:40.460
I need to change. Oh, here we go.

16:51.340 --> 16:54.300
I don't know why. Welcome to Villa's guarantees.

16:55.500 --> 17:01.820
You've heard of Marika's brothers from the same creators come Villa's guarantees. Two minutes on

17:01.820 --> 17:06.780
the board and we're going to need, um, Johnny, we're going to need you to, like, basically what is

17:06.780 --> 17:08.780
the Villa guarantee. You know what I mean?

17:11.020 --> 17:18.220
The Villa guarantee, uh, at least in this episode is uh, it's, it's not going to be the worst episode

17:18.300 --> 17:27.260
ever to, uh, or three rather. I guarantee you that. Uh, we have Kayla. We have Marika on here. We have

17:27.260 --> 17:32.940
Jeffrey who's probably bringing it down, but quite honestly, I think I think we're doing a pretty

17:32.940 --> 17:40.140
bang-up job, which is a good thing. I think that's what the phrase means. Uh, is there anything that I

17:40.140 --> 17:46.060
want to talk about? And Colorado, uh, I met a girl scout, uh, and I was speaking to her father.

17:47.020 --> 17:52.300
Uh, I was buying Girl Scout cookies. Uh, we started talking about milk and cookies, uh, which is the

17:52.300 --> 18:01.020
age-old, uh, dessert for children and teens alike. And during that exchange, uh, the girl chimed

18:01.020 --> 18:06.940
in the Girl Scout chimed in, she said, yep, a gallon of milk a day. And I looked to her father,

18:06.940 --> 18:12.300
and he's like, yep, she buys, uh, milk every single, she drinks a gallon of milk every day.

18:13.020 --> 18:17.900
And I was just absolutely befuddled. I thought I was on the right side of history by thinking

18:17.900 --> 18:23.980
that milk was a good thing. But after seeing that family, I realized now how wrong I was and how

18:23.980 --> 18:30.620
milk is, uh, guaranteed bad thing for you to have. Uh, we're still, there's still time on the

18:30.620 --> 18:38.860
spot. There's 48 seconds left. 40 seconds left on the clock. Um, I saw a dog race and Colorado.

18:38.940 --> 18:43.900
That was interesting. Garen, I guarantee you if you go to a Denver Nuggets game, you'll see a dog

18:43.900 --> 18:50.140
race in the middle of the show, which is the half-time show. And the half-time show generally occurs

18:50.140 --> 18:56.460
after the second quarter of the, of the, of the basketball game. And these things kind of happen,

18:56.460 --> 19:01.340
like everyone needs to break sometimes, right? That's why we go on vacation. Uh,

19:02.220 --> 19:08.380
and that's the Villa Garen T. How many more seconds left? 14. I have 14. Okay, one more guarantee.

19:08.380 --> 19:17.500
You have 11 seconds. Okay. I guarantee you that in 2023, I will let you down. And I'm sorry in advance.

19:18.300 --> 19:26.780
That's so far from now. All right. That's, it's over. Yeah. Why are you going to let people down in

19:26.780 --> 19:31.420
2023? Like a whole swan that people enough to broadcast it out now as a guarantee. I mean,

19:31.660 --> 19:38.380
Villa Garen T is over. I'm kind of a little beat from it. All right. I'm sorry to press, I guess.

19:39.580 --> 19:53.500
But I will let you down. Like, you have to let you down. Um, no, nice Beatles. Um, I've been

19:53.500 --> 19:58.060
pretty into French, or sorry, Caleb, we're going to say something. I just get a cell journey. He has

19:58.060 --> 20:03.260
not let me down yet. Oh, thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Yeah. I know we will only know

20:03.260 --> 20:08.860
each other about a month, but so far. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don't get your hopes up. It's what I'm saying.

20:10.780 --> 20:19.020
Weird. You're guaranteed. Um, I've been obsessed with French brassers recently.

20:19.900 --> 20:29.180
Mm-hmm. Yeah. And with that comes the certain ethos of, uh, and I was selling Marie-Chan and

20:29.180 --> 20:37.020
Johnny this last night because we were at a, a brassery. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Good food. Good wine and good

20:37.020 --> 20:45.900
conversation. And I can't really think of another type of food place where all three of those things

20:45.980 --> 20:54.540
are almost a real style of guaranteed. Mm-hmm. Isn't that really close to a restaurant's

20:55.580 --> 21:02.220
slogan, like good eats, good something, good conversation. Are you thinking of better ingredients,

21:02.220 --> 21:10.780
better pizza, pop a chance? Yeah. I don't think so. Okay. Um, because last night, the, I mean,

21:10.860 --> 21:15.260
correct me if I'm wrong, Johnny, but I think that the, the conversation flowed as free as wine.

21:16.460 --> 21:20.940
It didn't. You were texting us in the middle of the conversation, actually. Yeah. We should read

21:20.940 --> 21:25.420
those actually. Well, I would actually would be remiss if we read the actual texts and he's, yeah,

21:25.420 --> 21:31.180
he's pulling that out. Yeah, or I'm telling you, because well, um, so Jeff texted me and then

21:32.540 --> 21:39.340
motion at the table to check my texts very clearly. Oh, that obvious. It's saying that it's

21:40.300 --> 21:47.020
why is it that only when I speak do people look puzzled slash angered. He's about angered

21:47.020 --> 21:51.580
wrong and I'm corrected it. Mm-hmm. Well, it's because I had a couple of glasses of wine.

21:52.620 --> 21:59.020
Vance true. Really? Rainbow. Wow. Not a couple. You kind of just finished one and you were

21:59.020 --> 22:03.340
just starting your second glass. And it wasn't like a full glass either. It was kind of just like

22:03.340 --> 22:11.420
you were testing out the testing out. Quasu? Oh, so loud. I think that means what's that.

22:13.020 --> 22:18.460
Wait, what did you say? Quasu, which is just actually it's what that. So it would have to be

22:21.900 --> 22:23.420
actually I think it'd just be cascassé.

22:26.220 --> 22:29.020
Okay, cascassé. That's how are you doing, I think.

22:29.020 --> 22:34.460
Um, I just know what is that. I believe. Yeah.

22:36.220 --> 22:42.540
Anyways, yeah, in the middle of those actually nearing the end of our time at the restaurant

22:42.540 --> 22:48.540
and we're having a good time. It seemed like and then you texted me at 926 is my vibe really good.

22:49.340 --> 22:53.340
Just a weird thing to text somebody in general. You didn't even respond.

22:54.620 --> 22:58.780
Yeah, I did it. Yeah. I felt uncomfortable pulling out my phone in the middle of we were having

22:58.780 --> 23:05.260
a good time. Remember? Right. Yeah. Questionable. Yeah. Would you say that night had a,

23:06.940 --> 23:14.460
go for it. Okay. I was going to say Jeff. Oh, I was going to say Jeff. Did you think that that

23:14.460 --> 23:23.180
night had a certain journal say quah about it? That's really good. Oh, God. That's really

23:23.180 --> 23:28.060
fucking good. Yeah. And I'm really glad that it interrupted very much twice actually to have delivered

23:29.020 --> 23:37.180
that. That was easy. I just wanted to know what spurred this obsession of the week for you.

23:37.180 --> 23:46.620
Obviously, first soon. Right. Right. I just meant like, was there a reason that you went to

23:46.620 --> 23:51.260
Lucy and was it just because you heard it was good. And then you were like, this is the reason why

23:51.260 --> 23:56.540
want to go to a French pastor. Don't make that face to me. I got dinner with a friend

23:56.860 --> 24:00.460
because she wanted to see me before I left. I wanted to see her as well. On Monday, I said,

24:00.460 --> 24:04.140
what kind of food do you want? Pick a type of food and I'll find a place and make a reservation.

24:04.140 --> 24:09.580
She said French. So I was just looking up good French restaurants in New York City. And then I saw

24:09.580 --> 24:14.220
Lucy and and I had walked past Lucy and near that weekend last weekend. And I was like, oh, that's

24:14.220 --> 24:18.060
funny. Because one of my friends knew boyfriend's name is Lucy and I haven't met him and he's very

24:18.060 --> 24:21.500
mysterious. So I was going to send her a photo of him though the restaurant. So I was like, oh,

24:21.500 --> 24:24.860
maybe I'll check out what this place is about. It looks nice. It looks quaint, but it's the food

24:25.180 --> 24:31.420
good and a quick Google search resulted in a garage.vice.com oral history really. Okay,

24:31.420 --> 24:37.740
let. And so it was basically talking about how Lucy and was the last bastion of writers'

24:37.740 --> 24:45.020
salons in New York City, where basically, I mean, for lack of it or term, the wine flowed as free

24:45.020 --> 24:51.100
as conversation. Wow. Yeah. Thank you for all this background information. And they turned

24:51.180 --> 24:57.420
by doing last night. Sorry. I couldn't make it. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, that's and I wish you could have been there.

24:58.620 --> 25:06.380
Yeah. We ended up Johnny. We did the Mongers one. Basically. I don't know if you had any

25:06.380 --> 25:11.340
of the cheese. It was a soft cheese. You know what it was? Yeah, it's not a Mongers one by the way. It was

25:11.340 --> 25:19.580
just an order of cheese. Really. Fromage, it stayed in the menu. Yeah. It was, was it a triple crème?

25:20.540 --> 25:28.140
It was a good cheese, man. It was a good cheese, Marika. Yeah. It was, it said it on the menu and

25:28.140 --> 25:35.420
the room must not know about free. You must not know about free. I can have another cheese in a minute.

25:35.420 --> 25:42.380
Matter of fact, I'll have some cheese in a minute. More free. You must not know about free. You must not

25:42.540 --> 25:50.300
go about free. I'll have a variety cheese by tomorrow. But don't you ever for a second get to thinking,

25:51.020 --> 25:59.100
it's better than some free. Ha. This podcast is sponsored by Better Help Online Therapy.

morning and then I'll do my AG1 and then like an hour later I do my coffee. I'm off to the races,

27:44.540 --> 27:51.820
rat or otherwise, right? I used to be a big supplement guy. I used to do a million different pills and

27:51.820 --> 27:58.060
it was expensive and it was inconvenient. And instead I can get all the nutrition that I need

27:58.140 --> 28:03.100

about some France-related news that's really exciting for me? Yeah. Yeah. Today, the lineup for

30:02.060 --> 30:09.660
the 24 hours of limon came out, which I am going to go into. Yeah. And Michael Fassventor is

30:09.660 --> 30:17.820
indeed competing in his first ever 24 hours of limon this year. Yeah, that's crazy. Really excited

30:17.900 --> 30:25.740
to see him do probably terribly. Yeah. When is this? This is in June. Exciting. Yeah. That's

30:25.740 --> 30:31.900
awesome. Has he ever been bond as a week? He was one week, I think. I think it was somebody's

30:31.900 --> 30:41.580
bond pick. I think I might have been Billy Brook. We do have a big bond. Here we go. Something

30:41.580 --> 30:48.060
I've been wanting to get into recently is mysteries. Because one of my favorite literary

30:48.060 --> 30:57.820
characters is Sherlock. And I feel like I sort of have that, that eye for her. Your screen. What's

30:57.820 --> 31:05.180
that? I can see. You know, we see Garage Man, man. You can share specific windows. All right. Then

31:05.180 --> 31:10.220
I will. I don't know if this is a better not, but did you know that my last name is a very famous

31:10.220 --> 31:15.100
Sherlock Holmes character? Yeah. Moriarty. Yeah. That's why I've been a lot on you Moriarty to other

31:15.100 --> 31:22.140
people. Oh, good. Kayla, I have a photo because I was really into the Sherlock series. The BBC

31:22.140 --> 31:29.180
series. I have a photo of a grave stone that says Moriarty somewhere on my phone. Please send to me. Maybe

31:29.420 --> 31:40.220
I'm sorry. Are we ready? You're not. Go ahead. Sorry. No, don't be, you don't have to be

31:40.220 --> 31:48.140
sorry because he's we're having a good time. I feel like he's, let's find. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for

31:48.140 --> 31:52.940
you. Really. 54 inches of questions. You're opposed. How would they get from from this

31:52.940 --> 32:00.380
color? Are they straight or? I don't know if you're bending it. A wooden tool used to shoot arrows

32:00.380 --> 32:06.940
called a re-curved bow. You can see that it's got it's it's bent to create the curvature. It appears

32:06.940 --> 32:12.780
to be very old. It was completely submerged. Amazing condition. You could almost string it up and pull

32:12.780 --> 32:18.700
for our audio listeners. Mystery surrounds a 400-year-old or hunting bow. And preserve. It was made

32:18.700 --> 32:24.380
by a mastered craftsman from from my perspective. I'm sure Georgia, Lexi, and butchhobson

32:24.380 --> 32:29.740
are dinner in a Athabaskin. They've come to see the hunting bow. These are bows collected by

32:29.740 --> 32:34.780
the Russians. But it doesn't look like any other Athabaskin bows collected from the area. You

32:34.780 --> 32:39.740
can kind of see on that. The shoulder is really different. It appears to be a U-pick design. These are

32:39.740 --> 32:45.500
pretty distinctive. Deepening the mystery. What is a U-pick style bow doing in a lake in the middle of

32:45.820 --> 32:49.900
the day. I was just about to ask. I was causing more questions. Nobody was. We were both behind.

32:49.900 --> 32:56.300
So U-pick folks could have come down to the old village and done trading there. I wouldn't know how

32:56.300 --> 33:00.220
they shot it up there. In more populated parts of the world. Question, yeah, then becomes how

33:00.220 --> 33:05.020
did they traveling that far? Discover, of new artifacts. Alaska, we just we just don't have that

33:05.020 --> 33:09.420
kind of development. So it's very rare. It's very rare for us to come across material like this.

33:09.420 --> 33:14.140
There's tiny hole helped find one answer. We moved approximately two million

33:14.140 --> 33:20.220
part of that commentary was. Oh, that's good. We submitted to Kaelican at U-pick.

33:20.220 --> 33:25.180
But some answers only deep in the mystery. I wish they spoke and talked. I really didn't.

33:25.180 --> 33:31.100
Yeah, that's funny. I would be over a few centuries later. I really wish they could tell us how

33:31.100 --> 33:36.780
I got there and what it's doing. Adding 400 years of questions to the mystery,

33:36.780 --> 33:42.780
although like Clark Bow. All right, so just to recap, 400-year-old hunting bow found

33:42.860 --> 33:50.380
in Alaska. Potentially traced to the U-pick tribe of North America. And the question then becomes

33:52.060 --> 33:57.740
where did this originate? How was it preserved so well? Which I think that might have been answered

33:57.740 --> 34:06.700
and that it was preserved in ice. And John, are you crying? No, I'm just thinking, I'm actually

34:06.700 --> 34:11.260
kind of smiling a little bit because I was thinking, what if that boat could actually talk

34:11.260 --> 34:17.980
and host this podcast and the little of you? And Luke and actually, in the little of you,

34:17.980 --> 34:25.020
can you stop sharing your screen? Yeah, this isn't, I don't want to see this in it. Wow. All right.

34:27.340 --> 34:31.500
This is open discussion. We only have about five minutes for this. But if you guys have any thoughts,

34:31.500 --> 34:38.460
I wear five. Yeah, let's solve it in five minutes, basically. What's the mystery? The mystery

34:38.540 --> 34:43.100
being, how is it preserved so well? Where did originate? How did it get to Alaska? If it is.

34:46.940 --> 34:57.580
I think that it floated in some ice down a waterway. And that ended up there.

34:58.300 --> 35:04.460
Yeah, well, I'll never know for sure. It's a Washington to an atlaska mystery. Is that right?

35:05.020 --> 35:10.300
Sorry, let's just, if we can fully delve into Marie, because theory here, which I don't

35:10.300 --> 35:20.620
think is smart river flow Washington state. Okay, let me know. In Google. Now, I'm just saying it

35:20.620 --> 35:26.860
for the audio listeners, which I think is a down. Well, also, I don't, I don't know where the epic

35:26.860 --> 35:32.380
people. Yeah, that's also. We don't have to look this up. You said we only have five minutes

35:32.380 --> 35:40.060
right. And it was all going to be special speculation. What makes you think that we're qualified

35:41.420 --> 35:46.620
to solve this mess. How does anyone get qualified? They fucking try and they fail and they try and

35:46.620 --> 35:51.100
they fail to get better over time. Are they try and fail to get better? They try and fail to get better.

35:51.100 --> 35:56.380
Notification, take courses. You know what, this is poison. Fuck.

35:56.860 --> 36:01.260
Come on guys. Kelly's the only one who's giving me the fucking time of day right now.

36:04.060 --> 36:08.860
I mean. Oh, God. Where's that talking bow when we need them?

36:09.900 --> 36:16.380
I love to come to the background to talk bows. No, it's fun. Welcome to backgrounds. That's what we're doing.

36:16.380 --> 36:23.980
We can talk back. Backgrounds. Backgrounds. So I have written out a couple of acronyms. And we,

36:24.060 --> 36:29.660
it's our job during this segment to back our way into what they stand for. Let's start with lamb.

36:31.340 --> 36:34.380
Just throw out any suggestion. Yeah, L-A-M-B.

36:38.540 --> 36:41.100
Orange. Uh, what's up?

36:42.620 --> 36:50.060
Large ass military bunker. You know, with war going on. That's good. That's not, but it would save a lot of

36:50.060 --> 36:55.980
time, especially in military scenarios. I was going to say late ass, uh, actually, I didn't think that

36:55.980 --> 37:04.140
went through. Late ass, Maria, I wanted to say Shriver, but that doesn't start with a B. How could you

37:04.140 --> 37:11.180
not thought of this up? But that, how could you not thought about this through? One of the

37:11.180 --> 37:14.780
Marieka's biggest complaints with the me hosting these show is that I always come prepared with

37:14.780 --> 37:18.380
jokes that everybody has to just fucking sit through and everybody else has under prepared

37:18.460 --> 37:22.700
because they didn't get a heads up. So I didn't come up with ones for these. Lamb, what about this?

37:22.700 --> 37:29.020
Lame ass Marieka Brownlee. Yeah, I was going to say, oh my, oh, sir there. I was going to say look at

37:29.020 --> 37:35.900
male bosos. Oh, that's like Johnny and his roommate. Why would you bring my roommate into this?

37:35.900 --> 37:43.500
He's not even sort of a boson. It wasn't about you, Johnny. Yeah. P-K-L. Okay.

37:43.740 --> 37:56.220
Okay. Sorry, that's it. P-K-L. P-K-L. P-K-L. P-L like, uh, pharmacy. Wow. So the worst word, the worst word

37:56.300 --> 38:06.300
is, uh, hard to think of like, not name words, let's start with K. Okay. Let's put it

38:06.300 --> 38:17.660
around that other. What about, yeah, paid K-L off. So it's like K-L defines out one of Johnny's secrets

38:17.660 --> 38:22.620
and he kind of like gives a $2,000 under the table. That's good. I was going to say fill a

38:22.620 --> 38:28.060
Southical Kuala orientation. Oh, that's good. So it's like Kuala's a study. Sorry, one second,

38:28.060 --> 38:34.220
Maria. So it's like Kuala's a studying. Yeah. It's like their first day of philosophy school for

38:34.220 --> 38:40.380
Kuala's. That's really good. Thanks. What about R-R-R?

38:40.700 --> 38:52.220
R-R-R-R-R. What do you review? R-R-R-R-R-R. How about that? Try that one on precise, Jeffrey.

38:56.700 --> 39:09.260
Oh, is it? Wow. Reading railroad rocks. Really rough retention isn't like coming.

39:09.260 --> 39:13.020
If you've actually listened to this podcast all the way through. Yeah, that's good. That's good.

39:13.020 --> 39:18.540
Honestly, not good, but over a hundred percent. This is not a hard rock.

39:21.740 --> 39:27.020
Yeah, I mean, I was going to say rest relaxation and reactiveness. So it's like you rest,

39:27.020 --> 39:28.460
you relax, and then you're still angry.

39:33.740 --> 39:35.500
Moving on. S-B-N.

39:35.740 --> 39:48.380
I immediately thought of it as the abbreviation of supernatural, the TV show. So I'm going to take

39:48.380 --> 40:02.220
a second to think about what I've done. Yeah. What about R-R-R-R-R. It was a B, but I guess I'll still,

40:02.300 --> 40:11.500
why don't we still let it be? Let's still let it be. Spoon-poon in noon, but it's S-B-N. It's one of those weird ones.

40:13.180 --> 40:25.900
Okay. I didn't think you said P. R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R.

40:26.060 --> 40:27.020
Let's say I'll stand for it.

40:29.420 --> 40:33.820
Lee? Yeah, Robert E. Lee, Kennedy. Weird.

40:35.420 --> 40:39.660
Is it R-F-K? It is. This isn't a former president.

40:39.660 --> 40:42.300
Just someone else, a random person, got it.

40:42.300 --> 40:43.820
All right. What about A-B-D?

40:46.140 --> 40:51.420
Always B-Dying. Dabbing. Dilligent. Oh, okay.

40:52.380 --> 40:57.100
It's interesting you guys all kind of went with the A-B-C thing. They're like, um,

40:58.460 --> 41:00.060
Glenn Gary Gillen-Ross thing.

41:02.140 --> 41:05.020
What would you have gone with? A mere Blumenfeld's dead.

41:05.980 --> 41:11.020
That's terrible. I wouldn't. You have a soundboard. You don't have to make that sound.

41:13.260 --> 41:15.580
There's not a big enough of applause. Like this is like,

41:15.580 --> 41:16.780
it would be more people than that.

41:17.820 --> 41:20.700
Just what it? That's mean. Just saying.

41:21.260 --> 41:23.020
G-2-K.

41:24.940 --> 41:26.620
What? 2-K? 2-K?

41:26.620 --> 41:29.260
G. The number 2-K.

41:37.980 --> 41:39.980
Why are you, why do you keep using K's?

41:40.860 --> 41:44.220
I don't care with the K.

41:51.580 --> 41:53.660
What about Grammysie to K-La?

41:54.060 --> 41:57.740
So it would be like how long it takes to get from Grammysie Park to K-La's apartment.

41:58.140 --> 41:58.940
And what's that address?

41:59.980 --> 42:02.540
It is. Not gonna tell you.

42:03.100 --> 42:04.380
Yeah, good. Good.

42:04.380 --> 42:08.620
Only people that invite me to their good by dinner parties get my address.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.340
Okay. Oh, grrrr.

42:13.020 --> 42:17.900
Then we'll do run it back tonight at a different Brassery. Let's go sit all at 7.30.

42:18.460 --> 42:20.380
Done. But before that, what about Y2-R?

42:23.420 --> 42:24.540
Y2-R?

42:24.540 --> 42:24.860
Yeah.

42:28.460 --> 42:29.900
Y2 rank.

42:34.060 --> 42:38.140
Is that just the, yeah. That's just an, you're just saying that's an acronym.

42:38.220 --> 42:39.100
You're not saying that to me.

42:41.340 --> 42:46.780
I mean, she doesn't have to expound on it, but yeah, I think no one on top of you.

42:46.780 --> 42:48.620
We know the real, what it really means.

42:50.220 --> 42:53.820
If it is pointed, that sees on the mic.

42:53.820 --> 42:55.340
Y2 revolting.

43:08.220 --> 43:14.380
All right, we have one last segment to get to, here we go.

43:17.100 --> 43:20.620
To Bay, are the rides of March important?

43:27.980 --> 43:29.180
Up, go, up, aside.

43:29.900 --> 43:31.580
Yeah, come on. Great.

43:34.460 --> 43:37.660
Okay. I need an Ide of March refresher to be honest.

43:37.820 --> 43:39.180
Yeah, yeah, I'm looking at that.

43:39.180 --> 43:43.820
Refer to March 15th. The Basin is the Roman Islander equivalent of March 15th.

43:43.820 --> 43:46.540
It's also the day that Julius Caesar was assassinated.

43:46.540 --> 43:51.980
And so some people either celebrate it, maybe probably not anymore, unless they're crazy,

43:51.980 --> 43:54.940
but it was the three days of mourning starting on March 15th.

43:54.940 --> 43:58.300
But also it's just kind of this idea that, you know, around the Ide's of March,

43:58.300 --> 43:59.820
there's an energy shift in the year.

44:01.420 --> 44:02.140
I'm shift.

44:03.340 --> 44:04.140
Definitely.

44:04.220 --> 44:08.540
I think the Ide's of March, then, are probably important still.

44:08.540 --> 44:15.500
Okay. Yeah, because there's a lot of, I mean, there's like the play,

44:15.500 --> 44:20.460
Julius Caesar, like there's media, around that event, that is still relevant.

44:20.460 --> 44:21.660
So yeah.

44:21.660 --> 44:27.580
And from like a 10,000 foot level, like I love, you know, a betrayal, midseason arc.

44:27.580 --> 44:29.100
So yeah.

44:29.100 --> 44:29.980
That's fun.

44:29.980 --> 44:34.060
I guess the bigger question here is, do the Ide's ring true to this day?

44:34.540 --> 44:38.300
And I think we kind of touched on it that we do think it does.

44:38.300 --> 44:41.980
But is it really the Ide's or is it daylight savings times?

44:43.660 --> 44:44.940
I mean, that feels like a betrayal.

44:46.860 --> 44:51.180
That's, that's actually really interesting, you think about it.

44:51.180 --> 44:54.860
What's the one state that doesn't do daylight savings of that Arizona?

44:55.900 --> 44:56.460
I think so.

44:56.460 --> 44:58.460
It was, is it really?

44:58.460 --> 45:01.820
Why am I, I'm thinking of the West Wing scene,

45:01.900 --> 45:05.340
or they're yelling, and they're like in Indiana or something, right?

45:06.060 --> 45:06.860
Yeah.

45:07.340 --> 45:10.380
It's one of the Southwestern ones, because it's, I know that it would be,

45:11.020 --> 45:13.420
like sometimes it's specific times, sometimes it's mountain time.

45:13.420 --> 45:18.940
But is there a way that we can make the Ide's more modern or more fun, let's say?

45:21.340 --> 45:24.540
Maybe like, probably cyber bullying instead of stabbing?

45:25.980 --> 45:27.580
Yeah, that's good.

45:27.580 --> 45:29.340
So cyber bullying people who deserve it are like,

45:30.300 --> 45:33.260
I mean, I think anyone, okay.

45:34.060 --> 45:38.700
I don't know if I can endorse that on a podcast with such an important platform as this one,

45:38.700 --> 45:40.060
but, yeah, it's true.

45:40.060 --> 45:41.100
I take it back.

45:41.100 --> 45:43.820
I, I was thinking, because like one of my favorite parts of the week,

45:43.820 --> 45:46.780
and it's usually where betrayals happen as well, is drunch.

45:47.420 --> 45:49.900
You know, Saturday or Sunday drunch, which is just for those don't know,

45:49.900 --> 45:53.660
brunch is a combination of lunch and breakfast, and then drunch is adding alcohol into the mix.

45:54.700 --> 45:56.140
What if it was the Ide's of drunch?

45:57.100 --> 46:01.340
So instead of doing like a dry January, you do a really drunk march.

46:04.540 --> 46:07.980
That sounds like it could be fun for some people.

46:10.380 --> 46:13.260
I mean, George Clooney certainly thinks it deserves remembrance,

46:14.620 --> 46:16.220
because he has a two-kilimbrant.

46:16.220 --> 46:16.860
Huh?

46:17.580 --> 46:18.460
Remembrance?

46:18.460 --> 46:19.100
Yeah.

46:19.100 --> 46:20.460
Do you remember that on that?

46:20.460 --> 46:20.860
Sorry.

46:21.500 --> 46:22.700
Oh, I'm not your companion.

46:22.700 --> 46:23.900
Remembrance for a brand.

46:24.860 --> 46:26.860
That could be good for a background him.

46:27.980 --> 46:29.180
What about JRV?

46:33.260 --> 46:36.860
My initials, Jonathan, Raphael.

46:36.860 --> 46:37.740
All right, never mind.

46:37.740 --> 46:42.860
Then George Clooney produced the Iides of March with Ryan Gosling,

46:43.740 --> 46:45.420
and he also has a tequila brand.

46:45.420 --> 46:49.100
So I feel like if he is an interested in the idea,

46:49.100 --> 46:50.700
we could get him on board for the Iides of drunch.

46:53.980 --> 46:54.460
Probably.

46:56.060 --> 46:57.100
I'll tell you probably.

46:57.100 --> 46:58.860
Do you have his contact info?

46:58.860 --> 47:01.980
I mean, I can get his reps easy, easy money.

47:02.540 --> 47:04.540
The question is, how do you get in the room with him?

47:04.540 --> 47:05.980
Because you know, he probably has like a business team.

47:06.700 --> 47:07.100
Right.

47:09.340 --> 47:13.420
I think you're going to have to flesh out your pitch more before you get to that stage,

47:13.420 --> 47:17.980
because it's pretty not well thought out at the moment.

47:17.980 --> 47:18.460
Yeah.

47:18.460 --> 47:19.020
All right.

47:19.020 --> 47:20.700
And then maybe it really stands.

47:21.660 --> 47:24.140
Months is what you're doing.

47:24.140 --> 47:26.300
Well, not just the month that specifically,

47:26.300 --> 47:28.300
March and drunk drunk.

47:28.300 --> 47:29.340
Sorry, not a couple.

47:29.340 --> 47:32.460
For next year, I assume, because it's already March 10th.

47:32.460 --> 47:35.740
I was hoping we could try and get it going by the Iides,

47:35.740 --> 47:38.700
but yeah, I mean, I'd be open to the 2023.

47:38.700 --> 47:42.940
That also could be when Johnny betrays me.

47:42.940 --> 47:44.140
Oh my god, yeah.

47:45.580 --> 47:48.060
I do like the idea of a man betrayal.

47:51.500 --> 47:59.820
Because Johnny, you said that one of your guarantees was that you were going to betray

47:59.820 --> 48:00.780
others next year.

48:02.780 --> 48:04.140
Now Johnny's my Johnny.

48:04.140 --> 48:06.380
Ah, this is crazy.

48:06.380 --> 48:06.940
All right.

48:06.940 --> 48:07.500
You know what?

48:07.500 --> 48:08.620
We're out of time anyway.

48:08.620 --> 48:09.900
I can just say betray.

48:09.900 --> 48:12.220
I said, I'll let let you down.

48:13.180 --> 48:13.500
Great.

48:16.460 --> 48:19.420
The first sign that Johnny is going to get out of here faster.

48:19.420 --> 48:21.260
He just stopped his own thought and said, grrr.

48:24.300 --> 48:25.900
Plugs.

48:25.900 --> 48:27.340
Let's go Kayla, Johnny, Maria.

48:27.340 --> 48:28.380
What do you guys have going on?

48:28.380 --> 48:29.660
What do you want to point to people to the floor?

48:29.660 --> 48:32.540
Is your social media projects anything?

48:32.540 --> 48:37.820
OK, please everyone follow, head gum on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,

48:37.820 --> 48:42.220
TikTok and YouTube and gumball FM on Twitter and LinkedIn.

48:42.220 --> 48:45.820
If you're professional and follow me on Twitter and Instagram,

48:45.820 --> 48:47.180
Kayla, allow more already.

48:47.180 --> 48:50.380
And don't betray anyone on the 15th, please.

48:50.380 --> 48:51.180
Or cyber bully.

48:53.420 --> 48:53.820
Villa.

48:57.820 --> 48:58.620
Can't hear him.

48:58.620 --> 48:59.500
Are you typing them out?

49:01.500 --> 49:02.460
I can't even read it.

49:02.460 --> 49:04.220
Follow me on Instagram.

49:04.220 --> 49:06.380
Oh, Johnny, maybe.

49:06.380 --> 49:15.580
The time this comes out, I believe that XOXO gossip kings, the Gossip Girl podcast,

49:15.660 --> 49:19.340
posted by Carl Tart and Lamar Woods will have a YouTube channel

49:19.340 --> 49:21.500
and be doing video episodes.

49:21.500 --> 49:26.140
So put that link in the description and you should follow it.

49:26.140 --> 49:29.820
And subscribe because they're really, really funny.

49:29.820 --> 49:30.860
It's really funny show.

49:32.860 --> 49:38.620
And then follow me on Twitter, Instagram, and letterboxed at Maria Kayla.

49:38.620 --> 49:42.460
And follow BD newcomers, letterboxed.

49:42.460 --> 49:44.940
Marvel at newcomers.

49:44.940 --> 49:48.620
They're doing their fifth season on the MCU.

49:49.900 --> 49:52.540
And it will be really funny and fun.

49:53.420 --> 49:54.380
Hell yeah.

49:54.380 --> 49:57.100
And you can follow me on Instagram at Jeffrey James on TikTok.

49:57.100 --> 50:01.340
At, I am Jeffrey James because I couldn't get at Jeffrey James.

50:01.340 --> 50:03.820
The person who has it hasn't posted anything.

50:03.820 --> 50:05.100
I think his name is Matthew.

50:07.420 --> 50:08.860
But we'll see you guys again next week.

50:08.860 --> 50:13.020
Uh, and until then, I guess that's Daw's folks.

50:14.940 --> 50:32.940
That was a hit-dum original.

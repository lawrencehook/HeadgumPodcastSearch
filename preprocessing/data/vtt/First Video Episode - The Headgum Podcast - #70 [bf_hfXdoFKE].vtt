WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:30.000 --> 00:49.000
I think that's the whole clip. I think he made it shorter. You can't not laugh at a fall.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
Because laugh is fall backwards.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
You've had every emotion and we're only 41 seconds deep.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Pace yourself.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Pace your fucking attitude.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Blumenfeld.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
If I've had it, fall down.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Get up.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Laugh.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Everybody.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Let's go to my guest video.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
Let's get a story now!

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Johnny Villam Sacks.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Ricka Brownlee on the facts.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
That means I'm on a point to you, Ricka.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
We're giving meaning to this intro now.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
If I point to you and I say, let's get a number crunch on that.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I need you to Google it. Is that fine?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
All right.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
A number crunch?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
What?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Nothing.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
A number crunch?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah. Let's do the math on that.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
But it's really like Googling.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
You know, did Dwight L. Moody even gelicize anything.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Okay.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
All right.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Left.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
It's okay to laugh.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
So we're recording this whole.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
We're going to upload this whole thing, not just the best clips of other.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Whole thing.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Okay.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Less edited than ever before.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
The people that know how much of a shit show this really is.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
The James cut.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And now.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
You got him already out there.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Uh, vanilla sweet cream cold brew from Starbucks.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
The cold foam?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Mm-hmm.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Not cold foam.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
Just the, it's like vanilla ice cream melted into a coffee.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Okay.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Guards?

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
What I need from you guys for the rest of this episode and let's just all.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
If you can't handle this, then get out and I will get someone else from the headgum team on this record.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Because this is the first video episode.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
Like Rico is saying, which means we can't edit out the zoom delay like we normally do.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
I need you guys to be fucking on it today.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
I need the rhythm of this to be the rhythm of the rise.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Right?

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
It needs to have the energy of that one episode we did over video.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
We're a mirror to the arms be bit.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Yeah.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
I'm spit.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Don't set it up to fail.

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
You're basically, you're like a, you're a pinch runner and you're pointing to the fucking left field.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Like we can't necessarily pull that off.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
So don't put that pressure on us.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Everybody.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Are we going to get copyright infringement on YouTube?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
No.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
All right.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
I mean, maybe.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
In which first episode goes up, the audio is out immediately.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
It's quite nice coming for us.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
Nineteen flags as to stole and copyright content.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
But in that case, I'll just record a version of it where I'm like, everybody, everybody.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Let's get into it.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Get stopped.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
No.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
And then Ferris will edit that in and then we'll figure that out.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
What's that?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
I said, yeah.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
I'm just agreed.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Okay.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
I didn't hear.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Anyway, intro the show, I guess.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I haven't really said who's on yet.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
You saw the show.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah, I'll just start yelling.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
I said, I said, Maria could brownie on the facts.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
And then a mirror blue and feld bring it up the rear.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
What are your thoughts on that, Maria?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I don't like that.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I'm stumbled on my last name.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Fine.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Let's get it clean.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
And we can't edit it out again because we have to edit this way less.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Yeah.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
So we have to.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Let's get it.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Sure.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Get it clean.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Yeah.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Don't really exist on air.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Right.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Right.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
You're right.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Go for it.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
And a mirror blue and feld bring it up the rear.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Thanks.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Happy to be here, guys.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Who?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
We get sorry.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Who's that?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Who's notification was that?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Uh, me.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
I got an email.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Absolutely.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Put it on.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Absolutely mute all devices.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
This is already a train wreck.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I don't understand.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
We're having so much fun already.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
It feels like there's like steam rolling over.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
No, there's so much pressure on this because like.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
You fucking started it that way.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
You said let's have a great episode.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
One of the best.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
I want the energy to be like when I did this one thing once.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
And now you're worried that there's too much pressure.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Just have a nice organic episode.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
The pressures on either way because we're doing these video episodes so that we

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
can do what all these other successful podcasts are doing.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Putting up clips on TikTok, putting it the whole thing up on YouTube and people have

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
been begging for episodes over video on this show for months.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Right?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
So there's already hype surrounding this.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
There's already pressure under pressure.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
You can't handle it, man.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
It's real obvious that you're already cracking.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
I'm worried about the next 40 minutes.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Just shake it out.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Let's just shake it out, everybody.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
We're fine.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
You're the one who needs to shake it out.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
All right.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Any dreams?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
How did you sleep last night?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Because it looks like not great.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Not super good actually.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
It's afternoon, but it looks like we sort of shook you up after you woke up at

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
7.15 in the morning or so.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
In a way.

06:27.000 --> 06:36.000
I have been tossing and turning hitter than feather because I'm out of melatonin five.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Which is a sleep supplement you take.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
See, that's the kind of bullshit we're like, if I was editing only an oral version of this,

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
I would have cut out that misstep, vocally.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
But we can't because then the video's going to skip.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
And that's just so now we're seeing scars in all, right?

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
This is not the perfection of the vision that I have for it.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
If you're going to endeavor content or otherwise to create content,

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
make it as good as probable.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
That was easy.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
That was easy.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Oh, my new favorite one.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Yeah.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Number two is she.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
We'll get to she.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
We'll get to she.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Oh, that was six flags.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Someone said she at the start of one of the rollercoasters.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
And surely everywhere people started chiming.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
And it was great.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
It's my favorite thing in the fucking world.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I mean, what a call in response.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
What an absolute call in response.

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
And I think that it's basically calling back to a tribal way of life where there is this universal

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
language of celebratory or otherwise of joy.

07:51.000 --> 08:01.000
And I think we need to harken.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
I want to give a college lecture once in his life.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
I want him to get in front of a lecture hall.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
I just want to be precise.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
I just want to be precise.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Caleb and Shelby.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Shout out keeping records.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
It's my new favorite.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I've been podcast checking out.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
They did a bit on one of those shows with when Katie Kershaw is on.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
And they were talking about how lectures always come late with a call for you that they didn't have time

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
to drink.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
She's always like.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
And so that's why it's like drink the coffee in the green.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Obviously.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
Are you using the audio that I'm recording or the zoom audio for this?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
The audio that you're recording.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Okay, because as dogs bark, I'm using myself on zoom.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
But just know that it's leaking on to the sure audio.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
So for sure.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
For sure.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Yeah.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
For sure.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Yes.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Johnny.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Just check in about.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
And now I'm worried about censoring because we're going to have to censor our mouths.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
But let's check in to your kind of sexual escapats.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Because I think you've been sort of.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
This is you censoring yourself.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Yeah.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
You said I have to stop because I can't cut anything out.

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
I feel like it was never made clear that that's what that censorship was.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
So you immediately were going to have to censor.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Okay.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
What I was going to say is that he's become sort of a jack-off of all trades.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
No.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Don't say that.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Okay.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
For Johnny.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Why would you say that?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Get off.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
This is the worst place to.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
All right.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
So let's shout it home with your parents.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
I'm my childhood home.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
This is my parents bedroom.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
I'm not going to talk about my sexual escapats.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
My parents bedroom.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
I could see your dad in the background.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Looking for shoes or something in that closet.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Yeah.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Let's talk after the jack-off spell.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
You know that top and odd kind of gets your top off.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
And get the olive spread?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Yes.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I think.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
It's sort of an app.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Sure.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
It's an any teaser.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
It's an app.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
So you can fat.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Say it.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
You know you wanted to.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
Think me got them to it and guess what else.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I will eat your ass.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Oh, sorry.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
We can't have.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
These are the fun.

10:40.000 --> 10:46.000
What are we supposed to say after you played that clip?

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Are we supposed to chuckle at it?

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
It's here at every time.

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
People were rousing me for the two podcasts that we put out last week that I was on.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Review review and headgun podcast on review review.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
I didn't know the song 99 read balloons.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
And people were like.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
I'm read it talking about how there's gaps in my pop culture knowledge.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Which is probably true.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Which it is true.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
But then I didn't know that this clip was from Grant Theft Auto San Andreas.

11:15.000 --> 11:22.000
And it's only because I never played the story mode in Grant Theft Auto.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Did you guys play the story mode in Grant Theft Auto?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
No.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
I never played that game ever.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Not San Andreas though.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Yeah.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Four was fire.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
I can't wait for six.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Four is good.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Five.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
The goat obviously.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
The goat.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Yeah.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Is it was fine.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
No.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
I just went over from your experiences with I think.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Yeah.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
She's like an actual gamer.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
And you, I guess, have never heard of really popular songs and clips from video games.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Why?

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
Stop playing the knock sound.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Please distract.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Thank you.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
It feels like there's someone actually knocking.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Yeah.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
Jeff, did you add the sound clip that I asked for?

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Um, I didn't, but I'll do it right now.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
As you talk amongst yourselves.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I mean, you don't have to.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
God.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
We clearly cut around this.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
It wasn't a plea for you to do it now.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
I was just asking if it would come up eventually.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
No.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Let's just.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
I know we're on videos.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
So you're going to see me searching and people are going to be like,

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
like, this is a good podcast.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
But you guys can fill the time.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
And that's something that you guys only need to get better at.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I mean, or even on your show and we're going to get to this later.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
I think that there's some things that you can improve on.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Johnny, you're killing me.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
I don't respect you.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Oh, thank you.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Thank you.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
What?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
I don't respect your opinion.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
What kind of a mere show?

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
I was going to go if I were you.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
But you know what?

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
What about fashion wise?

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
I guess you have your pulse on what looks good stylistically.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
But don't ever talk to me about my shows or anything like that.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
You're not going to like the rest of this episode.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Because I have a whole segment.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Yeah.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
I'm talking about yourselves.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
I'm going to create the sound clip that Merika wanted to hear.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
You're going to create it now.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
In saying, no way.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
I mean, what is your, how do you say?

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
It's podcast merch for a friend of mine.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
So I had to give him that add a boy that shout out that, hey, how do you do?

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
And honestly, it was going to be sort of a subtle homage.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
But then you asked me to lift it into frames.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
So this is just an official absolute endorsement of the no-dong spotcast.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
But they're nice dudes.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
So I don't mind it.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Jeffrey, just go to the Soundboard clip now.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Let's just move on towards it.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
I'm sure I have to edit it because it's came in a compilation video.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
What's up?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
I'm slapping it.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
I can't afford you.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
You didn't have to do this.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
No, especially you want to make sure that this is happening because of Merika.

13:52.000 --> 13:58.000
I texted him this on Friday.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Yeah.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
That is true.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
That is good.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
I had the best weekend of my fucking life.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
When do you do?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
I do have to edit.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
So you guys have to talk to yourself.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
What do you, yeah, how did you have the best weekend of your life?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
No.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
I saw my first Broadway musical.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Wow.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Since the court went back.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Broadway's back.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
Our tickets extra expensive because it's been away or like cheaper because some people don't want to go.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Depends on the show.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
I think also a lot of the like discounted tickets.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Your lottery isn't stuff.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
I seem like they're going to have more allotments of tickets.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
So it's probably going to be a little easier to get cheap tickets.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
That's the scoop.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
My friend won the lottery for six.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
So he went.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
And it was very fun.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Is that new?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Yeah.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
It didn't exist before quarantine.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
It did.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
It was.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Yeah, but it like hadn't.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
I think quarantine happened the day before.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
It was supposed to officially open.

14:59.000 --> 15:07.000
So it wasn't considered for this year's Tony Awards, which were also on Sunday.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
But it's great.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
It's about the six wives of Henry VIII.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
If they were like a pop girl group, like the spice girls.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
And it's really fun.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
I'm here.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
How's it going?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Much less eventful than that.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I didn't see any Broadway musicals.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
I didn't see anything at all.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
I stated home.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
I watched football.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
We're dog sitting in extra dogs.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
So I got two dogs instead of one.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
And it feels like it's three times the work.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
I mean, it's just like when you got two things interacting with each other.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Forget about it.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
And once an older guy, they can't even jump on the couch.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
He's whining.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I got to lift him up every time it goes anywhere.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
We got diapers for the little dude.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Thankfully, he hasn't had to use him.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
But it was definitely in play as he gets excited very easily.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Anxious, skittish, scared.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
He's 15 plus.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
So you know, and my god.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Humid years.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
That's nine miles old.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Is it small?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
He looks like my dog.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
But even smaller and older.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
They look like twins a little bit.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
I wonder if I can share.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Put that picture on the screen.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
I would have to say.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
I'm just sharing.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
And I'm just, I'm not going to do that.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Yeah, I could just put it up.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
I'll turn your video.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
I'm obviously not going to edit anything now.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
What's that?

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
I'll turn your fucking video off if you try it out.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
This is my show.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
And I feel like you're not proceeding with veterans.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
What are you talking about?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
I'm being very nice.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
That's true.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Sorry.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
I was out of the loop for a while.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
I was in the loop.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Yes.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
I know you were editing.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Yeah.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
I'm sorry.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I'm just nervous.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Oh, look at that.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Look at that.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Beautiful.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
My dog and then an older, smaller version of my dog.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
They're like little clones.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Just look like the visitor.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Yeah.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
They get along.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
That's cool.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Like an uncle and nephew.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Yeah.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Who's who?

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
Uh, the older dogs, the uncle.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
I would make sense.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Obviously, Marika.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Yeah.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Just needed to clarify.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Let's, let's regroup here.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Right.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Let's just, okay.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Yeah.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I mean, are you finished editing?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Yeah.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Full steam ahead, right?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Yeah.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Very nice.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
You abandoned us.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
It's not like less.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
This isn't a regroup.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
You basically disappeared.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
And then you're like, all right.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Let's fucking, let's get things back on track.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Let's get real back on track.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Do you really hold on track?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Absolutely full steam ahead.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Yeah.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
You guys always get mad at me.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Okay.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I hate to copyright strike on this.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
That one really hurt my ears.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Yeah.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Yeah.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Um, we have some segments to get to.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
I think we should just get into it, right?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Yeah.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Let's do it.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Yeah.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Um, but not before.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Let's just get into them.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
18 minutes in.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Let's just get into the second.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
I think so.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
Do you want to mention the live show or just sort of keep that to the end as well?

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
You're the one who always gets mad at me for plugging in the middle of a show.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
But yeah, head gum podcast.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
First ever live record.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
New York.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Shitty.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Nice.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Um,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
October 22nd.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
7 p.m.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Will all be there?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Johnny's family will be there.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Yeah.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Yeah.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
New York City.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Grammarcy theater.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
October 22nd.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
7 p.m.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
Tickets are about over half sold out.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
So if you're considering going, I would go get your tickets now.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
The pit.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
If you're listening to this, it's probably already sold out and now you have to go to the

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
back and load.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Ugh.

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
Uh, well, you're sort of, you're making it seem like they shouldn't buy tickets then.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
You got it.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Don't dissuade the fan.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Well, it's just, uh, did you say swayed?

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Don't dissuade the fans.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
Should we do all swayed everything at the show?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
No.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
Where do you even buy swayed clothes anymore?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Top shop.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Rodney's closet.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Not.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
All right.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
We do have to take a quick break.

19:21.000 --> 19:30.000
But we'll be right back after we thank some sponsors.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.440

Thank you to RayCon for sponsoring this episode of our show.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.240
Guys, there's so much going on in the world.

20:53.240 --> 20:54.240
Right?

20:54.240 --> 20:58.800
I know that for me, it's stuff that I'm excited about, you know, getting back out there

20:58.800 --> 21:03.240
doing live comedy shows, hanging out with my friends, but also stuff that I'd rather

21:03.240 --> 21:04.800
not think about.

21:04.800 --> 21:08.280
Like, a climate change, maybe?

21:09.280 --> 21:18.080
I can't know what's control the vibes in the world, but you can control the vibe in

21:18.080 --> 21:19.080
your head.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.080
All right?

21:20.080 --> 21:21.880
I'm talking about RayCon ear buds.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.680
I got them right here.

21:23.680 --> 21:24.880
RayCon sent me these.

21:24.880 --> 21:32.600
I've been using them as opposed to the one, the other in ear pods that are wireless

21:32.600 --> 21:38.120
that we all use and know about, and they've been honestly much more usable and much

21:38.120 --> 21:41.000
much more me friendly, let's say.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.560
I wear them when I bike to work, when I walk to work, sometimes and when I work out, when

21:45.560 --> 21:49.320
I work out it's huge because they really stay in your ear and they're different sized

21:49.320 --> 21:53.000
little gummy things that keep them in there.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.720
So whether you're trying to pump up, wind down, work, or work out, like I was saying,

21:57.720 --> 22:04.000
RayCon's are the go-to for on the go audio.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.120
That wasn't meant to rhyme, but I wanted it too.

22:07.120 --> 22:13.360
And these are the everyday ear buds and they look feel and sound better than ever.

22:13.360 --> 22:18.560
They have an improved rubber, oil, look and feel, you can kind of see the finishing on

22:18.560 --> 22:19.560
here.

22:19.560 --> 22:23.360
It's very high quality, as you guys know that I'm a watch nerd, I really appreciate

22:23.360 --> 22:25.960
good finishing.

22:25.960 --> 22:30.640
You get three new sound profiles, which is also awesome, and I make sure that everything

22:30.640 --> 22:34.440
sounds its best with just the right amount of base, which obviously is very important for

22:34.440 --> 22:36.520
speakers or headphones, et cetera.

22:36.520 --> 22:43.040
There's pure mode, which is for podcast listening, blues, instrumental music, et cetera.

22:43.040 --> 22:46.160
There's balanced mode, which is also for podcast listening, but it boosts a little bit

22:46.160 --> 22:49.440
of the treble, rock and heavy rock slash metal.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.000
I use that for listening to the dead music.

22:52.000 --> 22:57.640
You can actually see my tape collection right there, which is not, there's no way for me

22:57.640 --> 23:01.600
to listen to the tapes through here, but you don't know what I mean, love the dead.

23:01.600 --> 23:05.880
And base mode for hip hop, EDM, reggae, et cetera.

23:05.880 --> 23:09.080
There's also an all-new awareness mode for when you need to listen to your surroundings

23:09.080 --> 23:10.080
instead.

23:10.080 --> 23:12.160
I haven't checked that out yet, I should.

23:12.160 --> 23:17.760
And they also offer eight hours of playtime with a 32-hour battery life, so this thing,

23:17.760 --> 23:21.360
if you charge it once, it's good for the whole week, at least in my experience.

23:21.360 --> 23:24.800
There's also a built-in mic, and you can take calls in your earbuds at the press of a

23:24.800 --> 23:30.120
button, and they also, these start at half the price of competing brands.

23:30.120 --> 23:33.680
They also come good with a 45-day happiness guarantee, so you have nothing to lose with

23:33.680 --> 23:34.680
Raycons.

23:34.680 --> 23:35.680
Go for it.

23:35.680 --> 23:41.120
And right now, head-gum podcast listeners get 15% off their order at buyraycon.com slash what's

23:41.120 --> 23:42.120
that?

23:42.120 --> 23:45.120
That's buyraycon.com slash what's that?

23:45.120 --> 23:48.800
To get 15% off your order of Raycons.

23:48.800 --> 23:53.120
One more time, that's buyraycon.com slash what's that?

23:53.120 --> 23:54.120
Thanks Raycon.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.840
That's the one you chose.

23:55.840 --> 23:57.560
Which one did you want?

23:57.560 --> 23:58.560
Oh my god.

23:58.560 --> 23:59.560
I asked Jeff.

23:59.560 --> 24:03.640
Don't recommend anything else, because we'll spend four minutes in the show.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.640
What editing it?

24:04.640 --> 24:12.080
I told Jeff that he should add the Hannah Montana transitions.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.480
That's what this is.

24:13.480 --> 24:17.560
I know, but it's not like obvious a lot.

24:17.560 --> 24:22.680
Which sing the obvious one, I don't, because I just, whoa, whoa, yeah.

24:22.680 --> 24:23.680
Like that one.

24:23.680 --> 24:24.680
All right.

24:24.680 --> 24:27.680
I know I said that we can't edit this very time, but that one I'm going to cut.

24:27.680 --> 24:30.720
That one I'm going to cut, because that was, I might ears are bleeding.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.720
Absolutely my eyes are so rude.

24:32.760 --> 24:33.720
You're so rude.

24:33.720 --> 24:37.480
I want to say fun and games.

24:37.480 --> 24:41.960
You're so angry saying this is all fun and games.

24:41.960 --> 24:45.240
All right, we do have to move on.

24:45.240 --> 24:46.240
Here we go.

24:46.240 --> 24:47.240
Fucking.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.240
Where's the song?

24:48.240 --> 25:01.360
Surely great, then I really want to see what we have to do during this one minute

25:01.360 --> 25:15.680
long sound clip.

25:15.680 --> 25:31.120
And Jeff's not even dancing anymore, as I'm here to stay as selfie.

25:31.120 --> 25:35.880
I know he's during the song.

25:35.880 --> 25:41.440
Welcome to Mandate or Nah.

25:41.440 --> 25:46.080
Zero response as well as zero sounds.

25:46.080 --> 25:50.240
Which you control the sound work.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.440
You could have applauded yourself.

25:52.440 --> 25:53.440
Okay.

25:53.440 --> 25:56.040
Listen.

25:56.040 --> 26:00.800
This tyrant that we have in office, this fucking communist,

26:00.840 --> 26:06.840
Joe Grampy Biden isn't trying to get me to get the fucking prick.

26:06.840 --> 26:10.880
He's a prick, prick.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.560
So this is Mandate or Nah.

26:13.560 --> 26:14.920
This is Mandate or Nah.

26:14.920 --> 26:20.120
Biden is mandating this fucking microchip sauce that they're trying to put into me.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.840
Okay, correct, but keep going.

26:22.840 --> 26:26.080
I'm not going to stand for it.

26:26.120 --> 26:31.720
I think we need to draw some equivalencies to fucking prove to these liberal

26:31.720 --> 26:35.120
cucks that this is crazy.

26:35.120 --> 26:38.000
I mean, you can't make me get it.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
You can't.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.520
And I'm going to tell him to prove it here.

26:41.520 --> 26:43.000
I really am.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
All right.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
It's gross.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
What?

26:46.000 --> 26:51.120
I think we need to wax about other things that what if they mandated, what if they

26:51.120 --> 27:02.040
mandated Jordan's to wear, to wear, daily, or yeah, sort of your daily drivers.

27:02.040 --> 27:03.040
It's fine.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.800
They're like comfortable shoes, I guess.

27:05.800 --> 27:06.800
Yeah.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.600
You're going to be free.

27:08.600 --> 27:09.600
I guess so.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.040
Yeah, because the vaccine is free.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.040
Sounds great.

27:12.040 --> 27:13.040
Yeah, sure.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.040
Okay.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.040
Well, that's a bad example.

27:15.040 --> 27:18.280
What if they mandated everybody this weekend has to take somebody they care

27:18.280 --> 27:22.160
about to dinner on the government's dollar and that's great.

27:22.160 --> 27:23.160
That's great.

27:23.160 --> 27:24.160
Really nice.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.160
Yeah.

27:25.160 --> 27:26.160
That's V2.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.160
Yeah.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.160
That is set on the government's time.

27:28.160 --> 27:29.160
Yeah.

27:29.160 --> 27:30.160
It would all be on.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.960
All of these would be free because the vaccine seems to be free because you

27:32.960 --> 27:34.080
can kind of walk in and get it anyway.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.080
Yeah, I love it.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.080
Yeah.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.080
Really.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.080
Okay.

27:38.080 --> 27:38.680
I got up the ante here for a second.

27:38.680 --> 27:48.120
I guess we got to get let's get medical sleep better before it shows what

27:48.120 --> 27:54.560
if I go with me for a second because this is what it's going to get your guys passes.

27:54.560 --> 28:02.040
What if it was mandated everyone goes and gets a physical on the government's dime.

28:02.040 --> 28:03.040
Great.

28:03.040 --> 28:04.040
That'd be nice.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.280
People would catch some stuff there.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.280
Pretty health care.

28:06.280 --> 28:10.720
Probably passing, you know, down the line.

28:10.720 --> 28:11.720
Okay.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.920
I might get it then.

28:13.920 --> 28:14.920
The um.

28:14.920 --> 28:15.920
The back.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.480
The back scene or the physical both because I fear that's good.

28:20.480 --> 28:24.200
So my creepy bones are due to like a calcium deficiency of sorts.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.200
Yep.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.200
Yeah.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.200
You can see that.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.200
Yeah.

28:28.200 --> 28:33.320
You look a little shallow today and maybe we thought I was going to be a black of sleep.

28:33.320 --> 28:36.160
Game over.

28:36.160 --> 28:43.120
That one's done just so we all know and I'm not going to do the song again.

28:43.120 --> 28:52.120
But it's over because we have to move on.

28:52.120 --> 28:53.120
Okay.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.120
What are we moving on to?

28:54.120 --> 28:55.120
Sorry.

28:55.120 --> 28:56.120
I just found a demo.

28:56.120 --> 28:57.120
Here we go.

28:57.120 --> 29:03.120
Don't break it.

29:03.120 --> 29:07.120
Welcome to the price of right.

29:07.120 --> 29:11.120
There we go.

29:12.120 --> 29:14.120
Sorry.

29:14.120 --> 29:19.120
One second.

29:19.120 --> 29:22.120
Do you know that we did play this game?

29:22.120 --> 29:23.120
No.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.120
This is different.

29:24.120 --> 29:25.120
This is different.

29:25.120 --> 29:26.120
The price of right.

29:26.120 --> 29:28.120
This is the price of right.

29:28.120 --> 29:30.120
Just give me a fucking minute.

29:30.120 --> 29:31.120
Yeah.

29:31.120 --> 29:32.120
There we go.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.120
No.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.120
The price of right.

29:35.120 --> 29:40.120
Oh.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.120
Are you guys seeing this?

29:41.120 --> 29:43.120
Oh, we really are.

29:43.120 --> 29:44.120
All right.

29:44.120 --> 29:48.120
This is the price of right.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.120
Turn off.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.120
Yeah.

29:50.120 --> 29:53.120
Welcome to the price of right.

29:53.120 --> 29:58.120
I can't like track of any of the shit on my desktop.

29:58.120 --> 30:02.120
You're like everybody's out to get me today.

30:02.120 --> 30:04.120
You look like you're extra paranoid.

30:04.120 --> 30:06.120
It's like your problem.

30:06.120 --> 30:09.120
You can't keep track of your shit.

30:09.120 --> 30:10.120
All right.

30:10.120 --> 30:11.120
Here we go.

30:11.120 --> 30:12.120
This is the price of right.

30:12.120 --> 30:16.120
Basically, I'm going to show some products from right.

30:16.120 --> 30:20.120
For those only listening to the oral version of this.

30:20.120 --> 30:23.120
But luckily, we do have some visual listeners and viewers.

30:23.120 --> 30:29.120
I should say watching along here who are seeing these products on the screen live on air.

30:30.120 --> 30:33.120
So prices right rules.

30:33.120 --> 30:40.120
And we're just going to go through some right aid products and see if you guys can kind of know what they cost.

30:40.120 --> 30:41.120
All right.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.120
Right aid.

30:42.120 --> 30:45.120
Hydrogen peroxide topical solution.

30:45.120 --> 30:47.120
How many ounces?

30:47.120 --> 30:49.120
This is going to be the full court.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.120
The 32 fluid.

30:50.120 --> 30:51.120
Yeah.

30:51.120 --> 30:53.120
198.

30:53.120 --> 30:55.120
Really.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.120
Wow.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.120
What do we do?

31:01.120 --> 31:02.120
Absolutely.

31:02.120 --> 31:03.120
Yes.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.120
How are you fucking doing?

31:05.120 --> 31:06.120
I'm good.

31:06.120 --> 31:07.120
I'm good.

31:07.120 --> 31:08.120
Okay.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.120
Yeah.

31:09.120 --> 31:10.120
And we're closest without going over.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.120
It's closest not going over.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.120
Yeah.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.120
I'll go above both of those things and say.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.120
8.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.120
99.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.120
Very good.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.120
Is.

31:20.120 --> 31:21.120
Yeah.

31:21.120 --> 31:22.120
Of course.

31:22.120 --> 31:23.120
Incorrect.

31:23.120 --> 31:24.120
Wow.

31:24.120 --> 31:28.120
I almost said 99, but I thought that was too low for the court.

31:28.120 --> 31:31.120
I thought it would be like 16 ounce.

31:31.120 --> 31:33.120
That's cheaper than water.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.120
Yeah.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.120
Which is kind of shocking.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.120
Truly cheaper than water.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.120
How is a chemical cheaper than water?

31:39.120 --> 31:40.120
That doesn't make sense.

31:40.120 --> 31:41.120
Did you ever?

31:41.120 --> 31:43.120
Water is too chemicals.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.120
Hydrogen.

31:44.120 --> 31:45.120
Nice.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.120
Dioxide.

31:46.120 --> 31:47.120
That's a good.

31:47.120 --> 31:48.120
So.

31:48.120 --> 31:49.120
This is grumpy.

31:49.120 --> 31:54.120
Although the hydrogen peroxide is probably more than one chemical too.

31:54.120 --> 31:57.120
So I guess price per molecule you're getting the best.

31:57.120 --> 32:00.120
I really should start drinking this.

32:00.120 --> 32:02.120
Let's read the review.

32:02.120 --> 32:07.120
Because it has one review.

32:07.120 --> 32:08.120
Yep.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.120
Great product.

32:09.120 --> 32:10.120
Great price.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.120
I mean, you're not being it.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.120
There's no way they're making a profit from this.

32:13.120 --> 32:14.120
The bottle alone.

32:14.120 --> 32:16.120
Plus the packaging.

32:16.120 --> 32:18.120
Getting it to the store.

32:18.120 --> 32:19.120
This is a loss.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.120
They call it.

32:20.120 --> 32:21.120
Sorry.

32:21.120 --> 32:26.120
This says the review says we used to get blood of cloth.

32:26.120 --> 32:29.120
It is amazing at taking out protein stains.

32:29.120 --> 32:30.120
Yeah.

32:30.120 --> 32:32.120
That's unfortunate.

32:32.120 --> 32:35.120
But you know, Brian is dealing with his own shit, I guess.

32:35.120 --> 32:39.120
What's unfortunate is you.

32:39.120 --> 32:42.120
What's unfortunate is you.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.120
How?

32:43.120 --> 32:44.120
Let's fucking move on.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.120
Here we go.

32:45.120 --> 32:46.120
Okay.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.120
We're having fun.

32:47.120 --> 32:50.120
We're doing work.

32:50.120 --> 32:52.120
The next product is.

32:52.120 --> 32:59.120
True North almond pecan crunch.

32:59.120 --> 33:02.120
Three, ninety nine.

33:02.120 --> 33:07.120
Now we're like veering off into that we were trader Joe's game that you play.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.120
Which I would have loved to play.

33:09.120 --> 33:13.120
I'm really upset that I didn't get to play that.

33:13.120 --> 33:16.120
I'm a trader Joe snack master.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.120
Yeah.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.120
Were some of those new to you or did you all?

33:19.120 --> 33:20.120
Did you know those all?

33:20.120 --> 33:22.120
Some of them were new, but I knew a lot of them.

33:22.120 --> 33:25.120
Did you know the grilled chicken in a bag or whatever?

33:25.120 --> 33:27.120
That one is I did not know.

33:27.120 --> 33:28.120
Okay.

33:28.120 --> 33:29.120
I used to for my old job.

33:29.120 --> 33:37.120
I used to have to go to trader Joe's every week and get four shopping carts worth of food

33:37.120 --> 33:38.120
and check out.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.120
Yeah.

33:39.120 --> 33:42.120
And like a shopping cart full of milk and check out.

33:42.120 --> 33:45.120
And then like go back and it would get delivered later.

33:45.120 --> 33:48.120
So I know a lot of the trader Joe snacks.

33:48.120 --> 33:49.120
Yeah.

33:49.120 --> 33:50.120
Johnny participates.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.120
Jesus.

33:51.120 --> 33:54.120
Talk on the mic or don't do the show.

33:54.120 --> 33:57.120
We can still go on and on about.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.120
What's your?

33:58.120 --> 33:59.120
Whoa.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.120
What?

34:00.120 --> 34:02.120
What the?

34:02.120 --> 34:03.120
What can I do?

34:03.120 --> 34:04.120
Break us up here.

34:04.120 --> 34:06.120
This is what he fucking wants.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.120
All right.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.120
We're trying to sell this.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.120
Go ahead.

34:09.120 --> 34:10.120
We're going to sell this.

34:10.120 --> 34:12.120
We're going to sell this.

34:12.120 --> 34:13.120
We're going to sell this.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.120
We're going to sell this.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.120
We're going to sell this.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.120
We're going to sell this.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.120
Okay.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.120
And the way you said that is worthy of.

34:20.120 --> 34:23.120
That.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.120
God.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.120
That's.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.120
And that mirror.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.120
Let's get your vote in.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.120
I'll go higher than both of those things.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.120
And say 549.

34:32.120 --> 34:35.120
Break it saves that it.

34:35.120 --> 34:36.120
Wow.

34:36.120 --> 34:37.120
Oh Johnny.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.120
Does Johnny win?

34:38.120 --> 34:39.120
Because he got it exactly.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.120
Wait Johnny.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.120
You said 299.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.120
I thought you said 499.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.120
No.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.120
I didn't say 4.

34:44.120 --> 34:46.320
Can we get a number crunch on that?

34:46.320 --> 34:47.760
What am I crunching there?

34:47.760 --> 34:48.600
It's right here.

34:48.600 --> 34:52.040
I told you, I gave up my point to Johnny.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.600
Okay, and we should say that this is,

34:53.600 --> 34:56.520
it's price is right rules and if you go over you lose,

34:56.520 --> 34:59.960
but it's also price is price of right rules

34:59.960 --> 35:03.520
where for everyone you get right, you get that cash.

35:03.520 --> 35:06.320
So Johnny's winning with $2.99.

35:06.320 --> 35:07.160
Here we go.

35:07.160 --> 35:08.000
Great.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.840
The next product is,

35:10.840 --> 35:12.800
joy and trampoline.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.400
This is sprinkler.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.600
What?

35:17.600 --> 35:19.200
It's a sprinkler.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.680
But you put on your trampoline.

35:20.680 --> 35:21.800
Or some shit, yeah.

35:21.800 --> 35:23.720
I don't think you put it on a trampoline.

35:23.720 --> 35:25.480
I'm pretty sure that it, like,

35:25.480 --> 35:26.880
you click on that image at the bottom.

35:26.880 --> 35:27.720
We could see other images.

35:27.720 --> 35:28.520
Yeah, let's see this.

35:28.520 --> 35:29.280
Oh, yeah, I guess it does.

35:29.280 --> 35:30.280
Oh, there you go.

35:30.280 --> 35:31.120
There you go.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.480
Yeah, I'm familiar with this.

35:32.480 --> 35:33.480
Yeah, it's fun.

35:33.480 --> 35:35.680
That's a lot of fun for kids.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.240
So dangerous.

35:37.240 --> 35:38.240
Yeah.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.240
Yeah.

35:39.240 --> 35:40.760
I'm going to go.

35:40.760 --> 35:42.320
Well, Marika should always get first.

35:42.320 --> 35:43.760
It puts you at a disadvantage.

35:43.760 --> 35:44.760
Yeah, yeah.

35:44.760 --> 35:45.880
I'll switch the order.

35:45.880 --> 35:49.360
So I'll go first this time.

35:49.360 --> 35:52.640
Not that I've actually used the last bit to my advantage

35:52.640 --> 35:54.080
because I've always overcasted it.

35:54.080 --> 35:57.320
So I would say something like one thing.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.400
And then I'll divide it in half because right

35:59.400 --> 36:01.480
eight is the fucking, I guess,

36:01.480 --> 36:06.640
goat of affordable shopping and say $12.99.

36:06.640 --> 36:08.640
All right.

36:08.640 --> 36:11.640
All right.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.640
1999.

36:13.640 --> 36:19.640
As in, let's party like it's 1995.

36:19.640 --> 36:21.640
No.

36:21.640 --> 36:23.640
Johnny, get your guns.

36:23.640 --> 36:24.640
Let's fucking do it.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.640
I'm going to say 16.99.

36:27.640 --> 36:30.640
Something that dangerous is going to be cheap.

36:30.640 --> 36:31.640
Marina.

36:31.640 --> 36:32.640
Texas.

36:32.640 --> 36:33.640
Wow.

36:34.640 --> 36:38.640
This one is more expensive than I thought.

36:38.640 --> 36:39.640
Yeah.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.640
I mean, this is what you might as well

36:41.640 --> 36:44.640
just get 40 hydrogen peroxide bottles, right?

36:44.640 --> 36:45.640
Here we go.

36:45.640 --> 36:46.640
Same price.

36:46.640 --> 36:49.640
The next the next fucking item is a very

36:49.640 --> 36:52.640
chuggy home decor item for fall.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.640
It's a cartoon fox.

36:54.640 --> 36:56.640
And it says, it's a sign.

36:56.640 --> 36:57.640
And it says, thank gourd.

36:57.640 --> 37:00.640
It's sweater weather.

37:00.640 --> 37:02.640
So Johnny, first this time.

37:02.640 --> 37:04.640
Let's go Johnny Villa first.

37:04.640 --> 37:05.640
All right.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.640
I'm going to shoot for

37:07.640 --> 37:09.640
$6.99.

37:09.640 --> 37:13.640
Okay.

37:13.640 --> 37:15.640
Ricky, you want to go?

37:15.640 --> 37:16.640
All right.

37:16.640 --> 37:17.640
You know, it's a little harder to go second.

37:17.640 --> 37:19.640
So I'll say $8.99.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.640
I'll say $9.99.

37:21.640 --> 37:22.640
Mm.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.640
All wrong.

37:24.640 --> 37:25.640
$3.99.

37:25.640 --> 37:27.640
I was right on the right way.

37:27.640 --> 37:28.640
It's on the right regular price.

37:28.640 --> 37:29.640
Wow.

37:29.640 --> 37:31.640
I know my chuggy items.

37:31.640 --> 37:32.640
Yeah.

37:32.640 --> 37:33.640
All right.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.640
And the next item is...

37:35.640 --> 37:40.640
Joven sex appeal for men fragrance to wear.

37:40.640 --> 37:41.640
Oh.

37:41.640 --> 37:43.640
Well, what is that fragrance time?

37:43.640 --> 37:44.640
Oh.

37:44.640 --> 37:47.640
I'm going joven tonight.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.640
What's that?

37:49.640 --> 37:50.640
Joven.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.640
It's sex to the hydrogen peroxide.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.640
A European dance pops.

37:54.640 --> 37:55.640
Anthem comes out.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.640
And you just kind of shit me.

37:57.640 --> 37:58.640
That's the commercial version.

37:59.640 --> 38:01.640
On the package says sex appeal.

38:01.640 --> 38:04.640
Now you don't have to be born with it.

38:04.640 --> 38:08.640
The bottom line says men can never have enough.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.640
Everybody.

38:10.640 --> 38:12.640
Everybody.

38:12.640 --> 38:13.640
Let's go.

38:13.640 --> 38:16.640
Joven sex appeal for men.

38:16.640 --> 38:20.640
I have no clue, but I will guess $9.99.

38:20.640 --> 38:21.640
All right.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.640
$8.99.

38:23.640 --> 38:24.640
Mm-hmm.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.640
Such a yellow cologne.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.640
That's the joven difference.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.640
It's like a neutrogenous soap.

38:30.640 --> 38:32.640
It contains...

38:32.640 --> 38:34.640
It's body gels.

38:34.640 --> 38:35.640
Yeah.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.640
It's as thick as shampoo.

38:38.640 --> 38:40.640
That you have to sort of...

38:40.640 --> 38:43.640
Lather on your neck and face.

38:43.640 --> 38:44.640
Yeah.

38:44.640 --> 38:46.640
It's amber.

38:46.640 --> 38:47.640
Are you okay, Jeff?

38:47.640 --> 38:48.640
What is that?

38:48.640 --> 38:50.640
What do you microdress in there?

38:50.640 --> 38:51.640
Yeah.

38:51.640 --> 38:52.640
Post-lacic drops.

38:52.640 --> 38:53.640
Yeah.

38:53.640 --> 38:55.640
Johnny, let's get your answer in.

38:55.640 --> 38:56.640
We're gonna say...

38:56.640 --> 38:58.640
17.

38:58.640 --> 38:59.640
17.

38:59.640 --> 39:00.640
All right.

39:00.640 --> 39:01.640
Oh, it's going high.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.640
And the winner is...

39:03.640 --> 39:04.640
Amir.

39:04.640 --> 39:05.640
Amir.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.640
Nice.

39:07.640 --> 39:09.640
So...

39:09.640 --> 39:11.640
Marika's winning with 1999.

39:11.640 --> 39:12.640
Amir has 1539.

39:12.640 --> 39:15.640
And I think Johnny has like 299 or some worship.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.640
The next item is...

39:17.640 --> 39:18.640
Cous...

39:18.640 --> 39:19.640
Caltrade.

39:19.640 --> 39:21.640
Bone Health Minis.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.640
Give me anything.

39:24.640 --> 39:25.640
Yes.

39:25.640 --> 39:27.640
The old ones I found a little bit too large.

39:27.640 --> 39:28.640
Yeah.

39:28.640 --> 39:29.640
And in charge.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.640
You need to take two of them though.

39:31.640 --> 39:32.640
So it amounts to the same amount of...

39:32.640 --> 39:34.640
Caltrade pills are big.

39:34.640 --> 39:35.640
All right.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.640
That's someone that has a hard time swallowing pills.

39:37.640 --> 39:38.640
Yeah.

39:38.640 --> 39:39.640
Right.

39:39.640 --> 39:40.640
And that's another one.

39:40.640 --> 39:41.640
I'm also like...

39:41.640 --> 39:42.640
Are you usually rough?

39:42.640 --> 39:43.640
Yeah.

39:43.640 --> 39:44.640
You didn't have to say that.

39:44.640 --> 39:45.640
Yeah.

39:45.640 --> 39:46.640
I was gonna say that.

39:46.640 --> 39:47.640
Caltrade pills are usually...

39:47.640 --> 39:48.640
They're never like a gel tab.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.640
Yeah.

39:49.640 --> 39:51.640
It's always that rough sort of...

39:51.640 --> 39:53.640
And for some reason you have to take three of them.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.640
That's a little too big.

39:55.640 --> 39:56.640
Yeah.

39:56.640 --> 39:59.640
Actually, the Caltrade Minis sound like a really good one.

39:59.640 --> 40:00.640
And I picked these up at Rade.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.640
Might have to cut.

40:02.640 --> 40:03.640
All right.

40:03.640 --> 40:04.640
Who's going first?

40:04.640 --> 40:05.640
Um, I'll go.

40:05.640 --> 40:06.640
Yeah.

40:10.640 --> 40:13.640
I'll go 1349.

40:13.640 --> 40:14.640
Ooh.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.640
That's a pretty safe bet.

40:16.640 --> 40:17.640
Not really.

40:19.640 --> 40:20.640
Sorry.

40:20.640 --> 40:21.640
Sorry.

40:21.640 --> 40:22.640
Sorry.

40:26.640 --> 40:27.640

40:38.640 --> 40:39.640
I'll go sick.

40:39.640 --> 40:41.640

I'll go $5.50

45:08.460 --> 45:10.460
That's wrong

45:10.460 --> 45:12.540
It doesn't matter because this whole thing was winter takes gall

45:13.660 --> 45:16.300
Amir wins with 78

45:16.300 --> 45:18.300
Fuckin' Euro

45:18.300 --> 45:20.300
Let me Venmo your ass

45:20.300 --> 45:25.660

45:25.900 --> 45:28.300
But what about the the fucking chowder?

45:28.300 --> 45:32.060
Yeah, the chowder was annoying too. My garage smelled like fish for a week

45:35.500 --> 45:37.500
Game over

45:38.140 --> 45:40.140
That was easy

45:43.820 --> 45:45.820
That was easy

45:46.780 --> 45:48.780
Fog corn

45:48.780 --> 45:50.780
Leg horn

45:51.100 --> 45:54.940
What about fog corn leg corn? Is that it?

45:54.940 --> 45:56.940
Is that sex segment wise?

45:56.940 --> 45:58.460
No

45:58.460 --> 46:01.900
We have look we have eight minutes three of that's going to be the segments we're going to get

46:01.900 --> 46:05.820
Third fast and then we're going to do plugs got it now we have an outline video

46:05.900 --> 46:09.580
People know what to expect we're not going to go past an hour because guess what that's being

46:09.580 --> 46:12.300
Greed a little bit gratuitous it's being a little bit fucking

46:13.340 --> 46:18.620
Selfish it's being a little prolonging you just go to the next segment. Okay, please that's right

46:19.340 --> 46:21.340
That was this is a head gum original

46:23.100 --> 46:27.020
Oh, wait, I didn't introduce it at all um was that my voice so

46:27.980 --> 46:31.340
I'm here I think that a lot of people would agree that you're a funny guy

46:31.980 --> 46:37.820
You know comedy's been your medium of choice to you know ultimately

46:38.620 --> 46:41.660
Guide others through turmoil and

46:42.620 --> 46:46.620
Like we were talking about earlier be a beacon of joy and I think that

46:47.900 --> 46:50.300
No one's without fault is my take

46:51.260 --> 46:53.900
So I think we're going to go through if if this is okay with you

46:54.460 --> 46:58.540
I thought we could go through this week's if I were you and just kind of give you notes on your performance

47:02.300 --> 47:04.300
Out of line out of turn

47:05.660 --> 47:07.660
unnecessary

47:07.660 --> 47:09.100
slanderous

47:09.100 --> 47:10.140
odious

47:10.140 --> 47:11.820
angry means fear to the bad

47:13.260 --> 47:14.620
um

47:14.620 --> 47:16.620
Let's hear it

47:17.500 --> 47:20.540
Thank you to square space for sponsoring this episode of our show

47:20.940 --> 47:24.940
I don't want to give them free out space. Yeah, all right. So it's the addiction fees. You can

47:25.100 --> 47:31.980
Fashionally yeah, calm is it so you're you're just just scrubbing through it randomly not necessarily here we go here we go

47:36.940 --> 47:41.260
Yeah, we have we have one minute left to do the yeah, wow

47:41.660 --> 47:47.260
I really thought he was I wish I thought it was Scottish. I thought he was a Scottsman. Yeah, yeah

47:47.980 --> 47:54.460
This is sorry. We stopped yep and insanely confusing two of us on this show are in that show

47:55.020 --> 47:59.980
Sounds like there are six people on the zoom now and two people up here twice or something

48:00.460 --> 48:06.060
That is not we can do another on next week's head gun podcast. We can critique this episode all right

48:06.060 --> 48:10.620
What we're doing right now is critiquing your performance specifically on if I were you we were only a minute and a half left to do this

48:10.620 --> 48:11.660
Let's get him to the end

48:11.660 --> 48:13.660
Yeah, I know why it's an accident

48:14.780 --> 48:20.780
He did yeah, so he it's like this opposite thing where usually you can't hear the accent until you're talking

48:21.100 --> 48:25.660
You could only hear the accent when he was singing and not when he was interesting did he have an accent when he was talking?

48:25.660 --> 48:27.340
It's good so far. I know because I'll give you that

48:27.900 --> 48:34.460
So why are you sitting and it was just what's the point in this then if it's good you're just listening to an episode saying it's fine so far

48:34.460 --> 48:36.460
That's not a note

48:36.460 --> 48:38.460
It's not so rare so like you

48:38.460 --> 48:42.860
In theory should know this I had a time you should know where the weak points why do you think I

48:42.860 --> 48:47.340
brought this up because there were some weak points that kind of kept me out you're saying that I didn't sleep well

48:47.740 --> 48:52.620
It's only one of few things that kept me out. Where are they what?

48:53.340 --> 48:55.340
Where are they don't listen to the whole up?

48:55.340 --> 48:57.500
It's so out of time. This is the worst

48:57.500 --> 48:59.740
We have forty five like he's golden child

49:00.300 --> 49:06.540
On one twenty twenty two and oh my god, you're over the hill. What have you had?

49:06.540 --> 49:09.260
So we're all over 22 talentless hacks

49:10.140 --> 49:15.020
That's what both of you. I think we're all over talentless hacks the both of you. That's really funny

49:15.580 --> 49:18.940
Because I saw the Jake and we were NFTs episode and it's actually

49:20.060 --> 49:24.060
Not pleasing to the ears and I really that's the that's

49:24.540 --> 49:29.340
Here's my first note. You don't know when to insert yourself and then you don't know when to not insert yourself

49:29.340 --> 49:36.220
You don't I mean like it's exactly what Johnny was talking about with self editing knowing when to chime in and when to sort of not

49:39.020 --> 49:41.020
Yeah

49:42.380 --> 49:44.380
Two minutes is up we have to do plugs

49:45.500 --> 49:46.700
Right

49:46.700 --> 49:49.740
So you just wanted to play it say that your bits were funny

49:50.540 --> 49:55.820
Not even a little bit so it was like the first 30 seconds which was Jeff insulting you guys

49:56.380 --> 49:58.380
Yeah, so

49:58.380 --> 50:00.380
Yeah, kind of mad on the way

50:04.620 --> 50:12.220

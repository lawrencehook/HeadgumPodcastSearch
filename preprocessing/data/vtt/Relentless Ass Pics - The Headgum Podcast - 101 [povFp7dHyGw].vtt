00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Great.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Is there a song to play with?

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Thanks to just vibe. Nice to just vibe.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
It's wonderful.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Yeah.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Lubricate your spine.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Yeah.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Episode 101.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Wow.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Woo!

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
We aren't supposed to be doing this.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
I don't have express written permission from the network.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
In fact, I was let go.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Um, so...

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Perfect.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
That's why I thought it'd be fun to just have...

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Sessely and Lucian.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
My two good friends.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
She's trying to build me back up.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
And to do this under the table.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
If you're anything about us, that's what our vibe is.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Is under the table.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Yeah.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
And you can use this for cloud any time.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Yeah.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Yeah.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Um...

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
You guys are very funny, LA-based comedians.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Sessely, some head-gum fans might know you from Jeffrey the dumbass.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Okay.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Uh, and review review.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Um...

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
This is a very special day though, because it's Lucy Belize.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Uh, debut-e.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
It is.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
My debut-e.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Yeah.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Um, do you guys want to plug your stuff up top,

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
so people can know where to find you?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Absolutely.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Especially taking away.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Okay.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Thrilled to plug.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Always a quick little butt plug.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Um, I...

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
You can catch me on Instagram and TikTok at Sessely Bro.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Um, and I have a...

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
It's a show at the friend called The Bro Show.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Um, every Wednesday at APM.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Jeffrey has been on it.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
He's so funny.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Um, and...

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Oh, we do a show called Teddy Committee.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Both of our sisters birthday.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Gemini season?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
So, come to that.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Safe-fried.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Safe-fried.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Santa.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
My name.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
My name is Lucy Bleahar.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
Uh, I am an actor, writer, and comedian based in Los Angeles.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I'm 5 foot 10 and a half.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Good.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Um, I do Teddy Committee with Cecilie.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
June 2nd.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
As you heard, I'm just going to repeat it for those of you who are not active listening.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Um, I also do social media at Lucy Bleah.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
The LE.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
You're sort of bleeding up on TikTok.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
I'm bleeding out on TikTok.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
I'm bleeding out.

02:52.000 --> 03:01.000
Um, you can catch me on, um, a bunch of different, like, web shows that I do with this production company called Pollution.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
One of them is Conspiracy Central, where I relay misinformation on Facebook.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Uh, video.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
And you're an alt-right talking head.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
I've been getting some proposals from, like, middle-aged men who are like,

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
I love what you're, like, you're telling the truth about the one-world government and you're so beautiful.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
And I'm, like, this is a simply a paycheck for me.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
But thank you.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Lucy, line them up.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Take them out.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I also want to say I'm also an actor and a writer and comedian.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm sorry.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
I didn't say what I do.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
It sounded like, okay, don't cut that out.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I just, I just thought, you should know.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Um, are you guys going to bring back Sunday school?

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
We both been booked and blessed.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
God bless.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
It's just been a busy task.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
That.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
So that was your guys' Teddy Committee podcast.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
The version of the live show that they do.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
And I'll sit and I did an episode of that.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
That's one of the most fun podcasts I've ever guessed it on.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
We had a great time.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Our last episode with Cat Cohen before her special.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
She's wonderful.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Jeffrey, we had so much fun with you.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
We were all going over for that episode.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
So hungover.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Oh, yeah.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Where were we the night before?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
We're real together.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
We were all in Hollywood Hills.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
We were at a party in Hollywood Hills.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
We were at that exclusive party.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
So exclusive.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
But you can find those episodes in Spotify and iTunes.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
We have.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
There's a lovely backlog.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Um.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
But yeah, we'll be to answer your cue.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
We'll be coming back as soon as one of us gets famous enough for us to actually make money off of it.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Exactly.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Yeah, that's the key.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
That's the key.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
That's the key.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
That's a major killer.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Don't do recorded radio unless it makes cash.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Because it's really, yeah.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
It's more work than you would expect.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
It is actually a more work than you'd expect.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
But let's.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Let's start this show.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Everybody.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Everybody.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Please.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Just.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Just.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Just.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Please.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Just.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Let's get it started.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Ha.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Oh.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Monday.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
May second.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
We've got a lot to get to actually.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Um.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
segments galore.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Let's start it off with everybody's.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Bond of the week.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
Every week until the next James Bond is cast.

05:17.000 --> 05:25.000
We're lobbying up our picks for casting to sort of wax about who could be the next 007.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
007.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
I'm going to call it right now.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Mr. Beans.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
Mr. Beans or Mr. Bean.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Mr. Bean.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Mr. Beans is.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Mr. Beans.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
So the same last name.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
But slightly different.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
That's okay.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
That's right.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
They're cousins.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
But it's your marriage.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Okay.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Yeah.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Mr. Bean.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
Someone with the last name beans buried into the bean family.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Yeah.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
There's the beans and then there's the bean.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
You're talking about I think the lowest probability.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I believe in love.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Sorry.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Love is love.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Even if you know last name.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yeah.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
My vote.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
I think it's going to have to be Harry Styles because we see him cracking into the movie franchise.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Okay.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
The movie franchise.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
What am I talking about?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
What's that?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Don't worry.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
That preview.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I just sent you where you don't worry.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Gaslighting.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
He's a gaslighting.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
He could go.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Gaslight me any day.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
I mean.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Yeah.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
You know we're with a train.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Harry.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
He could run me over with the train that he is conducting.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Oh.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Oh.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Yeah.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
My vote.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Harry Styles.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
I think Rowan Atkinson obviously could play a very convincing Mr. Bond.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Uh-huh.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Mr. Bond.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Yeah.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
You're I think he could be a good Bond villain.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Oh, yeah.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I think he could be a good Bond villain.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Oh, yeah.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
You have the layer.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Uh-huh.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
And you have the layers.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
More layers.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Yeah.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
I would love.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Okay.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Actually.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Let's talk about this for a second.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
It's my dream to just like only play villains.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Yeah.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Of course.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Well, yeah.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
You are one.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
I do feel like you're the.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Yes.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
I feel like you're rising.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Sessily's like evil twin.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Wow.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
And as you know,

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Sessily's a griffendor.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
I'm a slithering.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Of course.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
You Jeff.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
I'm a.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
I'm a hoffle puff.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
I think you're.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I think so too.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I think you're a hoffle puff.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
But you.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Wow.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
I think.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Okay.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
If you are the hoffle puff.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I like bullied Harry.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
And was like, we hate you.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
I think your both came for grounds.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Keep.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
This is not how I wanted the show to go.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Your filters cast like it's like stuck on the way.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Like Mrs. Wiggins.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
What's her name?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
You're starting off with a lot of drama.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Mrs. Wiggins.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Mrs.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Oh my god.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
What was her name?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Mrs. Norris.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Norris.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Yes.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
You know, sometimes I feel bad when I have my real friends on this show.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Because I'm such a dick on this show.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
But you just said, I'd be, what is it?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
The groundskeeper, Mr. Filch.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah, Mr. Filch.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
So it's no holds barred now.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Here we go.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
My bundle week is John F. Lungren.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Oh.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
He's the CEO of Quicksett.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Nope.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Don't know what that is.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
It's the key company.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
You don't know about Quicksett?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
No.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
The key company.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
No.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
My key is for door.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
It's not no bad keys.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
You must not know about keys.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
They're better than keyless entry doors.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Keys have the power to solve all wars.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
They way, you must not know about keys.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
You must not know about keys.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
You can get them cut at any home depot.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
So don't you ever for a second get to think in.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
They're here replaceable.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Wow.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Yeah.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Is that your sponsor?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
What's that?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Is that your sponsor for the day?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I wish.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Quicksett.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
No.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Quicksett.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
I think John F.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Could be a good bond.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
John F. Lungren.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Do you want to see this guy?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
John F. Lungren.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Oh.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I've already chosen to forget yours.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
John F. Lungren.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
My thing with hairy styles is that he's too recognizable.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
You need somebody who, you know,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
nobody knows like John F. Lungren.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Oh.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Look at the chest of the background for him.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Yeah.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
This isn't being like, I think I should try something different this year.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Honestly, he has a genuine smile.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I think this is actually happy guy.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Oh.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Yeah.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
But his eyes are saying.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Not a lot.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
That's all I'm going to say.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
The eyes are giving me a lot of.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
But who's for a villain?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Yeah.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
No.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Well, no, he's going to be James.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
He's going to be the bond.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Oh.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Okay.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
That's bold casting on your heart.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
But let's give him a chance.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Let's give him a chance.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I think casting would like to have a conversation about John F. Lungren.

09:58.000 --> 09:58.500
Sure.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.500
I want to see my unknown faces.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.500
Yeah.

10:02.500 --> 10:03.500
TV.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.500
Get that man.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.500
A chance.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.500
Give this white man a chance.

10:06.500 --> 10:10.500
That's what I've been saying on all my web shows is like,

10:10.500 --> 10:12.500
Where are the men?

10:12.500 --> 10:13.500
Where are they?

10:13.500 --> 10:15.500
That white man a chance.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.500
Give him a chance.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.500
He's been through enough.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.500
I just realized that my microphone wasn't connected.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.500
You haven't been hearing any of these sound effects.

10:23.500 --> 10:24.500
No.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.500
That's why we've been wondering why you were dancing to nothing.

10:27.500 --> 10:28.500
But we were going.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.500
No, I mean, did any of us say anything?

10:30.500 --> 10:31.500
No.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.500
You didn't hear.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.500
So you didn't hear the intro song.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.500
You didn't hear any of the major killers.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.500
I love that song.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.500
I mean, I knew the reference, but didn't hear it playing.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.500
No.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.500
That's deeply uncomfortable for me.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.500
You should know how healthy you are that Lucy and I both had.

10:47.500 --> 10:48.500
We were like.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.500
We were like.

10:49.500 --> 10:50.500
We were like.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.500
Yeah.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.500
Okay.

10:52.500 --> 10:53.500
He's doing his little.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.500
Let me do it.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.500
Well, let's get into some news of the day.

10:56.500 --> 11:00.500
So President Obama last week has called for more scrutiny of tech giants.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.500
All right.

11:01.500 --> 11:04.500
He's quoted as saying tech companies need to be more transparent about how they operate.

11:04.500 --> 11:05.500
All right.

11:05.500 --> 11:06.500
This is that a speech.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.500
What'd you say?

11:07.500 --> 11:08.500
I said, okay.

11:08.500 --> 11:09.500
Oh.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.500
Let me finish.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.500
This is that a speech at Stanford University.

11:13.500 --> 11:17.500
And he said so much of the conversation around just information is focused on what people post.

11:17.500 --> 11:22.500
The bigger issue is what content these platforms promote.

11:22.500 --> 11:23.500
Let's talk about it.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.500
What do you guys think of what's that?

11:25.500 --> 11:27.500
I was just saying an agreeable.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.500
Hmm.

11:28.500 --> 11:29.500
Okay.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.500
I was like.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.500
Let me finish.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.500
Yeah.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.500
Let me finish.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.500
Um.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.500
Oh.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.500
Oh.

11:37.500 --> 11:46.500
What do you think tech companies roles are with regards to free speech, hate speech.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.500
And far right this information.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.500
Let's start with Lucy.

11:51.500 --> 11:52.500
Whoa.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.500
Okay.

11:53.500 --> 11:57.500
This is where things get a little bit muggy as we would say in Pittsburgh.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.500
That means humid.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.500
That means swampy.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.500
That means a little bit confusing.

12:01.500 --> 12:02.500
You're disoriented.

12:02.500 --> 12:07.500
Because if you think about free speech, it's like, yeah, anyone can say any old thing.

12:07.500 --> 12:12.500
But then when we're talking about misinformation, look, that's what got Trump elected.

12:12.500 --> 12:13.500
Sure.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.500
Same thing with hate speech.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.500
It's like technically, yeah, that's free speech.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.500
But do we allow it?

12:19.500 --> 12:22.500
So are you asking me should tech companies play a role in censorship?

12:22.500 --> 12:25.500
Of hate speech and alt-right misinformation?

12:25.500 --> 12:26.500
Yeah.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.500
Yes.

12:27.500 --> 12:33.500
But then we're getting into like the amendments.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.500
However.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.500
Yeah.

12:35.500 --> 12:40.500
I do think that the amendments are called amendments because they're amendable.

12:40.500 --> 12:44.500
And why are we still referring to the Constitution in today's age?

12:44.500 --> 12:47.500
Like what people are like, the Constitution says.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.500
Thank you.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.500
Thank you.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.500
Okay.

12:53.500 --> 12:54.500
Thank you.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.500
Thank you.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.500
I thought I was shot.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.500
I always think I'm being shot.

12:59.500 --> 13:03.500
I mean, okay, here's, here's my one argument against the, I mean, not my one argument.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.500
I guess the Constitution.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.500
Because everything else is like sound.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.500
Sure.

13:07.500 --> 13:11.500
But okay, the right to bear arms when that was given everyone had, like, muskets.

13:11.500 --> 13:15.500
They didn't have, like, blocks and AK-47s.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.500
Yeah.

13:16.500 --> 13:20.500
So, like, we should amend it as the times they are a change in.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.500
Yeah, that's really good.

13:21.500 --> 13:27.500
So, that was my very Libra approach to saying, like, I don't know.

13:27.500 --> 13:31.500
My thing is that hate speech isn't free speech because there's a price to pay.

13:31.500 --> 13:32.500
Yep.

13:32.500 --> 13:35.500
What's that?

13:35.500 --> 13:38.500
That, yep, was locked and loaded no matter what I said.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.500
Yep.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.500
Color out.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.500
Anyway, sadly.

13:43.500 --> 13:44.500
Thoughts on this.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.500
I think let's be honest.

13:47.500 --> 13:51.500
People are weak and they're just, they're, like, they're not calling it.

13:51.500 --> 13:52.500
Like, oh.

13:52.500 --> 13:57.500
I'm sorry, sorry, I hope we're sound.

13:57.500 --> 14:02.500
Okay, you're in.

14:02.500 --> 14:11.500
Sorry, my hair got swept all the way back.

14:11.500 --> 14:12.500
I lost it.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.500
And both now.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.500
And then Lucy, you coming with the GI Gen joke.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.500
Yeah, here we go.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.500
Which is, I think, that's free speech.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.500
Okay.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.500
That's free speech.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.500
Here's my thought.

14:26.500 --> 14:27.500
Here's what I'm going to say.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.500
Here's the thing.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.500
We all know that hate speech should not be allowed.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.500
Like, the whole nuance of, like, oh, the amendments, all that, like, let's be honest.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.500
We know what is good and what is bad.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.500
What is bad is hate speech.

14:36.500 --> 14:40.500
So, just fucking call it out and say no more.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.500
And easy.

14:41.500 --> 14:42.500
Done.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.500
But the thing is, is there people want to make money.

14:44.500 --> 14:48.980
So they're like, oh, well, you know, we got to bring up the constitution and everyone's

14:48.980 --> 14:50.980
like, free speech and all that.

14:50.980 --> 14:54.740
And it's like, at the end of the day, we all know that these people are evil and bad

14:54.740 --> 15:00.980
and are saying bad things that are causing harm got Trump elected is like straight up, like,

15:00.980 --> 15:01.980
just propaganda.

15:01.980 --> 15:04.700
Like, how, everyone's like, how do World War II happen?

15:04.700 --> 15:06.460
This is how it happened.

15:06.460 --> 15:07.460
Yeah.

15:07.460 --> 15:08.460
Yeah.

15:08.460 --> 15:09.460
Yeah.

15:09.460 --> 15:10.460
That's how I feel.

15:10.460 --> 15:18.460
I'm like, I mean, everyone, we can talk about it all day, but at the end, we know it's evil and bad.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.460
And it should be stopped, but they're not going to do it.

15:20.460 --> 15:25.460
Because they're like, oh, they have people who are using their platforms, who are, you know,

15:25.460 --> 15:26.460
investing in it.

15:26.460 --> 15:27.460
So that's what's going to happen.

15:27.460 --> 15:32.460
I, this, these were very real answers that I agree with everything, both of you guys just said.

15:32.460 --> 15:36.740
If a mirror was here, which, thank God, he isn't because again, I don't even know if this

15:36.740 --> 15:39.460
episode's going to go live because I was fired last week.

15:39.460 --> 15:44.460
He wouldn't have let you guys treat that with any gravity.

15:44.460 --> 15:46.740
So I'm really, I'm really enjoying this.

15:46.740 --> 15:51.460
Let's move on to something a little more lighthearted, but not unrelated dating an L.A.

15:51.460 --> 15:52.460
Yeah.

15:52.460 --> 15:53.460
I'm just a man.

15:53.460 --> 15:55.460
That's not dating a L.A.

15:55.460 --> 15:56.460
You guys on the apps.

15:56.460 --> 15:59.460
Are you guys, are you guys on field?

15:59.460 --> 16:00.460
Field.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.460
Okay.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.460
We did learn about this through Georgia set.

16:03.460 --> 16:06.460
So it field is the, I was the friend that got him on that.

16:06.460 --> 16:07.460
You were the friend.

16:07.460 --> 16:08.460
Did you try the one field?

16:08.460 --> 16:10.460
I was on field.

16:10.460 --> 16:11.460
What's your king?

16:11.460 --> 16:13.460
I'm not saying.

16:13.460 --> 16:16.460
I was trying to get you to talk.

16:16.460 --> 16:17.460
What's your king?

16:17.460 --> 16:18.460
What's your king?

16:18.460 --> 16:19.460
What's your king?

16:19.460 --> 16:20.460
What's your one king?

16:20.460 --> 16:22.460
His king is your last one.

16:22.460 --> 16:25.460
His last sound effects over women's voices.

16:25.460 --> 16:26.460
Yeah.

16:27.460 --> 16:28.460
I love sound effects.

16:28.460 --> 16:29.460
With airplanes.

16:29.460 --> 16:30.460
With airplanes.

16:30.460 --> 16:31.460
Sound effect.

16:31.460 --> 16:32.460
Good boy.

16:32.460 --> 16:33.460
Um.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.460
Anyway.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.460
You guys never are on field.

16:36.460 --> 16:38.460
You guys are about dating people, right?

16:38.460 --> 16:39.460
Yes.

16:39.460 --> 16:40.460
Yeah.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.460
I'm casually friends with my boyfriend.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.460
It's what?

16:43.460 --> 16:44.460
What's that?

16:44.460 --> 16:45.460
Nothing.

16:45.460 --> 16:46.460
I love him.

16:46.460 --> 16:47.460
We're together.

16:47.460 --> 16:48.460
Yeah.

16:48.460 --> 16:50.460
But see me and my boyfriend met on hinge.

16:50.460 --> 16:53.460
Which he was like, let's not tell people we met on hinge.

16:53.460 --> 16:55.460
But I was like, what were we supposed to do?

16:55.460 --> 16:56.460
You met on fringe.

16:56.460 --> 16:57.460
No.

16:57.460 --> 16:58.460
No.

16:58.460 --> 16:59.460
Trinch.

16:59.460 --> 17:00.460
Um.

17:00.460 --> 17:01.460
What's fringe?

17:01.460 --> 17:05.460
It's like, it's the app that's meant to be deleted for couples.

17:05.460 --> 17:07.460
Oh, fringe.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.460
Hmm.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.460
I meant to say, throuples.

17:10.460 --> 17:11.460
Um.

17:11.460 --> 17:12.460
You met on hinge.

17:12.460 --> 17:13.460
I didn't know.

17:13.460 --> 17:16.460
I love both of your boyfriend's, but specifically Max.

17:16.460 --> 17:17.460
Hey, Max.

17:17.460 --> 17:18.460
Sorry.

17:18.460 --> 17:22.460
We see you two saying, any time we go out, any time we go out.

17:22.460 --> 17:23.460
Yeah.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.460
Jack goes, hey, says, where's Max?

17:25.460 --> 17:26.460
Right away.

17:26.460 --> 17:31.460
Not even no question of like, how are you doing to see you right away?

17:31.460 --> 17:33.460
Couldn't get it out quick enough.

17:33.460 --> 17:35.460
So what's your beef with Eli?

17:35.460 --> 17:36.460
Why don't you love me?

17:36.460 --> 17:37.460
I just don't know what you love Max.

17:37.460 --> 17:38.460
Oh.

17:38.460 --> 17:39.460
Neither do I.

17:39.460 --> 17:40.460
He's elusive.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.460
No.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.460
I thought.

17:42.460 --> 17:43.460
Neither do I.

17:43.460 --> 17:46.460
He's like serving some Lucius mouthway energy.

17:46.460 --> 17:47.460
Oh, yeah.

17:47.460 --> 17:48.460
Yeah.

17:48.460 --> 17:50.460
But then sometimes he's super goofy.

17:51.460 --> 17:52.460
Oh, he's such a goofy.

17:52.460 --> 17:53.460
He's such a sweetheart.

17:53.460 --> 17:56.460
But he is like the Mr. Darcy of our lives.

17:56.460 --> 17:57.460
Yeah.

17:57.460 --> 17:58.460
Trouided in mystery.

17:58.460 --> 17:59.460
Sure.

17:59.460 --> 18:00.460
Me and Mr. Bangley over here.

18:00.460 --> 18:01.460
Fucking.

18:01.460 --> 18:02.460
Yeah.

18:02.460 --> 18:03.460
You are with Mr. Bangley.

18:03.460 --> 18:05.460
I think Jeff is kind of a Mr. Bangley, too.

18:05.460 --> 18:06.460
Or maybe I'm Mr. Wickham.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.460
Oh, you're Mr. Wickham.

18:08.460 --> 18:09.460
That's like, Mary.

18:09.460 --> 18:10.460
Yeah.

18:10.460 --> 18:12.460
I don't even have Mr. Rick over.

18:12.460 --> 18:14.460
I remember when her friends like, no, it's cool.

18:14.460 --> 18:15.460
He has a house.

18:15.460 --> 18:17.460
He's a homeowner.

18:17.460 --> 18:19.460
He's a homeowner.

18:19.460 --> 18:20.460
He's 27.

18:20.460 --> 18:21.460
I'm not 27.

18:21.460 --> 18:22.460
I'm 25.

18:22.460 --> 18:23.460
I'm 27.

18:23.460 --> 18:24.460
I'm 27.

18:24.460 --> 18:25.460
I'm 27.

18:25.460 --> 18:26.460
I'm 27.

18:26.460 --> 18:27.460
I'm 27.

18:27.460 --> 18:28.460
I'm 27.

18:28.460 --> 18:29.460
Yeah.

18:29.460 --> 18:31.460
Mr. Wickham.

18:31.460 --> 18:32.460
You know, Kira could sing?

18:32.460 --> 18:33.460
No.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.460
Really?

18:34.460 --> 18:35.460
Where could we listen to her sing?

18:35.460 --> 18:36.460
Yeah.

18:36.460 --> 18:38.460
She was in, well, begin again.

18:38.460 --> 18:40.460
Never seen that.

18:40.460 --> 18:41.460
Really?

18:41.460 --> 18:43.460
Do you mean a tone man?

18:43.460 --> 18:44.460
Oh, a tone man.

18:44.460 --> 18:46.460
A tone man.

18:46.460 --> 18:47.460
Let's not forget young Sarsha Ron and that movie.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.460
Sarsha's so young.

18:48.460 --> 18:52.460
Yes, my pink was my pink is the library scene from that movie.

18:52.460 --> 18:57.460
You're not quite sure if I can't remember, I mean, let's be honest, I can't remember,

18:57.460 --> 19:00.460
but it wasn't clear to me if she was entered or not in the library.

19:00.460 --> 19:02.460
She was entered.

19:02.460 --> 19:03.460
She was entered.

19:03.460 --> 19:05.460
There's penetration for sure.

19:05.460 --> 19:07.460
Dating an L.A.

19:07.460 --> 19:09.460
Let's go through this.

19:09.460 --> 19:13.460
Have you guys ever had your version of the library scene from a tone,

19:13.460 --> 19:16.460
and also what's the, what are the spots?

19:16.460 --> 19:17.460
Yes, I have.

19:17.460 --> 19:18.460
What are the spots?

19:18.460 --> 19:19.460
I have as well.

19:19.460 --> 19:22.460
Although I've never seen a tone, but I know what you're talking about.

19:22.460 --> 19:25.460
Yeah, I actual library, USC library, if I don't forever.

19:25.460 --> 19:30.460
Oh my God, that's the stacks, not even like the fancy library.

19:30.460 --> 19:33.460
No, I went, of course, well, there's people everywhere in the fancy library.

19:33.460 --> 19:35.460
You have to go down, ground.

19:35.460 --> 19:41.460
Down, ground, ground, ground, ground, ground, ground, ground, ground, ground.

19:41.460 --> 19:48.460
Sounds like a horrible, like, you know, roll tied style sports slogan for a college that,

19:48.460 --> 19:49.460
yep.

19:49.460 --> 19:50.460
Don't ruin this for us.

19:50.460 --> 19:53.460
Mount down this one here.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.460
Daddy, chill.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.460
Daddy, chill.

19:57.460 --> 20:03.460
Lucy, your response to Pablo Pascal's viral video made me laugh out loud.

20:03.460 --> 20:07.460
I mean, if any man were to just casually be like, I'm your daddy.

20:07.460 --> 20:09.460
I would just feel like.

20:10.460 --> 20:13.460
I have an epileptic seizure.

20:13.460 --> 20:19.460
But like, did you read that video, like, my response as a good response, as a positive response?

20:19.460 --> 20:20.460
Yeah.

20:20.460 --> 20:21.460
Okay, good.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.460
Because I think some people were like, yeah, he's disgusting.

20:23.460 --> 20:26.460
But I was like, no, no, this is me, absolutely giving myself a verse to him.

20:26.460 --> 20:27.460
You're floored.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.460
You're pelvic floor.

20:28.460 --> 20:29.460
I was pelvic floor.

20:29.460 --> 20:30.460
I was pelvic floor.

20:30.460 --> 20:31.460
And I was.

20:31.460 --> 20:32.460
You're killer.

20:32.460 --> 20:35.460
Find what brings you.

20:35.460 --> 20:38.460
Honestly, sexual joy.

20:38.460 --> 20:40.460
And follow the path.

20:40.460 --> 20:41.460
Yeah.

20:41.460 --> 20:42.460
That's all we have these days.

20:42.460 --> 20:44.460
Follow the yellow bricked up road.

20:44.460 --> 20:45.460
Hey.

20:45.460 --> 20:47.460
That's what they say.

20:47.460 --> 20:48.460
Which more thief.

20:48.460 --> 20:50.460
How's dating and elephant for you, Jeff?

20:50.460 --> 20:52.460
Dating and it's served me well.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.460
It's, it's, what's that?

20:54.460 --> 20:56.460
That's amazing.

20:56.460 --> 20:58.460
There's a blister of ideas.

20:58.460 --> 21:00.460
So we get rid of that.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.460
Why did I ask?

21:02.460 --> 21:03.460
Oh, no.

21:03.460 --> 21:04.460
Just like, yeah.

21:04.460 --> 21:05.460
Oh, hey, I'm getting pussy.

21:05.460 --> 21:06.460
Yeah.

21:07.460 --> 21:08.460
I don't know what else to say.

21:08.460 --> 21:10.460
I spread four things.

21:10.460 --> 21:11.460
Oh.

21:11.460 --> 21:12.460
Joy.

21:12.460 --> 21:15.460
Truth, libel and legs.

21:15.460 --> 21:16.460
Oh, God.

21:16.460 --> 21:17.460
God.

21:17.460 --> 21:18.460
I'm glad you're fired.

21:18.460 --> 21:20.460
This is no longer a safe place.

21:20.460 --> 21:22.460
I'm not a safe place for you anymore.

21:22.460 --> 21:23.460
Well, let's take a break.

21:23.460 --> 21:25.460
Because I can already feel the energy shifting.

21:25.460 --> 21:27.460
I want to kind of bring us back.

21:27.460 --> 21:28.460
Let's thank some sponsors.

21:28.460 --> 21:29.460
We'll be right back.

21:30.460 --> 21:34.460
Oh, yeah.

21:34.460 --> 21:40.460
Guys, everybody's talking about fake spring and how difficult it is to dress around this time.

21:40.460 --> 21:41.460
But that's because it is.

21:41.460 --> 21:44.460
You know, it can be so difficult to find the right outfit in the spring.

21:44.460 --> 21:47.460
When every day is different, the weather can change at the drop of the hat.

21:47.460 --> 21:50.460
Luckily, Ferry makes it way easier.

21:50.460 --> 21:53.460
They make the perfect clothes for all seasons.

21:53.460 --> 21:58.460
Ferry is a family run brand, making high quality, timeless clothing with modern design.

21:58.460 --> 22:00.460
And functionality.

22:00.460 --> 22:02.460
It's that kind of effortless style that you want.

22:02.460 --> 22:06.460
Every time you go digging your closet, that's set, that shirt, that dress.

22:06.460 --> 22:09.460
That feels like you've had it for years.

22:09.460 --> 22:12.460
Maybe it's in a gorgeous print and maybe it looks vintage.

22:12.460 --> 22:16.460
But it fits so well that it feels like it was just made yesterday for you.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.460
Well, that's fairity.

22:18.460 --> 22:23.460
I'm really serious, guys, that I'm excited about this sponsorship.

22:23.460 --> 22:27.460
It kind of came out of nowhere, but I have been wearing Ferry clothes for.

22:28.460 --> 22:30.460
It sounds like a joke, but the better part of a decade.

22:30.460 --> 22:32.460
It's been like five years.

22:32.460 --> 22:34.460
And I don't have that many things from them.

22:34.460 --> 22:39.460
But you know, I wear them all the time and they've lasted the, the test of time.

22:39.460 --> 22:42.460
There's a lot of other clothing brands that, yeah, or maybe more affordable.

22:42.460 --> 22:46.460
But they end up having to buy multiple ones because they wear through.

22:46.460 --> 22:47.460
They wear out.

22:47.460 --> 22:49.460
They just start feeling nasty.

22:49.460 --> 22:53.460
Ferry, my fit clothes from Ferry feel as good as the day I got him.

22:53.460 --> 22:55.460
If not, better because they're high quality.

22:56.460 --> 23:01.460
And Ferry is so confident in the quality of their stuff that they have a lifetime guarantee of quality.

23:01.460 --> 23:05.460
They'll replace or fix your clothes forever no matter what.

23:05.460 --> 23:07.460
I mean, talk about making it easier to get dressed.

23:07.460 --> 23:11.460
I wouldn't even have to use it in over five years because it's just that good.

23:11.460 --> 23:15.460
But lifetime guarantee, maybe at your 10, I might send it into Ferry.

23:15.460 --> 23:19.460

Plus they come in a bunch of fun color options so you can find mom a color that suits your personality and style.

24:36.460 --> 24:39.460
With optimized gel tips for the perfect in-ear fit,

24:39.460 --> 24:43.460
these earbuds are so comfortable and they will not budge.

24:43.460 --> 24:44.460
All right, trust me.

24:44.460 --> 24:47.460
She will not have a hard time getting used to them.

24:47.460 --> 24:52.460
I mean, moms are sometimes the worst to change.

24:52.460 --> 24:54.460
But with Raycon, it's going to be easy.

24:54.460 --> 25:01.460
And for the mom on the go, Raycon's offer eight hours of playtime and a 32-hour battery life.

25:01.460 --> 25:02.460
Right?

25:02.460 --> 25:06.460
With their compact portable charging case.

25:06.460 --> 25:07.460
And their price just right.

25:07.460 --> 25:12.460
You get quality audio at half the price of other premium audio brands.

25:12.460 --> 25:17.460
And Raycon every day earbuds have over 49,000 five-star reviews.

25:17.460 --> 25:19.460
Perfectly fitting for a five-star mom.

25:19.460 --> 25:20.460
Right?

25:20.460 --> 25:21.460
Don't take my word for it.

25:21.460 --> 25:24.460
But I also love Raycon's.

25:24.460 --> 25:30.460
They've replaced the other wireless earbud that, you know, I'm sure we all know.

25:30.460 --> 25:34.460
Just the same audio quality, if not better, half the price.

25:34.460 --> 25:36.460
I lose those things all the time.

25:36.460 --> 25:40.460
And if you're going to replace them, Raycon is the way to go.

25:40.460 --> 25:42.460
Two for the price of fun in a way.

25:42.460 --> 25:45.460
So tell mom how much you love her and make sure she hears it.

25:45.460 --> 25:48.460
And crystal clear audio quality with Raycon.

25:48.460 --> 25:50.460
Go to buy Raycon.com slash what's that?

25:50.460 --> 25:52.460

25:52.460 --> 25:56.460
Again, that's buy Raycon.com slash what's that?

25:56.460 --> 25:59.460
Thanks Raycon.

25:59.460 --> 26:02.460
And we're back.

26:03.460 --> 26:05.460
Listen, I think we have all three of us.

26:05.460 --> 26:07.460
I think I've done things worthy of an apology.

26:07.460 --> 26:08.460
Right?

26:08.460 --> 26:09.460
Sure.

26:09.460 --> 26:10.460
Yeah.

26:10.460 --> 26:12.460
I'm apologizing all the time.

26:12.460 --> 26:15.460
But sometimes I feel like it gets lost.

26:15.460 --> 26:18.460
What an apology is actually supposed to be.

26:18.460 --> 26:22.460
I recently saw this article on fatherly.com.

26:22.460 --> 26:23.460
Great.

26:23.460 --> 26:25.460
Fuck.

26:25.460 --> 26:26.460
How do apologize?

26:26.460 --> 26:28.460
The six steps of the perfect apology.

26:28.460 --> 26:32.460
So what I thought we could do is we could all talk about something that we feel like we

26:32.460 --> 26:35.460
in the near future need to apologize for.

26:35.460 --> 26:40.460
And then craft on air, the perfect apology according to fatherly.com.

26:40.460 --> 26:41.460
I love that.

26:41.460 --> 26:44.460
This picture is from Pinterest.

26:44.460 --> 26:45.460
Just crying.

26:45.460 --> 26:46.460
Crying.

26:46.460 --> 26:48.460
Crying woman.

26:48.460 --> 26:49.460
She's hurt.

26:49.460 --> 26:50.460
She's been hurt by her husband.

26:50.460 --> 26:51.460
Love me.

26:51.460 --> 26:53.460
Never having to say you're sorry.

26:53.460 --> 26:54.460
Is there.

26:54.460 --> 26:56.460
Disappointed or worthless.

26:57.460 --> 26:58.460
Oh.

26:58.460 --> 27:00.460
I want to write for fatherly.com.

27:00.460 --> 27:01.460
How do you like it?

27:01.460 --> 27:02.460
Just fatherly.

27:02.460 --> 27:04.460
I think we've had to pay me parenting play.

27:04.460 --> 27:05.460
Love and money gear.

27:05.460 --> 27:06.460
Health and science.

27:06.460 --> 27:08.460
I can't talk about it.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.460
Gear.

27:09.460 --> 27:10.460
Gear.

27:10.460 --> 27:11.460
Wait.

27:11.460 --> 27:14.460
How about the article to the side that says my husband is a good man.

27:14.460 --> 27:17.460
But at home he acts like a clueless intern.

27:17.460 --> 27:18.460
Oh.

27:18.460 --> 27:19.460
No.

27:19.460 --> 27:20.460
Divorce him.

27:20.460 --> 27:25.460
I truly fear that I'm going to become dumb or as I become a dad.

27:25.460 --> 27:26.460
Oh.

27:26.460 --> 27:27.460
Yeah.

27:27.460 --> 27:28.460
Absolutely.

27:28.460 --> 27:29.460
That's what happens.

27:29.460 --> 27:30.460
Yeah.

27:30.460 --> 27:32.460
Because like all of your life force energy goes into like growing these little kids.

27:32.460 --> 27:38.460
My liquefied brain is leaking out of my nipples.

27:38.460 --> 27:40.460
Chaos.

27:40.460 --> 27:43.460
I love this publication.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.460
Here we go.

27:45.460 --> 27:48.460
Step one is expression of regret.

27:48.460 --> 27:53.460
Step two is explanation of what went wrong.

27:53.460 --> 27:59.460
Three is acknowledgement of responsibility.

27:59.460 --> 28:00.460
Four.

28:00.460 --> 28:03.460
Decoration of repentance.

28:03.460 --> 28:04.460
Four.

28:04.460 --> 28:05.460
Five offer of repair.

28:05.460 --> 28:07.460
Six request for forgiveness.

28:07.460 --> 28:10.460
So let's start with you.

28:10.460 --> 28:11.460
Okay.

28:11.460 --> 28:13.460
You feel like you need to apologize for.

28:13.460 --> 28:16.460
In the next let's say two weeks.

28:16.460 --> 28:21.460
I really want to genuinely apologize for interrupting you Jeffrey on this podcast.

28:21.460 --> 28:25.460
No, and I appreciate that.

28:25.460 --> 28:26.460
So let's go.

28:26.460 --> 28:27.460
Sure.

28:27.460 --> 28:28.460
Yeah.

28:28.460 --> 28:29.460
I want to express and again.

28:29.460 --> 28:30.460
I just did it just now.

28:30.460 --> 28:34.460
So I want to express my deep regret for interrupting you.

28:34.460 --> 28:35.460
This is your platform.

28:35.460 --> 28:39.460
You deserve to be heard seen and understood.

28:39.460 --> 28:44.460
And it was selfish of me to step over your words.

28:44.460 --> 28:48.460
Just because I could not contain my hysteria and my emotions.

28:49.460 --> 28:51.460
I am a woman.

28:51.460 --> 28:56.460
So it's hard for me to keep my shit in check.

28:56.460 --> 28:59.460
I'm probably going to get my period soon.

28:59.460 --> 29:01.460
So that also is something that went wrong.

29:01.460 --> 29:03.460
And I apologize for that.

29:03.460 --> 29:11.460
And I acknowledge my responsibility in remaining quiet the next time you have something to say until you're fully finished with your thought.

29:11.460 --> 29:16.460
And I promise to not speak again until spoken to or invited to speak.

29:16.460 --> 29:19.460
And I'd like to declare my repentance.

29:19.460 --> 29:23.460
I will say 10 memories and two hour fathers.

29:23.460 --> 29:30.460
And I offer to pay for your next five car repair bills.

29:30.460 --> 29:32.460
That's my offer of repair.

29:32.460 --> 29:33.460
Yep.

29:33.460 --> 29:37.460
And at this time, I would love to humbly request your forgiveness for interrupting you.

29:37.460 --> 29:38.460
It will never happen again.

29:38.460 --> 29:40.460
I'm truly deeply sorry.

29:41.460 --> 29:43.460
And I appreciate it.

29:43.460 --> 29:46.460
I mean, I think everything that just said was good.

29:46.460 --> 29:48.460
I think it was fair.

29:48.460 --> 29:49.460
And I, yeah.

29:49.460 --> 29:52.460
And it didn't make me feel deeply uncomfortable.

29:52.460 --> 29:53.460
Yeah.

29:53.460 --> 29:54.460
Mm.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.460
It's Leslie.

29:56.460 --> 30:01.460
I would like to express regret for all the ass pictures.

30:01.460 --> 30:05.460
I'll be posting when I go to Palm Springs this week.

30:05.460 --> 30:07.460
I'm always in Palm Springs.

30:07.460 --> 30:08.460
I'm sorry.

30:09.460 --> 30:19.460
I'm, I'm sorry for posting too much of me and a new bathing suit I got, which goes right up the crack.

30:19.460 --> 30:22.460
There's no hiding the cheeks they can't be contained.

30:22.460 --> 30:25.460
And so that's what went wrong as I thought the bathing suit would handle it.

30:25.460 --> 30:27.460
The bathing suit cannot handle it.

30:27.460 --> 30:33.460
I don't think this is a good idea, but I feel like you should plug your Instagram now again.

30:33.460 --> 30:35.460
My Instagram is at Susslybro.

30:35.460 --> 30:37.460
If you want to see what went wrong.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.460
Because it went wrong.

30:39.460 --> 30:40.460
It went wrong.

30:40.460 --> 30:44.460
I posted too many pictures of my porn star level ass.

30:44.460 --> 30:47.460
And I take responsibility for what my ass does to people.

30:47.460 --> 30:49.460
I take responsibility.

30:49.460 --> 30:53.460
What's the craziest thing you've seen your ass do to somebody?

30:53.460 --> 30:58.460
Um, well, of course, I immediately went to when I was too young.

30:58.460 --> 31:01.460
And there was an older teacher that said something he should not have said.

31:01.460 --> 31:02.460
Let's go somewhere fun.

31:02.460 --> 31:03.460
Let's go somewhere fun.

31:03.460 --> 31:04.460
Let's go somewhere fun.

31:04.460 --> 31:10.460
And like, um, well, while this, like, someone said something or like,

31:10.460 --> 31:12.460
while this, like, someone did, like, what?

31:12.460 --> 31:13.460
What?

31:13.460 --> 31:18.460
I like to, like, while it is in something, like a caused a, a rocket, let's say.

31:18.460 --> 31:19.460
It caused a rocket.

31:19.460 --> 31:20.460
You took us caused a rocket.

31:20.460 --> 31:23.460
I took us quickly volunteer something that I witnessed when her took us

31:23.460 --> 31:24.460
caused a rocket.

31:24.460 --> 31:26.460
We had an eye with this and the eyes have it.

31:26.460 --> 31:27.460
Let's hear it.

31:27.460 --> 31:28.460
This was on my 27th birthday.

31:28.460 --> 31:29.460
We were at a cabin.

31:29.460 --> 31:31.460
I was dating someone at the time.

31:31.460 --> 31:34.460
And Sessley walked up the stairs in her bikini.

31:34.460 --> 31:37.460
And I saw my boyfriend's face melt off of his skull.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.460
And he had let out an exasperated sign.

31:39.460 --> 31:43.460
He was like, oh, he was like, oh, Sessley's body.

31:43.460 --> 31:45.460
And I was like, you're my boy.

31:45.460 --> 31:47.460
I was fucked up.

31:47.460 --> 31:49.460
I honestly was furious for that.

31:49.460 --> 31:50.460
Because I was like, this is it.

31:50.460 --> 31:51.460
I'll get in the hot tub.

31:51.460 --> 31:52.460
And of course, we all got in the hot tub.

31:52.460 --> 31:54.460
And remember what happened that hot tub Lucy?

31:54.460 --> 31:57.460
We took peppermint oils in the hot tub.

31:57.460 --> 31:59.460
And all of our skin burned.

31:59.460 --> 32:00.460
Yeah.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.460
Don't recommend it.

32:01.460 --> 32:05.460
Don't, you know, don't put essential oils in a hot tub.

32:05.460 --> 32:06.460
Okay.

32:06.460 --> 32:11.460
So I take responsibility for what my asked us to people.

32:11.460 --> 32:13.460
And my deckbook declaration of repentance.

32:13.460 --> 32:15.460
I mean, I will, I'll hide the cheeks.

32:15.460 --> 32:18.460
I'll do what I need to to make everyone else comfortable.

32:18.460 --> 32:22.460
Because as it's my responsibility to hide my body.

32:23.460 --> 32:26.460
You know, they, they don't know what they're doing when they see it.

32:26.460 --> 32:27.460
They should.

32:27.460 --> 32:29.460
Anyway, it's my fault.

32:29.460 --> 32:31.460
My author repair.

32:31.460 --> 32:35.460
I, I offer to, I don't know if you all just saw the movie.

32:35.460 --> 32:38.460
With a gal from normal people.

32:38.460 --> 32:42.460
It's like off brand raw that movie where she's like dating a cannibal.

32:42.460 --> 32:46.460
Anyway, I, in that movie, she gets her asked cut off and

32:46.460 --> 32:48.460
Carterized and he eats it.

32:48.460 --> 32:51.460
So that's, I guess that's the only thing I can do is to offer my ask

32:51.460 --> 32:55.460
and Carterize my bottom and my request.

32:55.460 --> 32:57.460
I request everyone's forgiveness.

32:57.460 --> 33:01.460
Please, please, it would really help me to be forgiven.

33:01.460 --> 33:06.460
So so far, we've silenced women and shamed them for what they were.

33:06.460 --> 33:08.460
Yeah, well, that's your platform, yeah.

33:08.460 --> 33:09.460
No.

33:09.460 --> 33:12.460
I mean, you have the American flag behind you.

33:12.460 --> 33:15.460
Yeah, this is a, this is a quilt.

33:15.460 --> 33:18.460
Yeah, I'm seeing it from like colonial like colonizing.

33:18.460 --> 33:20.460
Yeah, like Betsy Ross.

33:20.460 --> 33:22.460
Betsy Ross's original flag is behind you.

33:22.460 --> 33:24.460
Like you bought that quilt at Crocker barrel, right?

33:24.460 --> 33:25.460
Yeah.

33:25.460 --> 33:26.460
No.

33:26.460 --> 33:31.460
This is, this is the first time I've been genuinely challenged on this show.

33:31.460 --> 33:33.460
And I'm not going to have it.

33:33.460 --> 33:34.460
Okay.

33:34.460 --> 33:35.460
You know how you invite us?

33:35.460 --> 33:36.460
You know.

33:36.460 --> 33:39.460
Um, do you have to categorize your asker?

33:39.460 --> 33:41.460
Can you categorize your asker?

33:41.460 --> 33:42.460
What?

33:42.460 --> 33:43.460
Okay.

33:43.460 --> 33:44.460
Yeah.

33:44.460 --> 33:46.460
Basically the same thing.

33:46.460 --> 33:47.460
No.

33:48.460 --> 33:54.460
Um, I feel like I need to apologize for.

33:54.460 --> 33:57.460
Just, yeah, I went to New York for a couple months.

33:57.460 --> 33:59.460
It's just being gone for so long.

33:59.460 --> 34:01.460
I know that it, what's that?

34:01.460 --> 34:03.460
I said, yeah, you should apologize for that.

34:03.460 --> 34:06.460
I feel like people.

34:06.460 --> 34:08.460
I don't know.

34:08.460 --> 34:11.460
I just, there was like, I feel like I came back to a wreck.

34:11.460 --> 34:13.460
You know, emotional physical.

34:13.460 --> 34:16.460
I just, LA's changed and, you know,

34:16.460 --> 34:18.460
the first time I saw y'all.

34:18.460 --> 34:21.460
It was like, I can see that there's like a shadow behind your eyes

34:21.460 --> 34:23.460
because like the glint was gone.

34:23.460 --> 34:29.460
And so I want to express her grat for exploring another city.

34:29.460 --> 34:35.460
I want to explain that I didn't mean for it to be a personal front,

34:35.460 --> 34:39.460
really of any of my friends, including you guys.

34:39.460 --> 34:43.460

I think we should be drunk at the Wena Planta.

35:04.460 --> 35:06.460
I just went there.

35:06.460 --> 35:07.460
Okay.

35:07.460 --> 35:08.460
Then we'll wait a couple weeks.

35:08.460 --> 35:11.460
It's when you're craving to Wena.

35:12.460 --> 35:15.460

36:14.460 --> 36:20.460
Um, will have you ever played?

36:20.460 --> 36:21.460
Um.

36:21.460 --> 36:23.460
Um.

36:23.460 --> 36:24.460
Um.

36:24.460 --> 36:25.460
Um.

36:25.460 --> 36:28.460
Um.

36:28.460 --> 36:30.460
Um.

36:30.460 --> 36:32.460

Um.

36:37.460 --> 36:38.460
Um.

36:39.460 --> 36:43.460
It's the same rules as jeopardy with the twist.

36:43.460 --> 36:46.460
Uh, the twist is that it's for actual cash.

36:46.460 --> 36:51.460
So, um, every number you see on this board is money that you can make, uh,

36:51.460 --> 36:55.460
that I will genuinely Venmo you on this, uh, on the company card, uh, until, uh,

36:55.460 --> 36:57.460

36:57.460 --> 36:58.460
Um.

36:58.460 --> 36:59.460
Um.

36:59.460 --> 37:00.460

Oh, great.

37:17.460 --> 37:18.460
Um.

37:18.460 --> 37:19.460
Can we buzz in?

37:19.460 --> 37:22.460
Uh, just say, well, well,

37:22.460 --> 37:23.460
buzz.

37:23.460 --> 37:25.460
It's a jeopardy where it's like you control the board.

37:25.460 --> 37:26.460
You do it.

37:26.460 --> 37:28.460
And then if you can't answer it, it goes to the other person.

37:28.460 --> 37:29.460
Yes.

37:29.460 --> 37:30.460
Yes.

37:30.460 --> 37:31.460
But someone has to buzz first, I think.

37:31.460 --> 37:32.460
Okay.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.460
Um, well, let's start with Lucy because,

37:37.460 --> 37:39.460
I literally made a buzz sound.

37:39.460 --> 37:41.460
But no questions were asked yet.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.460
No question.

37:42.460 --> 37:43.460

38:15.460 --> 38:17.460

47:06.460 --> 47:08.460
But it's also like, you know, there's a cove.

47:08.460 --> 47:09.460
It's wet.

47:09.460 --> 47:11.460
It's like inside of a little eyelid.

And then it's all those slippery dolphins.

47:13.460 --> 47:14.460

47:23.460 --> 47:25.460
Grand Canyon's dry.

47:25.460 --> 47:28.460
And it's pretty like nationalism.

You're bringing nationalism into this.

47:30.460 --> 47:31.460
Right.

48:11.460 --> 48:12.460

48:39.460 --> 48:41.460
Do I need to send this back?

48:41.460 --> 48:45.460

48:45.460 --> 48:47.460
but I'm a man on my word.

48:47.460 --> 48:49.460

48:49.460 --> 48:53.460
Well, that's technically non-expense.

48:53.460 --> 48:57.460

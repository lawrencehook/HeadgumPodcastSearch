00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:16.000
Cat.

00:16.000 --> 00:25.000
Right, not even 20 seconds in and he's already plugging his breath out of the bird.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Woo!

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Christmas episode edition of the head-gum podcast we've got to go.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
We've got a stacked duo.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
We've got Miles Bons and Yoray.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
We've got Miles Bons and Yoray.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Double-cheeked up on Christmas Eve.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
And we've got Riley and Spot bringing up the rear end.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Cheers!

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Do we just sink our file or record it?

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
Okay.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
Um, you guys are bringing an energy that can only be described as okay.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Miles, it's fucking crazy, dude.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I got a wild energy.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
He's kind of normal.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Second part of the day that I'm recording today.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
I recorded one this morning with the tripod with the try guys.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
How was that?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
It was good.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Did Ned return or...

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Yeah, he's back.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
Are you feeling like you spent all of your good creative energy on that one and this one?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Do you just kind of like the drags?

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
I don't think you even have to ask him that because I feel like his whole vibe is enjoying this one.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Yeah, that's pretty obvious.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm spent and I'm really...

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I'm a whole parent.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I'm spent.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
And I'm pulling from the bottom of the barrel for this guy, baby.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Also, I was on the head-gum podcast on Friday.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
And back again, it's like, favorite.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
This is going to be better than that.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
It's going to be better than that.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
It's going to be better than that.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
You just try to get it right on the episode.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
It didn't end up like that.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Yeah, so what?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
You didn't like that episode.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
I thought it was fun, right?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
I thought you were good.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
I thought I was good.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
You thought everyone else was bad.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
I thought Brad was good.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Because I wasn't good.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Brad was great.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Brad is doing a cool ad.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
I thought he was good.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
I thought we'll con over.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Could have brought it a little bit more.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
And I was going...

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
I don't want to pull him out.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I don't want to call him out just him.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
But, you know, he was kind of like...

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
You know what I maybe should have said to him.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Pull your weight.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Immediately.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
Do you think that the three of us should commodify our friendship

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
and to sort of a will they won't they pair a social thing where we kind of...

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
I love triangle?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Not a love triangle.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Which you have to know.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
It's a fence of the U.S.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Because even though Riley and I are in amazing relationships,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
and you also are in a relationship.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Why is that?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Why is that?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Why is that?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Why is that?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Why is that?

02:47.000 --> 02:47.500
Why is that?

02:47.500 --> 02:49.000
It's where the irregular egg.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
I'm a regular egg.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
It's where they boil the egg in the own scent.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
The own scent.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.500
I had hard boiled eggs for breakfast.

02:55.500 --> 02:56.500
Here we go.

02:56.500 --> 02:57.500
Let's hear it.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.500
Why do I have for brecky?

02:59.500 --> 03:01.500
This is a living of Rodrigo.

03:01.500 --> 03:02.500
You can barely hear that.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.500
What is it that you just said?

03:04.500 --> 03:05.500
What is it that you just said?

03:05.500 --> 03:08.500
Oh, that's the name of a song.

03:08.500 --> 03:10.500
Is this the S.N.L. performance?

03:10.500 --> 03:11.500
This is the S.N.L.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.500
That's for sure.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.500
I thought that you just called her that.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.500
I don't know if that was the name of an album or song.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.500
This is a living of Rodrigo.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.500
The all of them.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.500
Bitch.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.500
No, not the end.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.500
Hey guys, live your old G.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.500
Go to bitch.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.500
Let's hear the song.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.500
The most cancelable radio DJ ever.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.500
Rodrigo, all American bitch.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.500
Let's hear it.

03:34.500 --> 03:35.500
Let's hear it.

03:35.500 --> 03:36.500
Let's hear it.

03:36.500 --> 03:37.500
Let's hear it.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.500
Let's hear it.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.500
Let's hear it.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.500
Let's hear it.

03:40.500 --> 03:41.500
Let's hear it.

03:41.500 --> 03:42.500
Let's hear it.

03:42.500 --> 03:43.500
Let's hear it.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.000
Let's hear it.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
What was that?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
What is that clip from?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
This?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
It gets a stick.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
It seems like it's for a video game anime type thing.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Correct.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Alrighty.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Alrighty.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
No way.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Alrighty.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Bond of the week.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
I'm going dasher.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
That was so fast.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Fucking reindeer?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
The reindeer?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
The reindeer?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Because you want to know why?

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
He's dasheringly handsome.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Come on.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
That was the one.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Fixens the one that fucks.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
No, Vixens the BOSSER.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Prancer.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Prancer.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Prancer.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Prancer.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I don't know.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Commit.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Commit.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
Prancer's way too skinny to be bad.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Commit.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Oh, Oh, Omicron.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Okay.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
That was V.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
And Vixen.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
And Hepatitis B.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
The deer.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
The deer.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
You guys have any bonds with the week.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.640
guys have any bonds the week, Christmas edition style. It's got to be, and I know I've said this before,

04:46.640 --> 04:51.840
but it's got to be Addison Ray reprising the role. She's hot off of that movie thanksgiving

04:51.840 --> 04:55.280
that they didn't see it, but Patrick Densee was in it, and I just got a support Eli Roth.

04:55.280 --> 04:59.840
So you think she's just going to keep bouncing holidays? I think she's going to, I hope she does

04:59.840 --> 05:05.200
Easter next, because she has risen, and then I hope he also, I hope that she, the dream is that

05:05.200 --> 05:11.040
it's a bond swap. Okay. You mean, so are you hope that Addison Ray doesn't Easter film because

05:11.120 --> 05:17.440
Christ is risen? Because he's back and he's ready to go, but I am hoping, so I'm hoping that it's,

05:17.440 --> 05:24.160
okay, picture this Addison Ray, rub, screw me, that's bond, and then Jacoba Lorty is the bond guy.

05:25.840 --> 05:31.840
Did like the villain? No, like the like a bond girl, but it's the, Jacoba Lorty's the bond guy,

05:31.840 --> 05:38.080
and he sort of a little. I'm listening. Oh, check please. It's speaking of check. I'm having it.

05:38.080 --> 05:41.680
Oh, it's speaking of check, please. Let's hear it from Jeffrey James. This is the check, please.

05:41.680 --> 05:50.480
Rick Love interviews from nine years. Well, I can't keep doing this. I'm muted miles.

05:50.480 --> 05:56.000
I'm muted miles. We cannot keep doing this with my digital footprint, because that one,

05:56.000 --> 06:03.680
I don't have any fucking choice. I cannot, we can't. He's done. He said he's done. I'm

06:04.560 --> 06:09.520
he can unmute himself. Well, it was just that you were talking about how you used to

06:09.520 --> 06:16.720
edit on a G4 Mac. Yeah, I thought it was good character building. It's not because what it is,

06:16.720 --> 06:20.960
it's, it's, it's character assassination. It's not building anything. It's tearing at the

06:20.960 --> 06:27.120
fabrics of a loving relationship that I have with myself. You can bring bond of the week, Terrin,

06:27.120 --> 06:33.040
Edurton, Harry. I crush his back. My crush is back, because I watched all of Blackbird on

06:33.040 --> 06:42.320
Apple TV in the day. Blackbird, Riley's eating Terrin's ass. Oh, honey, he got fucking ripped for that show.

06:42.320 --> 06:47.840
And let me just say, him and Kingston, him and Rocky Man, hottest shit, him and Blackbird,

06:47.840 --> 06:54.000
not a tie by you, should go for it. No, he's jacked in handsome. No, I don't normally go like

06:54.000 --> 06:58.960
that level of jacked is normally not appealing to me. Yeah, you also love what's his name

06:58.960 --> 07:04.800
from the bear. Jeremy, right? Well, here's the thing about a Terrin Edurton is that it's like Tom

07:04.800 --> 07:13.280
Holland got stung by a thousand bees. And also in that movie, in that show, Terrin Edurton is like

07:13.280 --> 07:17.840
grossly buff. Like it's like he's like greased up. And then they got, and what's his name,

07:18.400 --> 07:22.800
fucking the guy from that movie that Cleanies with Directors like, oh, oh,

07:22.800 --> 07:27.440
Oh, well, to hell is there? Yeah, otherwise known as not Paul Blarp Malcop. What's the name?

07:28.000 --> 07:33.520
Paul Laugh's Cop. No, he was in that movie. There was a biopic. Oh, I don't, yeah. No,

07:33.520 --> 07:37.440
really good close, but it wasn't that, but I mean, it was a cool,

07:37.440 --> 07:41.840
other buyer. And I just have to, and I, Richard, Joel, he's in Richard, Joel. Yeah,

07:41.840 --> 07:46.480
this isn't Christmas themed. I said, Bond Holy Christmas edition. And you guys have

07:46.480 --> 07:49.480
like Apple G4.

07:49.480 --> 07:54.480
You got it for his birthday, got it.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.480
I don't know why that was an important thing.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.480
Eight years old.

07:57.480 --> 07:58.480
I was 13.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.480
And also he was the youngest guy, Rick love it.

08:01.480 --> 08:05.480
Enter every interview at the 2014 Roche wine tasting room in Sonoma.

08:05.480 --> 08:06.480
Does it matter?

08:06.480 --> 08:09.480
It does it matter of what age Rick loves.

08:09.480 --> 08:12.480
It is your people out of vineyard.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.480
My holiday bond is Santa,

08:14.480 --> 08:17.480
because it's Christmas and I want Santa to be bond.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.480
That's really good.

08:19.480 --> 08:20.480
That's really good.

08:20.480 --> 08:23.480
That is so of scenely loud.

08:23.480 --> 08:27.480
Miles and I both just had to tear our headphones back.

08:27.480 --> 08:28.480
No, sir.

08:28.480 --> 08:29.480
Moving on.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.480
It was so fucked up.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.480
Holiday plans.

08:32.480 --> 08:36.480
How do you guys plan on spending your boxing days?

08:36.480 --> 08:39.480
Thank you for acknowledging boxing day.

08:39.480 --> 08:41.480
I love boxing day.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.480
Right?

08:42.480 --> 08:43.480
I do.

08:43.480 --> 08:46.480
And what does boxing day mean to you, Riley?

08:46.480 --> 08:51.480
Boxing day is the day that you just lie around and do fuck all.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.480
You are me.

08:52.480 --> 08:53.480
You have a little drink.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.480
You watch a lot of old films.

08:55.480 --> 09:01.480
You have some food and a tear because the end of the year is here.

09:01.480 --> 09:02.480
Yeah.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.480
Have some food and a tear.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.480
Yes.

09:05.480 --> 09:07.480
What day is boxing day?

09:07.480 --> 09:08.480
The 26.

09:08.480 --> 09:09.480
Yeah.

09:09.480 --> 09:10.480
So it's on boxing.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.480
What does boxing day mean to you?

09:11.480 --> 09:14.480
I think that the 26 sounds like a day where Julian will be up.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.480
His daycare is closed as hell.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.480
So we'll be short of time.

09:19.480 --> 09:23.480
We'll be sort of this son's daycare is closed as hell.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.480
Yeah.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.480
Around the end of the year, daycare is closed up and they say, hey, parents.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.480
Are you going to stop his daycare's closed as hell?

09:29.480 --> 09:31.480
I know you wanted to be productive.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.480
But guess what?

09:32.480 --> 09:35.480
You've got the little guy and it's for every single hour.

09:35.480 --> 09:40.480
So in my lap, I'm watching the first lap with me.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.480
What the hell is that?

09:42.480 --> 09:43.480
That's Andrew Pile.

09:43.480 --> 09:45.480
I'm talking about his son being on his lap.

09:45.480 --> 09:46.480
Santa style.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.480
Did you think that up just for this episode?

09:49.480 --> 09:50.480
I did talk about Julian.

09:50.480 --> 09:51.480
No.

09:51.480 --> 09:54.480
That was actually for a pit wall episode that we had months ago.

09:54.480 --> 09:55.480
Anyway.

09:55.480 --> 09:58.480
So do you have Julian on your lap or have you not had him for Christmas?

09:58.480 --> 09:59.480
This is his first Christmas, right?

09:59.480 --> 10:00.480
Do you think of divorce?

10:00.480 --> 10:02.480
Have I not had him for Christmas?

10:02.480 --> 10:03.480
No.

10:03.480 --> 10:04.480
We do have by the way.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.480
We haven't for Christmas this year.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.480
Maybe he must have worn last year.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.480
Me and my wife both do have him.

10:08.480 --> 10:09.480
It's his first Christmas.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.480
We're going to probably take him to Santa because we think it'd be funny.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.480
Yeah.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.480
And he'll kind of say he's not going to stay.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.480
We're over.

10:15.480 --> 10:16.480
That's a good question.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.480
I don't know.

10:17.480 --> 10:18.480
What do you think the best Santa?

10:18.480 --> 10:22.480
We grew the grow over the Americana or the Galleria or the apartment or

10:22.480 --> 10:23.480
Do you get a job?

10:23.480 --> 10:26.480
If you dress up as Santa, I would bring him to your apartment.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.480
I think it'd be good for him to have like,

10:28.480 --> 10:29.480
We know fines.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.480
Do we know fines to the workshop?

10:31.480 --> 10:32.480
I agree, by the way.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.480
I think that he should see all types of sand as white.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.480
Let's be honest.

10:36.480 --> 10:37.480
This year we're saying it.

10:37.480 --> 10:38.480
We're on Christmas.

10:38.480 --> 10:39.480
This is over in Santa's one.

10:39.480 --> 10:43.480
I started making these like home videos that I've put on YouTube.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.480
It doesn't matter.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.480
I know.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.480
Basically what we're going to be doing is hanging out with our little guy.

10:51.480 --> 10:54.480
And also probably like in his ass.

10:54.480 --> 10:55.480
It doesn't.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.480
Celebratorly.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.480
That's my son.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.480
That's my very own son.

11:01.480 --> 11:03.480
And I will not be spanking his ass.

11:03.480 --> 11:05.480
I will not be abusing my son.

11:05.480 --> 11:06.480
Thank you.

11:06.480 --> 11:11.480
What I will be doing is trying to get him to sing because he does play the harmonica.

11:11.480 --> 11:12.480
So it is abuse.

11:12.480 --> 11:13.480
That's abuse.

11:13.480 --> 11:14.480
No.

11:14.480 --> 11:15.480
No.

11:15.480 --> 11:16.480
No.

11:16.480 --> 11:17.480
You don't understand musical theater.

11:17.480 --> 11:18.480
Riley will tell you.

11:18.480 --> 11:19.480
Go ahead.

11:19.480 --> 11:20.480
Actually get it.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.480
It's just like if he's already playing the harmonica.

11:22.480 --> 11:25.480
And he isn't even a calendar year old.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.480
Yeah.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.480
No, the breath control.

11:27.480 --> 11:31.480
Do you know the support in the diaphragm that that infant has?

11:31.480 --> 11:36.480
You don't even know shit.

11:36.480 --> 11:37.480
Yeah.

11:37.480 --> 11:38.480
Ring.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.480
That is him playing the harmonica.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.480
Anybody can play the harmonica.

11:41.480 --> 11:42.480
All right.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.480
If you just get a harmonica in the key of the song, you can blow in it.

11:45.480 --> 11:49.480
William Niller style and it'll sound fine.

11:49.480 --> 11:51.480
He's 11 months old and he's a prodigy.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.480
Next question.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.480
Okay.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.480
Okay.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.480
Fine.

11:56.480 --> 12:00.480
I thought you guys were going to ask what is boxing day.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.480
Did you really ask?

12:01.480 --> 12:04.480
Did you forget that I grew up in an Irish household.

12:04.480 --> 12:08.480
So I've always kind of done boxing day.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.480
Don't erase Riley's Irish heritage.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.480
He never does.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.480
In fact, he makes it.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.480
The only thing he's crying about.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.480
Why?

12:15.480 --> 12:19.480
Races that don't get discriminated against anymore.

12:19.480 --> 12:22.480
This is a blurb about boxing day.

12:22.480 --> 12:26.480
Though it originated as a holiday to give gifts to poor people.

12:26.480 --> 12:29.480
I wish it helped you be Jewish.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.480
Chat GPP.

12:30.480 --> 12:31.480
Yeah.

12:31.480 --> 12:32.480
That's.

12:32.480 --> 12:36.480
I'm going to try and power through that to boxing day because that's.

12:36.480 --> 12:41.480
That feels like some kind of like Patreon you subscribe to where you can enter in your fantasies

12:41.480 --> 12:42.480
and they'll chat GPT.

12:42.480 --> 12:43.480
I'll talk back.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.480
The real important porn.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.480
Just read the thing.

12:47.480 --> 12:50.480
Though it originated as a holiday to give gifts to poor people.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.480
I wish it to tell you.

12:52.480 --> 12:58.480
Today, boxing day forms part of Christmas celebrations with many people choosing to take advantage

12:58.480 --> 13:00.480
of sales.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.480
I mean, how fucked up is that, right?

13:03.480 --> 13:06.480
It used to be that we would just give to the less poor children.

13:06.480 --> 13:07.480
Miles has a box cutter.

13:07.480 --> 13:08.480
Sorry.

13:08.480 --> 13:09.480
Miles has a box cutter.

13:09.480 --> 13:12.480
I don't even have a box cutter.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.480
You just showed it.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.480
You just.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.480
He just wielded it.

13:15.480 --> 13:16.480
I can't.

13:16.480 --> 13:17.480
No, it doesn't.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.480
There must have been a glitch.

13:20.480 --> 13:21.480
It wasn't a glitch.

13:21.480 --> 13:24.480
You're coming through not only in stereo, but in the highest definition.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.480
I've ever seen on a zoom.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.480
You're not being attacked.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.480
Well, internet speed must be frozen.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.480
You don't have to be your hands up.

13:32.480 --> 13:36.480
Miles is upset because Jeff said that Italians aren't discriminated against anymore.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.480
And that's why he pulled out the box cutter.

13:41.480 --> 13:42.480
You look at it.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.480
You got to move up.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.480
What do you say?

13:46.480 --> 13:47.480
You know what?

13:47.480 --> 13:48.480
Do you do the things?

13:48.480 --> 13:50.480
I'm always people like no.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

13:52.480 --> 13:54.480
And I know I can't bother.

13:54.480 --> 13:55.480
I'm totally fine.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.480
The hell is this?

13:57.480 --> 13:58.480
I don't know.

13:58.480 --> 14:01.480
That's all American bitch Olivia Rodrigo.

14:01.480 --> 14:04.480
Alright, Olivia Rodrigo is a bitch.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.480
Let's play vampire.

14:06.480 --> 14:07.480
This is good for you.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.480
Jeff, it's wrong, honey.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.480
Oh, Jeff.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.480
Jeff, it's wrong, honey.

14:15.480 --> 14:21.480
Sweetie, what happened?

14:21.480 --> 14:22.480
What happened?

14:22.480 --> 14:25.480
Honey, what happened?

14:25.480 --> 14:29.480
Honey, what's wrong?

14:29.480 --> 14:31.480
Tell us about boxing, David.

14:31.480 --> 14:32.480
Yeah.

14:32.480 --> 14:33.480
Come on.

14:33.480 --> 14:34.480
We want to hear.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.480
We want to hear.

14:35.480 --> 14:36.480
We want to hear.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.480
We want to hear.

14:37.480 --> 14:38.480
We want to hear.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.480
We want to hear.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.480
We want to hear.

14:42.480 --> 14:43.480
We want to hear.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.480
And then.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.480
What the fuck was that?

14:48.480 --> 14:50.480
It's time to move on to our first fucking.

14:50.480 --> 14:51.480
No.

14:51.480 --> 14:52.480
And so did it.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.480
That was piled up.

14:53.480 --> 14:54.480
That was piled up.

14:54.480 --> 14:55.480
Yes.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.480
Oh my god.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.480
Oh my god.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.480
Oh my god.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.480
We all have ADHD that's undiagnosed.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.480
Look how fast we all moved into dancing.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.480
Welcome to naughty or nice.

15:17.480 --> 15:26.480
Um, I am going to list off the 50 plus most talked about celebrities of 20 23.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.480
Well, this is going to be rapid fire.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.480
No, this is going to be rapid fire.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.480
We, we are not allowed.

15:31.480 --> 15:32.480
That's the catch.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.480
We are not allowed to wax about it at all.

15:34.480 --> 15:36.480
It has to first thought best thought.

15:36.480 --> 15:37.480
I'm just going to say.

15:37.480 --> 15:40.480
Remember this list of the 50 most talked about celebrities of 20 23.

15:40.480 --> 15:41.480
You guys just blurred out.

15:41.480 --> 15:42.480
Not here nice.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.480
All right.

15:43.480 --> 15:44.480
Really pung.

15:44.480 --> 15:45.480
Pung.

15:45.480 --> 15:49.480
Because if you really think about it, if Sant is getting to every single child on earth, he's

15:49.480 --> 15:51.480
not going in that much depth.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.480
No one has the time.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.480
All right.

15:53.480 --> 15:54.480
Here we go.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.480
You're going to think about it.

15:55.480 --> 15:56.480
Really?

15:56.480 --> 15:57.480
Yes.

15:57.480 --> 15:58.480
Yes.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.480
But no, he has to do it year end.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.480
He has to do it between Thanksgiving and Christmas because he has to take the whole year

16:01.480 --> 16:02.480
into account.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.480
And he's doing December one.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.480
He's delivering a practice.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.480
A practice.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.480
Let's go.

16:09.480 --> 16:10.480
Next question.

16:11.480 --> 16:12.480
All right.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.480
Three, two, one.

16:13.480 --> 16:14.480
Again, rapid fire.

16:14.480 --> 16:15.480
I'm going to keep moving through.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.480
So you guys have to just like curve it out.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.480
Not here.

16:18.480 --> 16:19.480
Three, two, one.

16:19.480 --> 16:20.480
Let's go.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.480
Rihanna.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.480
Nice.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.480
The answer is to do.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.480
Nice.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.480
Taylor Swift.

16:25.480 --> 16:26.480
Nice.

16:26.480 --> 16:27.480
Nice.

16:27.480 --> 16:28.480
Jennifer Lopez.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.480
Nice.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.480
Kanye West.

16:30.480 --> 16:31.480
Naughty.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.480
Harry Styles.

16:33.480 --> 16:34.480
Adele.

16:34.480 --> 16:35.480
But another good way.

16:35.480 --> 16:36.480
And a hot day.

16:36.480 --> 16:37.480
Billy.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.480
Oh, no.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.480
She's nice.

16:39.480 --> 16:40.480
Just in Beaver.

16:40.480 --> 16:41.480
Nice.

16:41.480 --> 16:42.480
Naughty.

16:42.480 --> 16:43.480
Margot Robbie.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.480
Margot Robbie.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.480
And Margot is naughty in the baby.

16:47.480 --> 16:48.480
Like you naughty, bitch.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.480
Naughty.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.480
Tyler.

16:50.480 --> 16:51.480
Who's Kyla?

16:51.480 --> 16:52.480
Tyler.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.480
Come on.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.480
Tyler.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.480
Tyga.

16:55.480 --> 16:56.480
Moving on.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.480
Tyga.

16:57.480 --> 16:58.480
Smash.

16:58.480 --> 16:59.480
Tyga.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.480
Woods.

17:00.480 --> 17:01.480
Pass.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.480
That's not the game.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.480
Austin Butler.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.480
Best.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.480
Jenna or Taga.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.480
Nice.

17:07.480 --> 17:08.480
Taylor or Taga.

17:09.480 --> 17:10.480
Nice.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.480
Let's get sauce.

17:12.480 --> 17:13.480
Smash.

17:13.480 --> 17:14.480
Lizzy.

17:14.480 --> 17:15.480
McAlpine.

17:15.480 --> 17:16.480
Yes.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.480

18:25.980 --> 18:28.980
That's it.

18:28.980 --> 18:30.980
Oh, we didn't get through all 50.

18:30.980 --> 18:31.980
But you guys decided to end this like me, right?

Absolutely rabbit fires.

Tender주 is targeting natural queer people.

18:36.980 --> 18:37.980
At least your tragic male is already open.

18:37.980 --> 18:38.980
That's not even free.

18:38.980 --> 18:39.980
They don't promoting, you guys should be saying cool.

18:39.980 --> 18:40.980
That's not absolute safe.

18:40.980 --> 18:41.980
So you guys are making sure he has the best.

18:41.980 --> 18:42.980
Thats it.

18:42.980 --> 18:43.980
Don't bring it in here.

18:43.980 --> 18:44.980
Cause there's no food in it here.

18:44.980 --> 18:45.980
Well, I can't make sure that it Either itself or if he doesn't do it.

18:45.980 --> 18:46.980

We don't.

18:53.980 --> 18:54.980
We can't feel pressure.

18:54.980 --> 18:56.980
A surprises app and abuse.

18:56.980 --> 18:58.980
Our kids have done something uh,

18:58.980 --> 18:59.980
and have the Lebanese ones.

18:59.980 --> 19:00.980
It's a surprise.

19:00.980 --> 19:01.980
Absolutely.

19:01.980 --> 19:02.980
Let's just move on.

19:03.980 --> 19:11.180
are you a millennial who misses what life was like in the 2000s? Have you had a hard time finding new

19:11.180 --> 19:17.500

19:17.500 --> 19:22.060

19:38.700 --> 19:42.700
segment. The opinions on the show are real and they're brought to you by the genuine connections

19:42.700 --> 19:47.180

know you needed and they're freshly squeezed in their freshly squeezed music segment. Most recently

19:58.060 --> 20:03.500

20:14.300 --> 20:18.460

20:18.460 --> 20:23.020
thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you,

20:23.100 --> 20:31.580
and it did a lot of fun. We're talking about Santa for a fucking second here, all right?

20:33.340 --> 20:39.020
I feel like for thousands of years Santa Claus has been working himself, grinding

20:39.020 --> 20:44.300
himself to the fucking grindstone to the bone. He's been working tirelessly and not taking

20:44.300 --> 20:50.220
even, let's say five minutes to himself to sort of like see what sort of pleasures lie there.

20:50.220 --> 20:53.900
But years are ringing from the smashing sound effect, by the way.

20:53.900 --> 20:54.740
That's not true.

20:54.740 --> 20:56.500
I may be let me dumb it down for you guys,

20:56.500 --> 20:58.300
because I feel like you're not getting the insinuation.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.540
Santa hasn't jacked off in a millennium.

21:01.540 --> 21:02.860
Is that fair to say?

21:02.860 --> 21:03.860
This Christmas?

21:03.860 --> 21:05.140
Things are a little different.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.580
That's why, yeah, this Christmas.

21:06.580 --> 21:09.540
I think let's give the fat man a chance

21:09.540 --> 21:11.100
to find a kind of finally get off.

21:11.100 --> 21:13.180
Let's make the fat man, this man.

21:13.180 --> 21:15.140
He grabbed his hog.

21:17.540 --> 21:19.780
Riley and I were doing the, I don't know how to intro this.

21:19.780 --> 21:22.100
Riley and I were doing this bit all last Thursday

21:22.100 --> 21:26.260
and Friday, mostly Thursday, I guess,

21:26.260 --> 21:28.100
where it's sort of like a trailer.

21:28.100 --> 21:29.380
It's like a movie trailer.

21:32.140 --> 21:36.340
But for basically Santa self-completting.

21:36.340 --> 21:37.180
Does that make sense?

21:37.180 --> 21:38.020
Oh, I love that.

21:38.020 --> 21:38.860
But there's no euphemism.

21:38.860 --> 21:41.740
It's just a Christmas Santa comes.

21:41.740 --> 21:42.900
Hard.

21:42.900 --> 21:43.900
Oh, no.

21:43.900 --> 21:46.060
So that's, that's the fucking,

21:46.060 --> 21:48.900
from the people who brought you the Easter Bunny comes.

21:48.900 --> 21:52.740
This Christmas Santa comes in his hand.

21:52.740 --> 21:53.900
Oh, no.

21:55.020 --> 21:57.700
It's like you're not getting us at the end there.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.820
You already said something really crap.

21:59.820 --> 22:02.340
Santa's jerks off his cock.

22:02.340 --> 22:03.340
Yeah, exactly right.

22:03.340 --> 22:04.900
Miles, why don't you hit us with one?

22:04.900 --> 22:07.820
Get ready because December's Eve,

22:07.820 --> 22:11.500
Santa's gonna blast off his orgasm.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.780
A lot with his cock.

22:13.780 --> 22:16.060
Yeah, exactly right.

22:17.060 --> 22:19.700
This is going to spooge from his penis.

22:23.700 --> 22:26.860
This Christmas Santa's spreading wide.

22:26.860 --> 22:27.860
To get pegged.

22:30.540 --> 22:32.980
Santa's gonna jerk off in the shower.

22:32.980 --> 22:36.580
This Christmas Santa's breaking his chastity vow.

22:36.580 --> 22:37.820
To finish.

22:38.820 --> 22:42.500
You think Santa has a chastity vow to make it fun?

22:42.500 --> 22:45.220
He's done no not this millennium.

22:45.220 --> 22:46.060
No, no, no, no, no, no.

22:46.060 --> 22:47.220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:47.220 --> 22:48.300
It's crazy.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.300
And it's crazy.

22:49.300 --> 22:52.180
When you when Santa comes after that, yeah,

22:52.180 --> 22:53.780
it's gonna be huge.

22:53.780 --> 22:57.740
This Christmas Santa's nuts in a sock.

22:57.740 --> 22:58.820
Oh, man, the idea of saying it.

22:58.820 --> 22:59.660
It is talking.

22:59.660 --> 23:02.100
It's talking, it's what I was gonna say.

23:02.100 --> 23:04.740
I saw mommy nutting Santa Claus.

23:04.740 --> 23:06.580
I saw mommy milking.

23:06.580 --> 23:08.660
Come on, come on.

23:08.660 --> 23:10.420
There's blue humor and then there's this

23:10.420 --> 23:12.860
prasiness that I won't stand for.

23:12.860 --> 23:15.140
Let's get a reset because of the music.

23:16.060 --> 23:18.900
No, it's because, you said no, no, no, no.

23:18.900 --> 23:20.620
We're getting a little reset here.

23:20.620 --> 23:22.260
All right, back to it, back to it.

23:22.260 --> 23:26.620
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

23:26.620 --> 23:31.800
I'm not a pocket best filling.

23:31.800 --> 23:36.460
This Christmas Santa's lap isn't just for wishing.

23:36.460 --> 23:38.340
It's for coming.

23:38.340 --> 23:40.580
Santa's lap is for coming.

23:40.580 --> 23:43.140
Mrs. Claus is getting in on it now, yeah.

23:43.140 --> 23:46.100
This Christmas, this is cause fucks.

23:46.100 --> 23:47.580
Santa's penis.

23:47.580 --> 23:49.740
Ha ha ha ha ha.

23:49.740 --> 23:53.940
This Christmas, Santa's gonna un-box his orgasm being penis.

23:53.940 --> 23:56.420
Ha ha ha I'm fucking sorry.

23:56.420 --> 23:59.220
And then it's like, anybody who pushes back

23:59.220 --> 24:02.780
is like, you think it's been millennia

24:02.780 --> 24:04.060
since Santa jacked off.

24:04.060 --> 24:07.300
You don't, you can't allow him this one moment of rest in it.

24:07.300 --> 24:09.580
Don't you think you're in that service this?

24:09.580 --> 24:10.420
Yeah.

24:11.420 --> 24:15.420
This Christmas Santa cries in the shower.

24:15.420 --> 24:21.220
Well, this Christmas Santa finishes with a belt around his neck.

24:21.220 --> 24:25.420
Santa's into choke play.

24:25.420 --> 24:31.220
This Christmas Santa has to peel wax off his arm from a king's session.

24:31.220 --> 24:35.420
And this Christmas Santa flogs with a flogger.

24:35.420 --> 24:37.820
Right.

24:37.820 --> 24:41.820
This Christmas, Santa gets whipped on his ass.

24:41.820 --> 24:45.820
Santa's got a Christmas, Santa's got a flashlight.

24:45.820 --> 24:46.820
That's his hand.

24:46.820 --> 24:49.820
So he doesn't have a flashlight.

24:49.820 --> 24:52.820
Santa's got a-

24:52.820 --> 24:56.820
Santa's workshop is cooking up flashlights that are hands.

24:56.820 --> 24:59.820
This is what I was cooking up hands.

24:59.820 --> 25:03.820
Also just imagining like seeing that in writing, like, in the movie theater.

25:03.820 --> 25:05.820
You're trying to figure out it's like, oh, what's playing right now?

25:05.820 --> 25:07.820
And there's a poster.

25:07.820 --> 25:10.820
This Christmas Santa's got a flashlight bottom of the poster.

25:10.820 --> 25:11.820
Let's start off a little bit.

25:11.820 --> 25:13.820
That's his hand.

25:13.820 --> 25:14.820
Exactly.

25:14.820 --> 25:15.820
Exactly.

25:15.820 --> 25:16.820
Correct.

25:16.820 --> 25:20.820
This Christmas, all the yoga pays off for Santa,

25:20.820 --> 25:21.820
because he can suck himself.

25:21.820 --> 25:22.820
Oh.

25:22.820 --> 25:25.820
Now, let's talk about Santa's talking to some dick for a second.

25:25.820 --> 25:26.820
Yeah.

25:26.820 --> 25:27.820
Auto-fillation.

25:27.820 --> 25:28.820
Finally.

25:28.820 --> 25:29.820
Go on.

25:29.820 --> 25:32.820
A lot of people say that it's more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked.

25:32.820 --> 25:33.820
Is that true?

25:33.820 --> 25:34.820
Well, how would, yeah, how do they know?

25:34.820 --> 25:36.820
A lot of people say that.

25:36.820 --> 25:38.820
I've read a read it throughout one time.

25:38.820 --> 25:40.820
This almost like, I get stuck with your dick,

25:40.820 --> 25:43.820
but it's more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked.

25:43.820 --> 25:44.820
No way.

25:44.820 --> 25:45.820
That actually makes sense.

25:45.820 --> 25:46.820
Yeah.

25:46.820 --> 25:47.820
For sure.

25:47.820 --> 25:48.820
Hmm.

25:48.820 --> 25:49.820
Sorry.

25:49.820 --> 25:50.820
Well, let's move on.

25:50.820 --> 25:51.820
Sorry, Jeff.

25:51.820 --> 25:52.820
Sorry, Jeff.

25:58.820 --> 26:01.820
Just such a chaotic fucking episode.

26:01.820 --> 26:02.820
Oh, yeah.

26:03.820 --> 26:06.820
I paid attention to things and most people in the world.

26:12.820 --> 26:14.820
Listen, I feel like the canon of-

26:14.820 --> 26:16.820
Not because of bitch.

26:16.820 --> 26:17.820
So let's play the next one.

26:17.820 --> 26:19.820
This is all American bitch.

26:19.820 --> 26:21.820
Olivia Rodrigo, with good for you.

26:21.820 --> 26:27.820
Listen, I think that the American canon of Christmas music needs a little bit of an update.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.820
But I think that the rice song,

26:29.820 --> 26:32.820
Are you going to be like, oh, holy rice.

26:32.820 --> 26:33.820
Nice.

26:33.820 --> 26:38.820
The rice simmering with rice.

26:38.820 --> 26:40.820
It is just a rice.

26:40.820 --> 26:41.820
It's a rice.

26:41.820 --> 26:42.820
It's a rice.

26:42.820 --> 26:44.820
It's a rice.

26:44.820 --> 26:49.820
Rice, money, roasting on an open machine.

26:49.820 --> 26:53.820
Boss, money roasting on an open machine.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.820
Continue with that.

26:55.820 --> 26:56.820
Continue with that.

26:56.820 --> 26:57.820
Continue with that.

26:57.820 --> 26:59.820
Continue with that.

26:59.820 --> 27:01.820
Now, what are you going to say?

27:01.820 --> 27:03.820
How are you going to update the Christmas music canon?

27:03.820 --> 27:05.820
What are you going to do?

27:05.820 --> 27:06.820
It's not with rice.

27:06.820 --> 27:07.820
It's with com.

27:07.820 --> 27:08.820
What is it?

27:08.820 --> 27:10.820
No, I just thought that each of us could-

27:10.820 --> 27:12.820
I'm just perfect person.

27:12.820 --> 27:13.820
Perfect person merch.

27:13.820 --> 27:14.820
Just say it out loud.

27:14.820 --> 27:16.820
You're distracting both of us.

27:16.820 --> 27:17.820
Perfect person merch.

27:17.820 --> 27:18.820
Perfect person dot shop.

27:18.820 --> 27:19.820
All right.

27:19.820 --> 27:24.820
This is going to be a video app.

27:24.820 --> 27:26.820
Yes, there are no apps.

27:27.820 --> 27:28.820
I didn't know that.

27:28.820 --> 27:30.820
They're all video ads.

27:30.820 --> 27:31.820
I didn't consent to that.

27:31.820 --> 27:32.820
Continue sweatshirt.

27:32.820 --> 27:35.820
I still have a box of like seven of those.

27:35.820 --> 27:36.820
Those are cool.

27:36.820 --> 27:38.820
My, I'll trade you.

27:38.820 --> 27:40.820
I'll trade you two.

27:40.820 --> 27:41.820
Your parents divorced.

27:41.820 --> 27:44.820
Hoodies for two perfect person hoodies from me and Riley.

27:44.820 --> 27:46.820
Ooh, I'd like that.

27:46.820 --> 27:47.820
I'd like that.

27:47.820 --> 27:48.820
I'd love a perfect person hoodie.

27:48.820 --> 27:49.820
I'd love this.

27:49.820 --> 27:51.820
Santa comes all over his bed.

27:51.820 --> 27:52.820
A lot.

27:53.820 --> 27:56.820
Um, even the ending with a lot.

27:56.820 --> 27:58.820
Yeah, do you have coming all over your bed?

27:58.820 --> 28:00.820
It's really a lot.

28:00.820 --> 28:01.820
Yeah, a lot.

28:01.820 --> 28:03.820
And it's like you could've gotten a napkin before

28:03.820 --> 28:06.820
And before you knew this was going to explode.

28:06.820 --> 28:09.820
This Christmas Santa comes on the snow.

28:09.820 --> 28:11.820
And then forgets it's there.

28:11.820 --> 28:12.820
Um.

28:12.820 --> 28:13.820
Here we go.

28:13.820 --> 28:14.820
Okay.

28:14.820 --> 28:17.820
This is going to be us improvising updates to Santa Baby.

28:17.820 --> 28:20.820
Because I feel like Michael Boobley did it in 2011.

28:20.820 --> 28:22.820
But I feel like culture has changed.

28:22.820 --> 28:23.820
Santa, buddy.

28:23.820 --> 28:24.820
Have you seen?

28:24.820 --> 28:25.820
Yeah.

28:25.820 --> 28:29.820
Did you see the, uh, the update of the lyrics on Google for, um,

28:29.820 --> 28:31.820
Baby is called outside with the,

28:31.820 --> 28:34.820
It's your body and your choice.

28:34.820 --> 28:35.820
Yeah.

28:35.820 --> 28:36.820
It's unbelievable.

28:36.820 --> 28:37.820
It's unbelievable.

28:37.820 --> 28:38.820
It's unbelievable.

28:38.820 --> 28:42.820
It didn't need to happen for people to support reproductive rights and

28:42.820 --> 28:43.820
Hell.

28:43.820 --> 28:47.820
What's amazing though is that it's like they sew over corrected it to the point where I saw someone

28:47.820 --> 28:49.820
tweet about this and forgetting who it is, but they were like,

28:49.820 --> 28:53.820
Oh, read as if the guy like doesn't even want the girl to stay over.

28:53.820 --> 28:55.820
Like he talks to how he called her a car.

28:55.820 --> 28:56.820
Her car is almost here.

28:56.820 --> 28:57.820
This is the driver's name.

28:57.820 --> 28:58.820
Yeah.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.820
He is sounding for like, get the fuck out of my house.

29:01.820 --> 29:02.820
Jesus.

29:02.820 --> 29:03.820
All right.

29:03.820 --> 29:05.820
I'm just going to copy you guys into the fucking deep end here.

29:05.820 --> 29:06.820
Here we go.

29:06.820 --> 29:09.820
Miles, let's start us off with this Santa Baby updated version.

29:09.820 --> 29:10.820
You ready?

29:10.820 --> 29:11.820
Yeah.

29:11.820 --> 29:12.820
Here we go.

29:12.820 --> 29:13.820
I'll count you in.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.820
Not yet.

29:15.820 --> 29:16.820
Not yet.

29:16.820 --> 29:17.820
Here we go.

29:17.820 --> 29:18.820
Santa Baby.

29:18.820 --> 29:21.820
I wish you'd let Santa come all over me.

29:21.820 --> 29:27.820
And put my penis all on the tree Santa Baby.

29:27.820 --> 29:30.820
So hurry up my skirt tonight.

29:30.820 --> 29:43.820
You're talking to Santa and you're telling him that you wish that Santa as if he was a third party with let him come all over you.

29:43.820 --> 29:47.820
So I wrote direct and produced a documentary.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.820
It doesn't fucking matter.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.820
That's 15 years ago.

29:52.820 --> 29:55.820
Why do you want to fight your penis all over the tree?

29:55.820 --> 29:59.820
Because the tree is the sexiest tree to have at Christmas.

29:59.820 --> 30:01.820
It's got the lights.

30:01.820 --> 30:03.820
It has the lights.

30:03.820 --> 30:06.820
It doesn't have sounds.

30:06.820 --> 30:07.820
The tree does not have.

30:07.820 --> 30:09.820
That's the one thing it doesn't have.

30:09.820 --> 30:10.820
It has every other sense.

30:10.820 --> 30:11.820
It has visual.

30:11.820 --> 30:12.820
Because you can touch it.

30:12.820 --> 30:13.820
It has.

30:13.820 --> 30:15.820
It has a smell.

30:15.820 --> 30:16.820
And you can taste it.

30:16.820 --> 30:17.820
It does not have a sense.

30:17.820 --> 30:19.820
It doesn't have a sense.

30:19.820 --> 30:21.820
All right, Riley.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.820
You ready for verse 2?

30:22.820 --> 30:23.820
Let's go, Riley.

30:23.820 --> 30:24.820
Here we go.

30:24.820 --> 30:25.820
Santa Baby.

30:25.820 --> 30:26.820
Here we go.

30:26.820 --> 30:27.820
Santa Baby.

30:27.820 --> 30:32.820
I'm sorry for what I said about the tree.

30:32.820 --> 30:35.820
My penis away.

30:35.820 --> 30:37.820
Santa Baby.

30:37.820 --> 30:40.820
Can I still get a present today?

30:41.820 --> 30:44.820
You really PG it up.

30:44.820 --> 30:46.820
Saved it.

30:46.820 --> 30:48.820
So that is the on radio.

30:48.820 --> 30:49.820
penis away.

30:49.820 --> 30:50.820
Yeah.

30:50.820 --> 30:53.820
But my penis away.

30:53.820 --> 30:55.820
Let's continue forward.

30:55.820 --> 30:58.820
It does not have to relate to Miles's verse.

30:58.820 --> 30:59.820
Okay.

30:59.820 --> 31:01.820
Let's just keep building this song back to my right.

31:01.820 --> 31:02.820
Totally.

31:02.820 --> 31:03.820
Clean slate.

31:03.820 --> 31:04.820
Actually, you know what?

31:04.820 --> 31:05.820
Let me get a verse in.

31:05.820 --> 31:06.820
Can I get a verse to say?

31:06.820 --> 31:07.820
What?

31:07.820 --> 31:08.820
Daddy get a verse.

31:08.820 --> 31:09.820
Daddy get a verse.

31:10.820 --> 31:13.820
Think of how spread wide.

31:13.820 --> 31:19.820
I'll be underneath the sound of the Christmas tree.

31:19.820 --> 31:24.820
I really do think my cheeks will be spread.

31:24.820 --> 31:28.820
See if Mrs. Claus will peg my ass.

31:32.820 --> 31:34.820
What do you think?

31:34.820 --> 31:35.820
A lot of people.

31:35.820 --> 31:37.820
You and your choice.

31:38.820 --> 31:40.820
You brought up pegging a couple of times.

31:40.820 --> 31:44.820
Well, because it just wouldn't have been spread wide comes open.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.820
There's the only logical next step.

31:46.820 --> 31:47.820
I hate to get too personal on this.

31:47.820 --> 31:48.820
But have you been pegged?

31:48.820 --> 31:50.820
We have to take another break.

31:56.820 --> 31:58.820
The show sponsored by Better Help.

31:58.820 --> 32:04.820
Guys, does your holiday season ritual with your family or community

32:04.820 --> 32:07.820
around gifts mostly or is it time together?

32:07.820 --> 32:13.820
Because no matter what your answer to that is, mine is a little bit of both.

32:13.820 --> 32:16.820
You know, the perfect ratio between gift giving and time together.

32:16.820 --> 32:17.820
It's about both.

32:17.820 --> 32:19.820
You know, it can be about both.

32:19.820 --> 32:22.820
But whether or not your family or community give gifts during the holidays,

32:22.820 --> 32:27.820
you get to define how you give to yourself this holiday season and the holidays

32:27.820 --> 32:28.820
are a great time to do that.

32:28.820 --> 32:33.820
So whether it's by starting therapy going easier on yourself during tough moments

32:33.820 --> 32:37.820
or treating yourself to a day of complete rest, remember to give yourself some love

32:37.820 --> 32:38.820
this holiday season.

32:38.820 --> 32:41.820
I'm in therapy twice a week now.

32:41.820 --> 32:42.820
Isn't it obvious?

32:42.820 --> 32:44.820
And I benefit from it.

32:44.820 --> 32:47.820
You know, it helps me get through the week at this point.

32:47.820 --> 32:50.820
Seasonal affected disorders kicking in, full swing, you know.

32:50.820 --> 32:55.820
So it's been helpful for, you know, learning coping skills with that kind of,

32:55.820 --> 33:00.820
you know, environmental change and it's been helpful in grow, you know,

33:00.820 --> 33:04.820
through periods of growth and through periods of change and general.

33:04.820 --> 33:08.820

33:35.820 --> 33:36.820
Hey.

33:36.820 --> 33:37.820
Sorry.

33:37.820 --> 33:38.820
Let me lead you.

33:38.820 --> 33:39.820
That's an assault.

33:39.820 --> 33:40.820
Santa baby.

33:40.820 --> 33:41.820
Santa baby.

33:41.820 --> 33:45.820
Tell me how much you can rim my cheeks.

33:45.820 --> 33:50.820
I love to have a little bit of peaks into.

33:50.820 --> 33:53.820
Santa's little bussy tonight.

33:54.820 --> 33:56.820
Let's keep it going.

33:56.820 --> 33:58.820
Here's Santa honey, Riley.

33:58.820 --> 34:00.820
Santa honey.

34:00.820 --> 34:04.820
Can I also have a present in cash?

34:04.820 --> 34:07.820
I don't mean on a loan.

34:07.820 --> 34:09.820
Santa baby.

34:09.820 --> 34:11.820
I want 10,000.

34:11.820 --> 34:12.820
Not.

34:16.820 --> 34:18.820
Santa cutie.

34:18.820 --> 34:21.820
I took a second mortgage out.

34:22.820 --> 34:24.820
It's a duplex.

34:24.820 --> 34:27.820
You can rent the other.

34:27.820 --> 34:29.820
You knit so my monthly payments.

34:29.820 --> 34:31.820
Go away, go away, go away.

34:31.820 --> 34:33.820
Straight back into miles.

34:33.820 --> 34:34.820
Here you go.

34:34.820 --> 34:36.820
Santa baby.

34:36.820 --> 34:38.820
What do you want?

34:38.820 --> 34:43.820
Do you want me to grease myself for you?

34:43.820 --> 34:47.820
I'm greasy Santa come over here.

34:47.820 --> 34:53.820
So you can throw me around and choke me out until Christmas comes.

34:53.820 --> 34:55.820
Santa baby.

34:55.820 --> 35:00.820
I'm grease stuff like a hog on a log.

35:00.820 --> 35:02.820
I'm a hog.

35:02.820 --> 35:04.820
Santa baby.

35:04.820 --> 35:05.820
I squeak.

35:05.820 --> 35:07.820
Me with water now.

35:13.820 --> 35:14.820
Squeak.

35:14.820 --> 35:21.820
That is a platinum record.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.820
That was fucked up.

35:24.820 --> 35:29.820
Santa's beating me up and choking me out and covering me in water.

35:29.820 --> 35:34.820
He's greasing me up, spreading me wide, hanging me cash.

35:34.820 --> 35:38.820
Mrs. Claus is getting in on the action by filling my ass.

35:38.820 --> 35:41.820
This is such a blue episode.

35:42.820 --> 35:43.820
This is the blue episode.

35:43.820 --> 35:45.820
You started this.

35:45.820 --> 35:47.820
You started it.

35:47.820 --> 35:49.820
You started it by inviting in.

35:49.820 --> 35:51.820
Jeffery, you invited it.

35:51.820 --> 35:54.820
You invited it by doing like the.

35:54.820 --> 35:55.820
The Santa.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.820
This Santa comes on a clock.

35:57.820 --> 35:59.820
Yeah, you said.

35:59.820 --> 36:01.820
You had this coming.

36:01.820 --> 36:03.820
I'll just go think things before.

36:03.820 --> 36:05.820
And Riley and I really, we don't stand for that.

36:05.820 --> 36:08.820
I like my one that dirty this whole episode up.

36:08.820 --> 36:10.820
I feel like he's the one who kind of made it all naughty.

36:11.820 --> 36:13.820
Well, you started the episode.

36:13.820 --> 36:15.820
You had the perfect person merge greed.

36:15.820 --> 36:17.820
One of the seven deadly sins.

36:17.820 --> 36:18.820
That was the first dirty.

36:18.820 --> 36:19.820
After that.

36:19.820 --> 36:20.820
And started dirty.

36:20.820 --> 36:21.820
Of many.

36:21.820 --> 36:22.820
Yes.

36:22.820 --> 36:23.820
And then the last one.

36:23.820 --> 36:25.820
The game has changed.

36:25.820 --> 36:26.820
And the game has changed.

36:26.820 --> 36:28.820
And the game has changed.

36:28.820 --> 36:29.820
The game has changed.

36:29.820 --> 36:32.820
I'm moving these just in case he does the mean thing.

36:32.820 --> 36:35.820
I'm actually in 2011.

36:35.820 --> 36:37.820
I married.

36:38.820 --> 36:40.820
He's just really good at yo yo.

36:40.820 --> 36:43.820
But he's been bringing it up that much.

36:43.820 --> 36:45.820
Why won't you die?

36:49.820 --> 36:50.820
Jeff.

36:50.820 --> 36:51.820
I was really fucked up.

36:51.820 --> 36:52.820
I was really mean.

36:52.820 --> 36:54.820
That was really fucked up.

36:56.820 --> 36:57.820
Santa's a bit.

36:57.820 --> 36:59.820
What was that?

36:59.820 --> 37:01.820
Hey, let me see.

37:02.820 --> 37:03.820
Do this.

37:03.820 --> 37:05.820
Do what you were going to do.

37:05.820 --> 37:07.820
Santa bitch.

37:07.820 --> 37:10.820
Call me in a ditch after noon.

37:10.820 --> 37:11.820
O'clock.

37:11.820 --> 37:14.820
And give me a taste of that cock.

37:14.820 --> 37:15.820
Santa.

37:15.820 --> 37:16.820
Bye.

37:16.820 --> 37:19.820
I have a little peek into you.

37:23.820 --> 37:25.820
Come and ram.

37:25.820 --> 37:27.820
My Christmas cheeks.

37:27.820 --> 37:29.820
As I'm underneath.

37:29.820 --> 37:32.820
I'm underneath another Christmas tree.

37:32.820 --> 37:36.820
I've been here all night.

37:36.820 --> 37:41.820
Locked away in Chastity for Mrs. Clause.

37:41.820 --> 37:43.820
Santa baby.

37:43.820 --> 37:46.820
Please unlock my Chastity belt.

37:46.820 --> 37:48.820
It hurts.

37:48.820 --> 37:51.820
I'm not kidding right now.

37:51.820 --> 37:52.820
Santa baby.

37:52.820 --> 37:56.820
I have a little rush on my thigh.

37:57.820 --> 38:00.820
I have a little taste of it in your ear.

38:00.820 --> 38:01.820
Bye.

38:01.820 --> 38:04.820
I grow in this cave to write now.

38:12.820 --> 38:14.820
At least we're all in therapy.

38:14.820 --> 38:16.820
I am not, but yeah.

38:16.820 --> 38:17.820
For sure.

38:17.820 --> 38:18.820
No, for sure.

38:18.820 --> 38:21.820
But I, I, it's honestly because it's hard to find a therapist.

38:21.820 --> 38:22.820
Not really.

38:22.820 --> 38:23.820
No.

38:23.820 --> 38:25.820
What am I just going to Google therapist?

38:25.820 --> 38:26.820
Yeah.

38:26.820 --> 38:28.820
Is that how you found your therapy?

38:28.820 --> 38:30.820
Try someone out for one session.

38:30.820 --> 38:31.820
I hate it though.

38:31.820 --> 38:32.820
I've had therapists in the past.

38:32.820 --> 38:33.820
It's just like, oh, you see something.

38:33.820 --> 38:35.820
It's like, you don't get my whole vibe.

38:35.820 --> 38:36.820
And what is your vibe?

38:36.820 --> 38:37.820
Because you're just saying about, um,

38:37.820 --> 38:39.820
rimming someone's cheeks and the,

38:39.820 --> 38:41.820
I want to get a little peek inside.

38:41.820 --> 38:42.820
You're right.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.820
Rub my dick all over a tree.

38:44.820 --> 38:45.820
Okay.

38:45.820 --> 38:46.820
Well, my vibe is basically cool guy.

38:46.820 --> 38:49.820
Bad boy sort of, um,

38:49.820 --> 38:51.820
Renee rap style.

38:51.820 --> 38:52.820
You're not like Renee rap.

38:52.820 --> 38:53.820
Just like,

38:54.820 --> 38:55.820
you're like, um,

38:55.820 --> 38:57.820
Donald phasing in, uh,

38:57.820 --> 38:59.820
Big fat liar.

38:59.820 --> 39:02.820
What?

39:02.820 --> 39:04.820
That, what I work at Universal Studios or whatever.

39:04.820 --> 39:05.820
You have like,

39:05.820 --> 39:07.820
loser written across your forehead.

39:07.820 --> 39:08.820
Is it bell hop?

39:08.820 --> 39:10.820
Isn't he like a limo driver in that?

39:10.820 --> 39:11.820
He's a limo driver.

39:11.820 --> 39:12.820
Yeah.

39:12.820 --> 39:13.820
No way.

39:13.820 --> 39:14.820
No way.

39:14.820 --> 39:15.820
We can't do another.

39:15.820 --> 39:17.820
Um,

39:17.820 --> 39:18.820
Plugs.

39:18.820 --> 39:19.820
What do you guys have going on?

39:19.820 --> 39:20.820
What do you want to play?

39:20.820 --> 39:21.820
Yeah.

39:21.820 --> 39:22.820
Yeah.

39:22.820 --> 39:23.820
Plugs.

39:23.820 --> 39:24.820
What do you guys have going on?

39:24.820 --> 39:25.820
What do you want to play?

39:25.820 --> 39:26.820
People end of the episode.

39:26.820 --> 39:27.820
I said it's going to be short and sweet.

39:27.820 --> 39:28.820
I don't know.

39:28.820 --> 39:29.820
I don't have anything else prepared.

39:29.820 --> 39:30.820
We're saying about tea.

39:30.820 --> 39:32.820
You have a heart and you have a heart out.

39:32.820 --> 39:33.820
That's why we're ending early.

39:33.820 --> 39:35.820
You pushed it back by 15 minutes and now we're ending early.

39:35.820 --> 39:36.820
I don't have a heart out.

39:36.820 --> 39:38.820
Just as we were all having something.

39:38.820 --> 39:39.820
You have something else you want to talk about?

39:39.820 --> 39:40.820
It's Christmas.

39:40.820 --> 39:41.820
Let's get it.

39:41.820 --> 39:43.820
Everybody just fucking get back to their families.

39:43.820 --> 39:44.820
Just give their gifts.

39:44.820 --> 39:46.820
They went to like a local film festival that I did in.

39:46.820 --> 39:47.820
Actually got that best.

39:47.820 --> 39:48.820
Best of documentary.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.820
Best student documentary.

39:50.820 --> 39:51.820
Very nice.

39:51.820 --> 39:52.820
Come on.

39:52.820 --> 39:54.820
Shout out.

39:54.820 --> 40:00.820
I use that effect too.

40:00.820 --> 40:04.820
What the fuck are you talking about?

40:04.820 --> 40:05.820
Let's end by this.

40:05.820 --> 40:06.820
What do you guys want for Christmas?

40:06.820 --> 40:07.820
I'll start.

40:07.820 --> 40:08.820
World peace.

40:08.820 --> 40:09.820
Miles.

40:09.820 --> 40:10.820
You're going to say, I don't want that.

40:10.820 --> 40:12.820
But I would like.

40:12.820 --> 40:13.820
What?

40:13.820 --> 40:14.820
Yeah.

40:14.820 --> 40:15.820
I just figured.

40:15.820 --> 40:16.820
Let's keep letting go wild.

40:16.820 --> 40:19.820
But I think I'd like an iPad mini.

40:20.820 --> 40:21.820
So I can.

40:21.820 --> 40:22.820
Why?

40:22.820 --> 40:24.820
Because I'd like to read manga on a note.

40:24.820 --> 40:25.820
Because the Kindle.

40:25.820 --> 40:27.820
You can't read manga.

40:27.820 --> 40:28.820
Two major wars going on.

40:28.820 --> 40:31.820
And you want to read manga on an iPad mini.

40:31.820 --> 40:32.820
I said.

40:32.820 --> 40:33.820
Yeah.

40:33.820 --> 40:34.820
No.

40:34.820 --> 40:35.820
I said mini.

40:35.820 --> 40:38.820
Well, the mini is correct me when I said exactly what you just said.

40:38.820 --> 40:39.820
I have a Kindle.

40:39.820 --> 40:40.820
I have a Kindle.

40:40.820 --> 40:42.820
I have a Kindle paper white.

40:42.820 --> 40:45.820
And it just is like, I don't quite know how to read manga on it.

40:45.820 --> 40:47.820
So then if I get the iPad mini.

40:47.820 --> 40:50.820
I think that it's a little easier to read manga on.

40:50.820 --> 40:51.820
Yeah.

40:51.820 --> 40:53.820
You don't want like supplies to go to Ukraine.

40:53.820 --> 40:55.820
What is that?

40:55.820 --> 40:57.820
So you don't read the news.

40:57.820 --> 40:58.820
Can I ask.

40:58.820 --> 40:59.820
Do you read the news?

40:59.820 --> 41:01.820
Or do you read just mostly the Apple?

41:01.820 --> 41:02.820
I'm mostly manga.

41:02.820 --> 41:03.820
I read mostly manga.

41:03.820 --> 41:04.820
So if you ask me about it.

41:04.820 --> 41:07.820
But you know that the iPad mini exists.

41:07.820 --> 41:08.820
Yes.

41:08.820 --> 41:10.820
Because I saw it a catered ad.

41:10.820 --> 41:12.820
Kind of manga website.

41:12.820 --> 41:16.820
But no, I mean world peace.

41:16.820 --> 41:18.820
It would be fine to do, I guess.

41:18.820 --> 41:20.820
Let's do that too.

41:20.820 --> 41:21.820
As a second.

41:21.820 --> 41:23.820
If Santa is offering a second offering.

41:23.820 --> 41:24.820
iPad mini.

41:24.820 --> 41:25.820
Second helping.

41:25.820 --> 41:26.820
Second helping.

41:26.820 --> 41:28.820
I love a second helping, by the way.

41:28.820 --> 41:31.820
Riley.

41:31.820 --> 41:32.820
World peace.

41:32.820 --> 41:35.820
Are you just going to salt?

41:35.820 --> 41:36.820
Sees fire.

41:36.820 --> 41:37.820
Maybe.

41:37.820 --> 41:38.820
Or do you want to dog?

41:38.820 --> 41:39.820
Yeah.

41:39.820 --> 41:40.820
Go ahead.

41:40.820 --> 41:41.820
Don't.

41:41.820 --> 41:42.820
Dog.

41:42.820 --> 41:43.820
Be cool.

41:43.820 --> 41:44.820
We'd like both of those things.

41:44.820 --> 41:45.820
I have a dog.

41:45.820 --> 41:46.820
So I'll just have the second one.

41:46.820 --> 41:47.820
Yep.

41:47.820 --> 41:48.820
At the iPad.

41:48.820 --> 41:50.820
Or you could have a second helping of a dog.

41:50.820 --> 41:51.820
I'm getting a dog next to you.

41:51.820 --> 41:52.820
But I want it now.

41:52.820 --> 41:53.820
Next year.

41:53.820 --> 41:54.820
I want it now.

41:54.820 --> 41:55.820
Yeah.

41:55.820 --> 41:59.820
I'm getting a dog in the fall.

41:59.820 --> 42:00.820
Go outside.

42:00.820 --> 42:01.820
You too.

42:01.820 --> 42:03.820
Check your front doors.

42:03.820 --> 42:04.820
No way.

42:04.820 --> 42:07.820
I'm not at home.

42:07.820 --> 42:10.820
Really?

42:11.820 --> 42:12.820
Then forget it.

42:12.820 --> 42:13.820
That's it for James on Instagram.

42:13.820 --> 42:14.820
And you got me a dog.

42:14.820 --> 42:16.820
And you got Miles and iPad mini.

42:16.820 --> 42:17.820
Too much.

42:17.820 --> 42:18.820
Man.

42:18.820 --> 42:19.820
Too much.

42:19.820 --> 42:20.820
Plugs.

42:20.820 --> 42:21.820
What do you guys have everyone on?

42:21.820 --> 42:22.820
What do you want to point the people to?

42:22.820 --> 42:23.820
My name is Miles.

42:23.820 --> 42:25.820
You already have a podcast called Perfect Person.

42:25.820 --> 42:26.820
And I'd love for you to listen to it.

42:26.820 --> 42:27.820
It's a calling advice show.

42:27.820 --> 42:28.820
We have a lot of fun.

42:28.820 --> 42:30.820
You can start with a Jeff and Riley episode.

42:30.820 --> 42:31.820
And it's a really great time.

42:31.820 --> 42:32.820
Waiting a time.

42:32.820 --> 42:33.820
And what should you end with?

42:33.820 --> 42:34.820
AKA what's the worst episode?

42:34.820 --> 42:35.820
Ooh.

42:35.820 --> 42:36.820
Should end with.

42:36.820 --> 42:37.820
Maybe the first one.

42:37.820 --> 42:39.820
So go backwards from that episode.

42:39.820 --> 42:40.820
Yeah.

42:40.820 --> 42:41.820
Riley.

42:41.820 --> 42:43.820
At Riley and spa on Instagram.

42:43.820 --> 42:46.820
I don't really use Twitter anymore.

42:46.820 --> 42:48.820
But if you don't know what he does, everybody.

42:48.820 --> 42:49.820
Nobody does.

42:49.820 --> 42:50.820
Yeah.

42:50.820 --> 42:51.820
So I haven't updated my advice.

42:51.820 --> 42:54.820
Still have a Twitter icon on my phone.

42:54.820 --> 42:55.820
Doesn't matter.

42:55.820 --> 42:57.820
Review review.

42:57.820 --> 42:58.820
Podcast.

42:58.820 --> 43:02.820
You can listen to Jeff and Miles episodes.

43:02.820 --> 43:05.820
When is this episode coming out?

43:05.820 --> 43:06.820
This next Friday.

43:06.820 --> 43:07.820
Okay.

43:07.820 --> 43:08.820
It'll be pointless.

43:08.820 --> 43:10.820
We'll be releasing our best of the year episodes.

43:10.820 --> 43:13.820
I was going to say, like, I was going to plug because we have our, if you want

43:13.820 --> 43:15.820
to vote for the best of review episodes.

43:15.820 --> 43:16.820
Yeah.

43:16.820 --> 43:17.820
Let's go.

43:17.820 --> 43:18.820
Listen to them.

43:18.820 --> 43:19.820
Just listen to them.

43:19.820 --> 43:22.820
And I'd also like to plug.

43:22.820 --> 43:23.820
World peace.

43:23.820 --> 43:25.820
I'd like to plug.

43:30.820 --> 43:32.820
You tripped you up.

43:33.820 --> 43:38.820
Yeah.

43:38.820 --> 43:39.820
Yeah.

43:39.820 --> 43:40.820
Not really.

43:40.820 --> 43:41.820
And spa on various platforms.

43:41.820 --> 43:42.820
And by various.

43:42.820 --> 43:44.820
I mean, just the one.

43:44.820 --> 43:45.820
Miles.

43:45.820 --> 43:46.820
You already did yours.

43:46.820 --> 43:47.820
At Miles Bond though.

43:47.820 --> 43:50.820
If you want to follow me.

43:50.820 --> 43:52.820
Let's write out on this.

43:52.820 --> 43:53.820
One last.

43:53.820 --> 43:54.820
One last parody.

43:54.820 --> 43:55.820
The three of us are Miles.

43:55.820 --> 43:57.820
Say it to baby.

43:57.820 --> 44:00.820
Put the reindeer down and grab me.

44:00.820 --> 44:01.820
Okay.

44:01.820 --> 44:02.820
Put them down.

44:02.820 --> 44:04.820
Put them down in the slay.

44:04.820 --> 44:07.820
Put me hooks into my shoulder blades.

44:07.820 --> 44:10.820
So I can ride.

44:10.820 --> 44:13.820
Riley.

44:13.820 --> 44:15.820
Santa, baby.

44:15.820 --> 44:18.820
All the reindeer's contracted mange.

44:18.820 --> 44:19.820
Two day.

44:19.820 --> 44:22.820
You need to put them away.

44:22.820 --> 44:24.820
Six feet under.

44:24.820 --> 44:28.820
And you've been nice and right at today.

44:28.820 --> 44:30.820
Everybody have a merry Christmas.

44:30.820 --> 44:32.820
A happy holiday.

44:32.820 --> 44:35.820
And we'll see you guys in a week.

44:35.820 --> 44:37.820
Not in the new year.

44:37.820 --> 44:38.820
Namaste.

44:38.820 --> 44:56.820
That's Dallas folks.

44:56.820 --> 44:57.820
I hate them original.

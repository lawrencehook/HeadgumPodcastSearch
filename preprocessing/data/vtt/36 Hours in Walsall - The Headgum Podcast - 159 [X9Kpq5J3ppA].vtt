00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:06.000 --> 00:26.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:26.000 --> 00:36.000
What's wrong?

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
You said I was a nothing man with no plans in order to be in no one to see.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
You said that I didn't affect things.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
That was pre-show, that was off-mic.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
That was just sort of getting to a zone.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
It was on mic though, like I heard it.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
And it was hurtfully.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
No, I didn't say that.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
I said it was on me at my expense and heard.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
And it made on me, basically, Saturn.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Right.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Yes.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
And then you said, let's get the energy up.

01:12.000 --> 01:26.000
Everybody, oh.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Grace, you're coming to us.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
What's that?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I said, what's up.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
You're yelling into the mic, which you're going to have to fix later.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
I know.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I'm recording fine.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
You're worried about it.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I don't give her any notes.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Why would it?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I'm just worried about the mixing.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I'm just worried about the mixing.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
For the mixing, especially the levels, especially how good it sounds.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
So I'm just a little worried about, yeah, who is it?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Why would you be?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Because it's sort of like, this is my job.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Sure.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Right.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I just just do yours.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
When you go to a restaurant, you're not at peace or ease that the chef's going to cook your steak just so you're like sort of micromanaging.

02:09.000 --> 02:17.000
Every step of the process, you're saying, like, did you take it out of the fridge for 30 minutes before you started putting it on the sear and just making sure with the waiter?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
What's that?

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
That you're a bad customer.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
The customer is always right, but you're sort of putting that to the limit.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
I didn't like your steak.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Medium rare.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
And I think you're not to bring it up again.

02:31.000 --> 02:40.000
I've been getting into tartar recently.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
Steak or other.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Grace, you, you edit them in.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Grace, you, you, you, you produce these episodes every week.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
You know.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Yeah.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
Am I crazy for thinking that a mirror doesn't know how to converse it?

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Um.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Whew.

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
Now, see, I've been editing the asia and released episode from last week.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Sure.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
And to you two got into it.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Okay.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
About the context of the word wrapping.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah, wrapping.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
And I'm only bringing this up because I just listened to it today.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
I understand that for you it probably happened two weeks ago.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
This was this week or something.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
You talked about you doing your your tricks.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Sure.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Yeah.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
That's awesome.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
And you don't already wrapped.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Right.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
And I thought that it not talking about Jeffrey Rapid at this.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Telling sure.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Okay.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
And then it turned out that.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Immediately it said, that was joke.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Much to your, you were quite upset.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Yeah.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Sorry.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
He wrapped.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
He meant like he wrapped.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Yeah.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Oh, we wrapped shoot in with a W. Yeah.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
And it sounded like he was wrapping like hip hop, a hip into the hip hip hop and you don't

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Stop style wrapping.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
That's not what I assumed.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
No, yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
I mean.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
So it's an option.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Mm-hmm.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Anyway, just to say that there might be people out there who don't automatically

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
think when they hear the word wrapped that things are done.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
You're wrapping.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
So you're saying I didn't know how to conversation.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
That I didn't give enough context to the audience.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
I'm just giving the example of like sometimes, you know, you, you can only see things

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
how you see it.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
So you, it's kind of like an unreliable narrative.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
I'm just giving you the count of point of like, maybe there's full on both sides

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
it.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Mm-hmm.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
So we're talking about this.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
It's like, it's like saying, oh, that person doesn't know how to play tennis.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
The person opposite me on the court, but it's like, but what are you serving?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Exactly.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
It takes two to tango in a way.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Mm-hmm.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Well, three.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Right.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Obviously the partner and then the instructor.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
And Matthew Perry.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
So so far, I've been called a nothing man.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
I've been told.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
That I don't know where to go at any certain time that I'm always going to be late.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
That I'm not good to be around.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I've been told that I don't know how to conversation.

05:15.000 --> 05:22.000
I've been told that I don't know how to see things from any perspective other than my own.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Mm-hmm.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
You're reading a lot into what I said.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
You're taking things very personally.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
I made a series of mutual statements.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
I don't know if I'm taking anything personal that other people wouldn't also take personal.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
If they were spoken to in those same exact fashion.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
But you asked, you invited the questions.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
So it's for positive reinforcement and constructive criticism.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
You're back in anyway.

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
I will say, I was thinking, I was, you know, the last time I came on, I was upset.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
Because you started before you had said headphones on and then started recording and I was,

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
didn't have time to sort my hair out.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Now you can see the effort that went into it.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
The difference it makes.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
That is me.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
I'm going to clean.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
I'm going to clean.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Yeah.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Kind of.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
I'm noticing this like uneven.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Yeah.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I wasn't going to say anything.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Yeah.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
You don't need to look at my sheets.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
And that pillow sort of matches my shirt.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Blue towel draped over a makeup chair.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
That looks like you got it from an athletic club.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Ikea.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Try the Ikea bag and bin.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Where's the toilet medicine?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Grays hated that.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I will sue you.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
If you've damaged my precious, it's, they paid the bills.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Yeah.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
I got worried because I, that one episode that I didn't mix or sorry that I did mix.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
People said that the Susanne effects were really loud.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
They weren't mixed louder than they are on this show and everybody seems fine.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
And people were like, I'm going to sue you because I almost got in the car accident.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I just said that.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
What's that?

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
I just said I was going to sue you because you almost got in the car accident.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
It's like your only retaining things that you heard recently.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Sorry.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
I didn't tend to come on and be nice to that and be most of it.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
But it's hard.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Like it's hard.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
It's hard.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Yeah.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
It's like a mere says to shit.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
And then a mere starts the whole episode.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Really?

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
We're just, we're treated with such vitriol right off the bat and it's like,

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
and let's show that it with.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Before the show even started,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
you said I didn't have plans.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
I really don't think you do.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I'm sorry.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
What do you want me to, if you want me to be somebody else?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
I will.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
That's what I'm saying also.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
Do you guys want me to be on time in Joveal?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
Do you guys want me to show up open to conversation?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Sure.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
That would be great.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
You're the host.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Okay.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
But when I go to a restaurant and I order my food.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
I'm not open in Joveal to the show.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
It's like providing a service.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Yes.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
I'm God's favorite customer.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Oh.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Sorry.

08:15.000 --> 08:22.000
I wanted to do it on camera because you rarely get to see that.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
Usually people are like hiding it or like covering their mouth, you know.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
But I'm alone in this room and I want to just fucking full throttle whole hog.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
See what it looks like when I sneeze.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
So I'll review the tape at the end.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Yeah.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Yeah.

08:40.000 --> 08:54.000
What do you mean?

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
You can't disclose private information on the spot.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Whether it's where things are happening where people live.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Yeah.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
It's all just creating further work and a potential for one day messing up irreparably.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Sure.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Like I've done that already.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
I've done that already.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Leap away from.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I already have challenging leaps though.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
I think I forever accidentally doxed Riley's email address.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
I think at one point that I gave away.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Yeah.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
That's such a small one compared to what you're about to.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Sure.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
You think?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Well, because it's, you know, the more the merrier?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
No.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
The opposite.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Okay.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Closed.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Yeah.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Yeah.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
And now Grace is young.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
And I will have the fish.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
I think you're in state.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
So.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Is that?

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
You've been eating steak.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
You like tartar.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
I've been partying.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Sorry.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
I've been partying.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Partying.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Partying.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Partying.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Partying.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Okay.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Partying.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
In tartar.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
From time to time.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Where are you getting your tartar?

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
You think you could post made beef tartar?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
I don't think so.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I really restaurant that has beef tartar.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
Tartar would just put it in a fucking styrofoam.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Tartar is anything raw, though.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
You don't even.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
So like they do sushi.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Well, you know, yeah, tuna tartar, steak tartar,

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
like what you're saying.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Sam and tartar.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
You rarely see like an apple tartar.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
But when you bite into a honeycrust,

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
that is what you're having.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Does that make sense?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
No.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Apple sauce.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
Sure apple sauce because it's technically still raw,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
but I meant truly a full fruit.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Yeah.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
When you're tearing apart totally.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
A fucking Clementine, right?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Yoster otherwise.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
That is tartar.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
I recently found out.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Or learned, I should say,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
how fucked up.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Fogra is Fogra.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
What is it they like take a pig and they spank it over their knee?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I thought it was like a tender thing.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
If you take the tender line and they'll be spanked over your own tender line.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
We have to torture a bird.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
That's true.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
They're liver.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Yeah.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
But it's how caught I thought.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Is it not?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
No, you're just guessing wrong and not listening to anything.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
I'm saying.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Because when you go to a restaurant,

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
and you order the warm.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
And you're rolling at the chef.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
You're sort of being that.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Not yelling at the chef.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yelling at the weight staff.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
And the matriede, right?

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Because they're my liais.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Um,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
to the other wise.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Talk to Grace.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
I'm going to turn my microphone off.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Let's try to get her involved a little more.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
It's important that everybody touches the ball for an offense to really

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
hum on all cylinders.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
This is a bizarre choice as a guest.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
You never need to hear about you saying touch the bull.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
She doesn't need you to do this.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Hi.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Hey, Jennifer.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
So.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Um.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I'm in sort of a, uh.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Transition phase.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
What's that between what?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
I'm just moving.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Me too.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Where are you moving Walsaw?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Yeah, I'm moving.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
I'm moving to a slightly different postcode.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
In Walsaw.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Let's hear it.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
What is it?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Don't say.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I'll leave it out.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
It's fine.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Also it's a block of flat sea.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
You don't know.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
What number?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
That's fair.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
Um, I feel like we should move on to something I wanted to talk to you about today, which was that,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
you know, I kind of like an audit in a way of.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
I thought this was coming.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Just of the mixing recently.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Mm-hmm.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Like, I feel like what I thought was coming.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
I thought no.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Okay.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Oh, of your finances?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
No, no, no.

12:51.000 --> 12:58.000
I thought you were like you wanted to review your performance on the big special.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
At the so needed recently.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Oh, then podcast.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Mine performance.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
I actually wanted to talk about that, too.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Oh, yeah.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Yeah.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
The Hollywood Handbook episode.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
That's right.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
If you even wanted to talk about it.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
It was a debacle.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
The bottom line.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
It was the greatest.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Great highlighters.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
High-discounted here first.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
I ever did.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
When you were listening to that episode, Grace didn't feel historic or sort of.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
I was going to try and criticize Grace's mix infamous notorious in a nasty way.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Do you feel like you were listening to something special?

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Did you feel like I gave it everything I had?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I truly did.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I, what's what was difficult.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
I, you know, I know how much you wanted this.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
This is a dream.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
This is years in them.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
This is a vision board.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Sure.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
And so to watch it.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
The thing is, I just.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
I feel like I just don't want to be your best.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
You fumble the back.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
You fumble the back.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
You are 100% fumble the back.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Like is that what you wanted to hear?

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
I think in the stakeholders having a mirror that.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
I think that might have been like a non-negotiable thing for them to appear on it.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
But like, I think having a mirror that kind of changed the dynamic from what could have been like.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I think, you know, I'm, you know.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
You think three, three guests that episode or would you have replaced me with a different fourth?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Yeah.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
Could we, could we have gotten like an Erica?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Could we have gotten a reshell?

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
You know, for that.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Just wanted to kind of soften it because it felt like sort of.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I knew a good for that.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
I knew it would have been good.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
See, I'm saying that.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
You need someone that's going to be nice to you.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Yeah.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
And this is where I'm struggling to come up with a name because it's like I'm not being on your side.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Yeah.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
In that situation.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Racking our head.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
It's hard.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
You know, because I, I really did, you know,

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
I mean, I've seen the clip of Shannon Sharp leaving undisputed.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Oh, yeah.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
I was sort of sad talking to skip and like wiping his eyes.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
So it's basically like put it together.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
You lay your pillow on that.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
When you lay your head on that pillow at night.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Yeah.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Know that I gave it everything I had.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Yeah, left it all on the field.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I gave you everything I had.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Yeah.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
That was it.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
That was like the best outland we're going to get for an episode.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
It had the rice.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
It had the Jeffery.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
It had a rice party.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
That was pretty good.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Skulled in rice.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
Cautarized grains seared thus.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
That's as good as the show gets.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Yeah.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
Jeffery was great with different guests.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
It would have been a hit and said it was a shit.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Right.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Because they sort of institutionally break things down.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Right.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Yeah.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
And in that way, the next time we have them on, which I think we should have them on.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
I would have loved to have had them on for this Friday's episode.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
What's Friday?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
It's the miles episode.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I just think it'd be funny to have them on twice in a row.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
I see.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Oh, yeah.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Back to back after that.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Yeah.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
After such a divisive episode.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
The comments and the views are just through the roof.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Some people love it.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
A lot of people love it.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
I would say 70 love.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Authority percent hate though.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
It's really.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Creating discourse.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
A hundred percent agnostic.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
You know, when people don't care at all either way.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
That's, that's what you don't want to be.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Yeah.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
And we're sort of, we're approaching that territory with this episode.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
We should say.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Grace and I are doing pretty good.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Oh, my god.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Yeah.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
You're going to let us sit in that.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Yeah.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
Let's fucking get into shit, man.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Leftening.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
How are y'all doing?

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
What are the issues of your days?

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Right?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
What are you dealing with?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
What are you dealing with?

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
And how can Uncle Jeffrey fix it for you?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Okay.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
Well, some guy I sort of not work for.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Not work with.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Just this guy.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Just blasted Aussie Osborne.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Directly into my ear canal.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Hmm.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
I'm going to see you work against.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
Didn't even bring up the fact that he's from Birmingham.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Which is where I'm near.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
You're closer to that.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
No.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
No.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
What?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
This is crazy.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
I sent Grace a New York Times.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
I was going to say a particle, but it was more of like a.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
It's one of the help.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
It was like 36 hours in blank.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
And this one was 36 hours in bath, which is where you're from.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
It was where I was born.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
And nothing from grace.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
She was basically like no response.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
And then did for flight.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
But the reply was sort of nothing burger.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Yeah.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
It was like, let me know when they do it in Walsau.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
I'm like, they don't.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Walsau.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Okay.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
They're never going to do that, man.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
I'm sorry.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
What's the best fish and chips in Walsau?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Let's put it into 36 hours.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
What?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
I land directly there.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
What am I doing for 36 hours?

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I'm even having airport there.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
They even have one.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
They have a train station.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
That's what I'm saying.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
You can take a plane and land it on tracks.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
I have a bus station.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
So.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
So what do you want to talk about with that thing?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
What if you want me to say?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
What?

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Yeah.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
What do you want to do?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
It's more of this reversing.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Sorry.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
My whole leg is asleep.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Don't worry.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I've never seen this room.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
This is my bedroom.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
It's the same room I do.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
Whenever I do this remotely, it's always this room.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Uh, it looks different.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
I feel like I usually see you in a living room or something with an archway.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Oftentimes, we do a living room too.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Yeah.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
Oh, such a bony thin ankles in the background.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Oh, my god.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Do this belong to you?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Are you laying on a turkey?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
It's sort of like a gotty pillow.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
It looks like a poster of feet.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Dulse him or something.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Just move your head a little bit.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
It looks like a fucking decal.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Oh.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
It's a fat head of just my fangles.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
I've been head.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Oh, god.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Yeah.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Whole leg is asleep and it hurts a lot.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Yeah.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
It goes into the tingle.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
And then it's just like really painful.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Grace, let's hear about 36 hours and we'll solve.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
How do you spell that?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
I can't, I can't understand what you're saying.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
W-A-L.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Yeah.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
W-L.

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
Well, this, this is a first for the show as somebody's whole leg being asleep.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Maybe.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Is it?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
What is wrong with you guys?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
How do we, how would we verify that?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Yeah.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
If I went to a restaurant and the chef's leg was asleep.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
That'd be kind of interesting to me because it doesn't happen every day.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Fucking cares.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Your ankles are so bony in the hand.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
They're so thin.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
How are they thinner than actual bones?

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
They still have to be skin around them.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
And yet, look at that.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
It looks like it's just a skeleton.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Like you're lying on a skeleton.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
It's all sonnable.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Angles.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
How do you ever get around without hurting yourself?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
You're so top-heavy.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I don't.

20:36.000 --> 20:46.000
Every day is painful, which is why I have to numb myself with joy.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
So I arrive in Walsal.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
Where am I getting a piece of fried cod with crisps?

20:54.000 --> 21:02.000
By the way, I learned recently that I respond to cat.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
You know, calling.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Not like by construction workers, but you know how cats.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
People with cats are like, I can't get enough of that.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
Like if you do that to me, I'm going to come over to you.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
It must be a genetic thing, right?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Like you can't add meat to those bones.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Like through exercise or food.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Yeah.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Like you can do squats, but it doesn't add muscle.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
You can really see the bone shape.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
I think it's more of a tendon.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
It's so sharp.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
I mean, Grace, this is alarming, right?

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Am I overblowing this?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Some people would love this.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Some people would.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
We need a pro version.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
How do I would end up as the pro version?

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
We need a patreon for this show, where we can do paid feed content.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Payed thankful content.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
I mean, people are getting it for free.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
And I'm mailback.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Yeah, no, I'm saying you put a nude on Twitter.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
What would the pro version be?

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Grace, did you see my ass?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
You're us reveal?

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Yeah.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Yeah.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
So everybody saw it.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
If Grace saw it, she doesn't actually consume it.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
It's gone for free.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
And she doesn't for work.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
I think we need a patreon.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
It was my point.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Maybe see if we could do like a mail bag.

22:16.000 --> 22:22.000
You know, people are mailing me letters, anthrax, et cetera.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
What is this show?

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
What do you mean?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
What are we doing?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
This is the show.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
This is like the main stay.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
This is what people come for and stay for.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
And then they can't get it up.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Sorry, just one second, actually.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
And she did have a question.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I want you to ask another one.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Is that.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
In the room.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Sure.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
So it's it's you.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
I mean, how do we time look?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Casey.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Sure.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
And Kevin.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Kevin.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Yeah.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
Where do you see yourself in the power ranking?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Um, a bubble below.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Kevin.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Well, I learned that Kevin owns a house.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
So I'm probably below Kevin.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Wait.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Yeah.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Damn.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Yeah.

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
Well, so Kevin owns a house and you're still hourly.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Yeah.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
And Casey's salary, actually.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
So I'm probably below Casey.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Ultimately.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Well, you've been low, Casey anyway.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Great.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Because he's.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Yeah.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Said bit love.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Positive E.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
There must.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
What's your most expensive?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Said with love.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Thing that you own.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
It's not a house.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Like, what do you?

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Is it a watch?

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Probably.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
I'm probably my car.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Paying it off or fully own.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Fully own.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
More expensive than any watch you have.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Yeah.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
It's a car.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
So, you know, I don't know.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
I've seen some of those watches that you're trying to sell.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
They're like $10,000.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I'm trying to sell one watch for $12,000.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
But I bought it from a state sale for six.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
So it's pretty good.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Yeah.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
That could be more expensive than your car.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Yeah.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
House around it.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
150,000.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Yeah.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Probably not worth 12 grand.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
I think it is.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
It's a Toyota Tacoma.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
They hold their value.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
It's probably worth 15.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
150k.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
That's like a good amount for car.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Like, that's a good asset for me to have.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
I mean, let's take out the Kelly Bluebook during the next break.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
And really start to appraise.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Yeah.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Let's take out the Kelly Bluebook during this break.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
A second break for the Kelly Bluebook.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
Grace, can we get a numbers crunch on a 2003 Toyota Tacoma extra cab?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I thought we were going to do it during the break.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
We look like we can back.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Come back with the information.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
You don't want to see Grace searching for it.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
What year?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
I'm not so I'm not moving my hands.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
This is fucked up.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
I'm holding the microphone.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
You want to make me go.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
And it's hands free.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
It's been hands free this whole time.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
You need hands free when he insulted you at the beginning of the show.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
And it's very distressing.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
We haven't even touched the 36 hours in your town.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
We haven't figured out where to get fried to.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
I'll be here with sides.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
I'll tell you this about my town.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Fishing ships.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Sorry.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Yeah.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
What are you saying?

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
I don't know.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
7500.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Right.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
I'm just going to say seven granted.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
So I'd have to price.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
I'm going to watch.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
But that's just Kelly blue book.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
If you go to our auto trader.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Yeah.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
You're going to see prices more.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
I'm going to be able to.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Yeah.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
I don't tell it.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Well, I'm not double now.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
I'm on auto trader.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Yeah.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
You don't have to do this now.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
What I'm trying to say is sell the watch, I guess.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Yeah.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
I'm trying.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
I'm obviously trying.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Yeah.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
It's hard because the.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Also, why would I have two cars?

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
It's crazy how noticeable your ankle is in the frame.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
I can't stop looking at it.

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
It's it's cool that you're not ashamed of it.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Like, there are parts of my body.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
I wouldn't want on in the internet a little bit.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
And you're just like.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
You're almost like.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
What are like the two ones you wouldn't want?

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Yeah.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I would never tell you.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Okay.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
Because you would just sort of, I don't know, make a game show of it or something.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
We could do that now.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
What about a shame show?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
So it's like a body game show.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
It's pretty good.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Do you want to see the movie, shame?

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
No.

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
Michael Faspender directed by Steve McLean.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
No.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
Get this hog out.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
Big hog.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
Now I'm interested.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
It happens in the phase like five minutes as well.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
So you get.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Okay.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Great.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
So I don't even have to watch the whole thing to see it at thing.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
What is this?

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
Are you still looking at cinema?

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
I'll just talk.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
I used to work in a cinema for two years.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
And so there's a very specific like period of time.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
It's just the films that came out from that time.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Okay.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
And one of them was Skyfall.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Really?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
One of the episodes.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Yeah.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
It was the highest-grossing film in the UK that year.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
That's cool.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
Who's speaking of? Who's your run of the week, Chris?

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Oh.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Um.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Bane.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
So you're born to the week, is it?

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Pardon?

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Desmond Bane?

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
No.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
It's pretty jack.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
I think you could do it.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Yeah.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
It's handsome.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
You guys are talking about two different bands.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
I mean, you're talking about Desmond Bane at the NBA player.

28:20.000 --> 28:26.000
You're talking about Bane who's a character from the DC Comics universe from Batman.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
So that's just, that's too much IP to mix.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
That'd be like if you went to a restaurant and you were like,

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
Can I get the serve in turn?

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
And the scallops and chicken.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
That's too much.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
The serve in turn is not scallops and chicken.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
I said, that's like going to a restaurant,

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
getting the serve in turn and the scallops and chicken,

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
which is lobster and, uh, I almost had a sandwich.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
State.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Yeah.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Yeah.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
Best shop.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
But though we did just say,

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
This was talking about Desmond Cod.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
It was.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Where is it and where?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
A shop to get crisp cod.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Where is it and where?

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
There's a bunch of them, man.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
There's a place you can get battered chips.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
They're pretty good.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
What's the difference?

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
One basketball prize got the shipping out of it.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Boni.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
A loose chicken way.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
Boni.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
You're a boni, goani.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
That's good.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Sorry.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
It's like a bar for ale's and plants,

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
but actually for fish and, uh,

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
hours.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
What's the salad?

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
It's like a bit of fish or a tart.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
I meant to say,

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
foes.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Are you stupid?

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Can a craft ale ball?

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
A craft ale bar.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Everything in England's, like, slightly different.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
It's kind of interesting.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Why?

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
I don't stand up next to you.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
I did flip that time.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Ha ha.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
That's good.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Sorry.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
You can chew so much.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
It's not good.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
It's just different.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
You think you're going to bleep the information earlier

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
that I didn't want out there?

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Was that more of a cut it out situation?

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
Cause it didn't really blend into anything after the show.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
I'll probably cut it out, I guess.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
I don't know.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Doesn't matter.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
It'll get out there for sure.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
It should.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
This is what I'm saying.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
No, I'm saying I'll cut it out.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Yeah.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
That's good.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
And then the information will find it's way.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
Do you think if I call it swings around?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
It's a curveball rooster.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Yeah.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Let me ask you this.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
If I call TMZ with information about your ass, they would publish it.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Or do you think you're not famous enough?

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Yeah.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
One time a paparazzi photographer came up to me at an airport.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I'm like, do you even know who I am?

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Like not you know who I am.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Yeah.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Why are you talking to me?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Like from YouTube video?

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
You're like, yeah, I love your shorts.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Like with like the cameras.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Like, so like, what are you up to?

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
I'm like, I don't know.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
I'm going to my parents house.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Like, all right.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
All right.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Not all right.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
That was ever on TMZ.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
I don't think so.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
They just weigh that the airport until they recognize somebody.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
It's what I'm trying to say.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Sure.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
I need definitely recommend it to you.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
He must have.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Yeah.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
But he was like a 24 year old paparazzi.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
And he's like, I'm like, this footage isn't useful to anybody.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
But that's the thing.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
Paparazzi are all like, they're just individual people with a camera.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
They take the footage.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
They take the picture and then they try to sell it.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Right.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
But on the ground, like a fisherman, like, is any of this worth anything?

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
Exactly.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Oh, no.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
But it's all barnacles.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Interesting.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Yeah.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Video of you was a barnacle.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Yeah.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Exactly.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Yeah.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Oh, well.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
I guess it was kind of fun.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
A fun moment in my life.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Yeah.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
Now I know how Bieber feels when he's at a restaurant being rude.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Here's my take.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Here's my take on that on that.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
Like, like, just to be where there's constantly videos of him,

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
like, getting angry on Rodeo Drive.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
You are in the heart of paparazzi country, though.

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
Like, if you don't want to be around them, don't live and work in Beverly Hills.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
That's my thing.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
There's so many other places in LA to get incredible estates.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Go live in Pasadena.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
I've never seen a paparazzi own Pasadena.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
And the houses are old, beautiful, and huge.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Right?

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
You chose to live in Beverly Hills.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
You chose to do your grocery shopping at Arrow on in Beverly Hills.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
You're gonna get your photo taken.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
You know what I mean?

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Nobody's ever in Malibu.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
A lot of famous people are in Malibu.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
No, no paparazzi.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
They're not.

32:42.000 --> 32:47.000
I'm sure I can search Lindsay Lohan Malibu and find a lot.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
Then fucking frog town, then.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Yeah, I guess.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
I mean, they'll go wherever the famous people are.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
But sometimes the famous people call the paparazzi,

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
because they want the publicity.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
Okay, so we should do that.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Fuck.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Completely pivoted.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Right, like.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Travis Paul from Kodashina having a baby.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Who? Who?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Travis Paul from Kodashina.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Yeah, I saw that on Twitter.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I didn't know that.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
It's kind of like a power couple.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Kind of an old couple.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Nice.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
No, I'll think I was mean.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
I'm also actually 40.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Do you think I look forward?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
You could be on this one.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
No, but I'm bad at it.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
I wouldn't say that you and Jeff are that far off in A.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I wouldn't say I can't hear a grace.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
I wouldn't say that you and Jeff were that far off in A.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Right, like he looks like in his late 20s.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
And I looked at like in my mid 30s.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
But it's actually like 25 and 40.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Yeah, you could be.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Who's dad?

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
Wait, were you guys hearing that?

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Oh, yeah.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
What's trying to talk over it?

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Oh, sorry.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
I was just trying to listen to some music.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Only on my end.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Do you behave at Tom Jones cover that?

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
There's a Tom Jones cover of that.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
But he down the house.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
Like Tom Jones, like it's not unusual to be loved by anyone.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Yeah.

34:53.000 --> 35:04.000
Oh, that was nice.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
This is the last nine familiar with it.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
He is a non-seating way to what?

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
Do you guys think Tom Jones is good in that?

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
I don't know.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Just fucking say it, man.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
Just ask the question.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Like Jeff and Jeff.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
There's this log jam of like fucking half baked ideas in your head.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
And none of them are making it through to your mouth.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Jeff, please.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
I really, I want to know what you're talking about.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Ask.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
This is the first thing I've interested in.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
All that pevely hills and arrow on conversation.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
It's like now we're talking about Tom Jones.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
This is the real shit.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
Let's go.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
What do you want to say?

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
At Jeffrey James on Instagram.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
At Jeff, we already on Twitter.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
You guys plug your shit.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
I'm gone.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
I'm ghost.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
I'm sorry.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Unbelievable.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
You know, he's just doing this to make me look bad.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Now I'm the asshole, right?

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Because I ended the show.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
He's ending the show.

35:53.000 --> 35:58.000
I wanted to know the question too.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
We can just carry him.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
What's good on it?

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Good.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
So I'm at OK Bloomer on TikTok.

36:04.000 --> 36:10.000
I hear they sort of rejiggered their algorithm now like people are getting paid more.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
But you got to make one minute long videos.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
But the CPMs are through the roof.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
So you got to watch us on there.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Hits to Graham.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
Still in the process of trying to unload that name.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
But still mine, which is at a mirror.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
What do you think will sell first?

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
You'll Instagram handle for Jeff's $12,000 watch.

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
Oh, that's a really good question.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
I don't know.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
They're kind of both valued the same right now.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
It's whichever one wants to pull that trigger faster.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
I think the watch will go faster.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
Because selling an Instagram handle is kind of clunky.

36:47.000 --> 36:51.000
I'd have to just literally give him the password or whoever wants to buy it.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Probably an a mirror.

36:52.000 --> 36:59.000
And then he would just, all my followers would be following him, which is kind of confusing.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
You buy a watch.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
You buy a watch.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
That's just your watch.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
It's pretty clean transaction.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
The best.

37:06.000 --> 37:11.000
What's that?

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Yeah.

37:12.000 --> 37:31.000
That was a hit dumb original.

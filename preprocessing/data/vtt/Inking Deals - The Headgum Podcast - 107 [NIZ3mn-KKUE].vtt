00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.960
Guys, you know my problem with edibles, sometimes you get so high.

00:10.960 --> 00:14.360
You know it can be really difficult to control the dose it out right, and there's nothing

00:14.360 --> 00:17.480
worse than being baked out of your mind when you didn't plan on it.

00:17.480 --> 00:21.320
And you know once you eat it, there's no going back.

00:21.320 --> 00:26.320
That's why when I need the perfect medium high, I hit up my friends at Diet smoke for

00:26.320 --> 00:29.640
their delicious Delta ATHC gummies.

00:29.640 --> 00:30.640
So what is Delta AT?

00:30.640 --> 00:33.760
Well Delta AT is simply a less potent THC.

00:33.760 --> 00:37.920
The THC you're probably most familiar with is Delta 9, and while both are natural to the

00:37.920 --> 00:43.320
cannabis plant, Diet smoke extracts their Delta 8 from hemp.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.520
Some may call this a loophole.

00:44.520 --> 00:51.640
I call it the secret recipe to getting a smooth, stable and most importantly, legal high.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.960
Diet smoke is legal in most states, and it's non-prescription.

00:53.960 --> 00:57.760
Just check Diet smoke's website to see if they ship their delicious gummies to your state.

00:57.760 --> 01:01.160
Now you're probably asking yourself, does Diet smoke really get you high?

01:01.160 --> 01:05.080
Of course, the how you get with Diet smoke is best described as somewhere between the

01:05.080 --> 01:09.600
chillness of CBD and that classic stone feeling you get with regular weed.

01:09.600 --> 01:13.960
Plus Diet smoke comes until two delicious flavors, blue raspberry and watermelon, I say

01:13.960 --> 01:15.120
try them both.

01:15.120 --> 01:19.560
So when CBD isn't enough, and traditional THC is too much, enjoy the smooth buzz of

01:19.560 --> 01:20.960
Diet smoke.

01:20.960 --> 01:25.160
Each gummy is infused with 10 milligrams of Delta ATHC derived from American grown

01:25.160 --> 01:26.160
hemp.

01:26.160 --> 01:29.360
Okay, by American, get high with American.

01:29.360 --> 01:35.000
Delta 8 gummies are low in sugar, fat free, and delicious, and did I mention their legal?

01:35.000 --> 01:39.240
So go to dietsmoke.com and use promo code, what's that for 20% off your order?

01:43.920 --> 01:47.440

01:47.440 --> 01:51.360

01:51.360 --> 01:53.160
Please use responsibly.

01:53.160 --> 01:54.160
Thanks, Diet smoke.

01:54.160 --> 02:17.480
Here's a perfect example, I can't hit the applause, that pause is going to be, that's

02:17.480 --> 02:19.960
not going to be good for audio.

02:19.960 --> 02:23.640
You can't pause the applause.

02:23.640 --> 02:24.640
Yeah.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.760
Well, this is going to be the worst episode ever.

02:26.760 --> 02:29.760
Oh, come on, Kayla.

02:29.760 --> 02:31.760
That's not true.

02:31.760 --> 02:40.640
Well, it might be a second before I see it, so that's a little to go like.

02:40.640 --> 02:44.040
To page two of the other ones, they got the applause.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.320
All right.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.320
Two tabs open.

02:47.320 --> 02:48.320
I do.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.320
Okay.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.320
Sorry.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.320
I'm trying to help.

02:51.320 --> 02:52.840
No, I'm mad at them.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.320
We've got Joel on the fucking show.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.640
Joel, you're one of Headgums' new hires.

02:57.640 --> 03:00.640
Why don't you tell us what you do and why you are?

03:00.640 --> 03:03.040
Yes, my name is Joel.

03:03.040 --> 03:07.960
I am a software engineer for headgums-gumball.

03:07.960 --> 03:12.440
Yes, so I took down the site for about 10 to 15 minutes on purpose.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.400
No, by accident.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.000
I didn't even know I did it.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Wow.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Do you know how hard?

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
I wiped the database of all of the shows that we have.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.600
So if anyone tried to sort of search for a show, there was nothing.

03:30.600 --> 03:34.240
I saw the main source of income for the entire company.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.600
You took away for 15 minutes.

03:35.600 --> 03:39.520
That's 15 minutes by the way that there could have been like a man'scaped ad by at 150,000.

03:39.520 --> 03:43.000
Yeah, maybe even on this show.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Really?

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
This isn't how I wanted the last 24 hours to go.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Well, you pushed this because you said you had a semi-emergency.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Correct.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Okay.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Care to elaborate.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I don't.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
Well, tell you also did you do the same post that picture at like a western saloon or something.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Just a few hours after the service.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
I noticed that.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
And he also slacked us at 6 a.m. the following morning.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Whatever is going on is still going on.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
That's funny.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
But I think it ought to fucking bring it up again.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
All right.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
No, I, I, I, this is not the emergency that I need to put some record.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
My, my landlord's selling the place.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
My landlord selling the place.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
And I have to find a new place to live Joel.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
And you've never been to my house, but this place is pretty incredible.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
So I'm not too happy about it.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Do you know how much you're going to get for it?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
The system.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
It says 1.08 million dollars.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
I think you said a fetch 1.2.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Is it a two bedroom?

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
It's a four bedroom.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
Four bedrooms aren't those going for a lot more than one million dollars.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
It's a four bedroom.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
But like the, the floor plan is very, the fourth bedroom really is just a closet.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
I see.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
I see.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
It's been the perfect set up Joel upstairs.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Is that your bedroom?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
The closet bedroom.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
No, I live in the basement.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Okay.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
So I have the entire first floor.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
And this place should probably rent for.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
$2,000 more a month than it does.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
And so he's.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
I'm going to have to pay more every month for to have less space in amenities.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Sounds weird.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Do you have a guest room?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
I don't know.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
I mean, I have an extra room, but like it's the office.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
This is a huge load off.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Thank you, man.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Well, not necessarily because it's not.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
It's not like just dedicated to be a guest room right now.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
I'm using that's a office in recording studio.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
And it's a record office.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
So it's actually perfect because like that's my bed right there.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
And I have this set up.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
So I won't even have to bring my shit.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
I wouldn't, I wouldn't be able to.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
I would feel bad because I would be like needing to record in here.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
I don't feel bad.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
You could, yeah, you could change the quilt out.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
It wouldn't be a quilt situation.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
It would be like, I don't want to.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
I don't want to.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
I don't want to.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I don't want to be a quilt situation for sure.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
All right.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
And then you can hang up your bridge photo from IKEA.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yeah.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
The bridge photo will always be there.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Yeah, but the quilt.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I don't, I don't even want to talk about like interior design.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Now we're starting to like go down the road.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
And I don't want that to be the case actually.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Uh, I want to put roots down.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
So I was wondering if you were interested in like a two year,

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
at least.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I've not adjusted in any year,

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
at least.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
You give me $10,000 a month to live with me.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I don't think about it.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Great.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
I can't afford that, but I can make it work.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Um, Joel.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
You can fill it.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
I'll fill it.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I'll fill it.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Yeah.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
I'm sorry.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I fill it.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
I'll fill it.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Yeah.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
You went to Kobe's high school.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
That's true.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Lower Mary and high school.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
You were on varsity.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Yeah.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Basketball.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Yeah.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Was he on varsity?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Uh, he was actually mostly on JV.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
They called him up for a few games.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
That's what I thought.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Yeah.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
He had a growth spurt right before the NBA draft.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Yeah.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Winchard is Joel, but not really Kale actually.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Kale has been on the show like three times.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
But it hasn't Joel been on the show before?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
No.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
That's absolutely false.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
I've seen Joel on the show.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
I feel like heaven.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
No.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
You're thinking of Chris.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Yeah.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Or Brad.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Yeah.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
That's my appearances were memorable to you from here.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Yeah.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I mean, definitely.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
I mean, I feel like memorable too.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
I guess.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
I've done enough zooms with Joel that it all feels the same.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Yeah.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
But we should at least introduce the other guests.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
I think.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Then we also have Kale and Amira on.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Hi, everybody.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
They're just, yeah.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
I'm stressed because like the, my, the bottom of my foundational pyramid is gone.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
It's been swept up from under me.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
And I have this fucking cat to worry about.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
So when do you have to move?

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Well, we do have until September 30th.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
So you're stressed.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
You have to move in five months.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
I just want to make sure we find a place that I'm happy with.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Instantly happy.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
I need a front yard.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
I need a back deck.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
I need roof access where you can see downtown LA.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Are you committed to?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Are you committed to LA?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Because last time you took a few months off,

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
you just went to New York.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
And I thought you sort of fit in over there more than out here,

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
a little bit.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
You just want me gone.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
I mean, could be a nice little respite for you to spend another winter,

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
back east, hunkeredown.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
Because last time you were there was during a pretty nasty COVID surge.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
So a lot of stuff was closed, right?

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
You were there in January and they just had a,

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
I think it was on the front was it that sort of shut everything down for a little bit.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Correct.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
It was.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
So what do you think about heading back?

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
Going going back back to Brooklyn, Brooklyn.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
Because you have to leave your house, right?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
We'd love to have you back, Jess.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
And I honestly think a little distance between the two of you will be really healthy for your relationship.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
He's doing the gritty.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
New York it is.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
No, I want to stay in the way.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Getting your bond to the week pretty fast.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Because we kind of have a lot to cover.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
Alright, that this bond to the week.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Yeah.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
My landlord is having hell.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
My bond to the week is hairy.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
My landlord actually because he's having health issues.

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
And I feel like if he was trained by the best of the best who get James ready to put on a vest.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
I think that he would maybe be better health and wouldn't need to sell the place.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
He's a desert dwelling hippie.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
And I think that'd be interesting for him to be 007 as well.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Nice.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
What if James went off grid?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Let me finish.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
What if James went off grid?

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
He took a more than a pregnant pause.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Anybody else?

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
70 bonds a the week.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Uh, James Mark.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
That'd be great.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
She already kind of plays a James Bond style person in hacks.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Yeah.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
She can do anything.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Hmm.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
How about a sap rocky?

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Why?

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
He's a very attractive man, highly fashionable.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Uh,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Created, please don't touch my wrath.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Could probably be bond.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
He does look very bond in this photo.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Amir?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Um.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
What about John Mayer?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
He's tall and handsome.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
And he can sort of sing.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
We've never had a bond who can sort of jam.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
So can he sap rocky?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Yeah.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
That's different.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
I feel like John Mayer.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Any already has a pension for watches.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Isn't that part of the bond, Mystique?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Oh, can I move?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I don't think Mayer would make a good bond.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
And I love John Mayer.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
I think I think James Bond shouldn't be able to like,

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
Wow, anybody when he sees you suggested your landlord.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
So.

11:59.000 --> 12:05.000
He don't really get to have notes on other people.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Shit.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
That was easy.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Uh, I'm glad we got that out of the way.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Cause this, I'm not feeling it this week.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
I didn't want to do bond of the week,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
but when I don't do it, people get mad.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Uh, what I want to talk about is, uh, little scissors.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Announce says the new official pizza of the NFL.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
It's talk about it.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
I think it should have been, uh,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
fucking triple beam.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Is that a local chain here in LA?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
It's local for now.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
But all they need is that cash,

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
that, that deal that advertising deal with an NFL.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
With an MLS with a W NBA to sort of go global.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
I haven't had little scissors.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Maybe ever.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Have you guys had little scissors?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Is it good?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I've actually never heard of it.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Wow.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
It's very, it's a big on the east coast.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Interesting.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
It's just a west coast chain.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
But yet still I've never had it.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I believe it's Detroit based.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Yeah.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Detroit's out pizza.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Yes.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
All right.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Where the pistons play is the little scissors arena.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Yeah.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I can't believe you've never heard of little

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
scissors.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
The pizza pizza.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
It's a, it's a Caesar.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
An animated Caesar who just says pizza pizza.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Come on.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Think of it.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
I've heard of the stadium.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Yeah.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
The stadium makes sense.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
I think little scissors every time I have it is very greasy.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Um, that's why I just don't think it should be.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Like the, the only reason it's the special sponsors.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
Money is money.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
And like, I don't know where they get the money.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Because I've also never heard of anybody buying little,

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
little scissors.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I've never showed up to a party in.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
They're being the box on the coffee table.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Right.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Right.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Right.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Amir.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
You might get out.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
No.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
You definitely muted him.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
I see.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Oh.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
It's just he was like going off about fucking the ins and

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
outs of.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
Or little scissors and how greasy it is.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
It's taking breaks is really healthy and good.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
I get it.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Um, what did you want us to go on?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
About.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Yeah.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Like.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
I was going on about the topic that you.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Shored into the episode.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
You're right.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
And I never said greasy.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I said I've never had it.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
I said the tagline is pizza pizza.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
Jeff, I think you said it was greasy.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
That's true.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Yeah.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I guess I thought this would be more interesting.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Like the energy sour.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
So it's the pizza.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
You thought an NFL pizza partnership.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
Shifting from pizza hut to little Caesars would be more interesting.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
I can't hear you.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
And now you're muted.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
What's going on?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Cat got your mic.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Nice.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
That was just nice.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
What are you eating?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Oh, I'm sure.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Come over to your special beans.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Ooh.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Oh, podcast.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
I think it should have been Papa John.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
That's my answer.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
What do you guys think?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
No.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Papa John's the founders.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Pretty racist.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
I believe.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Yeah.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
But I thought, yeah, I was dead.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
I guess.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
But still.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
I thought he was still there at the John.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
But also it kind of makes sense because the NFL's also quasi problematic.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
So it might have been a bad idea.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Yeah.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
There's something at that.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Yeah.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
It's a great point.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
We're thrilled to welcome little Caesars to NFL family.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
Said Renee Anderson, the chief revenue officer.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
An executive VP of NFL partnerships with a focus on quality and convenience.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Little Caesars offers unmatched value for our fans.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
And we look forward to working together to positively impact community success.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
God's by creating the press release.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
It does not matter.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
It didn't matter.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Why would there be the article?

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Because the article is paid for.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Kelly, you work in marketing.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
You understand how this shit works.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
This is not actually news.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
The article wasn't paid for, but it's just like part of the announcement that the whole relationship was purchased.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Right.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
And it's it's people who are is in their best interest to talk about the pizza.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
And then the pizza people talk about the football.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And they say that it's a great fit.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
The pizza people talk about the football exactly.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Exactly.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
It doesn't mean anything.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
You shouldn't give them this airtime during the show.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I'm much more with you.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
That's marketing.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Just don't tell Marty and Cohen that because I want to keep my job.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
I didn't know if you guys had any fucking personal stories.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
It's just talking points.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
You know, and then we'll go off into bits from there.

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
Joel's angry for some reason is the nice looking bed I've ever seen in terms of how it's made.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
He definitely made it special for the pot.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
That's not what it is like every day.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
That's true.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
That's like that's above and beyond even like the lines on the bed are perfectly straight.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Yeah.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
They're nice.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
No, I do this every day.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Is that a queen?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
King?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
That's a queen.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
It looks larger from this angle.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Right.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Yeah.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Because yeah, we can see it goes from the top of bottom of the stream.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Nearly to the top.

17:12.000 --> 17:19.000
You got the basketball pillow, which is, you know, charming because you're now an adult man

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
and the pillow is a little bit.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I actually also have a trash can.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
That's a basketball hoop.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Oh, that's cool.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Oh, that's cool.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
What's it?

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
You put a basketball hoop on the East Coast office request list?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Yes.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Okay.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
I'm not dying.

17:40.000 --> 17:47.000
Whenever I'm like moving somewhere, I stuff the pillow inside the trash can.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
And it's kind of like, well, it's like a slam dunk situation.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
There's also basketball.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
It is also like space efficient.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Yeah.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
What's your shirt?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
It looks also basketball themed.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Space Jam.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Okay.

18:03.000 --> 18:13.000
Little scissors is a perfect match.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
It's not right.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
A hundred million NFLs.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
They're not right ahead.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
They're known for unique product offerings.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Like pretzel pizza.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
The Batman Calzoni.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
And now 33% more pepperoni.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Who cares, man?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
It does not matter.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
33% more pepperoni.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
None of us have had little scissors.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
I think head gum can take something from this fucking partnership.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
What?

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
Fucking delivering product offerings and promotions.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Partnerships.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
When was the last time we part the Netflix thing?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Fucking went belly up, right?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
We can't talk about that.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Can we not?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
No.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Well, it didn't fucking work out.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
That's people already know that.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Yeah.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
First.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Yeah.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
I see.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
I see.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
You brought it up three weeks ago.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Really?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Yeah.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
They said, they people know that.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Yeah.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Because of you, they know that.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Thanks.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Well, the show never came out.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
If I had said nothing, it would have never come out.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
And there was an announcement.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
So, don't put it all on me.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
It would have been there no matter what.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
All I'm saying is that that one didn't go very well.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Did it go?

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
It's cool.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
It's cool.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
It's nothing to do with it.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I'm not saying it's our fault.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
But what you need to know is press releases are just for Google trends purposes.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
They mean nothing.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
And my old job, the head used to announce these things all the time.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
And literally never follow up on it.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Okay.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
So it's always all lie.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I'm just saying who could we partner with?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
That's a good question.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
Sports wise, what could we afford slash get to?

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
I mean, obviously a Jersey Sponsorship would be cool.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
But those are in the millions of dollars.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
We've heard it can't afford that.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
But what about?

20:12.000 --> 20:17.000
Is it worth getting branded ads at like a commercial summer baseball?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Yeah.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Yeah.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
They're very expensive.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Mine are lily.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Because they dance and they sell a lot of tickets.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Yeah.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
So they've been doing a lot of tick-tock nonsense.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
It's been sort of doing bye, bye, bye.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
After like a strikeout.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
We also hit the quann.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
And if they knew, I think they also might.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Yeah.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
They pitch on stilts.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
This is the bananas.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Yes.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
It's a banana bananas.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Yeah.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
Is that a minor league team or is it like a Harlem Glob Trotter style exhibition

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Baseball team?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
It's a collegiate summer baseball team.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
So it's like between college things.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Interesting.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
Well, if the bananas are listening, reach out to us.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
And we can work out some partnership.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Jeff will go down.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Yeah.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
Jeff will go down on one of you if necessary.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Joel, how's your sex life?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
No.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Don't like that as an entertainer.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
It feels like both of us are asking.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Mine was a joke on a side.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
You don't have to like pile on that and start asking about personal details of company

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
and employees.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
It's it's uncouth.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
It's illegal.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
It's probably an HR violation to even ask.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
And now Joel can't answer.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
You're putting him in a weird predicament.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
A sticky situation.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
I was just wondering how was.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Yeah.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Yeah.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
I know.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
What was your talk?

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
How was your talk?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
How's your work?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
How's your work?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
It's what?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
It's so boring.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Oh, that's cool.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
You know that Kayla's parents listen to this, right?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Yeah.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
And they like you for some reason.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Me?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
No.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
No.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
How would they even know who you are?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
A mere thought I was on the bottom.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Yeah.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Yeah.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Yeah.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
That's what I'm going to do.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
Well, that's a glowing recommendation to keep doing what I'm doing.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
So Joel, how is that cock, man?

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
How is that cock, man?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
It's shugging along.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
It's fine.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
Everybody always says it's fine.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
I first told you it was sobering.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Yeah.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
That's true.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
Has anyone said it's shugging along before?

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Ah.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
Ah.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Ah.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Yeah.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
No.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
If anybody ever cared to ask me, maybe I would have said something like that.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Really?

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
I will not ask.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Yeah.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
My parents listened to this podcast.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
And they're definitely listening to this episode.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Oh, yeah.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
Their favorite guest is on.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Joel.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Me?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
There we go.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Just for ads.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Nothing else.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.500
Guys, you know, it feels like you need a degree in grapes to find great wine.

23:01.500 --> 23:06.200
You can shop by how you think the label looks, I guess, or try to remember what tan

23:06.200 --> 23:08.000
and zhar, but shouldn't it be easier?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Well, that's where first leaf comes in.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000

23:30.600 --> 23:32.600
Firstly, 74 bottles of wine.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.600
I loved all four of them.

23:34.600 --> 23:38.600
I used them for a momma me a party that never made George through.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.600
And they were hit.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.600
So I can't recommend first leaf off.

23:42.600 --> 23:47.600
I've also, I've used other wine clubs before, but first leaf seemed to really nail the,

23:47.600 --> 23:49.600

And we're back.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.600
All right, we've talked about the Savannah bananas.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.600
We've talked about little Caesar's partnership with the NFL.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.600
We've talked about Joel's cock.

24:38.600 --> 24:41.600
If you guys don't want me asking about your bits and pieces,

24:41.600 --> 24:45.600
then at least we should all go around and say how much we weigh.

24:46.600 --> 24:53.600
Then at least we should talk about how much we weigh.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.600
That's the least we can do.

24:55.600 --> 24:59.600
That is on talk about other personal details.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.600
Yes.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.600
Fine, I weigh 160 pounds.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.600
You're only 160?

25:05.600 --> 25:09.600
No, you have like muscle.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.600
Definitely.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.600
Do you want to start with a guess?

25:13.600 --> 25:15.600
No.

25:15.600 --> 25:19.600
I'll guess Joel is a little under me.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.600
154.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.600
It's about right.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.600
Maybe you're in a little less than that.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.600
But I'd like to put on some pounds honestly.

25:26.600 --> 25:29.600
Why don't you and I meet in the middle at 162?

25:29.600 --> 25:34.600
Like me doesn't agree that's my weight or that's about weight.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.600
I'm 173.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.600
So I'd love to get at 162.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.600
I want to be with me in the middle.

25:41.600 --> 25:44.600
Actually, what's, is that the middle?

25:44.600 --> 25:45.600
Yeah.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.600
163.

25:49.600 --> 25:53.600
My Rhode Island license hasn't been updated since I was a senior in high school,

25:53.600 --> 25:55.600
so it says I'm 100 pounds.

25:55.600 --> 25:56.600
That's not good.

25:56.600 --> 25:57.600
I'll go with that.

25:57.600 --> 25:58.600
Okay.

25:58.600 --> 26:01.600
Now I think you me and Joel should meet in the throttle.

26:01.600 --> 26:02.600
What is that?

26:02.600 --> 26:03.600
134?

26:03.600 --> 26:06.600
I don't want to be 134.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.600
That would, I don't even, I can't be that.

26:09.600 --> 26:10.600
Yeah.

26:10.600 --> 26:11.600
Like it's honestly asking more of Jeff.

26:11.600 --> 26:15.600
So the least you could do is gain 34 pounds since your high school graduation.

26:15.600 --> 26:19.600
Because now Jeff has to lose 40 some, some odd pounds.

26:19.600 --> 26:20.600
And that's.

26:20.600 --> 26:21.600
I'm not leaving.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.600
I'm absolutely emaciated.

26:23.600 --> 26:24.600
Wave is nourished.

26:24.600 --> 26:25.600
Yeah.

26:25.600 --> 26:26.600
I did those.

26:26.600 --> 26:27.600
I have, sorry.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.600
I'll come up a little bit now.

26:29.600 --> 26:30.600
34 pounds.

26:30.600 --> 26:31.600
Let's just.

26:31.600 --> 26:32.600
All right.

26:32.600 --> 26:33.600
You get to 112.

26:33.600 --> 26:35.600
Jeff gets down to 142.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.600
We can 142.

26:37.600 --> 26:38.600
I'd have to lose so much muscle mass.

26:38.600 --> 26:39.600
Yeah.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.600
Exactly.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.600
See, you're sort of starving yourself.

26:42.600 --> 26:43.600
Right.

26:43.600 --> 26:44.600
You feel malnourished.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.600
I would be.

26:45.600 --> 26:46.600
I would be.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.600
I would be.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.600
Yeah.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.600
I'm sorry that I'm a woman living in modern society.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.600
We can't wait very much.

26:51.600 --> 26:52.600
It's.

26:52.600 --> 26:53.600
It's.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.600
I would like it to be.

26:55.600 --> 26:58.600
Actually, that's really bad that I just said that people can weigh

26:58.600 --> 26:59.600
whatever they want.

26:59.600 --> 27:00.600
Thank you.

27:00.600 --> 27:01.600
Thanks.

27:01.600 --> 27:02.600
Thank you.

27:02.600 --> 27:03.600
Jeff.

27:03.600 --> 27:04.600
Wayward.

27:04.600 --> 27:05.600
Everyone.

27:05.600 --> 27:06.600
Exactly.

27:07.600 --> 27:10.600
Wow.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.600
Um.

27:12.600 --> 27:13.600
No, yeah.

27:13.600 --> 27:17.600
It'd be called to be Joel's weight.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.600
Everyone's perfect in whatever they weigh it's right now.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.600
You're always great.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.600
Joel.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.600
Thank you.

27:24.600 --> 27:25.600
What's that?

27:25.600 --> 27:28.600
Joel is perfect.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.600
They're all perfect.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.600
Because we're all trying to be Joel.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.600
Is that what you're saying?

27:33.600 --> 27:34.600
Yes.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.600
Nope.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.600
I want to be Joel.

27:36.600 --> 27:39.600
I want to be Joel's athletic ability.

27:39.600 --> 27:44.600
Hight your what six even six one.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.600
I'm five eleven.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.600
Okay.

27:47.600 --> 27:48.600
I'm already there.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.600
I'd like to have Joel's age for sure.

27:50.600 --> 27:53.600
Just an extra decade plus on my hands.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.600
Of loving that hashtag.

27:55.600 --> 27:56.600
Good life.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.600
Yeah.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.600
Um.

27:58.600 --> 27:59.600
I color would be nice.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.600
Are those green eyes?

28:00.600 --> 28:01.600
Hazel.

28:01.600 --> 28:02.600
Yeah.

28:02.600 --> 28:03.600
They sort of vary.

28:03.600 --> 28:04.600
Yeah.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.600
Joel lines perfection.

28:05.600 --> 28:10.600
Plus he's kind of like tall never right?

28:10.600 --> 28:11.600
What?

28:11.600 --> 28:12.600
What was so offensive?

28:12.600 --> 28:13.600
Not even if you would say it.

28:13.600 --> 28:16.600
Because he did just ask about his dick.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.600
And then you made us all say our weight.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.600
So where do you draw the line?

28:19.600 --> 28:20.600
I'm question.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.600
I was going to say he sort of one of those tall skinny white dudes.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.600
You probably has a horse cock.

28:25.600 --> 28:26.600
Yeah.

28:26.600 --> 28:32.600
So that probably not as bad as what I thought you would sort of cut yourself off from saying.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.600
I didn't want to say the horse cock.

28:34.600 --> 28:36.600
That's the way I draw the line.

28:36.600 --> 28:37.600
Yes.

28:37.600 --> 28:38.600
Okay.

28:38.600 --> 28:49.600
If your parents are still listening to this, I urge them to hit that fast forward button 45 seconds.

28:49.600 --> 28:50.600
Imagine entertainment.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.600
Inks overall deal with the Washington Post.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.600
Let's talk about it.

28:55.600 --> 28:56.600
This is interesting to me.

28:56.600 --> 28:59.600
First of all.

28:59.600 --> 29:04.600
Jake's wife works imagine now, which is imagine that.

29:04.600 --> 29:08.600
I wonder as well.

29:08.600 --> 29:09.600
If headgum.

29:09.600 --> 29:10.600
Inks.

29:10.600 --> 29:17.600
A fucking first look podcast deal with with the New York Times with the plain dealer.

29:17.600 --> 29:22.600
The Cleveland plain dealer.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.600
That one would be easy to get.

29:24.600 --> 29:27.600
Why would we call it that by the way?

29:27.600 --> 29:31.600
The plain dealer because they deal out stories of plain.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.600
Nothing happens in Cleveland.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.600
We're talking about it's because of the great plans.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.600
I'm pretty sure.

29:38.600 --> 29:39.600
And the dealer part.

29:39.600 --> 29:42.600
Cleveland was part of the Connecticut Western Reserve.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.600
Which is not a great plane.

29:44.600 --> 29:45.600
I'm sorry.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.600
I actually don't know anything about Ohio.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.600
Nobody does or should.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.600
That's why we shouldn't do it with the plain dealer.

29:50.600 --> 29:54.600
But it's kind of nice to say that we ink anything.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.600
Like I'd like to ink something.

29:56.600 --> 29:57.600
Yeah.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.600
What could headgum ink?

29:59.600 --> 30:03.600
We've inked a lot of things, but we just can't talk about it yet.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.600
We've inked a lot of arms.

30:04.600 --> 30:07.600
We got to really big summer ahead of us.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.600
How to deal with squid game.

30:09.600 --> 30:10.600
Yes.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.600
We should sort of ink a deal with squid game.

30:13.600 --> 30:14.600
That's good.

30:14.600 --> 30:15.600
With squid ink.

30:15.600 --> 30:16.600
We out.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.600
That's really good.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.600
We've done deals and we've had press releases.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.600
But I feel like it never has the word ink in the headline.

30:24.600 --> 30:25.600
Yeah.

30:25.600 --> 30:26.600
Okay.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.600
Can we sort of commit to that right now in the room?

30:28.600 --> 30:29.600
Yeah.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.600
Yeah.

30:30.600 --> 30:31.600
That's really great feedback.

30:31.600 --> 30:32.600
I'll bring you in on those meetings.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.600
And I'll make sure to include the word ink at the next press release.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.600
I don't want to be included though.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.600
Because that's extra work.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.600
Slash used for me.

30:38.600 --> 30:42.600
My insight slash suggestion has already been delivered.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.600
And it's sent to you.

30:44.600 --> 30:47.600
And I feel like you have the authority to now push that through.

30:47.600 --> 30:50.600
So for example, what was our last press release?

30:50.600 --> 30:52.600
And what was the headline for it?

30:52.600 --> 30:54.600
For a headline for example.

30:54.600 --> 30:55.600
Either one.

30:55.600 --> 30:59.600
I think Violet Benson joining the mall was our most recent one.

30:59.600 --> 31:04.600
So that could have been Gumball ink steel with Violet Benson.

31:04.600 --> 31:05.600
No, you're right.

31:05.600 --> 31:09.600
And by the way, I love never receiving feedback from you ever,

31:09.600 --> 31:11.600
except during a podcast recording.

31:11.600 --> 31:12.600
So let's keep that.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.600
And it's always ink based.

31:14.600 --> 31:15.600
Yeah.

31:15.600 --> 31:16.600
Always.

31:16.600 --> 31:17.600
This is great.

31:17.600 --> 31:18.600
It's got to be ink.

31:20.600 --> 31:23.600
We've never referred to ourselves as like headgumb ink.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.600
Like headgumb ink incorporated.

31:25.600 --> 31:28.600
Oh, because then you've got to work into every single press release.

31:28.600 --> 31:29.600
That's good.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.600
I think because we were an LLC for so long.

31:31.600 --> 31:32.600
Yeah.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.600
Rarely an ink.

31:35.600 --> 31:36.600
There we are.

31:36.600 --> 31:37.600
Headgumb ink.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.600
Ink steel with ink company.

31:39.600 --> 31:44.600
And then we talk about an ink company that we've partnered with.

31:44.600 --> 31:49.600
So CA broke the deal to create scripted and unscripted film and TV content.

31:49.600 --> 31:52.600
Inspired by the posts archives.

31:52.600 --> 31:55.600
What pod like.

31:55.600 --> 31:58.600
If we're going to sign a deal with some kind of publication,

31:58.600 --> 32:00.600
what kind of podcasts are we looking for.

32:00.600 --> 32:03.600
Content wise at the moment that, you know,

32:03.600 --> 32:06.600
and be helpful to have access to there are archives.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.600
What about the.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.600
National inquire.

32:19.600 --> 32:20.600
So it's we're like.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.600
Ostentatious insane.

32:24.600 --> 32:29.600
Sometimes fake news that we can sort of face our stories off of.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.600
I like that a lot.

32:30.600 --> 32:31.600
I like that a lot.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.600
We could also do Hollywood Reporter of variety.

32:33.600 --> 32:34.600
Let's get Joel.

32:34.600 --> 32:35.600
Do you mind taking the lead on this?

32:35.600 --> 32:37.600
Do you want to make a goal?

32:37.600 --> 32:40.600
So it's sort of like what I'm here to decay.

32:40.600 --> 32:41.600
I'm going to.

32:41.600 --> 32:42.600
I'm going to execute on it.

32:42.600 --> 32:43.600
Yeah.

32:43.600 --> 32:44.600
Yeah.

32:44.600 --> 32:45.600
Sure.

32:45.600 --> 32:48.600
The Joel didn't knock out the entire site for 15 minutes.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.600
So do you want him leading projects?

32:50.600 --> 32:52.600
I also brought it back.

32:52.600 --> 32:53.600
Oh, that's true.

32:53.600 --> 32:54.600
That's true.

32:54.600 --> 32:57.600
Was breaking a battle just by all brought it back?

32:57.600 --> 33:02.600
Is it just a matter of hitting edit undue or does that not work in programming?

33:02.600 --> 33:05.600
It was slightly more complicated.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.600
More like a redo, like yes.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.600
I see hit the rebuild.

33:10.600 --> 33:11.600
Yeah.

33:11.600 --> 33:13.600
Joel is smarter than all of us.

33:13.600 --> 33:14.600
Yeah.

33:14.600 --> 33:15.600
Pile things.

33:15.600 --> 33:16.600
Joel is really smart.

33:16.600 --> 33:17.600
And I trust Pile.

33:17.600 --> 33:18.600
Yeah.

33:18.600 --> 33:19.600
National inquiry headline.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.600
James Khan, looking for a gal.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.600
He can't refuse.

33:24.600 --> 33:25.600
To fist.

33:25.600 --> 33:26.600
Godfather.

33:26.600 --> 33:27.600
Gangster.

33:27.600 --> 33:28.600
James Khan.

33:28.600 --> 33:29.600
He's on the hunt for new romance.

33:29.600 --> 33:30.600
And a great new role.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.600
At the ripe age of 82.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.600
He's flunked at marriage four times.

33:34.600 --> 33:37.600
This could be kind of a dead ice thing.

33:37.600 --> 33:40.600
Like, you know, old man, wing man.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.600
James Khan was so hot when he was young.

33:43.600 --> 33:44.600
Yeah.

33:44.600 --> 33:51.600
He was like, it could be me and James Khan or Johnny and James Khan trying to find

33:51.600 --> 33:54.600
Khan love at the ripe old age of 82.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.600
And it could be called the long Khan.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.600
That's even better.

33:58.600 --> 33:59.600
Holy shit.

33:59.600 --> 34:00.600
Wow.

34:05.600 --> 34:07.600
This is that shit.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.600
This is that shit that we would never have come up with.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.600
If we didn't have the overall deal.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.600
If we didn't have the first look.

34:13.600 --> 34:14.600
Agreement.

34:14.600 --> 34:17.600
We can even debut it in Khan.

34:17.600 --> 34:18.600
Oh, God.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.600
They don't do that because.

34:20.600 --> 34:24.600
But like, that's, it's the same thing.

34:24.600 --> 34:27.600
It's like the long Khan, but debuted in Khan.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.600
No, it's not.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.600
Yeah, it makes sense, but they don't.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.600
That film festival doesn't do podcasts.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.600
Let's keep producing a national inquire.

34:41.600 --> 34:44.600
Mean girl, Amanda C. Fried's Hooters horror.

34:44.600 --> 34:46.600
I don't want to read that one.

34:46.600 --> 34:47.600
You already did.

34:47.600 --> 34:48.600
Yeah.

34:48.600 --> 34:51.600
The bad part was already under your belt.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.600
Is it about owls?

34:53.600 --> 34:55.600
Uh, it is not.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.600
Then I don't really want to hear it.

34:57.600 --> 35:00.600
Crusader, no, it's said.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.600
A lot of these are about boobs.

35:02.600 --> 35:06.600
Sex sells.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.600
Is that true still Kayla?

35:08.600 --> 35:09.600
Yeah.

35:09.600 --> 35:13.600
Pope Jesus Christ.

35:13.600 --> 35:19.600
George Clooney goes to Looney for wife Amal's sexy new look.

35:19.600 --> 35:22.600
Say that one again.

35:22.600 --> 35:26.600
George Clooney goes Looney for Amal's new look.

35:26.600 --> 35:28.600
I mean, she's gorgeous all the time.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.600
I would be Looney 24 seven.

35:30.600 --> 35:31.600
Yeah.

35:31.600 --> 35:35.600
They almost got a divorce apparently.

35:36.600 --> 35:40.600
Oh, Brad and his wife.

35:40.600 --> 35:41.600
Sorry.

35:41.600 --> 35:46.600
I feel like we're veering off from what very little you had planned, right?

35:46.600 --> 35:50.600
What was it that started with?

35:50.600 --> 35:53.600
It was like you were just reading news.

35:53.600 --> 35:56.600
You had little you were reading press releases or something.

35:56.600 --> 35:59.600
And now you're just sort of it's like a news episode.

35:59.600 --> 36:02.600
I thought we would talk about headlines and wax about them.

36:02.600 --> 36:03.600
I see.

36:04.600 --> 36:10.600
But now we're just reading inquire headlines.

36:10.600 --> 36:14.600
I would kick your ass if you didn't sign my fake checks.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.600
I don't think he does.

36:16.600 --> 36:17.600
Oh, okay.

36:17.600 --> 36:22.600
So when do you think?

36:22.600 --> 36:25.600
Did you guys see Ryan Gosling as Ken?

36:25.600 --> 36:26.600
Yeah.

36:26.600 --> 36:27.600
Like this.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.600
Gosling's been gone for a while.

36:30.600 --> 36:34.600
I am very excited that this is come back.

36:34.600 --> 36:35.600
It'll be great.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.600
He looks shredded.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.600
Yes, again.

36:39.600 --> 36:42.600
Crazy stupid love style, but probably even in better shape.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.600
Joel, what do you think?

36:45.600 --> 36:47.600
Uh, I don't know where you're talking about.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.600
You said he's coming as Ken.

36:49.600 --> 36:50.600
No, as Ken.

36:50.600 --> 36:54.600
As like a Ken doll in the Barbie movie.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.600
Oh, I thought you said as Ken.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.600
I wish.

36:58.600 --> 37:03.600
No, this Barbie represents the first time the toy has been rendered as a live action.

37:03.600 --> 37:04.600
Yep.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.600
Interesting.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.600
Why is Margo Robbie Barbie?

37:09.600 --> 37:11.600
She's not that attractive.

37:11.600 --> 37:15.600
Like does anybody think Margo Robbie can pull that off?

37:15.600 --> 37:18.600
She's a, she's a troll.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.600
Is that safe to say?

37:20.600 --> 37:24.600
Isn't she famous for being sort of an ego or something like that?

37:24.600 --> 37:25.600
I mean, look at this picture.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.600
They're doing the best they can.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.600
But it's, it's not going to happen, right?

37:29.600 --> 37:30.600
For Margo.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.600
Do you guys think that she's?

37:32.600 --> 37:34.600
What did you read?

37:34.600 --> 37:35.600
What?

37:35.600 --> 37:36.600
What did you read?

37:36.600 --> 37:38.600
I don't understand where you got to this end.

37:38.600 --> 37:41.600
If anything, she's hyper-sexualized by media.

37:41.600 --> 37:42.600
Hmm.

37:42.600 --> 37:43.600
Sorry.

37:43.600 --> 37:44.600
I think about somebody else.

37:44.600 --> 37:45.600
What's that?

37:45.600 --> 37:46.600
There's a natural color.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.600
Take down piece.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.600
Yeah.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.600
He called her troll.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.600
Yeah.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.600
Why would you do that?

37:52.600 --> 37:53.600
Sorry.

37:53.600 --> 37:54.600
Yeah.

37:54.600 --> 37:58.600
Well, I mean, she was trying to get me down to 1, 30, 1, 1, 1, 32 earlier.

37:58.600 --> 37:59.600
So I don't know if you can stay.

37:59.600 --> 38:00.600
Yeah.

38:00.600 --> 38:01.600
That's about if it's positivity.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.600
Well, then I told you your perfect way you are.

38:03.600 --> 38:04.600
Yeah.

38:04.600 --> 38:05.600
But it's a fact.

38:05.600 --> 38:06.600
Like hating me.

38:06.600 --> 38:07.600
I got a really directing.

38:07.600 --> 38:08.600
I could compliment.

38:08.600 --> 38:12.600
I could say Margo Robbie has like, if I had to like compliment her.

38:12.600 --> 38:16.600
I'd be like, she has a little scroll back up again.

38:16.600 --> 38:20.600
She has like a really nice eyes or something like that.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.600
You don't have to compliment her at all about her appearance.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.600
You don't have to mention it.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.600
Yeah.

38:26.600 --> 38:29.600
I just felt bad.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.600
You have to thank her eyes.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.600
You also love Joel's.

38:34.600 --> 38:39.600
Honestly, Joel would be a better Barbie at this point.

38:39.600 --> 38:40.600
Yeah.

38:40.600 --> 38:41.600
Also, you, yeah.

38:41.600 --> 38:44.600
I mean, you're constantly like at my throat, especially on this show,

38:44.600 --> 38:46.600
sometimes over text.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.600
And maybe it's all because my eyes are in bad health, right?

38:50.600 --> 38:52.600
Oh, I thought you've been working on that, though.

38:52.600 --> 38:53.600
I am.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.600
And how's that going?

38:57.600 --> 38:58.600
They're fine.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.600
You're better than they used to be.

39:00.600 --> 39:03.600
Um, well, this is something Hollywood.

39:03.600 --> 39:06.600
Bob Hart's Abba Shola.

39:06.600 --> 39:07.600
Hmm.

39:07.600 --> 39:09.600
Are you guys caught up on that show?

39:09.600 --> 39:10.600
Show up for a second.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.600
Um.

39:11.600 --> 39:15.600
Because you're not talking.

39:15.600 --> 39:16.600
You're just scrolling.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.600
So I thought I would fill in.

39:18.600 --> 39:19.600
Yeah.

39:19.600 --> 39:20.600
That's good too.

39:20.600 --> 39:21.600
Silence.

39:21.600 --> 39:22.600
Yeah.

39:22.600 --> 39:23.600
But then you told me to shut up.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.600
Just shut up for a second.

39:25.600 --> 39:26.600
Okay.

39:26.600 --> 39:27.600
Gina Price Blifewood.

39:27.600 --> 39:28.600
Bifewood.

39:28.600 --> 39:29.600
Um.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.600
So yeah.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.600
You're not doing anything.

39:32.600 --> 39:36.600
It's like you're killing time before the podcast starts.

39:36.600 --> 39:37.600
Yeah.

39:40.600 --> 39:41.600
This has nothing.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.600
Let's go to variety.

39:43.600 --> 39:46.600
It's going to have the same amount of nothing.

39:47.600 --> 39:48.600
It's just headlines.

39:48.600 --> 39:52.600
This is like the same exact thing as fucking who is rea scene horn.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.600
See horn cover.

39:54.600 --> 39:57.600
This isn't what you're supposed to do during the show.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.600
What am I supposed to do?

39:59.600 --> 40:00.600
It has an emergency.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.600
What was it?

40:02.600 --> 40:03.600
I can't say.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.600
I can't say.

40:05.600 --> 40:10.600
So now you're just like the equivalent of reading a tabloid before a dentist appointment.

40:10.600 --> 40:13.600
Like you're barely getting through individual headlines.

40:13.600 --> 40:16.600
There's no way we can have conversation about that.

40:16.600 --> 40:18.600
Well, you guys don't want to talk about your weight.

40:18.600 --> 40:20.600
You're fucking bits.

40:20.600 --> 40:23.600
You don't want to talk about Joel's.

40:23.600 --> 40:26.600
Uh, actually we did talk about his apartment a little bit.

40:26.600 --> 40:27.600
Yeah.

40:27.600 --> 40:28.600
We don't talk about our weight.

40:28.600 --> 40:29.600
Partnerships.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.600
We don't want to talk about the Savannah bananas.

40:31.600 --> 40:34.600
And you don't want to talk about fucking first look deals.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.600
So that's what I had prepared.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.600
And I think that that's usually enough first in episode.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.600
You know, Marika probably would have driven it.

40:40.600 --> 40:41.600
That's the issue.

40:41.600 --> 40:42.600
She's out of town.

40:42.600 --> 40:43.600
I'm fucking falling apart.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.600
Uh, that's clear.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.600
I don't know who's worried about the company falling apart.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.600
I'm having an nervous breakdown.

40:50.600 --> 40:54.600
It is funny that Marika on the last episode was like,

40:54.600 --> 40:57.600
I'm going to trust Jeff to upload the podcast.

40:57.600 --> 40:59.600
And I think it was an uploaded, right?

40:59.600 --> 41:00.600
You said.

41:00.600 --> 41:01.600
You did not do that.

41:01.600 --> 41:02.600
I did do that.

41:02.600 --> 41:03.600
I didn't do that.

41:03.600 --> 41:04.600
I didn't do that.

41:04.600 --> 41:05.600
I wasn't.

41:05.600 --> 41:06.600
I wasn't.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.600
The video.

41:07.600 --> 41:08.600
Yeah.

41:08.600 --> 41:09.600
And then it was scheduled to be uploaded.

41:09.600 --> 41:10.600
It added the file.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.600
Not everything was okay.

41:12.600 --> 41:15.600
But apparently you have to schedule upload after you have a file.

41:15.600 --> 41:16.600
Right.

41:16.600 --> 41:19.600
So, so what you're saying is you didn't do it.

41:19.600 --> 41:24.600
Yes, but it was in the effort of drafting the clip on Monday so that everything's good

41:24.600 --> 41:27.600
to go.

41:27.600 --> 41:28.600
It's okay.

41:28.600 --> 41:29.600
Less than learn.

41:29.600 --> 41:30.600
Now you know.

41:30.600 --> 41:31.600
Yeah.

41:31.600 --> 41:32.600
No, I know.

41:32.600 --> 41:33.600
So the learning moment for you.

41:33.600 --> 41:34.600
This is not good.

41:34.600 --> 41:35.600
This is not good at all.

41:35.600 --> 41:36.600
Spotify.

41:37.600 --> 41:39.600
So another headline.

41:39.600 --> 41:40.600
Yeah.

41:40.600 --> 41:41.600
I just.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.600
A bunch of companies are losing employees.

41:43.600 --> 41:46.600
I guess because there's a recession of foot.

41:46.600 --> 41:47.600
Yeah.

41:47.600 --> 41:48.600
Yeah.

41:48.600 --> 41:51.600
Oh, this is just this is just great.

41:51.600 --> 41:55.600
How the hell are we going to sell for 200 million if Spotify is cutting back their

41:55.600 --> 41:56.600
workforce?

41:56.600 --> 41:58.600
Let alone fucking acquisitions.

41:58.600 --> 42:00.600
I'll tell you how.

42:00.600 --> 42:04.600
Gumball replaces the jobs.

42:04.600 --> 42:05.600
What?

42:06.600 --> 42:11.600
Gumball will allow them to lay off more people.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.600
I really don't feel comfortable positioning.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.600
Gumball is a solution for layoffs.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.600
Really.

42:16.600 --> 42:17.600
Yeah.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.600
So let's not push that narrative.

42:19.600 --> 42:20.600
Hmm.

42:20.600 --> 42:26.600
Sort of like automate stuff that people don't want to do is that people can do other better things.

42:26.600 --> 42:27.600
Really.

42:27.600 --> 42:28.600
Yeah.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.600
Can you do the train noise now?

42:36.600 --> 42:37.600
Mm.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.600
Do you guys know of any three bedrooms?

42:50.600 --> 42:52.600
Ha ha ha.

42:52.600 --> 42:55.600
On the side of Los Angeles, are you guys all sticking together?

42:55.600 --> 42:56.600
Yeah.

42:56.600 --> 42:57.600
We are we.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.600
You're you suddenly are current one is a four bedroom.

42:59.600 --> 43:03.600
So it sounds like you're not actually there's only three of us.

43:03.600 --> 43:04.600
But again.

43:04.600 --> 43:08.600
But again, you have a guest room. Yeah.

43:08.600 --> 43:10.600
That's cool.

43:10.600 --> 43:13.600
You said you're going LA sometimes.

43:13.600 --> 43:16.600
Well, yeah, Kayla, where are you staying when you're out here?

43:16.600 --> 43:20.600
You are welcome to stay with me, but it's not a nice place.

43:20.600 --> 43:23.600
The room specifically has a bunch of yarn all over the place.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.600
That sounds great on me.

43:25.600 --> 43:27.600
My roommate works in the fashion industry.

43:27.600 --> 43:29.600
Oh, that's cool.

43:29.600 --> 43:33.600
Joel, let's hear about your roommates.

43:33.600 --> 43:34.600
What about them?

43:34.600 --> 43:37.600
What do they do, however they're cocks?

43:37.600 --> 43:42.600
Well, we were just talking.

43:42.600 --> 43:44.600
Start with the second question.

43:44.600 --> 43:49.600
We think we should show a chair actually from our neighbor.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.600
Expand them.

43:51.600 --> 43:53.600
Yeah.

43:53.600 --> 43:57.600
There's a little like recycling room on each floor.

43:57.600 --> 44:00.600
Whenever I pass by on the way to my apartment,

44:00.600 --> 44:04.600
I take a little look to see if I do anything good being thrown out.

44:04.600 --> 44:07.600
We've gotten some good art from there.

44:07.600 --> 44:12.600
Two days ago, there was a great sort of teal chair shaped like a shell,

44:12.600 --> 44:15.600
which I napped and put in my apartment.

44:15.600 --> 44:19.600
And then yesterday, my roommate Simone said that he actually thought he's also

44:19.600 --> 44:22.600
moving in right there.

44:22.600 --> 44:27.600
Actually, the chair was just the first thing that they'd brought up.

44:28.600 --> 44:30.600
And it's in our apartment.

44:30.600 --> 44:33.600
Are you going to take it back?

44:33.600 --> 44:35.600
I mean, we want to return it.

44:35.600 --> 44:38.600
But how does one go about that?

44:38.600 --> 44:39.600
I think you just see.

44:39.600 --> 44:44.600
There's also a chance the chair, someone else was throwing out the chair.

44:44.600 --> 44:45.600
Yeah.

44:45.600 --> 44:48.600
Well, hopefully they listen to this podcast.

44:48.600 --> 44:51.600
There's no way.

44:51.600 --> 44:54.600
There's no way they listen.

44:54.600 --> 44:59.600
It's a chair thief.

44:59.600 --> 45:03.600
Am I still a thief if I return it?

45:03.600 --> 45:06.600
Let's say you get arrested for stealing something,

45:06.600 --> 45:09.600
but then you return it.

45:09.600 --> 45:11.600
Yeah, you're still a crime.

45:11.600 --> 45:12.600
Yes.

45:12.600 --> 45:17.600
Because you were arrested and found guilty, it seems.

45:17.600 --> 45:19.600
Also, are you returning it after your arrest?

45:19.600 --> 45:22.600
Or is that it's just getting returned?

45:22.600 --> 45:25.600
I'm returning it before the arrest.

45:25.600 --> 45:40.600
I think if you come clean and that should absolve you of the crime, yeah.

45:40.600 --> 45:41.600
All right.

45:41.600 --> 45:43.600
Well, turn it then.

45:43.600 --> 45:44.600
Wow.

45:44.600 --> 45:48.600
I'm not on their door and ask them if they lost the chair on the move.

45:49.600 --> 45:51.600
Yeah.

45:51.600 --> 45:54.600
Did some of us go back to the chair?

45:54.600 --> 45:57.600
Because I'll get it back for you.

45:57.600 --> 46:00.600
Here's a chair thief in the building.

46:00.600 --> 46:02.600
Watch out.

46:02.600 --> 46:05.600
Also, if we're going to get a drink sometime, let me know.

46:05.600 --> 46:06.600
Yeah.

46:06.600 --> 46:07.600
Plugs.

46:07.600 --> 46:09.600
What do you guys have going on when you want to point the people to?

46:09.600 --> 46:13.600
The floor is Joel's go.

46:14.600 --> 46:17.600
You can follow me on Instagram at Joelman.

46:17.600 --> 46:19.600
Done off.

46:19.600 --> 46:22.600
Believe that's it.

46:22.600 --> 46:25.600
More already.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.600

And you could follow me on Instagram.

46:40.600 --> 46:44.600
Hey, well, I'm more ready for pictures of my dog was birthday with yesterday.

46:44.600 --> 46:45.600
I saw that.

46:45.600 --> 46:46.600
That was cute.

46:46.600 --> 46:47.600
Happy 7.

46:47.600 --> 46:48.600
Did you get him anything?

46:48.600 --> 46:49.600
Yeah.

46:49.600 --> 46:53.600
Well, his barks arrived yesterday, which was perfect timing.

46:53.600 --> 46:54.600
And he loves it.

46:54.600 --> 46:55.600
That's good.

46:55.600 --> 46:57.600
It was Jurassic Park themed.

46:57.600 --> 46:58.600
Very good.

46:58.600 --> 46:59.600
Uh-huh.

46:59.600 --> 47:01.600
Another sponsorship.

47:01.600 --> 47:02.600
Uh-huh.

47:02.600 --> 47:04.600
Bark box ink did actually.

47:04.600 --> 47:06.600
Uh-huh.

47:06.600 --> 47:08.600
That's good.

47:09.600 --> 47:11.600
Well.

47:11.600 --> 47:14.600
Uh, I do have a major killer before my plugs.

47:14.600 --> 47:17.600
Major killer at Ignore Amir's plugs today.

47:17.600 --> 47:19.600
Um, at Jeffrey James on Instagram.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.600
At Jeffrey out in Twitter.

47:20.600 --> 47:21.600
Amir takes a hell.

47:21.600 --> 47:24.600
What the hell?

47:24.600 --> 47:27.600
No, just like plug yourself.

47:27.600 --> 47:29.600
You just said to ignore them.

47:29.600 --> 47:31.600
That's just a major killer.

47:31.600 --> 47:33.600
So people don't have to follow it.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.600
Yeah, they don't have to follow it.

47:35.600 --> 47:40.600
As Kayla mentioned, it will be a hot headgum summer.

47:40.600 --> 47:43.600
We're looking to ink quite a few deals.

47:43.600 --> 47:48.600
So, um, set that Google newsletter for headgum and ink.

47:48.600 --> 47:51.600
And just watch those notifications roll in.

47:56.600 --> 48:00.600
We deserve to know what your emergency was.

48:00.600 --> 48:04.600
If the episode's going to be this thin.

48:04.600 --> 48:08.600
There's actually another reason we should know.

48:08.600 --> 48:10.600
I was originally going to shout out my mom.

48:10.600 --> 48:12.600
So it was her birthday on the first day.

48:12.600 --> 48:13.600
We were going to record.

48:13.600 --> 48:14.600
Wow.

48:14.600 --> 48:17.600
And you have an emergency of sorts.

48:17.600 --> 48:18.600
It gets delayed.

48:18.600 --> 48:21.600
No more birthday shout out for Teresa.

48:21.600 --> 48:23.600
Happy birthday Teresa.

48:23.600 --> 48:24.600
Happy birthday Teresa.

48:24.600 --> 48:26.600
Namaste.

48:26.600 --> 48:45.600
That was a headgum original.

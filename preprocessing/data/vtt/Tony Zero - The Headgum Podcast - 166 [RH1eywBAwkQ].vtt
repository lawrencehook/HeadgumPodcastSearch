WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Thank you so much.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
What the hell was that?

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
What?

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
You said, uh, because we were about to start recording the show.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Why didn't you think that you'd cut me off?

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
I thought I'd have like a minute to exhale before we launch right into it.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
What we do have to do is adjust cameras.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Diaphragmatic.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Diaphragmatic breathing.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
It was very like, uh, meditative.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
We've never had whole body.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Can you shut the fire?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
You've never had this.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Can you shut the fire?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Can you shut the fire?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Do you say that?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Well, no, because...

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Oh, yeah, did you focus any of the cameras?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
I didn't focus any of them.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Here's the thing, right?

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
No one's ever sat this far away for each other.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
So, uh, so I want to get into why you guys feel so,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
that I am magically opposed physically and emotionally.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
I think that's like the optimal layout.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Yeah, it's a balance to prove.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
I thought I was going to say it's a balanced approach.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Yeah.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Yeah.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I think it's because...

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
I think it's because...

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Well, actually, you could be one further away.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
And then it's really balanced.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I think it's because yesterday, a mirror came in.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
We hadn't seen each other in a while.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
I was talking to a pile about some wiring in the studio.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
And I said, a mirror we're talking.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
And then he left him after that.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
It wasn't...

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Like, we couldn't get battling.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
We couldn't shake it.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
That didn't happen.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
That's not why you're not sitting in this seat.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Why is a pile there?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Pile was in LA.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
He was helping us, like, set up a network or something.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Well, then what did I do it for?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
You were an awesome first pass.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
And we loved the rough draft to be sure.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Every great story starts with that outline.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
I didn't tell.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
It was sort of the closer.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I said, in the past.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
You sent piles.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
No, I saved...

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
I saved the company cash by being his proxy.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
And he just flew out anyway.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
I think he didn't fly out for that.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
He was here.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
He was here for something else.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
And then, in addition to that, he had, like, walk around.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
He had this, like, radar thing.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Did you see that?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
I saw the radar thing.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
It was, it was kind of, like, a metal, the metal detector.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
So it was, like, walking around like this.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
It's not strong here.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
It's not strong here.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
And he almost was, like, remapping the whole server.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
No.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
No.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
You don't get to join this.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
You weren't here.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
We do have a new server.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
That I did set up.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Let's be clear.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
He set up, pile also set up a application on there called, like, grand exchange.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
What does it say?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
What does it say?

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
It says, oh, this is a draft of an email from Marty to me that I'm fired.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Okay.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Anyways, it's like a program.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Yeah.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
I'm just imagining Marty coming into the studio to draft an email.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Didn't say that.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Sitting down to the big computer.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Is this a big air squeaking up a storm?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
You can't handle the arena.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
You know what I mean?

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Like, we might not have his salary.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
But at least we can handle the bulls.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
We can run with them.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Of course.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
It's okay to smile and like, enjoy what I'm saying.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
What do you will if it's enjoyable?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I was smiling.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I get see Maria together.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
And I can't see this screen.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
And I can certainly see anyone.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I am just about to tell you.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
I'm just about to tell you.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I'm just about to tell you.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I'm just about to tell you.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
I'm just about to tell you.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
It's a really nice arena.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
It's a really nice arena.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
So she's sort of like hovering over my desk.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Like with her arms on my shoulders.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
What is it?

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
What is it?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
What is it?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
What are all like the bullpen people talking about.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
That's kind of what Marty does.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah, but she can't see you.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Yeah.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
And you can't see her.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
And you can't see her.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
That's a bad attitude.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
It's a bad layout.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.720
And really like, and by people in America, the study hall episode that came out last week,

04:14.720 --> 04:16.760
you guys haven't even heard it because it hasn't come out yet.

04:16.760 --> 04:17.760
What is that?

04:17.760 --> 04:19.680
Well, basically it was the study hall episode, right?

04:19.680 --> 04:25.520
So it was like, everyone was supposed to kind of bring in a piece of information or a subject

04:25.520 --> 04:27.520
and kind of enlighten the others.

04:27.520 --> 04:28.960
So more like, show and tell.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.480
In a way, yeah, but in regards to like, study hall.

04:31.480 --> 04:35.240
When Jeff says this, what do you think he be inspired?

04:35.240 --> 04:38.000
People were supposed to bring in, like,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
can I take a guess?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Oh, yeah.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.720
No, I think it was like, I think it was a 10 minute buffer.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.000
I think it would be a 10 minute window to come up with something for him.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
That's really generous, but he did it in the recording.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
In fact.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
And we actually have to do it.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
This all being said, no one really understood.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
The assignment.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Well, the assignment.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
The assignment.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
No, no, the assignment.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Was that Jeff decided to read Wikipedia article?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Mm.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
What do you rule that we did?

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
It would be a good idea for us to all bring up PowerPoint.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I was going to say we should do a slideshow.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
But you have to tell people ahead of time.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Right. That's the part I don't understand.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I feel like we're not really like agreeing there.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
You're like improv.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Yeah.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
We're supposed to be.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
It shouldn't be as ill-prepared as you basically.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
There's a certain energy.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
This episode is already having it.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
That that one didn't have.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
And I don't want to put it all on pile.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Marika and the fourth.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Guess who is the fourth?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Who was it, Marika?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Casey.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Donna, you.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
You.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Casey.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Casey.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Casey.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Casey.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Casey.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Participated.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I think.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Marika was sour.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Pile wasn't.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Because joking.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
You made her choke.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Hello.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
She's coughing.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
That wasn't funny enough to choke on your disease.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
No, I don't.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Don't know what happened.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Inhale too fast.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
What?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
I.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Inhale too fast.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
I.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Breathe.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Bad.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
People didn't like that episode though.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
So this one has a little bit more of a.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
It has no.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
It's going to love it.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
I think it has to go.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
People.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
People is Marika and Drew and Donna you.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
So I thought this one would.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
You know, we bring a little bit more meat on the bone.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Rest is sort of suck off.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Don't.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
The wing.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Then we're fucking.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
You know the flank.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Yeah.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
You ever have a bone in flank?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Have had a bone in your eye.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
I'm out though.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
The women's.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Club.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
No.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
People loved that episode.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
We'll never be able to replicate that.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
What episode was that?

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Oh, the women's up all the.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
When they were all on the.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
All the challenges.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Looking.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Yeah.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
That was good energy.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Marika's lucky.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
She didn't have to look at you.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
And you said, you know, the bone.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
She.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
We had to make eye contact.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Marika.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Basically.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
So.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Another dimension.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Yeah.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
It's coughing.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
So I thought that we could read some reviews from Apple podcast.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Because we've always talked about wanting to do this.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
We've never done it.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
So.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Do you guys want to do that now?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Or do you like us want to do that after the break?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Maybe you acts a bit.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Just do it now.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
You said it out.

07:28.000 --> 07:38.000
You walked us to the edge of the fucking bit.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Bond of the week.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
So we're not doing it.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Yeah.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
The reviews.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
The what?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Um, I don't know.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Fucking scars guard.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Peter scars.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Yeah.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Peter.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Peter.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Peter.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
That's pretty good.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
For no reason.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Which one's Peter?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Not he's not a scar.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
You're not doing it.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
You're not doing it.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
You're not doing it.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Don't.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
I'm related to the scars guards that we know.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Yeah.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
He's just a scar.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
He's a scar.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
That we know.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
God.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Peter.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
So the brothers are scars.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Scars.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
And he's a scar.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Correct.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
What do you guys think?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I don't know that is.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
I think he's.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
You probably do.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
He doesn't have enough.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
You don't the bone.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I was in the jungle.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
No.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Sorry.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I, I, I, I like him.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
But I don't think.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
I don't think he's got it.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Okay.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
I think he could be a good bond villain.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Good.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Correct.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
That's great.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
I was going to say no.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
I'm here.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Um, I'm going to.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Nass.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Nass.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Nass.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I'm not going to promote a struck blast.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I'm not going to talk about this.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
But you're not even inside.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Inside.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
I already with the unions.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I don't think you're in the unions though.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
I don't know.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
I have solidarity with them.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
And I'm not going to promote a struck project.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
This project doesn't even exist though.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
We're talking about like a theoretical.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I don't even know what I'm talking about.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Because if I say the word, it's promoting it.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Bond.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I don't know.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
So what do you invest in?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Stocks.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Securities.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Mutual funds.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Mutual funds.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Sandgards.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
I've never even had that one.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Vanguard.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
ETFs.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
That's like a.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
ETFs are.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
They're cool.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
I think that one is sort of a mutual fund.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Thoughts.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I think that's my favorite.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Seeing and the Barbie movie.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Where.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
Ryan Gosling's realizing that the world is a patriarchy.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
And I was the world's only patriarchy.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
Specifically talking about the scene where I think it's Scott Evans.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
Ken character is just explaining bonds and CDs to someone.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Are you.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Are you not going to tell everyone?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
What?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Oh my god.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
You hooked up with the Ken guy?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Ryan Gosling?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
No.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
There's like 80 kids in the movie.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
That's a little joke.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
What is happening?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Are you not going to tell them?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
We sat in front of them.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
We sat in front of Scott Evans.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Chris Evans brother.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
And all of a sudden.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Kevin.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Yes.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
He was just talking about it.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
He was Ken in the.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
One of the cans in the Barbie movie.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Wow.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Oh.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
He doesn't get awful.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
He's.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
Like Chris Evans is pretty boring looking.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
But like.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Fuck off.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Let's move on.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
He.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
His skin looks like milk.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
I mean.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
He's always been the least attractive of the Hollywood alisters that people say are hot

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
to me.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
His brother looks like the same but not nice.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Chris at least looks like a good person.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
You're a bad person.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
You're a good person.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Because I said suck meat off the bone.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
That wasn't good.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
But that was honestly number 1,000 in a laundry list of things that suck.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Name three things I've done that sucked.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
He said.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
You called Chris Evans skin milky.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
That was just now.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
You said brother looks like a bad person.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I think he does.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
He looks like somebody that would make someone jump in the water party.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
But what I'm saying is the list of things that are bad about you.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Is like I said that a lot.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Okay.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
But that's nothing.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
That's a lot.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
You can say anything.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yeah.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Say anything.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
It's a good band.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
I think I'm serious.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
What are the worst things you've ever done?

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
So like I have no idea how easy you're doing this stuff.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Head in hands.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
What are the worst things Jeff's ever done?

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
The last few weeks you had a bunch of us coming to the office to record a podcast and you just didn't show up.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
And then you said, I'm sorry.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
I spaced.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
You constantly docks people and yourself and sometimes forget to edit it out.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
You send me food and don't tell me so it just rocks on my food waste.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Yeah.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
It's a food waste.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Plus ant problem infestation.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
And it has that you own.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
You would have to fumigate you can't just move.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
It's disgusting.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
The ads team emails me every week because you forget to do something.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Correctly when you upload an episode.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
That's true.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
You do forget.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
You forgot what I just went over teaching.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
What did you just go over teaching?

12:16.000 --> 12:23.000
You forgot everything I taught you about how to upload the podcast.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
So I keep having to fix episodes of your upload.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Meaning.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
I did genuinely forget.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
So why don't you teach me right now so I will do it right.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I feel like this is a teachable moment for you.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
It's not a teachable moment.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
That's a teachable moment.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
The moment.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
The moment when you teachable moment.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
It's a teachable moment.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Yeah.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Sometimes it takes a while to take.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
It doesn't stick.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
If you weren't funny you'd be the worst person ever.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
You have no redeeming qualities.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
He'd be a zero.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
That's actually when I was sick.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
He asked him I was feeling.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
That was very thoughtful.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
That was an automated text.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
That was scheduled months before to actually put you in utilities.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
And I'm trying to come to your defense.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
I don't know why.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
And yesterday I apologize to him privately for ignoring him.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Bagsman and being mean to him in the company slack.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
And he said I didn't have to apologize for either.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
That was pretty nice.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
You ignored him in the company slack.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
No, I ignored him his text.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
And then I was mean to him a little bit in the company slack.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
But that's his slack attitude is like to be antagonistic.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
So it's nice that you play along and prod him back.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Sorry to.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Yeah, sometimes I feel like it goes too far.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
He wants it to be on his terms.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
And I feel like as soon as you kind of step out of that.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
He needles and needles.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
And then you go back and that you're apologizing to him.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I was going to say maybe we do needle for lunch.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
He needles.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
He needles.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Yeah.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Like I need the train fund.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
Such a such an inside jug that I loved.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
Well, I kind of want to introduce the idea of needle because it's the new arms be.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
It really is.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Yeah.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Only it's actually good.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
That's the different idea.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Yeah.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Because arms be we should just for those who don't know.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Actually, I don't know.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Sick own giri balls.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Three inches in diameter.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Rice triangles rounded.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Kind of like a point where they're not even a triangle.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Yeah.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
It was sort of a sphere of rice.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Imagine a grapefruit of rice.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
But instead of seeds, it's a chunk of tuna.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
It was a triangle of badness.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
I would say that there's three components.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Rice fish and like mayo.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Did this start the rice?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
This was the origin of rice, I think.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Because we used to say exactly right.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
It was the only agree of the whole rice story.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
So yeah, there was there were three components.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Rice fish mayo.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
No, I understand.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
And you know, I think at most, you could get away with like a

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Negroni split like one to one to one.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Negroni.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
You know, like me groan is like three.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
We're getting away from the point.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Basically.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Oh, I see what you're saying.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Yeah.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Would be like, let's say 50% rice.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I thought you got only giri wrong.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
No.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Oh, no.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Negroni.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
It's a rice-based drink.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Rice oroni.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
I own a groan.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
It's under groany with sake.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
No, I think it should be like 50%.

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
50% rice, 35% fish, 15% mayo.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
This was nothing near that.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
This was like 80%.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
No, this was like 60% rice.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
For 39% mayo, 1% fish.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
It was absolutely vile.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
So needle by contrast is good.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Completely different food.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
All right.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Yeah, that's true.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
But it has rice.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Yeah.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
We've eaten a needle.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
It's very good.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
We had needle.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
You haven't been there.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
I've never been there.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
I've never been there.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
And I like, yeah.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
It took over my favorite restaurant in L.A.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
So I'm pretty bummed.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Which was what?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Oakberry?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Yeah.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
It was an original.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
The podcast before I was going to have a new role.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Yeah.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Oh, the fuck place.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I wasn't really fun.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
No.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
You know, I was always saying that.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Oh, very being your favorite restaurant in L.A.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Would be so iconic.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Yeah.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
The worst of sight ever, ever.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Hmm.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
What do you guys fear most of the moment?

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
We're going to do the kind of in here for podcasts.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
We're going to do it after the break, man.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Oh, my God.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Oh, my God.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Oh, my God.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Give my bond to the week.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
What's your bond?

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
You said Scott Evans.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
No, I didn't.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Oh.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
My bond of the week.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Hmm.

16:48.000 --> 16:55.000
It's going to be probably the new teacher from hardstopper season two.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
I don't know.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
My worst name.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
But I like to be seen it.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Hmm.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
I don't know either.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Sorry, Marika.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I want to pick up this thread with you, but.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
No, it's fine.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
Oh, just David Tennett.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Oh.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Oh, that's good.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Is it?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Oh, from Doctor Who?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
No.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Sure.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Well, where are you going to say on you?

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Is he the one from the Olivia Coleman?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Yes.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Yeah.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Um, murder shots.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Yes.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Yeah.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
He's great.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
So good.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Mm-hmm.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Great show.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
What's that one called?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Uh, it serves the project.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Yeah.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
We're not allowed to talk about any of this.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Insolidarity with this.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Well, the.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
It's a strict project.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
That's true.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
But it's BBC.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
It's like how?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
No.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Hmm.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Insolidarity with the striking UPS workers.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I think we should have a UPS workers bond.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I thought they figured there should out.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
It's they're going back and forth still.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
I see.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Um, my buddy used to drive for UPS.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
James Johnston.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Awesome.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
So James Bondston.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
That's pretty good.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
It's really good.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Is that fine?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
It's fine.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
It's fine.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
It's fine.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
It's fine.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
It's fine.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
It's fine.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
It's fine.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
That's James.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
That's James.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
That's James.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
He's here.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
He's here.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
He's here.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
He's here.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
He was sitting in this chair.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
It's kind of fun.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Just like you were.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Exactly.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
That's true.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Well, I wasn't on their show.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
They were on your show.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
They never invited me on their show.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
We'll never.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Um.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Um.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
What are you guys most afraid of in the world right now?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
What's that?

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
What?

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Sorry.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
He's collecting himself like a.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
He went like this.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
What are you most afraid of right now?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Just one thing.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
The most.

18:51.000 --> 18:58.000
Sort of inherently one thing.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Yeah.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
I'm not supposed to be lost in doing this show for me too, by the way.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Everybody's exhausted by too.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
He's most afraid of me too.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
No.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
There's no way.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Grace.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
I'll be great.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
I've always preceded with grace and reverence.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Trying to treat people with the utmost respect.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Hmm.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
You just said that Chris Evans skin was a milky.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
I don't think that's the most respect.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I don't think that's a bad thing.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Milky?

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Well, careful.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Well, there's different kinds of milk.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
What if it looks strawberry milky?

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Have you guys ever met somebody with like a sour milk energy?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Hmm.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
You?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
What the fuck?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Very good.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
The bagpire?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
The bagpire?

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Couldn't have seen that coming.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Um.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Who's your bond with me?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Are you already said?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
I thought I said Sandy.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
You did not say anyone.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
We got it this way.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Sandy?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Okay.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Oh, he said he said theater stars.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Yeah.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
A book dropping in a library.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Our next partner is athletic greens.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Guys, I used to take a ton of different vitamins and supplements.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Literally a basket full of f***.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I'm not supposed to say other brands, huh?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Of a bunch of different vitamins and supplements.

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
And there were so many pills that it took like 10 minutes to take them all to get all the nutrients that I needed.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
But then, Micah had had gum introduced me to AG one by athletic greens.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
And I was like, this has literally every mineral in vitamin.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
I was taking by pill in an all-in-one nutritional insurance.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
And it tasted great.

20:36.000 --> 20:42.000
And now I can casually sip as I start my day instead of stopping everything taking pill pill pill.

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
Uh, and it is just hard, you know, to keep up with a traditional supplement routine.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I'm not alone in feeling that way.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
And very quickly, I realized that AG one fit into my lifestyle a lot better.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Because like I said, you can sip it casually while you do other things.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
I will wake up.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
I'll have a glass of water.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Then I have my AG one.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
And then I have my coffee.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
And then I'm off to the races.

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
And I've quickly noticed that it helps with my mental clarity and alertness, sleep quality for sure.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
Uh, and overall just feeling like I'm doing one thing for my health every day.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
And even that mentally can be really helpful in getting other stuff done.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
Every scoop is packed with 75 vitamins, minerals, and whole food sourced ingredients of the highest quality.

21:19.000 --> 21:25.000
That give major benefits like gut and mood support, boosted energy, and even healthier looking skin hair and nails.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
AG one is delivered right to your door every month, making it super easy to make it a daily habit.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
It's very easy for me.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I never even have to think about it.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
And because of the subscription, every time I'm nearing, you know, the end of my supply, boom, it's right there at my front door.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Could not be easier.

21:39.000 --> 21:48.000
So if you're looking for an easier way to take supplements, athletic greens is giving you a free one year supply of vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Go to athletic greens.com slash what's that?

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
Again, that's athletic greens.com slash what's that?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Check it out.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
Oh, we're coming out of my belly.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Half of the show, right?

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Let's get the energy.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Let's get some interviews.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Let's talk about them.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Maybe we'll be funny.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Maybe we'll all get smiley and like happy.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
You know, this kind of feels like when I was a kid.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Why?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Because my parents would argue, right?

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
And I would be like, oh my god, are they going to get a divorce?

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
And I'd have to like take two people who look so upset.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
I would have to take two people who look so upset at each other at me.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
And, you know, my dad will go like, it's your fault.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
If we break up, it's your fault.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
And me just trying to be like, hey, let's all be happy, you know?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Yeah.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
The clown.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Sort of the gesture.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
Maybe not clown.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Because gestures of job and clown is an art.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
I was told once that that's like a younger sibling energy.

22:37.000 --> 22:43.000
It's like you're the the youngest like in a wolf pack is just there to not create drama.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
You're just like solve it.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Go with the flow.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Trying a lot of it.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
It's interesting to listen in her harmony.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Yeah.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Yeah.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
Somebody was trying to like persuade my listeners through that one.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Yeah.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
I'm the youngest child.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
It's like, oh, you don't.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
You don't ever have a strong opinion because you don't want to ruffle any feathers.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
No, I do.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Yeah.

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
And then you're trying to make levity in trying to like create a care free attitude and dramatic

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
situation.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
What he's talking about is middle child syndrome.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
And it's just that he has middle child energy as a youngest.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Nope.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Jeff, are you the baby?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
No.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
No.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
No.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
No.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
No.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
No.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
No.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
No.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
No.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
This show is sponsored by better help.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
Guys, sometimes you feel uncertain in life.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
You know, where are you headed?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
What is the right path to take?

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
How am I going to navigate this tricky time in my life?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
I mean, I'll be honest.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
I'm going through one right now.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
A lot of my best friends have moved to New York.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
And I'm left wondering, you know, what should I do?

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
What hobbies should I devote myself to?

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
How do you make new friends as an adult?

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
You know, we're always faced with crossroads in life.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
And we don't know what path to take sometimes.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
And that decision is really difficult when you're doing it on your own.

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
But whatever it is, therapy can help you map out your future and trust yourself to find

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
the way forward.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
I'm in therapy every week.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
My therapist is working overtime right now.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
Trying to help me figure out my whole life plan.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
But I can confidently say that I am a different and better version of myself,

24:18.000 --> 24:24.000
comparing when I started to therapy, started in therapy, and now cannot recommend it highly enough.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
So if you're thinking of starting therapy, give better help a try.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
It's entirely online designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000

Youngest of five.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Not me.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Youngest of two.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
I'm not the youngest of five.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Hmm.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
To get into some reviews.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Yeah.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Cleaner reall the youngest sibling.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Where are you?

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
I guess technically.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
I have half siblings.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
But they're all over me.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Yeah.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
So we're all the youngest child.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
That's interesting.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
A bunch of clowns.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Yeah.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Okay.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Just.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Justers.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
He says.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
This review is from low 817.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Um.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Low boss worth.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
No.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Ha ha.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
First episode is like standing near a group of headroom employees and Jeff,

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
and over here in their conversations.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
They speak as if we already know who they are, and as well as all their friends.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Listen to all episodes so far.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
It doesn't get Jeff or there's no structure.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
I listened to if I were you too, and that podcast revolves around a different format.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
The lack of grammar and surplus of spelling errors in the headgum podcast five star reviews

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
has a lot about how funny their demographic is.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Jake and him are in their late 40s now, right?

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
But they still are young and funny.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
And I bet most of their fans are under 30.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I'm so happy for them.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Those really.

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
They also said, and you've got Hay riddle riddle on your network.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
That's amazing.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
So, I, to Hay riddle riddle.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
Really don't appreciate Marie go like hovering over my shoulder.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
Having the apple podcasts pulled up because I didn't want to look less into it.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Yeah.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
I could tell you don't want to include it, but I had a marketing.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
I do want to include it because we love to give a shout out to other podcasts.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I can never mind.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
Honestly, the main point of this podcast is to illuminate different shows on our network.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Oh.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Why doesn't Jeff do that?

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Why doesn't Jeff do that?

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Well, he does the opposite.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
He sort of suppresses it even when they accident.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
But is it not what we're paying him for?

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
I thought so, but he sort of taken the nuclear football and ran away.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
I don't know what that.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
So, second review.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
This title, the actually five stars.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
As a women.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
Do you read these beforehand?

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
It looks like they're shocking you.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
They are.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
So you hadn't read any of these.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Why would I do that?

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
So you wouldn't get my natural reaction.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Yeah.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
These are a born performer.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Just yeah.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Whenever you find skim one that you.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
What do you say about women?

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
It was like a second part to the other.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Or you.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I was going to have to cut it.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
I was doing that to make you guys laugh here and now.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Beautiful.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Here we go.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
To the core.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
From Nick name is already taken.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
The title's Jeffrey James.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Colin.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Now.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
A piece of.

27:42.000 --> 27:49.000
A piece of absorbent material wrapped around a person's bottom.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
Between their legs to absorb and retain urine and feces.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Folks, I'm being kind here.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
He thinks I'm a diaper man.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
But you know what?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
He's not wrong.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
Because I do kind of catch a lot of shit on this fucking show.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
That's pretty good.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
That.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
I.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Bars.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
I'm hearing a.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Siren.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Is that a siren?

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
I thought it was like a.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Yeah.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
I'm coming to get me.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Um.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Marie, can we should say.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Stop.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
No.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
It's like a.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
That's kind of like unheard of.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Right.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Where.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Yeah.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
Obviously cut that.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Okay.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
What even is anything after the break that I've got to cut.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
So we're very little as well.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
By the way, I'm going to chop it up.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
It'll all be cut out.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
But it's going to be chopped up not smoothly.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
So people know how much it's been taken.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Exactly.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Exactly.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Yeah.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Is that going to be.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Are you writing your own vows?

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Are you writing?

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Yes.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Really?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
What do you think I was going to just take it from a fucking book of

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
poetry or something?

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Kind of.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Yeah.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Yes.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Why didn't.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
At that.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
At that idea.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Writing your own vows.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
You're not going to quote like.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Well, we're going to say Shakespeare.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
I was going to say shagal.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Who's a visual artist.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Yeah.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
I'm quoting a stained glass.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
Artists or glass.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Got it.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
Um.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Here we go.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
This is from Birch 91.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
Oh, I saw.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
That.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
What's that play?

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Here it's a.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Meritay.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Yeah.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Martin's spot.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Weird spot.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
It's kind of awesome.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
You know who else has been there.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
John Mayer.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
You know, we walk in through.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Have you ever been to Meritay?

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
No.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
I never even heard of it.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
Is it new?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
It's new.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
It's new.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
It's new.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
It's new.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
It's new.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
It's new.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
It's new.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
It's new.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
It's new.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
It's new.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
It's new.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
It's new.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
It's new.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
I'm like, I can't believe this even exists back here.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
I don't even know it was before.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
They let people in their late 40s.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Well, they don't actually.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
I'm 40.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Point five.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
So very early 40s.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
It's like he doesn't even read.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
I do.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
What's that?

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
I was told that the food there was bad, but the drinks are good.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
And have.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Well, how would you experience everything that's.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Every place now.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Yeah.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
I didn't eat there.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Only get a drink.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Yeah.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Got a drink.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.500
Can you read the review?

30:25.500 --> 30:26.500
Yep.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.000
This is from Birch 91.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Five stars?

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
No one man should have all that sour.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Good.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
Listening to this feels like I'm trying to cut water with a pair of scissors.

30:37.000 --> 30:45.000
Additionally, I'm going to make Jeff drink a non-ganset beer and watch him wither away like a vampire exposed to direct sunlight.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
We haven't talked about ganset in a while.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
It kind of like was one of those in beer citizenship that sort of fades away.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
You know that kind of ambience it or shit.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I feel like you don't drink beer that much anymore.

30:58.000 --> 31:03.000
Can you control F the reviews for all of our names?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Uh, that's not possible.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
You can't search.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
You can't use like it's a text document.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Yes.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
No, not on Apple podcast I just tried.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
Maybe if I was on the website or something, but I don't really care to open Google Chromebook.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
I think we should look at YouTube comments more than...

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Can you search those?

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Apple podcast reviews.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
That's probably smarter.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
I would say so far we have zero after the break.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
It's been a...

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Maybe the one line about the restaurant?

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
Yeah, but even then it was just like...

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
It didn't mention my personal life, so it's going to be gone.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Okay.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
There was...

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
There was one review that was sort of mid that we read.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
But they did say that you were in your late 40s, which we should keep.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Yeah, that's part of this morning.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Do you think they really think that?

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Or is that a joke?

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
I think the whole thing was kind of...

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
It's not that far from how old you are.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
This is really funny.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Um, nine years off piece.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
This is a comment from at 1-2-2 Go Green on last week's episode.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
I'm here to tell a true story.

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
Last night I had a dream that Jeff was hired to be on SML.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
I saw it on his Twitter.

32:11.000 --> 32:16.000
He was thanking everyone and said he'd look fondly on the days where he was just Jeffrey the dumbass.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
Here's the kicker though.

32:17.000 --> 32:23.000
To mark his debut in the world of show business, he had adopted a new stage name.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Tony Zero.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Yeah.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
That's pretty good.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
All right.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Tony.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
It's like Tony Clifton, but it's zero.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
That's really funny.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Yeah.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
If that was the case and I was Tony Zero on SNL,

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
you know how they get to choose their...

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
We're in your...

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
We're in New York.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
They're going to do their intro video.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Mine would be like getting a parking ticket.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
It's good.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
I'm liking rage.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I thought it was going to be a zero world trade server.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
It's also pretty good.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Ground Zero.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Ground Tony Zero.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
That's what it looks like.

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
Eating a spiral pizza over a fucking dumpster.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
It's me getting grounded at Ground Zero.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Oh god.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
Like a construction worker shows me to the ground.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Um...

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I'm going to call.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
It's okay.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
Uh, so far nothing has been usable after the break I think.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
I...

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I got the...

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
The address of one world trade server wrong.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
You don't have to cut that.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
It's definitely not zero.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
I don't think any address has ever been zero.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
It's ground zero, but that's confusing.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Yeah.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
One world trade and then ground zero.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Why wouldn't they call it zero world trade?

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
I don't think an address could be zero.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
Of course, again.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
I don't think so.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Marica?

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Hmm?

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Can an address be zero?

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Can we get a numbers crunch on that?

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
What?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Can we go this one from At Mr. Ballof?

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
I love when this clock has-

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
I love when this clock has-

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Listen if we know what-

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Mr. Ballof?

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Ooh, ooh.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Ooh.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Oh, of course, Mr. Ballofa.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
They call man.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Mr. Boom, Flafo.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Fiffa, Lofo.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
No.

34:04.000 --> 34:09.900
Boom, boom, I'm gonna do a different one.

34:09.900 --> 34:12.880
She's as Christ unusable to the core.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.600
Zero percent of this has been good.

34:14.600 --> 34:15.480
Tony Zero.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.000
Tony Zero is good actually.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.200
What I'm saying is he's gonna try to keep it at zero.

34:21.640 --> 34:24.880
Let's see if we can get a zero usable back half of the episode.

34:24.880 --> 34:28.280
I'm really curious to hear what everything after the break will sound like.

34:28.280 --> 34:32.200
It's gonna sound like some sort of weird choppy nothing is that he created.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.360
Tony Zero.

34:33.360 --> 34:35.800
And five with bull, bull, bull, fah.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.880
I'm on last week's episode.

34:43.880 --> 34:45.160
Yeah, I'm on tip.

34:45.160 --> 34:46.360
Thoughts.

34:46.360 --> 34:52.680
Thoughts is Maria is sort of saving your ass because you're just sort of silently reading reviews right now.

34:52.680 --> 34:56.840
Yeah, I was gonna read some comments.

34:56.840 --> 35:02.720
Someone said from last week, the are grits race, grits count as race.

35:02.760 --> 35:05.720
Absolute comedic moment of the century.

35:05.720 --> 35:06.920
Wow.

35:06.920 --> 35:10.320
How does that make you feel Jeff of the century?

35:10.320 --> 35:12.120
Well, it's obviously hyperbole, right?

35:12.120 --> 35:13.320
They don't actually mean that.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.520
Did you see the clip from yesterday?

35:15.520 --> 35:16.720
What happened?

35:16.720 --> 35:18.120
I don't know where I'm to cut this.

35:18.120 --> 35:19.320
Yeah.

35:19.320 --> 35:21.520
Resisting is sad.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.120
Did you see really kind of?

35:23.120 --> 35:25.720
This is from the burning all the right episode,

35:25.720 --> 35:27.920
which was the powerhouse women episode.

35:27.920 --> 35:32.460
At Alex D.H. 2001 said there's something so funny about Jeff being a disembodied

35:32.460 --> 35:36.180
voice for most of the pod while the camera is on the women.

35:36.180 --> 35:37.180
Careful.

35:37.180 --> 35:45.020
And then cutting to his smug face whenever he does a mediocre word play.

35:45.020 --> 35:47.020
How many stars?

35:47.020 --> 35:48.020
Oh, that's not YouTube.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.020
Oh, that's not YouTube.

35:49.020 --> 35:50.020
Got it.

35:50.020 --> 35:52.220
How many are there in this video for you?

35:52.220 --> 35:53.220
Um.

35:53.220 --> 35:57.900
So much silence.

35:57.900 --> 36:02.420
It's just going to be chopped up, chopped up and then yeah, I'll review that.

36:02.860 --> 36:03.860
And then silence.

36:03.860 --> 36:05.100
And Daddy Tuesday night.

36:05.100 --> 36:08.340
Jeff is like a hot nasty, scolding man, man.

36:08.340 --> 36:10.060
I can't get enough, but I've had enough.

36:10.060 --> 36:12.820
He's slime and a dime and definitely past his prime.

36:12.820 --> 36:14.140
Right here, buddy.

36:14.140 --> 36:14.940
Coolish shit.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.220
Love you, man.

36:16.220 --> 36:18.220
And he's doing the emoji, the middle finger.

36:18.220 --> 36:19.780
You're doing the bad guessing.

36:19.780 --> 36:23.540
You know, there's a middle finger emoji.

36:23.540 --> 36:27.700
Doesn't that seem kind of crass for like the most g-rated thing

36:27.700 --> 36:29.420
that you could put on your iPhone?

36:29.420 --> 36:31.300
Yeah, like we had to take a water gun or whatever.

36:31.300 --> 36:32.300
Right.

36:32.300 --> 36:33.660
But you have a straight up middle finger.

36:33.660 --> 36:35.340
That means fuck.

36:35.340 --> 36:36.340
That means fuck.

36:36.340 --> 36:38.660
Anyway, you slice it.

36:38.660 --> 36:39.660
It's the effort.

36:39.660 --> 36:40.980
We've never done this.

36:40.980 --> 36:42.660
We've never done this.

36:42.660 --> 36:43.660
But four minutes on the board.

36:43.660 --> 36:44.660
It's a mirror's druthers.

36:44.660 --> 36:45.660
Oh my god.

36:45.660 --> 36:46.660
Yes.

36:46.660 --> 36:47.660
Yeah.

36:47.660 --> 36:59.940
When you're driving with someone or you're navigating somewhere, like on a hike or a

36:59.940 --> 37:03.860
ride or whatever, some sort of journey.

37:03.860 --> 37:08.500
And somebody recommends going one way and you recommend going another.

37:08.500 --> 37:09.500
I find it.

37:09.500 --> 37:15.900
It's always useful to go their way because whether it's a 50 50 shot, which when it's

37:15.900 --> 37:18.740
faster, you can never prove that your way is faster.

37:18.740 --> 37:21.620
They can always just call you out on your way being worse.

37:21.620 --> 37:22.620
So just yeah, sure.

37:22.620 --> 37:24.100
Go your way.

37:24.100 --> 37:27.700
If it's slower, I won't mention anything and if it's faster than you were right.

37:27.700 --> 37:30.980
I basically, I'm a martyr for this trip.

37:30.980 --> 37:34.420
And if we go my way and it's slower, I'll never fucking hear the end of it.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.700
Oh, we should have done the other way.

37:36.700 --> 37:41.940
I'm in an Uber to LAX.

37:41.940 --> 37:49.180
His ways or his Google Maps says take side streets to the highway halfway to the airport.

37:49.180 --> 37:52.820
And he's like, no, trust me, I've been doing this for like five years.

37:52.820 --> 37:53.820
This way is faster.

37:53.820 --> 37:57.300
I'm like, why do you, how do you think you know

37:57.300 --> 37:58.300
live traffic?

37:58.300 --> 38:01.700
Like, I know you think the fastest way to get there is to get on the highway right

38:01.700 --> 38:02.700
here.

38:02.700 --> 38:04.900
But Google Maps is saying that there's a lot of traffic on the highway.

38:04.900 --> 38:09.420
So take side streets until they're like, all right, whatever you say, boss, I'm like,

38:09.420 --> 38:10.420
it's not me.

38:10.420 --> 38:13.020
I'm just looking, I trust the technology.

38:13.020 --> 38:14.020
I'm not calling you out.

38:14.020 --> 38:17.900
By the way, five years is not a long time to be a driver to the point where you think

38:17.900 --> 38:23.860
you know what the traffic will be like on the freeway before we even there.

38:23.860 --> 38:26.020
Furthermore, you get on like these ways.

38:26.020 --> 38:31.860
These GPS apps and it's just like, there's a, there's a car stopped in 0.5 miles.

38:31.860 --> 38:33.780
Is it still there?

38:33.780 --> 38:34.780
I don't know.

38:34.780 --> 38:35.780
Yes.

38:35.780 --> 38:37.260
Half a fucking mile down the road.

38:37.260 --> 38:38.260
Do you want me to answer right now?

38:38.260 --> 38:39.260
No.

38:39.260 --> 38:40.260
They're giving me the option right now.

38:40.260 --> 38:44.020
They're say, car stopped in 0.5 miles, is it still there?

38:44.020 --> 38:45.020
Yeah.

38:45.020 --> 38:46.020
It's still there.

38:46.020 --> 38:47.020
I'm guessing.

38:47.020 --> 38:48.020
I don't fucking know.

38:48.020 --> 38:49.380
It's half a mile down the road.

38:49.380 --> 38:50.980
Ask me when I get there.

38:50.980 --> 38:51.980
You know what I mean?

38:51.980 --> 38:54.220
There's no point in like me weighing in now.

38:54.220 --> 39:00.340
Also, don't rely on people fucking looking at the GPS and being like, uh, yeah, hold on.

39:00.340 --> 39:05.220
Let me press if it's here because I'm still driving how about we're at the point in

39:05.220 --> 39:11.220
society and technology that you can get a fucking GPS camera and you tell me if it's

39:11.220 --> 39:12.220
still there.

39:12.220 --> 39:13.940
And who cares if it's still there?

39:13.940 --> 39:16.460
Is a car stopped on the side of the road?

39:16.460 --> 39:17.460
Sure.

39:17.460 --> 39:18.460
It doesn't matter.

39:18.460 --> 39:20.460
It's not affecting anything.

39:20.460 --> 39:24.100
I'm worried about if there's still a road.

39:24.100 --> 39:27.540
On the side of the road, yeah, we drove fast to car.

39:27.540 --> 39:31.140
Let me weigh in like it's a fucking online pole.

39:31.140 --> 39:34.420
This isn't a doodle where I have to weigh in on shit.

39:34.420 --> 39:35.660
This is a GPS system.

39:35.660 --> 39:37.980
Just telling me the fastest way to get there.

39:37.980 --> 39:43.420
Also, if I'm using ways and my buddies using Google Maps, it's telling me two different

39:43.420 --> 39:44.820
ways to get there.

39:44.820 --> 39:46.420
Didn't Google buy ways?

39:46.420 --> 39:51.020
Aren't they all using the same open source, live traffic technology?

39:51.020 --> 39:53.860
Remember when you're listening on the radio and they're like, all right, we got a helicopter

39:53.860 --> 39:57.940
up in the air and there's some traffic over here and there's some traffic over there.

39:57.940 --> 40:02.660
Are people still flying up in helicopters or are we just like over that?

40:02.660 --> 40:05.380
Like why do we need helicopters at all anymore?

40:05.380 --> 40:06.860
They should all be like diverted.

40:06.860 --> 40:14.660
Those funds should go to like fucking fire, like men using helicopters to drop.

40:14.660 --> 40:19.820
I think water, but maybe some sort of like gray sludge debris, whatever the fuck.

40:19.820 --> 40:23.820
I guess we're past water, even though I see, I still see hydrants everywhere.

40:23.820 --> 40:24.820
That's water.

40:24.820 --> 40:28.780
Why don't we fill the hydrants up with a gray shit that they drop on fires?

40:28.780 --> 40:32.260
Also, what's the point of like trying to contain a forest fire?

40:32.260 --> 40:35.260
These things are going hog wild in Canada.

40:35.260 --> 40:37.260
Yeah, let me lie.

40:37.260 --> 40:38.860
They have a fucking helicopter.

40:38.860 --> 40:39.860
I could try to slow down.

40:39.860 --> 40:40.860
No, you can out slow it down.

40:40.860 --> 40:45.660
The size of fucking Texas, you're wasting your time, you're energy, you're effort.

40:45.660 --> 40:51.020
Those helicopters could be used to tell me the live traffic update or maybe there's a car

40:51.020 --> 40:52.660
on the fucking side of the road.

40:52.740 --> 40:57.020
You guys can tell me about from your helicopter, so I don't have to weigh in while I'm on my

40:57.020 --> 41:02.300
while I'm driving to sort of you've cast my vote as to whether something is on the side

41:02.300 --> 41:03.300
of the road or not.

41:03.300 --> 41:04.300
I have a pitch.

41:04.300 --> 41:06.660
That's how you do a druthers.

41:06.660 --> 41:07.660
Marika.

41:07.660 --> 41:08.660
I have a pitch.

41:08.660 --> 41:09.660
I have a pitch.

41:09.660 --> 41:10.660
That's a rough.

41:10.660 --> 41:12.900
The spirit of druthers.

41:12.900 --> 41:13.900
That's a rant.

41:13.900 --> 41:14.900
I have a pitch.

41:14.900 --> 41:15.900
Yeah.

41:15.900 --> 41:16.900
Go to break.

41:16.900 --> 41:21.300
Come back from break, just cut to that.

41:22.020 --> 41:27.620
Just keep everything else in, sort of the reverse what we expect.

41:27.620 --> 41:30.460
That's harder for grace, because there's so many more cuts we have to make, but I think

41:30.460 --> 41:39.540
we should come back with a mirror talking about being in an Uber and having a power

41:39.540 --> 41:42.180
of battle of wills between him and the Uber driver.

41:42.180 --> 41:47.580
I think that you're driving in tandem with who's taking Google Maps and you're taking

41:47.580 --> 41:48.580
ways.

41:48.580 --> 41:49.580
Yeah.

41:49.580 --> 41:58.900
If we're both leaving on a ship, or not recording, or no, the SSD just finished.

41:58.900 --> 41:59.900
Holy shit.

41:59.900 --> 42:00.900
That's never happened.

42:00.900 --> 42:03.860
I've never even tried to check.

42:03.860 --> 42:04.860
Take that.

42:04.860 --> 42:06.460
Take the blue one that says audio.

42:06.460 --> 42:09.100
So it's at like 39 minutes left when you start.

42:09.100 --> 42:10.100
What?

42:10.100 --> 42:11.100
What?

42:11.100 --> 42:13.100
Why did it stop?

42:13.100 --> 42:14.100
Just now.

42:14.100 --> 42:15.100
Okay.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.100
Wow.

42:16.100 --> 42:25.100
That's really helping none of the second half was in.

42:25.100 --> 42:28.100
We're the first half, do you?

42:28.100 --> 42:29.100
Oh.

42:29.100 --> 42:33.860
This is going to be a load to edit for me.

42:33.860 --> 42:34.860
Yeah.

42:34.860 --> 42:36.060
But you're saying it's not for Friday.

42:36.060 --> 42:37.060
It's for a week from Friday.

42:37.060 --> 42:38.060
We come Friday.

42:38.060 --> 42:39.060
Friday is already uploaded.

42:39.060 --> 42:40.060
Look at that.

42:40.060 --> 42:41.060
Yeah.

42:41.060 --> 42:42.060
That's really, really proud of you.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.380
You're so hot in my apartment last night.

42:43.380 --> 42:45.740
I didn't get, I didn't get to sleep until 5 a.m.

42:45.740 --> 42:46.740
Did you get to sleep?

42:46.740 --> 42:47.740
I do.

42:47.740 --> 42:49.180
And it was still too hot.

42:49.180 --> 42:50.700
It's like a really old AC.

42:50.700 --> 42:52.180
I don't think it works very well.

42:52.180 --> 42:58.300
I'd need to replace it, but I'm on the, well, I'm on the 18th floor, let's just say.

42:58.300 --> 42:59.300
I'm not.

42:59.300 --> 43:03.180
I just don't want people to know anything.

43:03.180 --> 43:04.580
It's high up.

43:04.580 --> 43:06.980
We also didn't ask.

43:06.980 --> 43:07.980
What is specific?

43:07.980 --> 43:11.500
I don't mean we didn't, you, you like walk yourself into these.

43:11.500 --> 43:15.660
Also, wasn't it cooler than like 70 degrees outside, like can you just open the window?

43:15.660 --> 43:16.660
Isn't that hot?

43:16.660 --> 43:17.660
We're right.

43:17.660 --> 43:18.660
No, yeah.

43:18.660 --> 43:19.660
I'm here taking issues off.

43:19.660 --> 43:30.660
So about your thing, I was with you.

43:30.660 --> 43:33.660
Like, I started off fine.

43:33.660 --> 43:38.380
We were like, it's just like a Jenga tower exploded all over our laps.

43:38.380 --> 43:42.500
We had like, two months of solid episodes, maybe like six weeks.

43:42.500 --> 43:45.340
And then starting with pile, there's been a demise.

43:45.340 --> 43:48.700
I don't say that while we're still recording.

43:48.700 --> 43:49.700
We can start taking time.

43:49.700 --> 43:50.700
Okay.

43:50.700 --> 43:51.700
How do we turn it around, I guess?

43:51.700 --> 43:52.700
I think it's on Marika.

43:52.700 --> 43:56.300
She's been saying nothing.

43:56.300 --> 43:58.780
You just said that the hard drive stopped.

43:58.780 --> 44:01.220
You gave me no indication that we're back.

44:01.220 --> 44:03.220
You just, I think.

44:03.220 --> 44:04.220
I can't see you.

44:04.220 --> 44:07.220
I can't see anybody.

44:07.220 --> 44:08.220
I can't see anybody.

44:08.220 --> 44:10.220
I'm looking at myself.

44:10.220 --> 44:12.580
You're in a lot of other podcasts, records, right?

44:12.580 --> 44:13.580
Yeah.

44:13.580 --> 44:15.220
Do they go like this?

44:15.780 --> 44:18.260
But they usually have a plan.

44:18.260 --> 44:19.260
Really?

44:19.260 --> 44:23.060
Or you spent half of the episode, skimming,

44:23.060 --> 44:24.260
leading reviews to yourself.

44:24.260 --> 44:27.700
And it was crazy because he wasn't like, oh, I have to find one and just like,

44:27.700 --> 44:29.460
no, you really said that.

44:29.460 --> 44:31.300
Marika, we're awful, unusable.

44:31.300 --> 44:33.260
Yes, you're not going to use any of it.

44:33.260 --> 44:34.980
Maybe Tony's zero.

44:34.980 --> 44:37.700
Tony's, we'll come back from the break.

44:37.700 --> 44:38.940
We'll use Tony's zero.

44:38.940 --> 44:40.660
Tony's zero, get up with the hero.

44:40.660 --> 44:43.540
And then emures your others.

44:43.540 --> 44:46.540
But that means that we have to wax for another 40 minutes.

44:46.540 --> 44:48.740
I think that we have to call that something else besides

44:48.740 --> 44:49.660
a mirror's dryers.

44:49.660 --> 44:51.460
That's not the spirit of dryers.

44:51.460 --> 44:52.540
That's the spirit of dryers.

44:52.540 --> 44:53.900
That's always been a spirit of dryers.

44:53.900 --> 44:54.740
You've always dryed there.

44:54.740 --> 44:57.100
What's the spirit of dryers?

44:57.100 --> 44:58.940
What did you say, what is?

44:58.940 --> 45:03.060
He was talking about if he had his dryers, things would be different.

45:03.060 --> 45:04.580
That's mirrors dryers.

45:04.580 --> 45:05.740
No.

45:05.740 --> 45:08.500
First of all, I didn't say if I had my dryers,

45:08.500 --> 45:13.020
he was just ranting about various,

45:13.060 --> 45:15.860
traffic concepts.

45:15.860 --> 45:19.500
And I guess gray sludge that they pour on fires.

45:19.500 --> 45:22.620
And how that should be in fire hydrants.

45:22.620 --> 45:25.780
Yeah, what did you guys agree with the most?

45:25.780 --> 45:27.620
And what did you guys disagree with the most?

45:27.620 --> 45:29.220
Oh, I can start.

45:29.220 --> 45:31.140
So I was with you at the top,

45:31.140 --> 45:33.820
where like, which I think is a little sibling energy,

45:33.820 --> 45:36.100
where you're like, I'm just going to keep the piece

45:36.100 --> 45:37.980
and do what the person next to me suggesting

45:37.980 --> 45:40.500
because if they're wrong, it's on them.

45:40.500 --> 45:42.820
And I get to be able to feel a little bit superior.

45:42.820 --> 45:45.340
But then it turned out that that's like a conversation

45:45.340 --> 45:49.420
and like a battle of wills that you're having

45:49.420 --> 45:51.460
with an Uber driver, which is,

45:51.460 --> 45:53.460
well, I was sort of flying all over the place.

45:53.460 --> 45:55.180
But sometimes I do, I will get an Uber driver

45:55.180 --> 45:57.060
that wants to override the GPS

45:57.060 --> 45:59.180
because he thinks he knows best.

45:59.180 --> 46:01.180
And you're having like a,

46:01.180 --> 46:03.660
and I'm just like, there's no way you can know

46:03.660 --> 46:04.500
what the traffic is.

46:04.500 --> 46:05.340
Do you say this to him?

46:05.340 --> 46:07.180
No, I'm like, can you already did this?

46:07.180 --> 46:08.340
Yeah.

46:08.340 --> 46:11.660
Speaking of Uber drivers, I got a served

46:11.660 --> 46:16.540
a compilation video today of all of Jake's

46:17.540 --> 46:19.940
Mr. Uber driver's stories.

46:19.940 --> 46:20.780
Oh, that's good.

46:20.780 --> 46:21.460
Hold up.

46:21.460 --> 46:23.780
Wow, they're so funny.

46:23.780 --> 46:25.620
A character based on a filter,

46:25.620 --> 46:27.220
that's Snapchat you sad.

46:28.220 --> 46:29.060
His name?

46:29.060 --> 46:30.780
No, Leslie.

46:35.780 --> 46:38.700
Great name, a British dandy.

46:38.700 --> 46:41.220
Oh, so why were you the Uber driver?

46:41.220 --> 46:43.220
I don't know, so does I wasn't even driving.

46:45.620 --> 46:47.700
You guys ever get Uber drivers that want to

46:47.700 --> 46:50.500
issue the GPS, the navigation,

46:50.500 --> 46:51.900
they're like, because they know better.

46:51.900 --> 46:53.220
I get Uber drivers that are like,

46:53.220 --> 46:54.740
which way do you want to go, sir?

46:54.740 --> 46:55.580
All right.

46:55.580 --> 46:57.460
And then you say, just the GPS or like,

46:57.460 --> 46:59.740
all right, let me fucking hardwire into my ass

46:59.740 --> 47:00.980
and I'll tell you which way to go.

47:00.980 --> 47:02.100
I'm in the front seat.

47:02.100 --> 47:02.900
You're in the front?

47:02.900 --> 47:05.340
I'm pointing, left, right, center.

47:05.340 --> 47:06.860
You're telling them to switch lanes.

47:06.860 --> 47:08.700
Yeah, I'm telling them to get out of this

47:08.700 --> 47:09.540
for some reason.

47:10.500 --> 47:12.620
Yeah, he's on the hood of the car.

47:12.620 --> 47:13.980
Yeah, I'm like,

47:13.980 --> 47:17.220
cleaning the like fucking thing on top

47:17.220 --> 47:19.100
that you can like put, yeah.

47:23.100 --> 47:24.900
I had a board give me the strength.

47:26.900 --> 47:28.860
Why don't you guys lead some shit for once?

47:28.860 --> 47:29.460
I don't know.

47:29.460 --> 47:30.460
I'm out of my ears.

47:30.460 --> 47:31.620
Tell us clearly.

47:31.620 --> 47:32.540
Yes, for now.

47:32.540 --> 47:34.220
I have other ideas that the network keeps saying,

47:34.220 --> 47:34.980
oh, we don't have the money.

47:34.980 --> 47:36.380
I'm like, can I put some money into it?

47:36.380 --> 47:36.900
My own money?

47:36.900 --> 47:38.220
And they're like, no, we can't let you do that.

47:38.220 --> 47:39.900
I'm like, I don't understand that at all.

47:39.900 --> 47:44.340
The same is just talking and having a plan for an episode.

47:44.340 --> 47:48.860
Also, I will say that if you're pitching something to some.

47:48.860 --> 47:50.580
This is just a little bit of free advice.

47:50.580 --> 47:51.660
You're pitching something to someone

47:51.660 --> 47:53.900
and they say we don't have the budget for it.

47:53.900 --> 47:56.060
And then you say, I'll pay for myself

47:56.060 --> 47:57.260
and they still say no.

47:58.460 --> 48:02.260
That's like, that's them politely saying we don't want to do it.

48:02.260 --> 48:03.660
The idea is, well,

48:03.660 --> 48:05.140
because Katie said they want to do it.

48:05.140 --> 48:06.460
I want to do it.

48:06.460 --> 48:07.300
Yeah, to be clear.

48:07.820 --> 48:10.940
OK, OK, first of all, why is this the first time?

48:10.940 --> 48:14.460
Why is it the first time we're all taking each other seriously on this?

48:17.460 --> 48:20.540
I have ideas to break the old.

48:20.540 --> 48:23.820
Maria comes to Jeff's defense for no reason.

48:23.820 --> 48:24.700
For no reason.

48:24.700 --> 48:25.980
Jeff, I was in kidding.

48:25.980 --> 48:26.980
Yeah.

48:26.980 --> 48:29.980
I just want to make two things happen.

48:29.980 --> 48:32.980
They rarely can't even see your face.

48:32.980 --> 48:34.780
I only see your legs.

48:34.780 --> 48:36.020
That's not the case.

48:36.020 --> 48:38.340
So it's holding the show back at this point.

48:38.340 --> 48:39.180
It's just funny.

48:39.180 --> 48:42.380
It's funny that you're saying, we can't afford it.

48:42.380 --> 48:43.580
And then you're saying, I'll pay for it.

48:43.580 --> 48:45.020
It's really not saying no.

48:45.020 --> 48:46.300
It's true.

48:46.300 --> 48:47.620
I don't understand it at all.

48:47.620 --> 48:49.660
I have, at this point, I'm going to do it myself.

48:49.660 --> 48:51.460
And then we'll do it live.

48:51.460 --> 48:54.420
No, what's an example of something that you want to pay for?

48:54.420 --> 48:57.820
I can't say, I can't say it to you.

48:57.820 --> 48:59.220
Jeff, we'll talk about this also.

48:59.220 --> 49:00.220
We'll talk about it offline.

49:00.220 --> 49:03.420
I just said, you already know what we're going to do.

49:03.660 --> 49:04.660
No, I don't.

49:04.660 --> 49:05.660
Yes, you do.

49:05.660 --> 49:06.660
Here we go.

49:06.660 --> 49:09.180
Casey Donnie here in the studio.

49:09.180 --> 49:10.180
And he doesn't look happy.

49:10.180 --> 49:13.220
Get him in here.

49:13.220 --> 49:15.140
He's giving me the wrap it up.

49:15.140 --> 49:16.140
It is almost wrong.

49:16.140 --> 49:17.500
He's coming in at one.

49:17.500 --> 49:19.500
We have a studio tour.

49:19.500 --> 49:20.500
Someone's with you.

49:20.500 --> 49:21.500
Not telling.

49:21.500 --> 49:22.500
Well, I'll believe it.

49:22.500 --> 49:23.500
Bleep it.

49:23.500 --> 49:24.500
Who's coming in here?

49:24.500 --> 49:25.500
Same to show.

49:25.500 --> 49:26.940
The episode's been a fucking wash.

49:26.940 --> 49:30.100
Actually, you said the last episode that Casey was on was awful.

49:30.100 --> 49:32.540
Yeah, but I said that was because of pile.

49:33.100 --> 49:35.140
I don't think we can arm your mic midway through now.

49:35.140 --> 49:35.980
It's already armed.

49:35.980 --> 49:37.380
I knew this would have been.

49:37.380 --> 49:38.380
Yeah.

49:38.380 --> 49:40.740
He's been wasting SD space just for you.

49:40.740 --> 49:42.580
We actually ran out during the episode.

49:42.580 --> 49:43.820
Is that a wrap in before?

49:43.820 --> 49:47.100
Well, you used to run out of episodes.

49:47.100 --> 49:48.940
That's still sprint out of the studio.

49:48.940 --> 49:50.180
I'll leave this humor.

49:50.180 --> 49:52.180
And pandemic, you would leave the Zoom every time.

49:52.180 --> 49:53.540
I'd like the 20 minute mark.

49:53.540 --> 49:54.780
Yeah, I've never heard of this.

49:54.780 --> 49:56.300
Yeah, this podcast.

49:56.300 --> 49:58.460
I've never run out of space in the middle of an episode

49:58.460 --> 50:01.020
because I check to make sure I have enough space

50:01.020 --> 50:03.220
for the right answer.

50:03.220 --> 50:05.940
All right, you coming in with the heat.

50:05.940 --> 50:09.180
You're about to hear everybody is getting to hear it.

50:09.180 --> 50:11.260
Get stole from my Instagram.

50:11.260 --> 50:12.420
Get started.

50:12.420 --> 50:13.420
Get started.

50:13.420 --> 50:14.260
Get started.

50:14.260 --> 50:15.780
How long into this, are you guys?

50:15.780 --> 50:16.780
Let's go.

50:16.780 --> 50:17.780
Let's go.

50:17.780 --> 50:18.780
Let's go.

50:18.780 --> 50:19.780
Let's go.

50:19.780 --> 50:21.780
I have to go.

50:21.780 --> 50:24.780
Donna, you're to the rescue.

50:24.780 --> 50:25.780
Let's take it away.

50:25.780 --> 50:28.780
You ever got a new bird driver that says,

50:28.780 --> 50:30.660
shut the fuck up.

50:30.660 --> 50:31.660
No.

50:31.660 --> 50:33.660
Shut the fuck up.

50:33.660 --> 50:35.660
Wow.

50:35.660 --> 50:41.260
You don't realize how off base that reaction was.

50:41.260 --> 50:42.700
Like I haven't heard of Brandon.

50:42.700 --> 50:45.460
Talked about it for four minutes with an amir's

50:45.460 --> 50:46.460
druthers.

50:46.460 --> 50:47.460
He had his druthers.

50:47.460 --> 50:51.340
And then Marieka's trying to tell me what druthers is.

50:51.340 --> 50:55.020
That's what the segment has always meant to be.

50:55.020 --> 50:56.820
And Marieka's never done it.

50:56.820 --> 50:57.820
That way.

50:57.860 --> 50:59.500
I'll just explain the energy in the room.

50:59.500 --> 51:06.380
Usually it's all of us kind of against Jeff and everyone's having fun.

51:06.380 --> 51:09.740
For some reason, I've never done this show to him.

51:09.740 --> 51:11.740
It's every man for himself.

51:11.740 --> 51:12.740
Do you see this?

51:12.740 --> 51:14.740
I'm trying to, I'm trying to fill Casey and get the same bait.

51:14.740 --> 51:15.740
I'm not for Jeff.

51:15.740 --> 51:16.740
I just know where.

51:16.740 --> 51:17.740
I know where.

51:17.740 --> 51:20.140
I'm not going on you side.

51:20.140 --> 51:21.140
I just did it once.

51:21.140 --> 51:22.780
And it was just cool to see.

51:22.780 --> 51:23.780
It's kind of like history.

51:23.780 --> 51:30.300
Again, because he's saying that my druthers are wrong for years.

51:30.300 --> 51:34.180
I've said, break his druthers seven minutes on the board basically like rant.

51:34.180 --> 51:35.500
Go off queen.

51:35.500 --> 51:37.500
And you never have to never even know where to go.

51:37.500 --> 51:39.500
Never have to be with one.

51:39.500 --> 51:41.140
And then your nails.

51:41.140 --> 51:43.580
You can almost argue that this is Marieka's druthers right now.

51:43.580 --> 51:45.980
You had overlapping dialogue with yourself.

51:45.980 --> 51:46.980
I've never seen that.

51:46.980 --> 51:47.980
That was unbelievable.

51:47.980 --> 51:48.980
That's not.

51:48.980 --> 51:51.220
That's not the spirit of Marieka's druthers.

51:51.220 --> 52:00.900
There's also involved and become sort of just uncertain conversation starters that go nowhere

52:00.900 --> 52:07.540
because nobody actually wants to talk about them or they're being silenced by Jeff.

52:07.540 --> 52:10.540
I'd like to see you try to do a Marieka's druthers, actually.

52:10.540 --> 52:11.540
What?

52:11.540 --> 52:12.540
I don't understand.

52:12.540 --> 52:15.580
What I'm just saying was not Marieka's druthers.

52:15.580 --> 52:18.740
What I'm here did was like, it was yours.

52:18.740 --> 52:19.740
It was yours.

52:19.780 --> 52:22.980
You're describing is the rest of the show.

52:22.980 --> 52:26.700
Conversation starters that don't go anywhere, bringing up topics that no one participate

52:26.700 --> 52:28.500
then that's just the show.

52:28.500 --> 52:30.260
So of course Marieka's druthers is supposed to do for it.

52:30.260 --> 52:32.700
What is Jeff explaining the concept of the show to us?

52:32.700 --> 52:34.700
I was good.

52:34.700 --> 52:37.500
Look at Tony Zero over there.

52:37.500 --> 52:39.060
I think he owns this place.

52:39.060 --> 52:41.060
Don't go KC in on me.

52:41.060 --> 52:43.060
It's catching on.

52:43.060 --> 52:44.060
It's catching on.

52:44.060 --> 52:46.420
KC, feel free to call me Tony Zero.

52:46.420 --> 52:48.060
I like that.

52:49.740 --> 53:06.260
That was a hit-dum original.

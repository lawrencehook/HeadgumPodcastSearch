00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Piles here?

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
Hey, Pile.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Hey, that's up, guys.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
What's up?

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Yes, Pile.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Do you want to do the show?

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
No.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Come on.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
He's not doing it until you take his voice off the soundboard.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Yes.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
God has asked.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Yeah, see, this is what it's not acceptable to me.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Oh, we got him on the show.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Because it's on and right now it's there.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
There he is.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Block the door.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Block the door.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Block the door.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
It's so loud.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
It's so loud.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Waiting for Joel.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
This is the episode has started.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
The episode started this soundboard website.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Fucking me up.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
So we're starting your prioritizing pile over the soundboard.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
I'm prioritizing pile over the listener's smiles.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
This is that 20, 24-year-old.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Oh, man.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
I think she knows that.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
She's on the show.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
The show is begun.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
The show is begun.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
The new year.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Yeah, I'm out here on the show.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Yeah, to be clear.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Oh, has been going through the show.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
To get back to the bathroom.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
The bathroom.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Joel waited.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
And you said you could finally go pee.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
He finally left.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
And then you started the show.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Joel's coming soon.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Joel's coming soon.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
And we need your saying.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
It's so loud.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
The chaos in the New York studios.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Not my fault.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Yeah, I mean.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Why?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Because I'm too calm and collected.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
By the way, I'm coming here.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
The text is already to go.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I was leaving right now.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
See you.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Appreciate you.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
We got him.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
This episode's going to stay with pile.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
With child.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Wednesday.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Sorry, Thursday.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
January 18th.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
It's the year of our CEO.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
I'm actually not the CEO.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
What?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Yeah, that's Marty.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Who gave him that title?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
I remember when that shift happened.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
By the way, he stopped calling himself co-founder.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
And he started calling himself CEO.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
He was like, who gave you the right?

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
I think we had to choose like different job titles when we were creating the LLC or something.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
That's what I was going to say.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
When you were kind of, no, because you went from an LLC to an incorporated.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Yeah.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Yeah.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
And that was sort of when I sort of noticed not only a title shift in Marty, but also like

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
the tides had shifted in Marty.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
You should act more concussed.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I am.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Like you have the energy of someone who hasn't suffered for a month.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Five weeks.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Yeah.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
But you have.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
So I guess just slow down.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
You got two concussions, right?

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
I had second impact syndrome.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Got nervous within an inch of my life.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
And we'll get into that.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
You spoiled it.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
Because not everybody listening here knew that I had the.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Concussion.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Yeah.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Exactly.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Not everybody listening.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
I Instagram.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
I Instagram to photo with me in a barn cat.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
You've been talking nonstop about this concussion.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I've been thinking nonstop about the concussion.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
It's not possible for me to not think of the concussion in any moment.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Because I'm hedging toward post concussive syndrome.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Every waking moment.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
I wasn't even close to done.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
Every waking moment is a reminder that my cognition isn't.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
I feel as if reality is 15 feet away from me.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I don't have peripheral vision.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
And what's that?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
You don't.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Sorry.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
It's hard because like I've already been.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
So when you're looking at me, you can't see a mirror.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
I can.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
I know he's there.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
I can sense him there.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Sure.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
And I can kind of see him.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
But it's blurry to be sure.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
He's going to make a blur with the conget cognition.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
It is a source.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Because he experienced because ultimately Joel MN.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
I thought we were on the Hadgun podcast just with Jeff.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
And then Jeff invited two people not on the calendar invite in the L.A.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Studio to join.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
And I was only talking to them.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
He said it's talking.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
I got a text from Jeff yesterday asking me to be on the show.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
He said New York's going to be there.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
But their low key dead weight would be helpful to have some real backup.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
IRL.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
So fucked.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Jeff, what if the concussion just makes you regular?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
What if it works in the other way?

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
I've already found that not to be the case.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I mean, we'll get into it.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
We'll get into the episode.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
But you guys aren't going to be happy with what I have prepared.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Okay.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
And it is concussion.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I don't think I've ever been happy with anything prepared.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Yeah.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
That's right.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
It's hard, right?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Because it's a mere birthday.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Yeah.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
And so I feel like the energy's already going towards you.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
When I would rather be going towards my...

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
It kind of helps dramatic brain injury.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
You've been talking about it for several months.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Yeah.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Maybe let's talk about it on your birthday.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
How are you feeling?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
For a new one.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I was very under the weather last week.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
So I feel like I'm trending out of this like flu like haze.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Like last week was bad.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
This week is better.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
And then this is like the beginning of a new,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
basically week slash year.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
I feel like a rebirth.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Exactly.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
How's the peripheral?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
peripheral is okay.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
My lingering issue is more like a dryness in my entire head.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Like a...

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
A bit or...

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
I had the flu.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Wow.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Wow.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
RSV?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I don't know.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I didn't really test specifically what strand I had.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
I just didn't feel well.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Do you get a flu shot?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
I did.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Wow.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Yeah.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
I guess, you know, they only do so much.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Cover so many strains.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
And who knows if I even had the flu or just a flu like symptom from something else?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
There's no way to know.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
There's no COVID-19.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
There's no COVID-19.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
You're a flu game.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
You think you might bring it because of the energy of your birthday.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
You might save certain parts of the episodes with one line.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
There's the people comment down below being like, oh, that was a great job.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I think I'm already past flu games.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
Actually, the last segment spot cast I did was probably my flu game because I was like

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Coffee and stuff.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Do you think Jordan had the flu or do you think he was hung over?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
I don't know.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
Either way, it's really impressive because like whether you have the flu or you're hung over your

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
body sort of like suffering slash dehydrated.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Yeah.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
So it doesn't really matter what the cause of the issues, whether it's a virus or the fact

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
that you poison yourself the day before.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
It's really impressive that you can overcome because like when I had the flu last week,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I couldn't even like walk to the bathroom.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
The idea of playing against the Utah Jazz seemed completely unfathomable to me.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Yeah.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
And today.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
Today I could probably drop 15, 10 and 10 against a regular season.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Dallas Maverick, so close to any Thunder style opponent.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
I know.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
To really good team.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
But I'm just saying like the if the defense is sort of focused on somebody else.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I can pick and choose my spots.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Austin Reeves style and make sure that I'm both a facilitator.

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
I'm hoping we take today and I sort of brush you off.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
All right.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Well, Rick asked me how I was doing so.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Yeah.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
And I'm and it's glad to know.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Yep.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Me too.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
How are you doing?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
New Year's say I'm not well.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
I'm not sick, but I'm not well.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
America, how is your New Year's New Year's New Year?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
I don't do that.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
But it's the Jeff Rubin special.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Not to be confused with a Rubin.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Wait.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I don't think anyone has been fusing that.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Or Billah.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Billah Rubin?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Jeff, if he does he have a kid?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Why didn't he name his him.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Billy or Billah?

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
You don't know what his name is child.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
It's a billah.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
It's Max actually.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Yeah.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
He's a sweet boy.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Max actually Rubin.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Direct.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Actually it's such a funny bit on the internet.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
I like that.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
The name's Max actually.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
Anyone with the last name actually, I think, is that CEO material.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
It'll be a mere actually bloom in the fall.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Yeah.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
It works for everyone.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
My hair position is GEO.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Is that a cat?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
From this podcast?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
That's a cat Cohen original.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
She wanted to make the soundboard.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
And she did with that one.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Oh, okay.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
And a couple other ones that didn't upload for some reason.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Because they thought it was copyrighted material.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
I think that I can't believe I know this.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
That's from a clip that Lauren Conrad a long time ago.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Someone asked her what her favorite position was in an interview meeting like sex position.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
And then she said CEO.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
And I think that's right.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Yeah.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
But Cat Cohen said my favorite position is GEO.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Because my name is spelled off.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
But she drives the GEO.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Wagon.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
No.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
You know, I don't want New York complaining that I'm not including them enough in the conversation.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
They've been dead silent other than Mariaica.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I don't know if Joel still has it.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I just don't know if we're in color.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Really?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Yeah.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Well, it's hard because I can't see them.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
There's no way to see them.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
No.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
There's a monitor right next to you or if you see them.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Yeah.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
But peripheral vision.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
No, I can't mirror because I need to use my sound boards.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Your whole setup is fucked.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
It's not.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
There has to be a better way to do this.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
And I'm not going to complain about it.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
I'm not going to complain about it.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
I'm not going to complain about the fucking studio.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
That being said, I do need to get one thing out of my system.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Sure.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
On you.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
It's not here for this.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
She will hopefully hear the episode and be pissed.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
On you zero.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
On you zero.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Right now.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
What you're saying.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Were we sure about charcoal?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Yeah.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Yes.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
I just.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Because I was wondering if we might have done like a cola or if you might have done like a.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
You're saying cola.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
You're saying.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
You're saying.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Like, hey.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Yeah.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Not like who we're not.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Kind of like that.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Also, I found.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I just sent this to a mirror.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
But there's a pink color called China.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Yeah.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
We're response.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Like, we're the China green.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Yeah.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
I get that.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
How is everybody else?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
The first episode of the New Year.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
I feel like the energy is almost there.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
But it's not there.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
There.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
It's not bull bull.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Mm-hmm.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
There's my birthday recently.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
And how was that?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Yeah.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
It was good.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Yeah.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Emma's birthday also.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Yeah.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Happy birthday.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Emma.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
I think it's January birthdays in the office.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Or limbo is just a very, very nice.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
I think it's just, you know, you want to chalk the whole space full of capricorns to make everything,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
you know, fit us.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Mm-hmm.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
They're just going pretty good so far.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
You were filling me in on some personal private info that I will bring up.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Yeah.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
But it sounded like I was going, right?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Yeah.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
It feels like this might be your, not if not Jordan New Year.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Uh, let's say you're Sarah.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Jordan New Year is my year.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I feel like it's for sex in the city year for you.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
It's a sex in the city year for you.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Yeah.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
You're going to have sex and the city.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
And I feel like you're going to like have gossip to talk over brunch.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
You want to take a sip of that so bad.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
But you are preventing yourself from doing that.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
What's that?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Thanks.

11:32.000 --> 11:41.000
Thank you.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
May this be the year that they finally cast the next James.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
I'm sick of the segment and so is the general public.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
But while we have to do it,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
me, she, you're sorry.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
Me, see, Nash bets bond.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Me, see, Nash bets bond.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Is this sure you're out of the concussion?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
No.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
I said that.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I have post concussive syndrome.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Meaning I still feel concuss.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
That's the fifth week mark, which happened.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
What's that?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
As have been five weeks.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
Well, past the six week mark is when they were diagnosed with post concussive syndrome.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.440
Um, so I don't actually have a yet, but I'm not out of the weeds yet. I've hit my head three times four if you count the four

12:22.440 --> 12:23.720
And

12:23.720 --> 12:24.600
um

12:24.600 --> 12:30.200
That's been part of the issue. Mm-hmm. Are we gonna get into it or are you gonna just sort of we have to allude to

12:30.920 --> 12:37.480
Trudged through the segment that is bond of the week and then we'll get there. Okay. I want to know Joel's bond of the week Joel

12:37.480 --> 12:39.480
I'll go with Max actually

12:40.200 --> 12:42.200
Nice

12:42.760 --> 12:44.520
Emma

12:44.520 --> 12:48.680
The um pilot who was on mushroom to try to crash the plane who I can't stop talking

12:48.680 --> 12:51.800
You're thinking about and I talked about on the other episode where you were in hosting Jeff

12:52.520 --> 12:55.000
Who is this? May never see a lot of time

12:55.000 --> 13:00.600
I mean who's supposed to pilot on mushrooms? It was a pilot who was on a mushroom trip from multiple days

13:01.000 --> 13:04.360
That got on a plane and thought he needed to crash the plane to get out

13:04.360 --> 13:07.400
He thought it was like a simulation and thought he needed to crash the plane to get out of it

13:07.400 --> 13:10.920
So then he was like held down and then he started pouring coffee all over himself and singing

13:10.920 --> 13:12.920
Showtunes. Oh my god

13:13.400 --> 13:18.280
And masturbating all to come out of his sounds like a mirror's birth in in the air

13:23.240 --> 13:25.240
My bond of the week is

13:26.200 --> 13:31.080
Ultimately gonna be the soul of Jennifer Lopez. I think from her new

13:32.360 --> 13:33.640
trailer

13:33.640 --> 13:35.640
Fuck off Jeff

13:36.680 --> 13:38.680
I forget that she can see me

13:39.240 --> 13:46.200
You press the button. I know but I'm used to it being the the logitech. Yeah. All right. Let's keep things going

13:48.120 --> 13:50.120
I wish I had a bond of the week

13:50.600 --> 13:52.600
It is my birthday

13:54.360 --> 13:57.400
We're the only one that doesn't really like the segment

13:57.960 --> 14:03.480
We'll come over and you made it very clear. He doesn't like the second only one that doesn't like the segment that's

14:03.480 --> 14:07.320
I don't like the segment. I think it's just fine

14:07.400 --> 14:09.400
Like it doesn't offend me in any way

14:09.720 --> 14:11.240
It's a mirror

14:11.240 --> 14:15.160
What's your fucking bottom? Oh god. I don't know. I haven't thought about it

14:15.160 --> 14:16.920
Yeah, I'm white

14:16.920 --> 14:18.280
Yeah

14:18.280 --> 14:19.560
The bear

14:19.560 --> 14:25.080
This is in a funny segment, but I just have to make it through to the announcement

14:25.480 --> 14:29.240
Otherwise it really sucked. You know what I mean? Yeah. Oh, yeah

14:37.320 --> 14:39.320
I

14:48.440 --> 14:50.440
The entire room

14:52.440 --> 14:54.440
Wow

14:54.840 --> 15:00.280
Check that out a mirror behind you starting 2024 off already with a little bit of effort into the podcast

15:00.280 --> 15:02.280
I got an MRI just for the show

15:02.840 --> 15:05.240
It seems like you got it for the concussion really

15:06.200 --> 15:11.720
Mr. it's mr. Jeffrey A James is the A for always it's for actually

15:15.400 --> 15:17.400
It really does look like a walnut

15:17.400 --> 15:21.800
What's that the brain looks like a walnut the brain or mine specifically? I can't tell if you're

15:21.800 --> 15:26.520
Buying me they say like you're supposed to eat foods that look like the brain for brain health

15:26.520 --> 15:28.520
Raspberry

15:28.760 --> 15:30.760
Brain

15:32.600 --> 15:35.240
In just case an entirely smooth can't only be in

15:54.520 --> 15:56.520
Oh

15:58.920 --> 16:00.520
Lots

16:00.520 --> 16:02.520
It was a joke

16:02.520 --> 16:11.960
Are you millennial who misses what life was like in the 2000s right? Have you got a hard time finding new or curated music?

16:12.840 --> 16:19.000

17:28.760 --> 17:30.760
Sorry

17:32.040 --> 17:39.560
That was that would have sounded like neurologist at the Cleveland clinic said that I had an age appropriate

17:40.200 --> 17:42.200
Unremarkable brain

17:42.200 --> 17:44.200
That's kind of a sport is right

17:45.160 --> 17:52.040
Really to like that it rains like normal and not my intellect not my intellect is unremarkable

17:52.040 --> 17:54.040
Just the brain. Well

17:54.120 --> 17:56.120
A lot of philosophy

17:56.120 --> 17:59.320
On is this physical brain versus like your mind?

17:59.720 --> 18:03.160
It's just with or without contrast. It's withering with contrast

18:03.400 --> 18:07.800
So basically they put too much dye into my veins and it started to sort of degenerate

18:07.800 --> 18:09.080
They actually did they actually put

18:10.280 --> 18:16.680
Contrastin for not they this is the MRI they did end up doing a CTA as well

18:16.760 --> 18:22.360
That one had contrast dye because I ended up in the ER on New Year's day eve

18:22.760 --> 18:29.000
Because my pupils were different sizes and they say if that's happening you might have a stroke so I had to go to the ER

18:29.960 --> 18:31.320
But you're fine

18:31.320 --> 18:39.000
We should say ultimately yeah a symmetrical pupils find guy because that makes sense. Yeah. I feel like I don't know why the mood is coming down

18:39.400 --> 18:41.400
I'm studying

18:43.400 --> 18:50.760
Can I explain I don't fucking know you think I'm a neurologist? This is the scan. I did a zoom call with a neurologist

18:51.000 --> 18:56.520
He looked at my MRIs and he said yeah, it looks like everything's fine. No bleeding

19:01.640 --> 19:10.360
But you know, this was the only way I could get a screenshot of the bush was to have him share his screen and be sneakily

19:10.360 --> 19:15.080
Yeah, I've gotten like an MRI before and it's oddly hard to get the it's not like images on a test

19:15.080 --> 19:18.920
Yeah, well we have this CD, but you need the software and most places don't have the software

19:19.240 --> 19:24.280
Just take a fucking screen. That's what I said. I do like you know fucking command 4 shit

19:24.280 --> 19:28.760
I had to take a photo of my MRI and the doctor's office like sneakily on my phone

19:29.320 --> 19:34.440
It's crazy how antiquated. I mean the entire healthcare system was fucked, but like the fact that these it

19:34.440 --> 19:36.680
It's already no

19:36.680 --> 19:38.600
No, no, no, no, what do you mean by that?

19:38.600 --> 19:40.840
It's really hard to get proper healthcare

19:40.840 --> 19:44.520
Well, it's hard to navigate the expense of a ship, but what do you mean by that? I'm not going to sit here

19:44.520 --> 19:47.880
Either by don't care that it's your birthday. You're not going to talk shit on my health care

19:47.960 --> 19:50.360
Actually, I hear good things about the Ohio healthcare system

19:50.360 --> 19:53.720
Cleveland, yeah, it's one of the best cost bills in the world. It's hopkins number one

19:53.720 --> 19:59.160
You've probably got the cash on your very good state. Yeah, but I wasn't in a good state mentally

19:59.160 --> 20:03.480
Exactly or rendered you in the worst sort of but it's nice that you were there

20:04.120 --> 20:06.840
To get the help you talked about how you got the concussion. I have no idea

20:06.840 --> 20:11.080
Just like I've heard the rumors an anapiel or step on a rake. I want to hear what Joel heard the rumors

20:11.080 --> 20:13.080
I've heard a lot of rumors

20:13.880 --> 20:18.920
That it had to do with you standing on an elevated but soft surface

20:19.800 --> 20:24.520
We'll performing some sort of impersonation that went south

20:25.960 --> 20:27.960
Fast

20:28.360 --> 20:30.760
He's choosing his words incredibly wisely

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Joel's in court

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
We're doing a bit and fell off a couch

20:35.000 --> 20:44.200
I was doing a bird. No, I was doing a very very tasteful

20:44.840 --> 20:47.160
Impression of a Korean

20:47.160 --> 20:49.160
Land owner

20:50.040 --> 20:52.840
No, I was snowmobiling

20:52.840 --> 20:55.320
We're in the Alaskan Alps. Yeah, no

20:56.040 --> 20:59.160
Not even know what you don't think I could do. Call shit. Yes

21:00.120 --> 21:03.640
No, is it as the Alaskan Alps like the name of a park in Cleveland?

21:04.200 --> 21:06.920
We already said you're an old. It's a cross-country skiing

21:07.960 --> 21:14.760
He was in a bad state and like he met Alaskan. Your concussion happened in California. I was in Juno and

21:15.320 --> 21:17.320
The fall movie in the temples

21:19.640 --> 21:21.320
Can't get a straight answer out of this guy

21:23.000 --> 21:26.680
I was four wheeling in an extra

21:27.640 --> 21:34.600
To rest rail terrain park and here's the thing I was having a ton of intercourse on a

21:36.120 --> 21:40.760
Very tricky surface. Mm-hmm. I basically was at jumbo's clown room

21:41.880 --> 21:45.080
oiling slick a gland and

21:46.360 --> 21:54.040
I flipped and fell off the stage and then ended up in a CTA

21:54.520 --> 21:56.520
We need to know how to get your head

21:57.800 --> 21:59.800
Scaling

21:59.800 --> 22:01.800
I was so amazing

22:01.800 --> 22:10.200
shit yeah, I go underneath a beam okay, and I thought was like, okay, I was like, oh, I cleared the fish right?

22:10.200 --> 22:15.960
No, I didn't okay stood up directly into it full force so like I was like

22:17.240 --> 22:19.240
Top down

22:19.800 --> 22:24.840
It's kind of interesting just that the joint next to the night of all so it has a weird body

22:24.840 --> 22:31.320
Sorry, I don't know the feeling after a traumatic but like why do we actually it's a dramatic brain injury by the way

22:31.320 --> 22:33.720
I said mild before because I was trying to be demirited today

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Well

22:37.000 --> 22:39.720
You haven't been demurited. That's not a brain injury. That's a neck

22:39.960 --> 22:45.800
So it it hit you right top to bottom square like the tip of your skull. It scrunched me like a slinky

22:46.440 --> 22:48.440
Okay, and were you with anybody?

22:48.760 --> 22:50.120
I was

22:50.120 --> 22:51.640
Pisted people

22:51.640 --> 22:56.120
Okay, because they let you in the attic because they let me down so I went to the attic

22:57.480 --> 23:01.960
And then at first did you think it was just like a well that was weird or you like something terrible

23:01.960 --> 23:06.440
It's just happened and it'll affect me. My first thought was this ought to be a good episode

23:07.640 --> 23:09.640
Your brain is so fucking

23:11.240 --> 23:12.440
There are so I

23:12.440 --> 23:18.360
Interesting similarities to the movie anatomy of a fall where I feel like we could kind of make a version of that

23:18.440 --> 23:20.440
About yeah, just like

23:20.680 --> 23:27.160
Getting a concussion and I can do a sublaying thing to me yesterday in our barris. I'm trying to get into three person

23:27.880 --> 23:29.400
Well, not tree

23:29.400 --> 23:31.400
herbs

23:31.720 --> 23:36.760
I'm taking classes. I'm trying to better myself. I'm trying to get better at fucking what kind of glasses

23:37.240 --> 23:41.400
So you hit your head so hard in an attic by yourself. It doesn't matter the classes

23:42.120 --> 23:47.320
Were you with anybody and who was the first person you told that oh by the way? I think I might be can cussed

23:47.960 --> 23:54.360
I was fine the day it happened so you were just like oh, maybe it's just a bump. Oh, I'm tired

23:54.360 --> 23:58.200
I got to go to sleep. Yeah, yeah, and I had some wine

23:59.400 --> 24:06.520
So you really didn't think it was a big deal. I discounted it. I decanted it and I watched in canto

24:06.840 --> 24:10.680
You're just talking about the wine now. It was an incredible

24:11.640 --> 24:13.640
You know

24:13.640 --> 24:21.880
Just read also so crazy that you didn't think you had a concussion after hitting your head that hard when Adam years

24:22.040 --> 24:28.200
Pre-wetting party or going around telling people you thought you had a concussion, but you just like hadn't had any water all day

24:30.520 --> 24:35.320
Well, it's hard. You know because I'm trying to like make sure that I look out for my health and not discount any little feeling

24:35.320 --> 24:37.320
Did you hit that hit did you hit your head

24:37.640 --> 24:42.840
The day before my wedding I I didn't hit my head. I hadn't had any water

24:43.960 --> 24:45.960
Or maybe

24:47.160 --> 24:51.720
No, so the issue was I hit my head and I was just kind of like ah, you know

24:51.720 --> 24:57.800
I was like I'm like home or something that I know discounted the hit I decanted the green

24:58.760 --> 25:04.680
And much to my sugar in falls in which I was I woke up the next day with a headache

25:04.680 --> 25:08.360
But I had had enough wine the night before that I was like, I'm just hung over

25:09.080 --> 25:17.000
Housing water the entire day. Yeah by 9 p.m. I'm like this is this is something else so I call my dad's dog

25:17.880 --> 25:25.240
And he's like I don't think it's a concussion, but you know, just rest and recover and I was like all right

25:25.880 --> 25:29.160
Treated it like it was a concussion for a few days and it just kept getting worse

25:29.960 --> 25:32.760
The headache hours the experience got worse

25:33.160 --> 25:35.160
The headache was the experience

25:35.960 --> 25:42.680
It was slowed cognition. It was my vision being off feeling like I'm not in the same reality as other people

25:43.240 --> 25:48.360
I mean the scans are up. I don't know what else do you guys want what do you want you want another more detailed view there you go

25:49.640 --> 25:56.280
Hmm yeah pretty smooth. Yeah the thing you can see here is the only issue is there was remote insult

25:56.920 --> 25:58.920
to the corpus calcium

26:00.280 --> 26:02.280
In utero

26:03.560 --> 26:05.320
Remote doesn't sound very remote

26:07.160 --> 26:12.520
Remote means long ago so I don't know how much longer ago in my lifetime you could get that in utero

26:13.320 --> 26:19.640
So you think that's the thing that made you you that's what I wanted to get into okay I want to get into a couple of things

26:19.640 --> 26:25.160
But that's the first thing I mean this show has been a train

26:26.040 --> 26:32.600
Falling off the tracks for nearly three and a half years and I want to I want to trace it back

26:32.760 --> 26:34.760
Potentially to this

26:36.280 --> 26:39.960
Is that the reason we're all here today?

26:41.320 --> 26:46.360
I think I don't think it's the reason I'm here today. I was I was hired by a mirror to work here

26:46.360 --> 26:49.800
Well, you're here because Jeff texted you you said well, yeah, oh, yeah, I'm here today

26:49.800 --> 26:51.800
We're now because Jeff texted me

26:52.040 --> 26:55.480
But you don't know if they would have even needed to fill the producer

26:56.280 --> 27:00.040
Position that you filled if I didn't cause the issues that I did

27:00.040 --> 27:06.440
Like we need we need professionals and imagining a world where you're like group of interns

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Produced like very competent

27:10.120 --> 27:14.760
Video and audio technical people that then went on to work at the company

27:15.320 --> 27:22.840
What exactly like yeah? Interesting. Yeah, like if yeah, if I had been able to understand everything here better

27:23.400 --> 27:27.240
Maybe I would have been offered a full-time position like you did go to USC film school

27:27.640 --> 27:35.880
What's that you did get the education necessary to do something like yeah, but we just watched on the episode that's coming out on Friday a project that I made

27:36.280 --> 27:43.400
For film school casey side and there was no I did remember conversation with myself post shower. Oh, yeah

27:57.720 --> 28:01.960
Get pile back in here. Hey, it's so much

28:03.080 --> 28:07.880
I have an excuse. I have an excuse for the no gray matter

28:08.840 --> 28:10.840
Doesn't matter and it matters

28:11.320 --> 28:17.640
This right here is the reason why the show might be off sometimes for the next couple years

28:18.840 --> 28:21.640
Like if I don't prepare one week because I don't have time

28:22.120 --> 28:29.560
This is why so you're already pre-using this is an excuse. You're already getting the research done on me

28:29.560 --> 28:36.440
Sorry you're in utero injury is the reason why the show might be bad for the next three years

28:37.320 --> 28:39.320
It was more of a remote insult

28:39.880 --> 28:41.240
to injury

28:43.240 --> 28:46.040
I'm sorry. Let me check and how's your birthday so far

28:51.640 --> 28:53.640
I'm 41 today

28:53.800 --> 28:55.800
There's got to be something

29:02.920 --> 29:05.720
We're gonna say there's got to be something more to life than this

29:13.880 --> 29:18.840
Welcome to our first segment. I like to call this blame for the segment. What's that first segment

29:19.560 --> 29:21.560
I like to call this blame game. Okay

29:24.920 --> 29:26.920
Shake it

29:27.320 --> 29:29.320
That it was an accident

29:29.880 --> 29:31.880
That this happened

29:31.880 --> 29:33.880
You're shooting yourselves

29:34.440 --> 29:37.400
This happened because according to a hair

29:38.680 --> 29:43.000
Kind of in a literal blood analysis a malgum

29:44.680 --> 29:47.720
I'm so stressed. I'm reaching chemical burnout

29:49.800 --> 29:51.800
That's on y'all

29:51.800 --> 29:53.800
That's on y'all

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
That's on god

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
I thought we were talking about your

30:00.360 --> 30:02.360
Brain mark on your brain

30:03.560 --> 30:08.920
Now it just seems like Jeff made up a segment to say that this is our fault

30:11.800 --> 30:14.440
Moving on to 11 take four minutes and light

30:15.320 --> 30:17.320
Sorry

30:17.320 --> 30:19.320
11 is taking

30:23.960 --> 30:27.480
Four full minutes don't be shy. What is this?

30:32.360 --> 30:34.360
I didn't think it through

30:34.360 --> 30:36.360
Looking at me

30:36.760 --> 30:42.360
One of these audio clips this from the post shower. That's an example sorry just the

30:43.320 --> 30:44.920
The name of the game is blame game

30:46.440 --> 30:50.440
And I'm playing you guys some clips of moments where you caused me stress

30:51.720 --> 30:56.680
Pacy that one's on you. I couldn't even understand what was happening

30:56.680 --> 30:59.480
Would you need me to play it again? It's 30 seconds long

31:01.400 --> 31:04.920
I think we just need to do it to explain what it was four minutes and light

31:05.480 --> 31:08.200
So this was from the opposite of the came out two weeks ago

31:08.440 --> 31:10.440
Yeah

31:12.440 --> 31:14.440
Lead to love

31:15.720 --> 31:21.320
And you guys were making fun of my ass for having one of the questions take full four full minutes

31:27.320 --> 31:31.720
Sorry, what was that Marie got cost you burnout burnout yeah, that's what I was going to say burnout basically

31:32.600 --> 31:34.760
It exhausted me that you guys didn't like the questions

31:35.720 --> 31:41.880
Okay, and I don't think it was fair to me considering how much time an effort I put into all 36. That's a me two hours

31:43.560 --> 31:50.920
Was you recorded before the concussion though all of this was all of these clips are gonna be before the concussion because this was the this is the first episode after the concussion

31:50.920 --> 31:55.240
So apparently all the concussion but happened the gray mark on your brain

31:55.560 --> 31:57.560
Bc you can call it

31:57.560 --> 32:01.960
Well the stress isn't the remote insult do you know what I mean like

32:02.600 --> 32:04.120
That is

32:04.120 --> 32:09.880
Inuturo that is unrelated to stress but the concussion can't have been an accident

32:09.880 --> 32:13.640
Okay, what I'm trying to say is there's blood on all of your guys the sense does that make sense sure?

32:13.640 --> 32:18.920
Well listening to that clip it didn't sound like I was saying anything. I was laughing a lot

32:18.920 --> 32:24.200
That's true. So I actually appreciated that. Oh, you're welcome the joy that you bring the episode so the blame is not on me

32:24.200 --> 32:29.480
I might shift it on to yeah, okay. This is kind of like the French court scene and anatomy of a fall

32:29.800 --> 32:31.320
Here we go

32:31.320 --> 32:32.840
Clip number two

32:32.840 --> 32:37.960
Jeff is like the cotton candy of men. So like he says that so nice appears before

32:41.800 --> 32:46.760
It's not nice he said that I was the cotton candy of men because I'm thin in terms of

32:47.640 --> 32:49.640
things that are

32:49.800 --> 32:51.800
They are

32:51.800 --> 32:58.600
That I don't bring much nutritionally pulled apart very easily pulled but pull pork would be better

32:59.160 --> 33:05.880
Yeah, the part yeah more substance for sure. But what do you want to make sure you want to take that work because I kind of feel like that sentence alone

33:06.280 --> 33:09.960
Might have been enough to cause me to stress. Yeah, but where are you gonna has a great question?

33:09.960 --> 33:14.200
Yeah, would you rather me say that you're the pulled pork of people?

33:17.160 --> 33:19.160
I don't it's worse

33:19.160 --> 33:22.680
I don't even mind if I'm not dressed

33:23.400 --> 33:27.560
Meaning if I was sort of bearing all on the show

33:27.960 --> 33:32.600
I moved on from the pulled pork analogy. Got it. Well, you would mind if you did that

33:33.160 --> 33:38.840
That would cause a stress episode and doesn't immediately refer you to a therapist

33:44.920 --> 33:50.520
That wasn't even me. I was melty, but you know what no, but you know what Maria could you were there

33:51.160 --> 33:53.000
You were there and you didn't stick up for my ass

33:53.800 --> 33:55.800
Real friendship you are

33:58.600 --> 34:00.600
I agree with that though

34:02.920 --> 34:08.520
Then I don't think there's I don't think that's I did a problem for me. It was the group called the US males

34:21.400 --> 34:23.400
That borderline happened today

34:25.240 --> 34:27.240
Can't only be in

34:28.760 --> 34:30.760
The Catalini Venus

34:31.560 --> 34:35.800
That will go down into his sister play that clip on this episode here

34:38.440 --> 34:42.600
Like what does that I put a lot of time enough for an energy into a ring

34:42.600 --> 34:48.680
I feel like you were laughing at the fact that the group was US males right not you

34:49.320 --> 34:55.960
Yeah, I was laughing at that that it was called the US males is very funny, but it's also funny that Jeff was in an

34:55.960 --> 34:57.960
Occupel group called the US males

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Jeff you were in an Occupel group

35:01.640 --> 35:03.640
We really

35:08.440 --> 35:13.480
That was the blame game. I blame all of you. Okay. We know this show sponsored by

35:14.120 --> 35:17.640
Better health guys, sometimes you want to keep things the same about yourself, right?

35:17.640 --> 35:23.000
Sometimes you've already made progress that you need to track chart and appreciate about yourself

35:23.640 --> 35:26.280
I have been sleeping fine

35:26.280 --> 35:30.280
or the normal and that's something that started way back in November

35:30.680 --> 35:33.000
I'd like to continue that into the new year

35:33.560 --> 35:37.720
Right? I want to make sure that I'm doing the daily habits that allow me to fall asleep

35:38.200 --> 35:44.680
By midnight and so I can wake up and be more refreshed and bring that spark that jolt to that

35:45.080 --> 35:47.400
That that earthquake energy to the show

35:48.440 --> 35:53.880
Around New Year's people get obsessed with how to change themselves instead of just expanding on what they've already done right

35:54.200 --> 36:00.760
Maybe you finally organized one part of your space and you want to tackle another or maybe you're taking your supplements every morning

36:00.760 --> 36:03.560
And now you want to actually eat breakfast, too. That's one of mine

36:04.200 --> 36:11.000
Therapy can help you find these strengths so you can ditch the extreme New Year's resolutions and make changes that really stick

36:11.720 --> 36:13.480

37:12.600 --> 37:16.200
Bob Dull with pineapple yeah, yeah, can this is

37:19.720 --> 37:24.120
Joel has said like four senses on the episode and one of them is yeah, I can

37:35.560 --> 37:40.200
Resolutions this is the first episode of the new year right we're gonna you know move away from my sort of it

37:40.200 --> 37:44.440
Trial in terms of the concussion that I'm still dealing with and move into where y'all can improve

37:44.840 --> 37:48.040
Does that make sense I think I have a unique point of view

37:49.640 --> 37:56.760
In terms of where there are holes in your personalities where there are root there's room for improvement in terms of

37:57.000 --> 38:01.800
Y'all holistically as people as you pertain to my life and the world at large

38:02.920 --> 38:05.960
So I'm gonna go one by one and I'm gonna give you guys

38:06.680 --> 38:11.320
New year's resolutions okay before we get into it does anybody want to say what their resolution actually is

38:12.520 --> 38:14.520
I want to get abs

38:22.600 --> 38:25.400
Okay, Joel be nice to peel us often

38:27.240 --> 38:29.240
It'd be nice

38:32.040 --> 38:40.120
I'd like to reduce my screen time phone wise, but I don't know find myself struggling more and more every year as things become more and more online

38:41.080 --> 38:42.280
between

38:42.280 --> 38:44.280
game social media

38:44.280 --> 38:46.920
news information sports work

38:47.560 --> 38:49.800
Work like it's nearly impossible to

38:51.160 --> 38:52.520
put

38:52.520 --> 38:57.160
the little iphone dictator down and then at what point are you just

38:57.960 --> 39:00.920
replacing that screen with another right already yep

39:03.960 --> 39:05.960
Marika's resolution

39:06.760 --> 39:13.880
Episodes any guesses I wouldn't mind if everybody through guesses out on what she needs to improve on

39:14.440 --> 39:20.680
Or should we just more TV yeah that's what I would like to do I have fell behind this year past year

39:23.160 --> 39:27.960
Well the real one that I want to give her is join a city club soon

39:28.920 --> 39:30.920
What's a city club

39:31.320 --> 39:37.560
Marika's been in New York for almost a decade and has next to normal slash nothing to show for it

39:38.120 --> 39:44.360
Take a page from the gilded age and try your darndist to join a man hat and social club

39:44.760 --> 39:52.040
The union club will do the union club crowned the Rockefeller family members of the New York City elite

39:52.680 --> 39:55.880
Now let it allow Marika in thus suit

39:58.920 --> 40:03.880
What what so it's like a elk's lodge sort of thing in New York it's a little bit house

40:04.840 --> 40:11.080
It's like the 19th century so how house why is everybody not reacting with joy

40:13.240 --> 40:17.320
I guess I'm confused joy is the reaction from the perspective

40:17.800 --> 40:19.800
Yeah

40:20.280 --> 40:22.280
Then okay

40:22.280 --> 40:27.160
Marika what do you think yeah, Marika I'm open to it, but I'd love to know more about these clubs

40:27.160 --> 40:30.120
I'm unfamiliar with them as a genre of place

40:30.520 --> 40:36.520
I think it's like you go you'd play bridge you chat about current events maybe movies even TV show

40:36.520 --> 40:39.000
You wouldn't play bridge. Yeah, you would build bridges

40:39.400 --> 40:41.400
Socialy and infrastructure

40:41.400 --> 40:48.360
So I could be like an oil tycoon. No, you'd be a parent in shorts. I'd be down to be like a railroad baron

40:49.080 --> 40:55.160
That's what I'm saying. I feel like all Marika does is like make sure the wheels don't fall off this fucking place

40:56.040 --> 41:00.760
I want to see her better the United States of America at large

41:01.080 --> 41:06.520
Let's start with the tri-state area. Let's start with the Hudson Valley. Well, that's something politics and I'd love to better

41:07.000 --> 41:11.560
The United States at large, but yeah, you think is the problem sorry

41:11.560 --> 41:15.000
Marika is the problem that you know like the union club because the knickerbocker club would do

41:18.040 --> 41:23.240
I'm interested in the knickerbocker club. I'd like to know it's a close second and don't let the fact that they don't let women in

41:23.240 --> 41:25.240
Still into you

41:25.720 --> 41:29.080
Take your rightful place in New Amsterdam history. Okay

41:29.880 --> 41:33.960
Yeah, okay, you're gonna do it soon because that is there like a fee

41:34.600 --> 41:41.160
I think there's like a $3,000 induction fee. Yeah, that's a wrap. That's like isn't that like what sojo houses?

41:42.120 --> 41:44.360
No, so house is like $2,000 a year

41:45.480 --> 41:50.680
Oh, so this is just three a flat for life. Three grand and you're gonna do is no

41:53.000 --> 41:59.960
And by the way, I'm a huge part about getting into these social clubs is to own a town home. Okay, does that make sense?

41:59.960 --> 42:07.080
So yeah, it's not just the $3,000 induction fee. It's also like the $10 million fee for the fucking

42:07.800 --> 42:11.560
How do you have a damn suggestion of how I should get that?

42:12.280 --> 42:16.200
I have a suggestion on what you should do and be if you don't get in. Okay

42:17.480 --> 42:19.480
embarrassed as

42:23.000 --> 42:27.240
Are we clear on your resolution join a city club soon?

42:27.720 --> 42:33.720
Yeah, we're clear. All right, you don't have a lot of time for that one moving on to Emma's resolution. Emma are you ready?

42:34.280 --> 42:36.280
Yes

42:42.440 --> 42:44.440
Try to enjoy the head-gump podcast

42:46.680 --> 42:51.800
I feel like all the people on the network and who's guessed it on the show

42:52.440 --> 42:57.160
You really don't seem to you either get the show and you don't like it

42:57.160 --> 43:00.040
Which doesn't make a ton of sense or you haven't understood what it is yet

43:00.440 --> 43:02.440
She definitely understands

43:02.440 --> 43:05.320
Yeah, I feel like I get what it is and I'm kind of

43:07.320 --> 43:09.320
That's what you think but

43:10.280 --> 43:11.320
I

43:11.320 --> 43:17.880
Don't understand how anyone wouldn't enjoy the show if they get it you know what I mean? It's either not for you or you love it. No

43:17.960 --> 43:19.960
Well, that's interesting

43:21.160 --> 43:23.000
Here's my resolution for you

43:23.000 --> 43:31.400
Listen to the show on a weekly basis and find a way to have fun while doing so. It's you can't. Okay, go, sorry go on

43:32.600 --> 43:35.800
No, what are you gonna say? Do I see what that meant so?

43:39.480 --> 43:41.480
Yeah

43:41.480 --> 43:43.480
We're friends you go. Well, I don't know

43:43.720 --> 43:45.720
Oh

43:46.040 --> 43:48.360
I'm not me. It's the show

43:48.920 --> 43:52.680
Okay, and they are two very different are they really?

43:55.160 --> 44:03.080
If you can't enjoy even a few seconds of each episode send me detailed notes unpaid

44:04.600 --> 44:06.600
And un-toward

44:06.600 --> 44:13.000
So you're looking for Emma to get you notes on the show for the whole episode too

44:13.080 --> 44:18.440
Old episode that catalog yeah, yeah because we I got an email saying that I need to

44:19.240 --> 44:22.600
Scrub the back catalog for copyrighted material

44:23.480 --> 44:27.080
Which I'm not gonna do no when it's just music it's

44:28.280 --> 44:33.720
It's just for copyrighted music just hyper writing music which he plays on every single episode

44:35.480 --> 44:37.480
Everybody everybody

44:38.440 --> 44:41.640
I think this one. He's about to work out the show

44:42.840 --> 44:49.480
Went on the show whether you're in a guessing or producing capacity bring a ton of or sorry bring a ton to the table and enjoy

44:50.520 --> 44:52.520
Like terrible horoscope

44:54.520 --> 44:56.520
Nice yeah

44:56.520 --> 44:58.760
I'm inclined to agree. Thank you

44:59.800 --> 45:03.080
Well, let's see what Joel's is maybe his is also really rude

45:04.040 --> 45:06.840
Sorry Jeff is texting

45:06.840 --> 45:11.560
Ali I think it's perfect transition. Why out of the net. How did you know it was Ali?

45:12.200 --> 45:16.680
Cause Ali keeps moving hith or into their picking stuff up for you. Okay

45:18.280 --> 45:19.800
Okay

45:19.800 --> 45:25.240
Moving on to Joel. Emma are you clear on what your resolution is try to enjoy the headband podcast give a ton of notes for free

45:26.200 --> 45:27.880
It's let me make the show be clear

45:29.880 --> 45:33.000
Thank you. All right here we go Joel's resolution Joel you're any

45:33.080 --> 45:35.080
Or do you want to take a minute

45:43.080 --> 45:49.240
Resolution is stay put a lot. Does that make sense go on

45:50.440 --> 45:52.440
So it doesn't make sense no

45:52.600 --> 45:56.280
Don't go on. It's not an answer to the question does that make sense. I think I understand it

45:58.040 --> 46:01.080
So I know you have this weird affinity for Philadelphia, but this year

46:04.040 --> 46:09.480
Enjoy the city that never sleeps in travel at ton just not to Pennsylvania

46:09.960 --> 46:13.320
If the urge not stay put then you want me to go all over the place

46:14.520 --> 46:18.040
I wouldn't mind if you become a little bit more worldly just avoid Philadelphia

46:20.360 --> 46:23.000
That's not staying. What about this? You want me to see my family

46:23.960 --> 46:25.960
He went to Argentina last year

46:26.440 --> 46:31.240
If the urge strikes to see a sixer's game or even your family

46:31.640 --> 46:36.520
Exhibit the kind of restraint that Marika does during a Marika's brothers and don't

46:36.840 --> 46:38.840
Understand the assigns

46:41.720 --> 46:43.720
So when I feel the urge

46:44.440 --> 46:46.440
And don't I hear standing

46:48.760 --> 46:52.760
All right, I'm hearing a lot from of every Marika. We're hearing a lot from Marika

46:53.000 --> 46:57.480
So when I feel the urge to see my family your advice is to stay put

46:58.520 --> 47:01.240
My advice is to stay put a lot right

47:02.920 --> 47:08.120
That's the first thing to even want to see my family a lot and then when I feel that

47:08.920 --> 47:10.920
You're not getting it

47:12.200 --> 47:20.040
You don't have the degree to which you miss your family is irrelevant. It's the degree to which you stay put is what I'm concerned with which is right

47:22.760 --> 47:26.200
And this is all year because it's a new year so resolution sure

47:26.760 --> 47:29.800
Amir has that birthday uh fine. I guess so far

47:30.840 --> 47:37.640
Has it gotten better or worse since the show started it's gotten better since the show started because we're closer to the show ending yeah

47:39.640 --> 47:45.400
Okay Joel are we clear? Yeah, that's let's move on to a mirror case. Oh, let me be clear

47:47.000 --> 47:49.240
What was that an impression of Barack Obama?

47:53.720 --> 47:59.240
Nobody got you if you started a business you didn't build that we have to move on

47:59.880 --> 48:02.520
I know a bunch of people on the way helped

48:03.640 --> 48:06.360
All right, Amir's resolution. Are you ready? Yeah, yeah

48:07.320 --> 48:09.320
Ah

48:19.320 --> 48:21.320
Jeff is furiously typing

48:21.720 --> 48:23.720
All right, Amir's resolution

48:24.920 --> 48:29.960
Are you nervous or you excited is it? Is there even a little part of you that's a little bit excited?

48:29.960 --> 48:34.440
I'm excited because it seems like you're trying to time something up in a grand reveal

48:34.920 --> 48:36.920
I'm curious as to what that thing is

48:40.520 --> 48:43.720
A little delayed, but let's see if you stick the landing

48:47.960 --> 48:51.880
It's hard. Yeah, it is hard. I think I saw Ali coming in

48:54.520 --> 48:56.520
embody young

48:57.240 --> 48:59.240
Fadius

49:05.240 --> 49:09.800
Happy birthday to you

49:09.800 --> 49:39.760
Happy birthday to you, so regrets is out of view, and as they did it, he's flinching

49:40.720 --> 49:47.560
Let's see you playing the size of a frisbee. It's leaking. There's your just coming out of the

49:47.560 --> 49:51.520
side. I want to speak to the juice of the plan. You can grab this mic.

49:51.520 --> 49:55.840
Oh, thanks. Sorry to bother you today. No, it's all good. This is the runnyest

49:55.840 --> 50:03.320
flan flan ever seen. It's a very seropy runny flan. Yeah, I sort of, I think, you know, for you

50:03.320 --> 50:08.640
to embody young this year is for this flan to embody you right now. Where do you get a

50:08.640 --> 50:18.240
flan that size? A bakery in East Hollywood. All right. Did you have to special request?

50:18.240 --> 50:23.040
Like, the trippiness and then you're like, can you make a bigger one? Well, in the special order

50:23.040 --> 50:27.960
request, I said, a day old one is fine. But they didn't give me it. I was hoping they would

50:27.960 --> 50:33.720
like give me a refund and they didn't. We should, uh, dig in talking to them. Like you should,

50:33.720 --> 50:42.200
uh, have it all. Well, it's. You want him to eat it all right now before the show

50:42.200 --> 50:47.040
wins? I love if he tried a bite or if he tried a bite. Yeah, I'll get you a fork. No, no, no, no, no, no,

50:47.040 --> 50:56.440
I'm you're all good. It's his birthday. Just take you second. Well, he's away. I guess

50:56.440 --> 51:02.800
we could talk about his resolution. Basically, actually, no, he needs to hear this. Yeah,

51:02.800 --> 51:10.360
that was really cool. You're anything. And Ali Kant, you're anything. Yeah. How's your

51:10.360 --> 51:16.640
New Year so far? So far, so good. Yeah. You've been going to a ton of like, I would say

51:16.640 --> 51:23.680
locations where the veil is thin between realms. Does that make sense? Joe Pango. Oh, hi. You

51:23.680 --> 51:30.040
know what I mean? Yeah. No, she didn't, you know. Oh, this is so weird. What is

51:30.040 --> 51:36.720
more like off-site that I'm invited to. Is it like you've heard of this? This is my

51:36.720 --> 51:41.120
feeling. Come this year. I would love to. I'll pay my own flights if I can come to the

51:41.120 --> 51:46.080
office. Can you talk to them? I love it. Jeff, what if my family was in Nashville? I still

51:46.080 --> 51:50.960
be allowed to go. I'm, everybody's yelling into my ears. Ali, how's your new year? So far, so

51:50.960 --> 51:57.280
good. I was just cleaning up this flan residue. I accidentally made Alex's whole desk

51:57.280 --> 52:06.240
area sticky as I mean, can you blame anyone? Here's, did you see my MRI? Oh, my God.

52:06.240 --> 52:11.360
Pretty things. He can blame someone. I've been watching a lot of grace, so I understand. And

52:11.360 --> 52:16.000
can you please for the record say that I don't have a can to, what is it? Can a

52:16.000 --> 52:23.080
lot be smoking? Cannot be being brain. Cannot be being smooth brain. Oh, no, I wouldn't say

52:23.080 --> 52:29.400
that about you. You're the vascular. I mean, you know, what I've lost this winter and

52:29.400 --> 52:36.040
vascularity on my body of game in your brain, which is ultimately what you want. Right.

52:36.040 --> 52:44.840
Yeah. That is not how I see the shape of your head. Yeah, because of the hair loss. I guess

52:44.840 --> 52:51.960
we've never seen Jeff without, like, long hair ponytail. Is it giving you body dysmorphia?

52:51.960 --> 52:57.560
Giving or making worse what was already there. Yeah. The second one. Yeah. Amir, how's that

52:57.560 --> 53:03.160
birthday? It's doing good. I'm looking forward to digging into this plan. Yeah. And

53:03.160 --> 53:11.600
then for lunch, Maria, are we thinking digging? No, we ordered Ty Villa, which is what

53:11.600 --> 53:19.640
Johnny's name would have been if he was born and put on him. All right. Getting back to

53:19.640 --> 53:26.280
New Year's resolutions, dulling out rather New Year's resolutions, embody young. This is my

53:26.280 --> 53:33.840
resolution for Amir. Amir, you've had a few peaks. You know, 2011, 2012 era, Jake and Amir,

53:33.840 --> 53:39.960
you were kind of thriving market and otherwise. Thanks. I'm okay. Thank you. Enjoy. You know,

53:39.960 --> 53:43.920
I thought the fired special was you, you know, doing really well. I'm editing those

53:43.920 --> 53:50.280
Patreon videos right now. I think it's a great episode of web series television. Lonely

53:50.280 --> 53:54.560
and horny was a real moment for you. I feel like you went to the sort of longer form,

53:54.560 --> 54:01.800
ig, glitzier, glamier, Hollywood, Regency style. But you're in a massive value right now.

54:01.800 --> 54:07.360
Is that fair to say? Do you agree with that? Hey, cheers.

54:07.360 --> 54:13.360
Let me continue.

54:13.360 --> 54:14.360
The man's planned it.

54:14.360 --> 54:23.960
Yeah, it's another man's treasure. Yeah. And one man. We're really good. It's from the

54:23.960 --> 54:28.960
Marnark. It's from La Marnarka, which is a good bakery. Wow. It's like a Crembroulet,

54:28.960 --> 54:32.720
but without the fun part. Are you listening to your New Year's resolution? Because it's

54:32.720 --> 54:37.320
going to be pertinent to your entire year. Oh, is embody young and body young. Okay. I want

54:37.400 --> 54:46.360
you to act with the urgency creatively that you used to over a decade now and create that

54:46.360 --> 54:53.160
Jake and Amir musical, whether you know it or not. Whether I know it or not. Create a new

54:53.160 --> 54:58.440
long form project this year or bust is your resolution. Even if I don't know it. I thought

54:58.440 --> 55:04.040
embody young was his resolution. His resolution sort of all over the place as we found. I wrote

55:04.120 --> 55:12.200
these in a fever dream last night. I am still confused. Any new works in the in the works,

55:12.200 --> 55:17.240
any long form pieces between you and in Jake? No, I mean, we got the new podcast. That's not

55:17.240 --> 55:24.280
enough. A podcast is a side hustle. I mean, running head gum. I mean, what about a musical?

55:24.280 --> 55:29.480
Yeah, I guess we could work on the musicals. I just we don't really know how to write songs.

55:29.480 --> 55:38.120
What about get Lin Manuel? He's in between Disney. Why don't you just call Lin Manuel up?

55:38.120 --> 55:42.440
And then say, will you write a musical with me, Jake? Yeah. And don't have a mouth full of

55:42.440 --> 55:46.520
flan when you say it. Yeah. Yeah. All right. This was the worst resolution. Yeah. Here we go.

55:46.520 --> 55:48.680
Casey, you ready? Yeah. Sure.

55:49.640 --> 56:01.720
Go Hollywood. Basically, embody young and work on a long form project this year. You've had a few

56:01.720 --> 56:08.120
peaks. This is you're in a massive value. No, sounds familiar. No, here we go. Yeah, I think you just copy

56:08.120 --> 56:14.280
it and paste it. Yeah. Casey, you've been an LA for almost a decade and have next to normal slash

56:14.360 --> 56:24.840
nothing to show. Join a New York Social Club. Take a page from Geraldine page and make

56:24.840 --> 56:32.760
Hollywood her story. Uh-huh. You've got multiple scripts in the works all worth producing.

56:32.760 --> 56:35.240
Is that the actress that jumped off the Hollywood sign and called herself?

56:35.400 --> 56:47.080
I don't mind that. For someone, uh, you've got multiple scripts in the works,

56:47.080 --> 56:52.680
irons in the fire, all worth producing to make her story. Get the cash, make the film, and enjoy.

56:53.800 --> 57:00.280
That's that is my actual resolution. We got there. Yeah. Why couldn't this have been mine, Jeff?

57:00.600 --> 57:04.840
Oh, they were the work on my script, and they'll be listening to the interview.

57:04.840 --> 57:09.720
Well, I don't know. I forget. I forget. If you know, things move quickly in LA.

57:09.720 --> 57:15.160
Yeah, Hollywood. Yeah. Casey's was like, your college dream is make that awesome project and enjoy.

57:15.160 --> 57:20.120
And then Emma's was like, hey, will you listen to old podcast episodes and smile more?

57:20.120 --> 57:23.480
I mean, you're a story. I mean, let me know your grandma.

57:23.640 --> 57:31.480
Oh, what do you guys have going on? What are you guys having to learn the fire that you want to point people towards? Emma,

57:31.480 --> 57:38.600
you could take this moment to get some funding. What do you think? It doesn't seem like I'm going to have much time to get ahead on that this year.

57:40.840 --> 57:44.680
I don't have anything to plug right now. Follow me on Instagram at Emma Rose Foley.

57:45.720 --> 57:49.320
Joel? Joel Man Dunnaff on the Graham.

57:49.640 --> 57:52.280
That's it.

57:52.280 --> 57:55.720
Jessica's disappointed in that. Well, it's just he operates at a different pace than the show.

57:55.720 --> 58:03.960
So I'm like Joel and he's like, well, Joel Man Dunnaff on the Instagram.

58:03.960 --> 58:09.800
I'm faster than that. Follow me at Marie Gillon on a letter box to an Instagram and Twitter and

58:10.680 --> 58:19.000
listen to Pitwall and seek treatment and go touch grass and newcomers.

58:19.960 --> 58:25.400
And I don't know when this comes out, but exploration life is going on tour on the West Coast.

58:25.400 --> 58:30.440
So Seattle, San Diego, and San Francisco. There are still tickets. They got a tour before the

58:30.520 --> 58:41.400
headgum podcasts. Yeah. No problem. What's funny about that?

58:43.640 --> 58:47.320
I wouldn't say anything. If I were tirelessly, but you like it.

58:49.880 --> 58:54.920
Casey, what do you got? You can follow me on Instagram at Casey Donnie. You can listen to the pitwall.

58:55.800 --> 59:01.000
Podcasts I host with Marieka Jeff is on it. Sometimes if he answers his text.

59:01.560 --> 59:05.480
And if you're interested in producing and moving funding and movies specifically,

59:05.480 --> 59:11.160
slide into my DMs, I'm looking right now. I've got a project I'm looking for.

59:11.160 --> 59:16.520
Let's let I want to start with 50 grand, but we can always go up. I'm trying to keep it a

59:16.520 --> 59:22.520
lean production, a lean crew. I'm looking at 10 shooting days. I think 50 grand could get me

59:23.160 --> 59:29.000
there. But if someone wants to 5,000 a day, 5,000 a day, if you have someone wants to give me 5,000

59:29.000 --> 59:34.520
dollars a day, I think we could, I think we could make a movie magic. Plug your Venmo. Maybe somebody

59:34.520 --> 59:39.880
will send you a call. Yeah, Venmo, me at Casey Donnie, and just then just put this is a

59:39.880 --> 59:47.160
forward of the movie. Okay. Allie? Um, please don't need to Casey's movie fund. And you can follow me

59:47.160 --> 59:55.320
on Instagram at aliecon and letterboxed at aliecon and thanks for letting me hop in with the

59:55.480 --> 01:00:07.080
plan. Hop in with the plan. The woman on the one. For a day one. What's that? It's like 21, but

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:20.920
plug. Call me 41 Savage. Are you going to call this? That should have been the name of

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:27.000
your solo podcast instead of call her daddy. It's called a mirror 41 Savage. As a podcast.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:36.120
At Jeffrey James on Instagram. And if you're a concussion physical therapist rehabilitation specialist,

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:43.880
please let me know what exercises to do to bring back my peripheral vision. Leave it in the comments below.

01:00:50.920 --> 01:01:05.880
That was a hit-dum original.

WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
Is this live?

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
No.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
It feels that okay.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
No, doesn't it?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
There it is.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
It's happening.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
We're on.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
In studio.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
Yeah.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
In uterine.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Sure.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Losing the ad revenue right off the bat.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
This episode's off the rails already Johnny.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Let's get it started, Michael.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Let's get it started.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Let's get it started in the hall.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
We have to do 60 minutes.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
So let's start it right now and then explain what we're doing.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Okay.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
And you.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Where have you been?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
This is my shot glass.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
This is already not going well.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
We're doing a power hour.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
We're doing a power hour.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Is there an hour?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Is there an hour?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yep.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
There's that long explanation.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Yeah.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I accidentally used the two shot glasses.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Right around the corner there.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
There's the home.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Yes.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
There we go.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
It starts going.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
It's going so bad that we almost need to restart.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I guess that's just part for the course.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
We've got Jeff Rosenberg on the show for the first time ever.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
You've never heard it before.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
You just saw it.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
I, you know, I saw some of the grammancy show.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
But I'm not going to get a drink.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
This is perfect.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Did not come back.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I don't think I'm going to drink.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
You're going to have 60 of them.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
You've got to get a drink.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
You've got to go home.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
You Irish accident.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
We're drinking.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Yeah.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I think half of this is a shot.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
These are too big.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
We should also say.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
These are like.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Jake is doing whiskey.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
That's correct.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Because you didn't want to hand it.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
But I'm not doing it.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
We're not 60 shots of his feet.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
We're doing the equivalent.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
The liquor.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Okay.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Every 10 minutes every 10 minutes.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Right.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
What do you think it was every eight and a half minutes?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
He would take a shot.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Yeah.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Are we?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
I'm fucking itching to drink this.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Can we do it in 10 seconds?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
I'm starting the timer right now.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
And then we'll get into the episode.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Cheers.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Cheers.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Cheers.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Men.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Men.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Delicious.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Smooth to Cate.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Going down all of our throats.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
The taste of Cate is.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Me or Shite compared to that of.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Wow.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
I can already tell.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I cannot do six shots of fucking.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
That was more than a shot we should say.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Was it?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Great.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
These are not shot glasses.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
These are dixie cup size.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
It's the smallest I could get.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
On Tuesday.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Oh, are you British?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Yeah.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
On Tuesday.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
We shouldn't say that.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Japanese didn't.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
You said it would.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
A power half hour with breakfast.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Yes.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
On Tuesday.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
On Tuesday.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
I tweeted out.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Why doesn't there again sit.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
A brand ambassador.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
And they fucking responded.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
They had the goal.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
And within two hours.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
I was an ambassador.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
And a beer.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
And a beer.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
And beer ambassador.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
And beer ambassador.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
But did you get his hair cancer for free?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
I get it.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
I get it.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Do you get it?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Reimbursed like fucking tax.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Is that true?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Wow.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Interesting.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
This is actually a loads of experience.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Do not take the shot with you guys.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Every.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
I feel like you should be drinking a shot of something.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I can't do it.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Because my stomach can't handle it.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Like I could.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
I guess I could do water.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
You're a source.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
As hell from a insane ab workout.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Yeah.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
And with Micah.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
So he's right.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
It's theoretically going through the same.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Yeah.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
But I can burp.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
So it's different.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I guess.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
But we are drinking.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Gensets.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
That I will eventually have gotten for free.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Are they giving you money as well?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Out of curiosity.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
No.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
It's not a paid gig.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
It's a reimbursed gig.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
So you have to.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
You have to send receipts.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
It's my turn.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
And it's on my turn.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
That's pretty long.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
But no.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
My friend Max was the Narraganset beer ambassador.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Brand ambassador.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
They didn't have the term at the time.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
And he's the one who told me that they should reimburse me.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
So I haven't even confirmed it.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Reimbursed you.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
That's really good.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
But actually, why don't you leave the puns to the brand ambassador.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
How do you going to do anything?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
You don't have enough hands.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
The laptops in your lap.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
It's on your fucking legs.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
You're holding a mic.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
I was so mad.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
She was trying to get us to do this in a better way.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
This is all we could kind of figure out.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Yeah.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
And I already lost us the ad revenue because I had to get us started.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
And get us started.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Let's get it.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Let's get it.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
We're done with this.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
I think we're doing double shots of this shit.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Sorry.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
It's already been five minutes.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Let's kind of wax your first spell.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
I am an ambassador.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
We are drinking there again.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Sit high neighbor.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
That's a great day for against it.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Johnny, tell us about your sexual escapades as of late.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
All right.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Well, I got invited to a sex party.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Yeah.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
It's tomorrow, right?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
No, next Friday.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Okay.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Did you get invited or did you kind of solicit an invitation?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I got a little bit of boat.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
They invited me, but I had to apply.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Okay.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Man.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Man.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Man.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Being invited sounds like way sexier than applying.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
I don't know.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
I was down on my knees begging to get into the front door.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
What was the application process?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
So.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Dick.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
36.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
24.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
36.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Well, winning man.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Johnny.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Dick measurements.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Head torso and balls.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
They rate your attractiveness on a scale of 1 to 14, which is a very odd number.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Actually, very even number.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
That's a kind of humor.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
That's going to be what you're drinking liquor.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Instead of beer.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
They just ask for your social media, basically, and what you're into.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
And what'd you say?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Let's see.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Well, yes.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Or whatever.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
I'm a power hour.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
500 words.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Answer.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Don't need it.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
So where does this go down?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Smells like Bushwick.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I thought this was in Brooklyn.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
It's actually in Soho.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
It's actually in Soho.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
It's actually in Soho.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
It's in Soho.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Can you just kiss me?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Can you kiss?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
I can absolutely kiss.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Yeah.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Thanks, neighbor.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
That's good.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
I can take a full can.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
It's a thanks neighbor.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Yes.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Maro.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Logan.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
There we go.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
It's a tiny neighbor.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
They have a lot of slogans, which is what I like about them.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Their design is great.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
I mean, look at the box.

06:36.000 --> 06:44.420
The body doesn't really need a slogan like that. They kind of sell themselves with like the purity of the lightness of that kind of that that's sub

06:45.720 --> 06:47.720
North American bear

06:47.720 --> 06:49.720
Incorrect

06:51.120 --> 06:53.120
What is this episode?

06:53.120 --> 06:58.760
Yes, you fucking shout out my fucking show we have stuff to get you. I just we've been settling in. I've already had like a beer

06:58.760 --> 07:03.120
It's been seven minutes has been seven minutes. Yeah. Yeah, it's been seven minutes so far

07:03.120 --> 07:07.340
It feels like time is going by fast now. Yeah, but I feel like it's some point in the middle

07:07.340 --> 07:12.420
It's gonna be like this is never gonna have to be outlined. Also, please overt your eyes from the screen

07:12.420 --> 07:18.740
We did like to not know the time to yeah, because I'm more counting and then it's like it's like counting sheep

07:18.740 --> 07:22.940
Yeah, but I kind of need to know the time because I need to take a shot at on the trail

07:22.940 --> 07:28.400
We can know the 10 the 15s or did you decide? Let's do 10s. Let's do 10s. Let's see. We'll do 10s

07:29.120 --> 07:31.760
I'm gonna get wasted. Well, dude. I'm gonna do less

07:31.760 --> 07:33.760
That the first

07:33.760 --> 07:42.760
Is it I think it's a full shot. We'll do 15 or no major killer. Don't try an entirely new style move on a day that it rains

07:42.760 --> 07:47.560
I'm wearing all white and it was pouring today. Yeah, I thought that was pretty sharp actually

07:47.560 --> 07:52.060
They look good. It looks good. I'm enjoying it, but it's every time I'm on the street

07:52.060 --> 07:58.320
I'm like I'm gonna ruin white pants. Yeah, that's it. That is the problem with wearing white. Yeah, did we just miss one? I think a lot of time is one part

07:58.320 --> 08:00.320
I would have done

08:01.760 --> 08:07.280
Fasten some things. I think we did miss one. I think we missed one. We definitely missed one

08:07.280 --> 08:11.840
I'm gonna take a cheers. And what's that? I don't think we need to add to it if we don't see here at the dawn

08:11.840 --> 08:14.480
I just can't get enough of that golden nectar

08:15.120 --> 08:19.680
Gensic cotton. If you're to cut a ambassador, you should be taking extra one, too

08:20.000 --> 08:22.960
Well, we even call it to cut to ambassador. There's nothing

08:23.440 --> 08:25.840
Could still be a tow your sitter to caught a no

08:26.320 --> 08:28.320
Yeah

08:28.800 --> 08:30.800
Thank you. What about like a

08:31.760 --> 08:35.440
Comrade like to come to come rad-dray. No

08:36.560 --> 08:38.560
It's forced

08:38.560 --> 08:40.560
Come rad-dray

08:40.560 --> 08:42.560
Why drag

08:42.960 --> 08:46.800
To cut like acres of the world unite. You have nothing to lose, but a bottle cap

08:47.680 --> 08:49.680
Is that in front of their website?

08:50.640 --> 08:55.320
It was a play on the first couple sentences of the communist manifesto. I see

08:55.560 --> 08:57.320
Of course

08:57.960 --> 08:59.960
I have a couple subjects

08:59.960 --> 09:06.920
To wax about that's kind of singular to you guys as people. Okay. You already established that. I'm a Narrigan set brand and beer sitter

09:07.960 --> 09:10.600
You know anybody go to Narriganset.com

09:11.160 --> 09:15.560
See if you can locate beer sellers near you whether it's a bar or whether it's a guard

09:16.680 --> 09:19.720
Is that what I think or is that was that just fucking plug?

09:21.240 --> 09:23.240
Just they're not paying you yet

09:23.240 --> 09:25.240
Yeah, we get all

09:25.400 --> 09:33.080
Amazing you spend war. I'm in the literal red you're operating on a assumption that they're going to reimburse you

09:33.080 --> 09:35.080
You don't even know for sure

09:35.080 --> 09:37.880
When I'm operating on is all cylinders going fine

09:39.320 --> 09:46.920
No, Jake, let's talk about you search for a watch. We were just talking about this. Yeah, you want to be you want to appear. I'm going to step out. I want to I want to appear

09:47.400 --> 09:52.920
Powerful and rich to others. Yes, you don't think that comes across with your plaid shirt

09:53.800 --> 09:58.200
Sorry, I guess I hope it does I hope it does, but I was getting hot

09:58.200 --> 10:01.160
So I'm not to take this off when I am wearing a buck mace and t-shirt

10:01.160 --> 10:06.280
Yeah, it's a little more expensive than you're having if you think buck will be at the sex party. Oh, I hope so

10:06.680 --> 10:08.680
Mr. Mace

10:10.680 --> 10:12.680
Again

10:15.560 --> 10:17.560
That's that liquor

10:17.560 --> 10:19.560
That's the liquor joke

10:19.560 --> 10:26.040
No, but you're in the market for a swatch. No, not a swatch, but a Swiss watch on the list Swiss. Yeah, I'd like to be sweet

10:26.760 --> 10:32.520
German did a British designed yeah Swiss made in a way German engineer the world will source

10:34.040 --> 10:38.520
He's a Nazi set of fire. I believe what's he he is a Nazi set

10:39.320 --> 10:41.320
Says who

10:41.400 --> 10:50.520
I am worried for the rest of the show. I only outlined 45 minutes so we're not behind schedule outline anything

10:52.520 --> 10:57.640
So far this is actually all gone to Jecks plan and to my head. I didn't eat a lot today

10:57.640 --> 11:00.280
I had a chicken salad sandow from Frankles

11:01.080 --> 11:04.200
That's huge though. They do big sandwiches don't they that's true

11:04.920 --> 11:10.520
Why are you leaving over there now? What's that and are you living in green point now?

11:11.320 --> 11:14.280
Say it online you dox every

11:15.320 --> 11:20.840
Yeah, I'm in green point nice green point some big neighborhood have you been to twins lounge? Yes, I did a bar crawl

11:21.240 --> 11:25.160
And you were out of town. Yeah, I also wouldn't have come. That's

11:26.120 --> 11:31.880
Very good my podcast renovation actually has a monthly residency there at twins lounge. That's right

11:32.280 --> 11:37.640
Really? How did you ever make it through without sweating? What do you mean? Oh, because that you go upstairs?

11:37.720 --> 11:41.240
Yeah, yeah, we've never been upstairs. Is it hot? Maybe maybe not

11:42.600 --> 11:47.000
Temperature wise or like the first time I went to all of the bartenders had their shirts off

11:47.480 --> 11:55.400
What really illegal take as you I took one early. I think because we're talking about watches nice that's a department of health

11:55.400 --> 11:59.320
Johnny you're at the bar crawl. Mm-hmm. It was kind of in remembrance of Johnny

12:00.040 --> 12:06.360
What did we talk about this already? No, why do we did remembrance? I so I sent out a little Pixar

12:06.680 --> 12:08.680
Shout out a Pixar a former sponsor

12:09.480 --> 12:14.280
I actually use their platform. It's pretty cool. I just made a little thing saying you know bar crawl

12:14.280 --> 12:17.400
It was called a night of joy. Mm-hmm. Did you go to night of joy? Oh

12:18.760 --> 12:23.320
Kind of get in there. So for people don't live in Brooklyn. There is a bar in Brooklyn called night of joy

12:23.320 --> 12:27.480
I did a bar crawl in Brooklyn called it night of joy, but we didn't go to the night of joy

12:27.480 --> 12:33.240
Like a point of that out. Yeah, that was a great bar. Like that bar. It does look abandoned when they're not open yet

12:33.400 --> 12:38.040
Yeah, most of I because it's under the BQ evasically everything there looks like shit

12:38.040 --> 12:43.480
It's I do to fur do you know that they're building a bike slide? I've just passed by night shade. I think it's

12:43.480 --> 12:46.200
There's a night shade in the arts district. It's a lamp that's a lamp store

12:46.200 --> 12:50.680
No, it's I do I thought that it was like a de-funked bar for the longest time and then

12:51.240 --> 12:56.120
Years after living in this neighborhood. I drove by and like two and it was just popping

12:57.240 --> 13:01.720
Why are you driving like two I am or two PM? I guess it was I I had landed

13:01.880 --> 13:06.520
You're drunk driving. Yeah, I was I came back. It was when I came back from LA so it was late at night

13:06.520 --> 13:10.920
And it was like maybe one it I think it was almost to um but to round up the bar crawl story

13:11.480 --> 13:16.120
I was using Pixar and one of the templates had an extra line of text and I was like I don't have anything to put here

13:16.120 --> 13:17.240
The info's already here

13:17.240 --> 13:21.800
So I was like let me just make it in honor of Johnny and then I it was gonna be a night in honor of Jonathan Villa

13:21.800 --> 13:26.360
And then I changed it to remembrance but I spelled it wrong so then everybody was saying it was in remembrance

13:26.520 --> 13:28.520
And then at the third bar Ramona

13:29.720 --> 13:34.920
I gave everybody a chance to say a few words about Johnny. What's Johnny? Well, he's there. I was like that's nice

13:36.920 --> 13:40.680
How many people came? I think total like probably 30 40

13:49.400 --> 13:53.880
30 to 40. I don't even know that's such a disturbing amount of people

13:57.320 --> 14:03.960
Are you rented it out? We didn't rent it if you go on Rezi you can reserve the upstairs at Ramona. Oh, it's

14:04.760 --> 14:11.240
That's crazy. But we had the dinosaurs to ourselves. That's so nice. It was insane and then we got like Johnny and I got a couple bottles of wine

14:11.240 --> 14:16.280
Champagne. We popped the champagne and remembrance. Yeah, and believe you haven't like done this since

14:16.920 --> 14:20.680
This was like two weeks ago. No, it was when you were in LA really two weeks ago. Yeah

14:21.640 --> 14:24.600
We should do it again. We wanted to do one for Johnny's half birthday in two weeks

14:24.840 --> 14:31.480
So they're always about Johnny. I don't mind that. I'd be done for always Johnny themed. Yeah, it was a good thing covid's over

14:31.480 --> 14:32.680
Hello

14:32.680 --> 14:38.760
Totally man Johnny still hasn't fucking got a breakthrough case. Yeah, I've been going out more

14:39.720 --> 14:45.480
Just as much if not more than him. Yeah, I saw today the day you'll get it for sure today it's actually my death day

14:47.080 --> 14:52.280
After this is my recovery day. Yeah, so Jeff is a great

14:52.840 --> 14:56.200
Last a little bit longer then you're all fucked

14:56.680 --> 15:02.360
This is already not great because I'm starting to feel buzzed really because I didn't need enough today and not a huge

15:02.360 --> 15:06.680
Just sandwich with our well actually won't ask the time Jeff does want to know I don't know

15:07.480 --> 15:12.760
But anyway, so yeah, I wanted to ask but yeah, like you're watching KG about it. I'm not being KG

15:12.760 --> 15:13.800
I have

15:13.800 --> 15:15.800
48 to $50,000 that I'd like to spend

15:19.640 --> 15:20.840
On the watch

15:20.920 --> 15:25.160
On the watch really on the face. I'll spend more on the bracelet

15:25.160 --> 15:30.280
Talk about it again. Let's just plant the seed right now that I'm trying that I kind of successfully got you into the idea of

15:30.440 --> 15:33.240
Maybe getting well I see he's wearing a necklace and everyone here

15:33.240 --> 15:41.320
I believe is wearing a necklace. I may if I'm wrong. No, I'll tell you what I had my gateway piece of jewelry was my wedding

15:42.120 --> 15:47.800
I made me realize that I like interesting thing about this power hour timer is it doesn't go off if it's not on the screen

15:47.800 --> 15:51.640
Is that what's happening? Yeah, yeah, I do mean I've noticed we haven't heard them

15:51.640 --> 15:57.960
No, here's what we'll do so on has to pull it up on their phone all I wanted to do was plant the seed that you might you're in the market for a watch

15:57.960 --> 16:03.880
Yes, so we'll follow up in you know four to eight weeks whenever you get the piece and we'll talk about the story

16:04.200 --> 16:06.600
Yeah, also Micah might get a Venus

16:07.160 --> 16:09.160
Pena

16:09.880 --> 16:14.920
That's a callback for everyone at home. That's a callback from earlier when I made the same exact joke

16:15.320 --> 16:17.080
Several times

16:17.080 --> 16:23.800
What I do think is going to be the viewers experience for this episode is that it it's the most like it just feels like they're hanging out with us

16:24.200 --> 16:29.160
But either to its detriment or not right that was it like it wasn't a podcast that was just

16:29.720 --> 16:31.720
That was us hanging out. Yeah

16:31.960 --> 16:37.960
Namaste I like when it's timed perfectly to like the end of a joke. That's really good. Yeah, that's nice

16:39.080 --> 16:43.240
Let's all see how often that but it's also kind of funny when it's in the middle of somebody's well

16:43.560 --> 16:46.920
But then people are drinking instead of laughing and you feel like you really like

16:47.960 --> 16:51.800
Blue it Johnny let's talk about fashion. What's the next move for your ass? Sorry

16:53.000 --> 16:55.240
Why do you talk to Johnny about fashion and not me?

17:00.520 --> 17:05.640
The best dress. I don't have a Rolex on this wrist that would be are you might have one?

17:06.920 --> 17:08.920
Okay, you're chasing by the way

17:09.240 --> 17:11.640
Gosh it's actually have the puns. Oh

17:12.280 --> 17:16.580
You said you were asked I said 40 people shout out to my bar called you were like how the fuck do you know these

17:16.580 --> 17:19.560
There's many people my tattoo artist showed up

17:19.560 --> 17:23.240
There and yeah at liking honey shout out. She's based in LA

17:23.800 --> 17:26.200
But she's in Paris right now or should I say pop

17:27.480 --> 17:29.480
Say anything about where she's based

17:29.480 --> 17:37.000
She's based on tangential Johnny fashion. What's the next move like the next swurve what's next fit Johnny?

17:37.000 --> 17:40.760
Let's talk well. I think he's in agreement with me if I'm gonna cut in here with the turtle neck

17:41.160 --> 17:43.640
Yes, he's the only person who hasn't answered yet

17:44.920 --> 17:46.920
I'm just

17:46.920 --> 17:51.560
I apologize for cutting in but please no no you actually had a very very good point with the turtle neck

17:53.320 --> 17:57.720
Look man, I think the 80s are back and full force just wait to bring summer

17:58.440 --> 18:03.800
80s not 90s 90s was 80s is going to be interesting

18:04.200 --> 18:05.480
Interesting

18:05.480 --> 18:11.640
You know what because we were at the Johnson's in Bushwick. Yes, and they were paying they just play 80s smash hits

18:11.640 --> 18:14.280
But they've been playing 80s music forever

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
But how it's even a

18:19.000 --> 18:24.440
I don't think you can base it on music is what I'm saying if you think you go to a bar and they're playing this type of music

18:24.440 --> 18:27.640
So that's an ex fashion. Yeah, I don't I don't buy that all right

18:27.720 --> 18:29.720
As someone wearing a buck macy

18:30.520 --> 18:33.000
About to wear a Rolex about to wear a roll

18:33.880 --> 18:36.760
You see this that's not that's gonna be a Rolex

18:36.760 --> 18:40.060
Your frail risk it's gonna be a Rolex. Don't call them frail

18:40.060 --> 18:45.560
They're fancy about that. Oh, like what happened? Oh, I need to thicken them up somehow

18:46.440 --> 18:53.240
What about a watch on like the bicepter like your hunting every twin of each I'm just saying like like why were it on the wrist?

18:53.720 --> 19:00.920
I don't like showing like drawing attention to thin wrists, which I may or may not have and I want to I want to wear it

19:00.920 --> 19:04.600
Maybe midway up. Yeah, is that what about midwife up?

19:05.160 --> 19:07.160
Mean you could wear a watch on your waist

19:07.560 --> 19:11.880
My Rolex is a belt yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, um, did you guys see oh?

19:12.760 --> 19:17.560
Sports center tweeted out. Did you see the Jake fall-puff it? I'm sorry. I asked no, I didn't watch the Jake pull fight

19:17.720 --> 19:22.680
Was it received or was it the one from like a month ago glad you asked this was from like a month ago

19:22.680 --> 19:28.760
But it was they tweeted out that he was wearing Rolexes on his like boxing shorts. He wasn't at all. They were re-shared mills

19:29.560 --> 19:32.520
Huh? They were re-shared mills

19:33.640 --> 19:35.160
Richard mills

19:35.160 --> 19:39.480
See, I feel bad doing them these episodes in person you've never heard the show. I yell a lot

19:40.360 --> 19:44.520
With the zoom it's like a level of like separation where I'm like I'm not actually yelling at another cue right

19:44.520 --> 19:49.920
Yeah, I just yelled at you and I feel bad. I didn't I didn't you can I didn't consider that you yelling

19:53.640 --> 19:57.400
The interruptions are weirder because they catch people off guard

20:03.480 --> 20:09.480
I'm sorry. I was looking to see when we're thinking of a shot. Oh shit. We're definitely missing some of these

20:10.200 --> 20:12.200
Welcome to

20:12.200 --> 20:15.000
The miss one miss one. Yeah, I like that you're resting your

20:15.800 --> 20:18.040
Shot of beer on your laptop

20:18.600 --> 20:23.880
Anyway, the people listening to this episode will be able to do drink along with us or have like the drinking

20:24.440 --> 20:29.080
Become so super merry gole-fix and impost probably. Yeah, I'll add I'll make sure we haven't all right

20:29.080 --> 20:33.000
What people should do is like if you're gonna drink along to this please do it with friends

20:33.400 --> 20:37.400
Please don't do this alone. I feel yeah to listen to the show and drink alone as the worst

20:37.400 --> 20:42.120
You don't even have to do it responsibly just don't do it alone well the high neighbor or

20:42.280 --> 20:44.600
Rhynever you're giving

20:44.680 --> 20:46.680
Genset so much fucking airtime

20:48.040 --> 20:51.960
I promised their social media manager who did not give me their name

20:52.600 --> 20:58.520
That I would talk at length about Genset on this baby. Usually their email is usually their name, though

20:58.520 --> 20:59.880
It was

20:59.880 --> 21:01.880
Instagram

21:02.520 --> 21:11.320
And again follows that like actually kind of similar to me or less. Okay, that's either a flex or the opposite of a flex

21:12.280 --> 21:14.760
I would say somehow both

21:16.600 --> 21:22.040
Welcome to high neighbor or Rhynever. Okay, this game is near against it's themed obviously

21:23.080 --> 21:25.080
Basically, I'm gonna shout out a celebrity

21:29.480 --> 21:32.840
You're in selling ads for you're as an

21:33.400 --> 21:39.560
Embarrassed or you're just like giving away free content and they're not even gonna re-inverse

21:40.120 --> 21:45.000
You're fucking you're not an imperson your mark. I think I'm spent $50 on their games

21:45.000 --> 21:50.040
It's since Tuesday and like usually we sell ads on this show like once what's one add on this show like $500?

21:50.040 --> 21:52.040
Something like that. Yeah

21:52.040 --> 21:54.040
I talked about it for 20 minutes

21:54.040 --> 21:57.480
Anyway, what can talk about what's it not what's an advertiser on this show?

21:58.840 --> 22:00.680
Tacata

22:00.680 --> 22:03.720
Athletic greens better home great formerly Ray com

22:04.680 --> 22:09.240
We're really pigs are what let's deal let's deal with the advertisers we belong

22:13.240 --> 22:17.480
Has Jake had anything in a minute what time what time are we at? 20

22:18.360 --> 22:21.160
So I wouldn't have ten more minutes wait

22:21.880 --> 22:28.440
No, I thought they're for the 10 it's on the 10 let's do it but now do it on the next one do it on this one

22:28.920 --> 22:33.800
I'm just saying it's literally been in the minute. Oh, yeah, you're gonna do it between ones

22:35.000 --> 22:39.640
The game the name of the game is high neighbor or Ryan neighbor because ever played no obviously

22:39.640 --> 22:45.320
haven't really no you came up with this game based on your sponsorship or lack the wrong

22:45.320 --> 22:47.880
You've got over here. Can I guess what it is? Yeah

22:48.760 --> 22:55.320
It's gonna be a fact about something and you have to guess if it's a fact about narrow against it or if it's a fact about

22:55.640 --> 22:57.640
Whiskey

22:58.200 --> 23:00.840
That would have actually been more pertinent the situation

23:00.840 --> 23:06.120
Being that Jake is drinking bourbon, but could have been a rye, but wasn't that was the a buzzer or not

23:06.280 --> 23:10.920
necessarily the drink minute, right? No, that was an incorrect buzzer the truth and it is

23:13.240 --> 23:15.240
That was good like you're looking at it

23:17.000 --> 23:18.600
Cheers

23:18.600 --> 23:21.960
No, the name of the game is high neighbor Ryan neighbor meaning

23:22.840 --> 23:24.840
I'm gonna say a celebrities name

23:25.320 --> 23:30.600
And you guys have to say whether or not you think they've been spotted by the pops drinking

23:30.600 --> 23:36.440
Ganset or whether they have lived or currently live in a rye rye New York. Yeah, okay

23:37.560 --> 23:42.200
It actually be really easy for me. Oh, but we play per real cash Jeff doesn't know this

23:42.760 --> 23:46.680
Yeah, so it's a hundred dollars for every right answer hundred dollars owed to me for every wrong answer

23:47.160 --> 23:50.520
My bank account is sub a thousand dollars at the moment, so let's just

23:50.600 --> 23:52.600
Right carefully

23:52.600 --> 23:59.320
Don't look at the screen, obviously first person is Jason Bateman. Oh, oh, Ganset

24:00.200 --> 24:02.200
rye

24:02.600 --> 24:08.600
First answers the only one that's for cash. So words he lived he lives in a rye

24:09.560 --> 24:12.120
That's insane. I thought it was in those arcs

24:13.160 --> 24:15.160
That was a television show by the way

24:15.240 --> 24:17.240
It's not real

24:18.920 --> 24:26.040
Bateman lives in rye to be sure. How do you know if you go to the rye with competing pages says notable people who live here or from here?

24:26.040 --> 24:28.520
I said live or have lived

24:28.920 --> 24:32.520
There it is and is it better and there it didn't loss than to have never lived at all

24:33.400 --> 24:39.800
So he's maybe from rye. He definitely lives in L.A. Yeah, he holds court in L.A. He lives in rye

24:39.880 --> 24:45.240
Well, Bateman you had to think about it like he's he's been in several TV shows several movies

24:46.520 --> 24:51.960
He has podcast with bought by Amazon for a hundred or Spotify. No, Amazon for hundreds of millions of dollars

24:51.960 --> 24:53.960
Spotify boo

24:53.960 --> 25:03.240
Yeah, I feel like he you throw anything to innovation out of Spotify. He's got two places. Yeah, like he has a two-bedroom apartment in L.A. and a studio in Manhattan

25:03.240 --> 25:13.960
That's bad. Is this like studio? Yeah, it's a lot of money. He has two fucking paths. He has two bedroom apart condo in New York

25:13.960 --> 25:19.240
And he has a whole condo. He has a house in the hills and he's rye. Where he has to be his

25:19.240 --> 25:25.480
Children. One bath house in the hill. He has children and a wife. Okay, okay, so maybe a three bedroom one

25:25.480 --> 25:31.640
one Swift Taylor Swift. She probably has she is fucking loaded because she gets royalties on all of her

25:32.120 --> 25:37.800
on her fucking music. So she has she doesn't because I thought I thought yeah, I'm going to actually

25:37.800 --> 25:43.400
Does and see from scooter. I'm saying she has a more bedroom scooter condo in mall. I kind of think the scooter

25:43.400 --> 25:50.280
One laughs for bedroom condo. Yes, so for bedroom condo because there's two on the top one on the main and one in the basement

25:50.280 --> 25:52.280
It's a wreck room

25:54.280 --> 25:56.280
I said

25:56.280 --> 25:58.280
Just because you're not chasing for payment

25:59.880 --> 26:01.880
What was your kind of looks like?

26:04.360 --> 26:06.360
What's the next fucking person?

26:06.360 --> 26:12.200
Taylor Swift. I think she's against it. No, she's a fucking. That's absolutely correct. Thank you to Johnny

26:12.200 --> 26:17.000
ville for getting that right because guess what? Her biggest beach house is in Rhode Island. See

26:17.000 --> 26:21.640
you know she's been seen with a dance. Newport. I should have known that. I wish.

26:21.960 --> 26:29.000
Oh, man. I'm already feeling it and I get very violent when I'm true. Yeah, I've been out with Johnny a lot

26:29.000 --> 26:34.680
He's fucking picks fights. You'd never assume based on kind of look for small children because I'm already pretty small

26:34.680 --> 26:41.080
Yeah, so I'm trying to see if I can win a fight right so it's without early. So he's drunk picture him drunk at 330

26:41.080 --> 26:46.200
Like just waiting outside school school school school bus is crime target just like waiting outside

26:46.200 --> 26:49.480
You know that you need to do work on yourself when you say the word target

26:50.440 --> 26:54.920
All right Anthony Bourdain. Oh, that's cancel. Correct

26:56.200 --> 27:01.560
Fucking $100. Hell yeah. I also thought that that was the shot. Are we gonna show the photos of them?

27:01.960 --> 27:06.840
I don't remember what the game is about to be a game is high neighbor Ryan. We think you are they're either

27:07.400 --> 27:12.760
There's even a photo of you. I'm never gonna narrow the camera near Genset or they are from or live

27:13.320 --> 27:17.000
They spent time in Ryan New York. I spent time really on

27:17.000 --> 27:21.560
But there's no get the game Ryan ever you can't even name the

27:22.840 --> 27:24.840
Why don't you know if they live in rock

27:27.800 --> 27:35.320
Does no a lot about where celebrities live and non celebrities that's true this Westchester County

27:36.120 --> 27:40.360
But right no Ryan New York. That's on a Westchester. We're talking to Jessica County

27:41.800 --> 27:42.760
Interesting

27:42.760 --> 27:46.680
It's in Westchester but court of Harold and Mod fame

27:47.800 --> 27:49.800
Right

27:49.800 --> 27:54.680
This sucks. Yeah, I mean that was obvious because like you wouldn't have just thought of that guy you were like

27:55.240 --> 28:00.920
I can tell which ones are pulled from the right what could be at this point because Jason Bateman was like the number one

28:01.720 --> 28:03.720
Bud court holds court and right

28:05.080 --> 28:11.080
Notable alumni of right have I ever gone to bud court have you ever held bud court? Oh, absolutely not

28:11.160 --> 28:18.040
All right, here's if you had a two-fanny dude. I'm getting a lot of her being honest. Yeah, I'm not sure you didn't now

28:19.400 --> 28:21.400
Mike Dentony

28:21.400 --> 28:23.400
Dentony right fucking

28:24.360 --> 28:26.360
Genset

28:26.360 --> 28:28.360
Told you right

28:29.880 --> 28:32.040
Fucking Seth McFarlane

28:32.600 --> 28:34.360
Genset

28:34.360 --> 28:39.160
Correct. I think you're up 200 and he keeps edging you out by like a millisecond

28:39.160 --> 28:44.040
Well, I was up 200 then I I was up 100. I owed you money then I just got money back

28:44.040 --> 28:47.000
So I have meeting thinking about who owes me money. That's great

28:51.080 --> 28:57.000
You're faded man Amelia fucking error heart. Oh wow, right. Obviously, Ryan

28:58.520 --> 29:00.520
This sucks

29:02.200 --> 29:04.200
Debra fucking messing

29:04.280 --> 29:06.280

29:06.680 --> 29:09.800
Show me the folder of messing with the dancing. There's no photo

29:11.000 --> 29:15.240
What's from Rhode Island so you know she had a Genset, but you

29:15.240 --> 29:15.960
But you said

29:15.960 --> 29:17.960
Comoretta see them you broke your own guns

29:19.160 --> 29:22.280
There's no photos of celebrities drinking near a Genset

29:22.280 --> 29:25.960
They want to bring us this game because I'm sponsored by the shit

29:26.680 --> 29:29.720
What am I supposed to do? Nergenset doesn't rhyme with anything Johnny

29:30.760 --> 29:32.760
You you're a fraud

29:32.840 --> 29:34.840
Presansen maybe wrong

29:35.480 --> 29:40.760
You're a fucking funny man. You said the game was if the celebrity was photographed with a Genset

29:40.760 --> 29:41.720
Yeah

29:41.720 --> 29:44.040
For real I'm not gonna be wrong Rhode Island

29:44.760 --> 29:47.960
Man who hasn't even had a Rolex. I'm gonna have a

29:48.840 --> 29:53.240
Even know the name was Jeffrey mean Chris Hanson near a Genset. Well, he's Kanson

He's Kanson. He's canceled. We saw Kanson. I don't they see really can't what did I do?

29:59.080 --> 30:02.120
Kanson. Oh, it's good. Wait Chris Hanson

30:02.680 --> 30:04.680
There's no he's

30:04.680 --> 30:06.360
He can't

30:06.360 --> 30:08.360
Yeah

30:10.360 --> 30:12.360
Who's the guy from the bachelor

30:13.640 --> 30:15.640
I don't know

30:15.640 --> 30:17.640
Handsome

30:18.920 --> 30:21.960
Thank you. Thank you. All right. John fucking J

30:22.920 --> 30:24.920
The like by the law

30:27.320 --> 30:28.600
Jake is up for $100

30:31.000 --> 30:35.080
You know why the power our works for high and mighty because that's a show about nothing

30:35.480 --> 30:40.680
Yeah, so is this show but and there's too much structure to also do a power or we should have just waxed

30:41.080 --> 30:44.920
We should have just waxed. See yeah, and that's your fault. You were stressing out about writing this entire episode

30:45.800 --> 30:47.800
Yeah

30:47.880 --> 30:49.880
Might be as cause gave us as a better host

30:49.880 --> 30:51.880
Okay

30:53.560 --> 30:55.560
That was easy

30:57.640 --> 30:58.920
I'll never not laugh

30:58.920 --> 31:01.880
The Nash this segment's too long

31:03.240 --> 31:06.280
When you get to when you get to John Jay and Ogden Nash

31:07.160 --> 31:11.320
Let's let's fucking move on. Yeah, right? Just pay me yeah

31:11.560 --> 31:14.680
Exactly. I've come up a solid pay me my $300

31:14.680 --> 31:16.680
Obviously when the game

31:16.760 --> 31:21.160
All right, can I sell you? It just goes in the taxing part of the demo

31:22.200 --> 31:24.840
It's but I'm the one that gets taxed on demo because it's my income

31:25.560 --> 31:27.560
You actually can write it off as a loss

31:29.400 --> 31:30.760
All right

31:30.760 --> 31:32.040
No way

31:32.040 --> 31:34.040
Yes, that was like a 30 second minute

31:34.680 --> 31:40.280
Not for you. No, I think I took it. Maybe I took it too early. I think you did. I mean anything for cancer

31:41.240 --> 31:45.160
God if I ever go into a non entertainment industry job

31:45.160 --> 31:50.440
This is gonna be the thing that loses her fucking position. What's that entertainment industry job that you currently have?

31:56.200 --> 31:58.200
That was easy

31:59.880 --> 32:01.560
Full steam ahead full steam ahead

32:03.080 --> 32:05.960
All right, are you ready for our next segment or do you guys want a seven minute break?

32:06.920 --> 32:11.560
Seven minute break. Let's take a break. Yeah, let's take a breather. I love it. Let's we'll wax

32:12.920 --> 32:14.600
Michael, let's let's talk

32:14.600 --> 32:17.240
Little dirty. Hey, did it twice. Let's talk that

32:18.600 --> 32:20.600
In a rose

32:20.600 --> 32:25.560
You touched my leg and I sort of tried to move it out of the way and I almost seemed like you came for it again

32:26.200 --> 32:29.720
Like you're doing it out. I thought you were the reason I looked at you the second time

32:29.720 --> 32:31.720
Because I thought you were trying to get my attention

32:36.840 --> 32:38.840
You're a fucking trash bro

32:42.760 --> 32:46.120
It's not been that my guess is puking

32:47.240 --> 32:50.520
I guess we're falling at the mouth. There's two doors

32:51.080 --> 32:53.560
There's no worse through the tower

32:54.440 --> 32:56.680
There are two doors to the home

32:58.520 --> 33:00.040
I'm feeling that my

33:00.440 --> 33:02.440
Oh, wait, everyone quiet is your thing

33:04.120 --> 33:06.120
Oh, k-book, sorry

33:13.720 --> 33:18.840
Yeah, no, I can't get you against me. You went to other room. Yeah, I can I can absolutely get to you

33:18.840 --> 33:24.600
This is one where I might text Ferris and be like, hey, I can't do the assembly cut. Is it cool if you take this one?

33:24.600 --> 33:29.080
Yeah, I don't like fuck you. Yeah, on your Ferris. Was that your joke?

33:29.720 --> 33:35.800
No, I'll take credit for it. Good just in time. Oh my god. You need new shot glass. Throw over there

33:35.800 --> 33:42.760
It was uh it was Marieka Marieka and I did trivia. I'm choose day. Love love love

33:43.560 --> 33:45.560
Love two if chain

33:45.560 --> 33:51.960
Did you think trippy that is that he long? Oh, that's also good. What's it like Dennis? Why are you fucking pissed everyone's

33:52.920 --> 33:57.160
We're laughing on your toes. Oh, you fucking got it all over yourself. You're

33:57.720 --> 34:05.320
We're talking to each other shot. Yeah, I can do that. You know when you're when you get past that certain part of being drunk that's fun and then suddenly you're like angry

34:05.640 --> 34:07.960
Yeah, I feel like you got it really fast because it's like

34:08.520 --> 34:10.520
I've been doing not alcohol against him

34:11.720 --> 34:13.720
I'm so sorry they thought

34:15.560 --> 34:17.560
This is going so bad

34:18.040 --> 34:22.120
You just dumped what on Jeff's computer. Just a little bit against it

34:23.160 --> 34:26.440
Against it is actually increasing the ram weirdly

34:27.160 --> 34:32.600
You should be an ambience. I'm thinking about reaching out to them. Yeah, well, you don't know what it's fucking taste

34:32.600 --> 34:34.600
It's good not be going

34:34.600 --> 34:36.920
I think it's going fine-to-bad

34:38.280 --> 34:46.360
You're what you take it a paper towel to your laptop, right? It was a napkin and also I think that high neighbor Ryan neighbor went pretty

34:47.320 --> 34:54.280
We were having diminishing returns since Beton you will be $300 this sucks can I sell you?

34:54.280 --> 35:06.040
Yes, you can tell me it's fine, but you're not dodging taxes. That's good. I want to understand the tax implications are still there

35:08.760 --> 35:13.720
That actually sucks to hear. Yeah, okay cool. I just need to write off enough money

35:14.280 --> 35:16.280
To even out the money. I spent on arrogance

35:17.240 --> 35:21.000
Well actually you could start you could you have a job as an ambience reader?

35:21.160 --> 35:26.040
You could write off your your beer spend on arrogance and as a loss. Well, so this is because that's

35:26.040 --> 35:31.240
Because we're fucking talking about right you could you could write this off as as a loss

35:31.240 --> 35:36.360
Here's the thing I bought these for $68 and you could because we're filming this right that

35:36.360 --> 35:39.880
That's wardrobe for the meeting. Yeah, that's arrogance. That's right

35:40.840 --> 35:45.000
All right, that's that was a five minute break. This is gonna bring us into the next segment

35:45.000 --> 35:49.080
That's the way I don't want to be fucking I don't want any lawyers coming it'd be for saying that we're drugs not

35:49.720 --> 35:51.720
Not a wall, okay?

35:51.720 --> 35:57.720
You can dodge attacks because these jacens expense almost 20 grand off of buck mason

36:00.280 --> 36:02.280
Mr Mason

36:02.280 --> 36:05.560
Jam glad to make sure he just walks right by you shoulders you

36:06.200 --> 36:08.200
I'm gonna have a roll-exprister

36:09.320 --> 36:11.320
Have a roll anyone can say that

36:13.160 --> 36:14.680
Roll-exprister, you see this?

36:15.880 --> 36:17.320
That's fucking gonna be a roll-exprister

36:17.320 --> 36:19.640
Like when you say that you're pulling down your shirt

36:19.640 --> 36:21.640
Welcome to like a little bit

36:22.280 --> 36:25.480
Or one movie this means not working to get a roll-exprister

36:25.480 --> 36:28.920
American welcome to the finds or things

36:30.120 --> 36:33.880
Okay, Pfizer pun the fact that you guys didn't

36:34.840 --> 36:41.800
Explode with joy and surprise is a fucking a front to not only me, but make a

36:42.760 --> 36:47.400
What is not aware of the segment? No, is it a Pfizer pun?

36:48.200 --> 36:51.240
The finders finders finders. So they find

36:51.800 --> 36:53.800
You guys could have at least smiled what he said it

36:55.560 --> 37:01.240
I think I said cool or I don't know I've reacted in the positive enough way the red dragon himself

37:01.320 --> 37:06.280
Here's the thing right and Johnny come back me up on this rave finds definitely enjoys the finer things

37:10.920 --> 37:12.920
That's not bad actually when you say like that

37:14.200 --> 37:17.640
You should have said the rave finders things. Yeah, yeah

37:18.440 --> 37:24.600
I think there was a way to do it that was better like yeah, you like had to back us all the way into it being a rave

37:25.080 --> 37:27.080
Finds pun

37:27.080 --> 37:30.360
Ralph isn't it? No, it's rave. It's rave like rafial

English patient have you guys seen GQs 10 essentials yes of

38:07.640 --> 38:13.080
Any celebrity like the 10 things I can't live without right. I see I thought we could postulate

38:13.080 --> 38:19.400
This isn't a game. It's just kind of like a fun structure of a wax segment. What do we think rave finds finds or things?

38:19.400 --> 38:21.000
Or who is rave finds?

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Remind the rave finds Voldemort

38:23.560 --> 38:30.200

38:30.600 --> 38:34.920

38:34.920 --> 38:39.560
Yes, yeah, like if we're like, oh, yeah, let's do the let's do the 10 things

38:39.560 --> 38:43.080
He can't live without the finds or things and they're like who is this guy? Oh Voldemort

38:43.800 --> 38:47.000
That's gonna set my cup per failure on the game. Do you know what I mean?

38:47.000 --> 38:51.880
I think he likes his game. Jeva's been saying sorry every time I pull him

38:51.880 --> 38:56.920
You're bad. I think he likes like a salt deprivation chamber something like that. Yeah, yeah

38:57.880 --> 39:02.840
That's a fire where are you going? That's good. Throw something good. I need more of yours. Oh, I can get you

39:03.960 --> 39:08.040
Well, I kind of I'd like to talk about what I think the finds are things are okay

39:08.120 --> 39:10.120
This is crazy

39:12.440 --> 39:14.680
There's no way the splash card

39:15.960 --> 39:21.720
Jumera quiet tickets. That's not really fucking we don't even know if he likes music let alone

39:21.720 --> 39:24.840
Jumera lives music everybody looks music. I don't look at me like

39:26.200 --> 39:29.400
And we don't know if he likes fucking I don't know it. I don't even know who that is

39:29.400 --> 39:31.400
I'm sorry a for Jumera quiet

39:31.400 --> 39:35.240
Jumera quiet. I don't wait to subjected to it. I think some glasses

39:35.240 --> 39:39.960
I'll interject there and say I actually go like music you don't like kind of my claim to fan

39:39.960 --> 39:41.960
Yes, Jeff doesn't like music

39:41.960 --> 39:47.480
Not a fan of music actually you basically predicted podcast because you didn't like music before podcast

39:47.480 --> 39:50.920
We're even relevant right no one listened to me that no one doesn't come in now

39:51.640 --> 39:53.640
It's all right. It's moved

39:53.640 --> 39:56.760
I've never had a smoother. Yeah, I would like to say that the whisper and the

39:56.760 --> 40:03.160
I was trying to cut that the episode at earlier wasn't you did a nice line the Ganset it was because you said something while the

40:03.240 --> 40:05.160
Ganset was going down. Yeah, yeah, I

40:06.360 --> 40:10.040
I fear we're getting away from the fines or things. We are it. We're basically

40:11.000 --> 40:14.600
As on topic is any other segment so you said the Rolex was number one

40:15.160 --> 40:21.960
I said Jumera just like I'm gonna have yeah, what we'll what did you say? Jumera quiet tickets and I would disagree with you you said

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Sensory deprivation chamber

40:25.000 --> 40:29.640
I think that's a little much for rave. No, I think he lives I mean I think he lives look

40:29.880 --> 40:36.600
Google his address. I think he lives in the English country side. I think he lives in a deprivation chamber in an oven 12

40:37.160 --> 40:42.360
He does something specific with his hair. I think he is so short of everything you were exactly

40:42.360 --> 40:48.840
Okay counting that's 30 thousand dollars in jigspock. Thank you. No, I now I don't think somebody living in suffoc

40:49.720 --> 40:52.920
I feel like he I don't know that's where you have a sensory deprivation tank

40:52.920 --> 40:54.920
You don't have the space. I think he has antiques

40:54.920 --> 40:59.960
You don't really need space for I feel like I think I think he has antiques

40:59.960 --> 41:06.040
I feel like he has like an old old boat or like a King's

41:07.640 --> 41:10.680
Bound carry something something like that

41:11.000 --> 41:15.160
Oh, he has any kids none of these are each exclusive by the way. We're just waxing. What Johnny thought excuse me

41:15.160 --> 41:18.040
But we're not waxing. We're not waxing. We're waiting

41:19.240 --> 41:23.800
And we're trying to get to 10 things that rave fines can't live without and we have to agree on them

41:25.000 --> 41:27.640
It's waxing also everyone just saw the way the waxing

41:28.920 --> 41:32.520
The waxing is what happens in between segments. Are we in a segment? Are we in a segment?

41:32.520 --> 41:37.640
We're actually within a segment. He is a nice car. How about he is a car and a Rolls Royce for your boys

41:38.200 --> 41:41.880
He has an Alden's rewards card for shoes

41:44.360 --> 41:47.560
You how do you like that? How about a

41:48.520 --> 41:50.520
Lush bath bomb for rave

41:51.480 --> 42:01.160
We're you're getting you're including too far on into the 10 things. Do you know what I mean? Like we're gonna get to 10 things and and two of them are gonna be a rewards card in a bath bomb

42:02.600 --> 42:04.600
That's 20% of his shit

42:05.000 --> 42:09.880
What about a strong horse? Yes, are you feeling drunk at all because you've been driving away the fucking trash

42:11.320 --> 42:15.400
I just feel like we're going through this all thing. I want to make sure you're with us at the same

42:15.480 --> 42:21.560
Yeah, I feel pretty drunk. All right, I'm minute 38 by the way, I see two two more great. I didn't mean to hit this

42:21.560 --> 42:23.560
But now I have to make something out of it

42:24.520 --> 42:33.000
I hear by crown Rosie is the best first guest ever. Oh, that's taking in one count Zach Dunn. Yeah, that's huge

42:33.560 --> 42:35.560
Who is

42:35.560 --> 42:37.560
Yeah, yeah, dude

42:38.920 --> 42:45.000
We should say so so we had kind of vaguely talked about doing a power r. I feel like and then we were climbing

42:45.640 --> 42:50.120
And you said is that for real. I said. I don't know. Let's see if Jake would do it and then I lied

42:50.120 --> 42:54.200
I told you that Johnny was on board. He hadn't fully run it by him yet

42:54.440 --> 42:59.560
You said I wouldn't do beer, but I would do a shot or like we figured out that it would be a shot of every 15 10 to 15 minutes

42:59.560 --> 43:01.560
Yeah, and then you run board

43:01.960 --> 43:07.080
I don't even he didn't like mention this at all to me. I've just kind of say yes to whatever that's also true

43:07.960 --> 43:09.960
And then you guys we're gonna hang out

43:10.200 --> 43:13.560

Water sports. Yeah, I guess the the sports where you need the yachting a sport though

44:03.240 --> 44:04.600

44:19.960 --> 44:23.240

You know we switched it so I would do more

50:05.560 --> 50:11.080
We're okay, then Mr. we get back to the finds or things. I'm sorry about how drunk Johnny is because he's actually being very quiet

50:11.560 --> 50:13.560
Which is how I know he's trash yeah

This tick-tock thing didn't work out. Did you guys try to do tick-tocks?

50:35.480 --> 50:39.560
No, it is working out actually. I'm gonna cut that out because it's kind of doing numbers

50:41.320 --> 50:43.320
I don't like when I don't have a good idea

50:43.720 --> 50:45.880

50:46.520 --> 50:51.800

Me, he rest in peace

51:27.080 --> 51:30.440
Speaking of you, I'd like to just take a minute to plug in there against it longer

51:31.800 --> 51:33.800
Mid-segment

51:34.920 --> 51:36.600
By the way

51:36.600 --> 51:41.240
They're getting to a so front and center in me and just shot that it's been plugged the entire

51:42.280 --> 51:44.760
That was on purpose. We actually put the decotties

51:44.760 --> 51:48.120
Let's do this. Let's keep talking about the finds or things. We're about nice

51:49.640 --> 51:51.640

Think finds has glice

52:05.480 --> 52:08.440
What is the rhythm of the glice

52:09.640 --> 52:14.040
The glice oh yeah, I don't care for music

52:14.840 --> 52:20.680
We should explain what we're talking yeah Jeff's checking out that's like your passport that is

52:20.680 --> 52:24.920
No, it's so I did a job for Facebook years ago meta and

52:25.880 --> 52:28.280
Always to drop to actually 27% tonight

52:31.000 --> 52:32.360
You've stuck

52:32.360 --> 52:38.920
No, I because I got a bunch of these free notebooks hell, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's for Fred. No, it's quite it's actually paper stock though

52:39.640 --> 52:41.640

Do you think finds likes

52:48.760 --> 52:50.760
Scott who's just as she has oh

52:51.160 --> 52:53.400
Konyac I think he's more of a konyac really

52:55.400 --> 52:57.400
Yeah, I got you

52:57.400 --> 53:00.920
Northern England you did get me a Hennessy on us. It was disgusting

53:01.400 --> 53:08.040
I don't like it. Yeah, huh? Hennessy is disgusting. I always try to like make the day special for you and you never

53:08.040 --> 53:12.200
Yeah, yeah, do you think finds has a pubic hair trimmer on hand

53:13.080 --> 53:17.240
He's he has a man-scaped nose hair trimmer that he uses on his grundle

53:18.520 --> 53:23.080
Because he has the fucking the lawnmower, but he lost the charge. Oh, okay

53:24.040 --> 53:29.960
So he still don't excuse me. He still has it in a dock kit. What about a directs air just in case

53:31.480 --> 53:33.480
It's the world's the missed condom

53:36.440 --> 53:43.560
Is it it's thinner than the trojan ecstasy yeah, it is people don't use it thinner than skin condoms are directs

53:44.680 --> 53:49.560
Condoms I do get tested often for that. You don't use condoms

53:49.960 --> 53:50.960
Let's uh

53:50.960 --> 53:59.000
Keep talking about finds or things. What about coffee pocky pocky, he got a full of the timing was I don't miss it

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Oh, we measured it

54:01.000 --> 54:07.000
That was the final thing my cousin on point is from because he is this is the rhythm of the rise

54:08.440 --> 54:13.800
What is the glyce? Oh, yeah, the glyce you have to describe the glyce for Jeff to understand the rhythm of the glyce

54:13.800 --> 54:15.480
He has to understand the rhythm of the rice

54:15.800 --> 54:17.320
Which is

54:17.320 --> 54:22.200
Jeff's a perfect form it'll be this meta moment speaking of is in glyce fake

54:22.200 --> 54:26.760
I so because I've been glycegating. Yes, that's exactly right

54:26.760 --> 54:30.520
It's very poorly at the top of the one the one the top of the villain belt

54:30.520 --> 54:33.080
That's exactly an absolute piece of shit

54:33.480 --> 54:36.920
So we the three of us plus Micah's girlfriend

54:37.800 --> 54:39.800
What's going on?

54:39.800 --> 54:41.800
Plan episode of the head go

54:41.800 --> 54:43.800
God, that's where the audio is

54:43.800 --> 54:48.680
I'm trying to explain to Jeff the right the rice, which is the only good way to do that is to who sings that

54:50.040 --> 54:54.160
This is the real it's the rhythm on the night is the original yeah, I rhythm on the night

54:54.160 --> 54:56.160
Yeah, this is the rhythm of the rice

54:56.680 --> 55:01.080
You're so rice. That's good actually. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have good voice

55:02.680 --> 55:04.680
I'm pretty sure

55:05.240 --> 55:07.240
Shit, bye

55:07.880 --> 55:11.880
Oh, yeah, I'm biting into rice

55:14.040 --> 55:16.040
Sing along and do you know the words?

55:17.000 --> 55:19.160
This is actually pretty good. That's what you do know the way

55:21.160 --> 55:25.480
It's kind of a Johnny point unless this is on Spotify or not. There's an instrumental break

55:25.480 --> 55:27.480
I can't sing along

55:27.720 --> 55:29.000
This is the worst part

55:29.000 --> 55:33.960
Jeff you want to know what I'm just realizing you go to a lot of shows for somebody who doesn't like

55:34.040 --> 55:36.040
Can you pause the video

55:37.160 --> 55:40.280
We're speaking to original Jeff JFFF here. Yeah

55:41.880 --> 55:47.400
I do yeah, no, I go to I do because I want to partake in communal activities

55:47.800 --> 55:50.120
I don't enjoy it. You don't enjoy the music

55:51.640 --> 55:54.680
No, but you enjoy the other aspects of it the

55:56.840 --> 55:59.000
Barely it's more like something to do, you know

55:59.640 --> 56:02.280
This is like the biggest red flag in a human for me

56:02.920 --> 56:04.920
How not like music

56:06.040 --> 56:06.920
See it all right

56:06.920 --> 56:10.440
Let's listen shit, like didn't you see what you strangled the dog as a kid

56:11.880 --> 56:13.880
Shut you like stompers

56:15.080 --> 56:17.080
He likes stuff

56:17.080 --> 56:19.080
I like seeing the life

56:19.960 --> 56:21.960
Be removed from the storm. Yes

56:23.880 --> 56:28.680
There's a moment. I feel like we figured out the finds are things he wants what a sensory deprivation tank

56:28.680 --> 56:34.280
Insuffic. I am the only one that figured out any of the finds hockey poppers. What did you say for funds?

56:34.600 --> 56:38.200
Tennis rack is tennis rack is sunglasses. Oh, hello. You're out

That I don't what's gonna happen because I'm having such a great time right now

57:04.440 --> 57:08.680
But when I'm editing this next week, I'm gonna be so mad at myself that this is what we deserve

57:08.680 --> 57:14.200
How does Ray finds pronounce his name? How does Rayf do? How does Rayf do?

57:15.800 --> 57:17.800
Who we get him on the show?

57:17.800 --> 57:23.640
I'd love to get him on the pool my goal for the 2022 is to get like a fucking ailister on the show to be like

57:24.200 --> 57:29.960
To the point where the audience is like what how? How do you think Ray is still an ailister though? Oh, yeah

57:32.040 --> 57:34.040
Put some respect on Ray's

57:34.360 --> 57:37.080
Show some respect. Who's the dream guest Jeff?

57:40.840 --> 57:42.840

58:10.600 --> 58:11.720
Jeff

58:11.720 --> 58:13.720

58:14.680 --> 58:20.200
I thought I thought you would be looking at something on his no-one seeing Jela on a couple minutes though, huh?

58:20.760 --> 58:22.760
We have begs the question. We saw her

58:23.160 --> 58:28.280
Where and I don't look up shoes in a movie. Oh, she wasn't she was fantastic

58:28.520 --> 58:32.520
Love you. No, I don't know the dream guest is I guess Michelle Obama for just like the laugh of it

58:34.120 --> 58:38.680
If you had Michelle Obama on would you prepare more or the same amount? Oh

58:39.160 --> 58:43.560
More I prepare more when Zack done comes on wow all right

58:44.840 --> 58:50.760
He writes for what we do in the shadows. He's like a college buddy mine, but he's just very funny. Oh, that's cool. That show stole is round

58:51.080 --> 58:55.800
Let me nominate it fucker. I thought it was like an import though that like kind of

58:59.320 --> 59:03.320

I think you're amazing how I love you would love to meet you. Let's do dinner lunch or lunch and it's not even just come back on this show when he's on

59:11.640 --> 59:16.920
You want to do dinner lunch and it doesn't live in a lunch in it. Yeah, you want to meet him at lunch

59:17.160 --> 59:19.160
There's a body

59:23.400 --> 59:25.720
And then we're going out after this we should say we have to go

59:34.280 --> 59:41.320
I'm I just pop over my side bear. This is my life

59:42.600 --> 59:47.720
Saw the last look of that song and you know, I'm there some distance between it, you know

59:48.360 --> 59:51.240
This is the rhythm of my life is a kind of sadder

59:51.240 --> 59:53.240
I don't know

59:53.240 --> 59:57.080
Yeah, this is the rhythm of my life. You guys are about me, look

59:57.720 --> 59:59.720
What's that he's gone? Yeah

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:04.440
But not for a minute. We have two minutes left of me on your side me love died

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:09.880
Four minutes of the power hour so we don't have two more minutes of the fucking show do we I don't think so

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:15.160
Or do we end it fucking 52 minutes? I think we've started the power and later in the show

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.160
Starts out right

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:21.960
Yeah, but the show has a lot the show's not gonna be an hour six minutes. Did you say exactly right?

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.600
Yes, oh

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:30.120
Also, whatever Johnny not whatever one of you still a little quick for a here we go. Do you have been done this in a while?

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.640
Let's do Johnny's growing out a big bag of cocaine

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:40.680
John and brothers two minutes on the clock here we go Johnny has the floor Johnny's brothers, all right

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.920
Johnny's not here. It's only a tomato

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Yeah

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:52.360
This is my first power hour, which is really really never never never ever because I know how beat red I get

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.080
And beat red I am

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.480
Don't look that beat red, especially on video

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:03.240
God this is low that's low America could do some color correction and put absolutely

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:09.160
What about Nick Radot beat Nick and he's red is a beat

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.800
Nick red be next to red

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.800
Be back used to be by Chloe

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:24.440
I was a big red joke God, I wish it didn't see it

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.920
It's still Johnny's brothers. I'm sorry to say

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:36.680
If I had my brothers, I'd be drinking another against it a full-ganset and I deserve to be an ambier sitter

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:40.120
No, you can't

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.120
Not you

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:47.000
I'm trying to get off to admit it. All you have to do is tweet and then get 500 we shouldn't

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.760
Prang nobody's from the Narraganset media team sees this so here's the thing this is this would be bad

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:58.600
This is bad for the brand social media manager. Let's call him fucking Bertolt. Hi, baby

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:09.480
Don't ever

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:21.960
Hi, neighbor don't ever apply satire against it. We shouldn't get you fucking on the legacy of Narra you guys want to get into fight tonight

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:30.440
Johnny's already drunk enough Johnny. Yeah, I'm violent. I'm violent right now. We as they defined a school that gets out at 945

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:38.040
I'm looking at my school is a box and you offer that so effortlessly. Oh, I can find a school that gets out

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.040
You know it these charter schools

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:45.560
Give me a magnet school. That is the end of Johnny's brothers. All right. Did you speak your piece?

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.560
I did speak my piece and I'm glad I did

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:51.160
Glad I had the platform. Did you speak your piece with the Jesus piece?

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:55.080
You get a Jesus piece. I should get a Jesus piece. What's the Jesus piece?

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.320
Giant cross necklace

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.120
This is borderline not even a podcast

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:09.720
I'm so worried what this is gonna sound like and we flushes that by the way. I don't know it's a collective effort for it to be this shit

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:15.640
Yeah, yeah, you're kind of right. I feel like even the segments that you came up with were

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.800
salvageable like the finds or things

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:25.320
Was interesting and you you derailed it to a point

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:30.120
Are you real in derailed you're so a self-sabatory trying to figure out the finds or things

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:33.480
And then you were like does you like chalk or what that's just what happened

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:38.280
News would actually happen. I I wrote it as the finds or things to be like. Let's figure out what he's like

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:42.440
What it actually likes. I think that's interesting and then as I was writing suggestions

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:47.000
I was like, oh, what would be his pockets? So like loose pistachios was supposed to be a joke

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Yeah, how do you have that in this boggy race well pistachios they're a high-end nut

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.880
But he doesn't keep them as pockets

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:59.240
Why not I just feel like you I refuse to be a car stop at the knees when you do shit like

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.120
Because this is I think to be a sandbox where we can all plan

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:08.520
But Jeff holds all the cards

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.800
And every time he metaphors

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:15.320
Also the cards in the sand dog which is fine

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.360
Need somewhere else with cards

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:27.480
I'm so sorry to everyone consuming this. This isn't convenient

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.520
I never considered

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.360
I'm not defending you. I can barely I can probably barely stand up

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.720
I actually need another one of those

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.920
to what

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.160
Now the power of the end of the podcast we do this we do what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:51.560
If we go in the middle for the next three minutes we have to figure out what we're going

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:55.640
Nobody fucking cares everybody always comments by the way. Oh, like you know

01:04:55.640 --> 01:05:00.840
You're you're citing random LA New York shit that nobody knows. It's so early people hate it

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:08.120
620 oh my god, you say it is five o'clock here when we started it's five o'clock somewhere

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:19.080
You just had him for he didn't do anything. Yeah, you didn't like the joke you could easily have glossed it a loss over it

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:24.840
Micah reacts like what I just did all the time nobody fucking grills him while he's doing it. I just did it a moment

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.600
He doesn't react like that to anything

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000

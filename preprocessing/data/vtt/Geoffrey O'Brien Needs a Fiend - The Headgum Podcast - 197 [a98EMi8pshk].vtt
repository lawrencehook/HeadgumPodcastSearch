00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:26.000
Yeah, we're really part of it.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
No applause.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
Oh my god.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
A meteor.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
John Distyers, hear the show.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Often clear.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
You can't throw.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Brand new stew.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
It's called G.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Eat blue chew.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
For your pee.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
I can tell that we are going to be themes.

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
Yes, I can tell that we are going to be themes.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Welcome to Geoffrey O'Brien needs a fiend.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Oh my god.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Like a queen?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Nothing.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
You guys have heard the show.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Come on and a Brian needs a friend.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
I've never listened.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I've heard of it.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Well, this is Geoffrey O'Brien needs a fiend.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
St. Patrick's Day was 48 hours ago.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
So I was thinking about Irishman.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
I was thinking about killing Murphy as the potential new bond.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
And I thought, why not be Geoffrey O'Brien this week?

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Feel free to call me Geoffrey O'Brien.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Got it.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Got it.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Got it.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
He's cutting that Mr. O'Brien.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
He's a Geoffrey O'Brien a lot.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
It's already coming to fruition, which this episode is, you know,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
I get a lot of flack from you guys.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
I don't know if I'm appreciate it.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Sometimes it makes for good content.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Sometimes it makes for a lot of awkward silences.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
This.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Sorry.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Is something funny?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Geoffrey O'Brien.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Right?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Does it fit?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Does it work?

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
If the shoe fits, we're going to try it out this episode.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
And I'm going to see because a lot of people like to jump down my throat on this fucking show.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Right?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Let's make it official.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Let's see.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
If you guys are going to become official fiends of me.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
All right.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
On Conan's show, they're like, I'm blank.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
And I feel blank about being Conan O'Brien's friend.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
So, I'm here. Why don't you start us out?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
I'm a mere Blumenfeld.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
And I feel about being Geoffrey O'Brien's fiend.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
So much to remember.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Did you get a haircut?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
No.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
You're having a chart.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Do you need me to kind of show you again?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Or do you not understand?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
He's not.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
My name is a mere Blumenfeld.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
And I feel fine about being Geoffrey O'Brien's fiend.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Really?

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
You don't feel fine?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Yeah.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Like, I'm okay with it.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Reign.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Reign.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Yeah.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
I was going to say Reign.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
You also don't strike me as an Irish person.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Why is it because of the dark Karen's good?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Yep.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Really?

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
We really got the bottom of it fast.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
You nailed it in one.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
There's dark Karen, Englishman.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
But not dark skin, Englishman.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
An Englishman or Irishman.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
We got him.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
We absolutely got him, Marika.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
We also didn't talk about the lyrics of the intro song.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I kind of spent a lot of time on that.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
John Diskind.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Take a few.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
When was the last time there was a Bluetooth app?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Well, you're up next.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
My name's Wilkanover and I feel blank about being different.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
My name's Wilkanover and I feel indifferent about being Jeffrey O'Brien's fiend.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
I got there.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Indifference is worse than hate.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Next to godliness.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
I don't think indifference is next to godliness.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Are you really sure that's it?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Because god is sort of blaze, blaze, blaze.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
That's really good.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Gra.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
What's that?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Nothing.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Just like Adlibs.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
I say, yeah.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Emma.

04:17.000 --> 04:24.000
My name is Emma Foley and I feel happy about being Jeffrey O'Brien's fiend.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
I feel like I need to beat the allegations that I have a bad attitude on this podcast.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Not allegations.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
New Year's resolution.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I have to beat my resolution.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
I haven't had time to listen to your entire backlog.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
So I'll say I feel happy.

04:47.000 --> 04:55.000
My name is Marie Cabralmi and I feel confused about being Jeffrey O'Brien's fiend.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah, fiend.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Let's hear that theme's line in.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Listen to the lyrics of this song.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Okay.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
John Destyers, hear this show.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Often blear.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
You can't throw.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Brand new stew.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
It's called G.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Eat blue chew.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
For your pee.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
I can tell that we are gonna be fiends.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
Yes, I can tell that we are gonna be fiends.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Right?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I couldn't understand like the second and third.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
John Destyers.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Yeah.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Hear this show.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Okay.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
I knew got that.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
What about the next song?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Awesome.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Our entire audience has John Destyers.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
What you're saying.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Yeah.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
But only in the years.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Okay.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
I don't mean the moral cavity.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
The next part is what I couldn't quite make.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Often blear.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Uh huh.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Someone's dead.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Someone's dead.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Mm.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Someone's dead.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Next line.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
You control.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
What is that?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
It's like an arc arc layer.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
It's like an infertross or believe.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Often blear.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah, you control.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Trowed at.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Believe that.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
What's another way to say that sentence.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Because I don't understand what it means.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
The show sucks.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
And you can believe in that.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
God.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Um.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Brand new stew.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
It's called G.

06:24.000 --> 06:24.840
We got that one.

06:24.840 --> 06:25.660
We got that one.

06:25.660 --> 06:26.500
We got that one.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.340
Yeah.

06:27.340 --> 06:28.340
You're an age.

06:28.340 --> 06:31.480
Eat blue chew for your pee.

06:31.480 --> 06:32.840
Why not for your dee?

06:32.840 --> 06:33.840
Yeah.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.340
I'm not that one.

06:35.340 --> 06:40.920
It's like a weird way to say penis, but dee makes sense and also your rhymes just as well.

06:40.920 --> 06:44.640
It's a little bit harder too, yeah, it's a little more like adult in a way.

06:44.640 --> 06:45.640
Yeah.

06:45.640 --> 06:50.760
Um, I can tell that we're going to be fiends and I don't even mean the lyrics this

06:50.760 --> 06:51.760
point.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.760
I can tell that you and I.

06:52.760 --> 06:57.080
And I heard that you had some kind of chronicles this morning.

06:57.080 --> 07:00.320
I did have some kind of chronicles.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.320
What happened?

07:01.320 --> 07:02.320
I don't know.

07:02.320 --> 07:07.240
Um, well, I was going to the dentist, but then I realized I forgot my wallet at home

07:07.240 --> 07:11.000
so I had to go back home and I need to call them to move the appointment later, which

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
they very kindly did.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.440
And so then I went, um, and I'm kind of six and sort of like under the weather anyway.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.200
And then I just sent a appointment to my mouth really hurts and then I'm on the train

07:19.240 --> 07:23.120
and then I kind of ripped my pants and that like, like, very single way.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.280
How did you rip your pants on a train?

07:25.280 --> 07:32.160
Um, well, I was bending over and that's kind of the whole story there.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.560
No, no, no, no.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.720
But I just like, what do you bend over to get on the subway?

07:37.720 --> 07:39.320
Did you drop your phone?

07:39.320 --> 07:41.520
Um, no, I didn't drop anything.

07:41.520 --> 07:45.520
I don't know why I was bending over because it's a question.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.920
You're maybe helping someone off the track.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.440
Maybe the time like, yeah, I was doing something noble and chivalrous.

07:51.440 --> 07:51.880
Okay, cool.

07:51.880 --> 07:55.280
Which I was, which I was not thankful for because of women started burating me.

07:55.280 --> 07:58.240
Well, this is, I was trying to kind of get a view of this man who was eating a

07:58.240 --> 07:59.800
begot taking like bites out of it.

07:59.800 --> 08:00.800
Giant giant begot.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.600
He's holding it almost like a horn up in the air.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.760
And so I'm trying to get him look at him and this woman sort of begins burating me.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.680
She was holding some kind of private protest.

08:10.680 --> 08:15.240
Um, I think it was against, it seemed to be against a lot of different groups and then

08:15.240 --> 08:18.080
she started, it's so sad.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.320
She, um, kept calling me ugly.

08:21.320 --> 08:24.960
I'm pleased that she would kill herself as she looks like a dog.

08:24.960 --> 08:25.960
She's gone.

08:25.960 --> 08:29.480
Do you think New Yorkers has gotten weirder since the pandemic?

08:29.480 --> 08:30.640
100%.

08:30.640 --> 08:36.040
In 2019, things were kind of crazy and crazy because New York, but

08:36.040 --> 08:38.040
do you think that's sort of ratcheted up to the end?

08:38.040 --> 08:38.640
10 times.

08:38.640 --> 08:39.640
It's 10 times worse.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.880
I've never done this in terms of like, that was a really interesting

08:42.880 --> 08:43.880
conversation.

08:43.880 --> 08:53.280
I've never done this that much, I've done it, but not this much on to this degree, especially.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.560
It feels like you've been like practicing just a relationship.

08:55.560 --> 08:56.560
No.

08:56.560 --> 09:00.360
Because you were like, I'll put it on the screen right here, but you were like, moving

09:00.360 --> 09:05.360
your hand like a certain way, you were just taking a master class and like getting people

09:05.360 --> 09:07.560
to respect your based on easily the strategy.

09:07.560 --> 09:09.560
Yeah, it was like a baby.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.400
It was like a normal, nice, interesting conversation.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.400
Conversation was.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.280
Are you dealing with a relationship on my hand?

09:15.280 --> 09:16.280
I don't know.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.280
I don't want to deal with it.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.280
That's kind of a fundamental theory.

09:19.280 --> 09:23.800
The master class about hand district, just regulations.

09:23.800 --> 09:24.800
David Blaine.

09:24.800 --> 09:25.800
Barack Obama.

09:25.800 --> 09:26.800
Yeah.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.800
Blaine's good.

09:27.800 --> 09:28.800
I don't know.

09:28.800 --> 09:29.800
I think Blaine.

09:29.800 --> 09:30.800
Obama.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.800
Not fucking justice.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.160
He's not the only famous for it.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.160
Yeah.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.160
Blaine is a dark building.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.160
English man.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.360
So like the fact that you're not that doesn't exist, it's kind of really.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.360
You said that.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.360
Yeah.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.360
You said that.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.360
You said that.

09:45.360 --> 09:46.360
Yeah.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.360
I also don't know if David Blaine is English.

09:48.360 --> 09:49.360
I don't like it.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.360
Yeah.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.040
But like, nobody was sure enough to refute it.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.040
Still with the hands.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.040
Yeah.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.040
I can talk to my hands.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.040
That's fine.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.040
I don't know.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.040
You don't.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.040
We'll sit there.

10:00.040 --> 10:01.040
You can see him on the screen.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.040
Yeah.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.680
He has his leg crossed and he's just sitting there still.

10:04.680 --> 10:05.680
And you know what?

10:05.680 --> 10:06.680
That's fine too.

10:06.680 --> 10:07.680
Yeah.

10:07.680 --> 10:08.680
And you know what?

10:08.680 --> 10:10.400
That means that there's a quiet confidence about connover.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.640
There's a quiet connover about confidence.

10:12.640 --> 10:13.640
That's sweet.

10:13.640 --> 10:16.040
Thank you guys for just moving right on from when I said the word.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.040
Yeah.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.040
A killer self.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.040
She looked like me.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.040
I didn't want to talk about it.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.040
So I'm pretty sure.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.040
And I'm clapping.

10:22.040 --> 10:26.520
We're going to come back to it right about now.

10:26.520 --> 10:30.640
You still don't know why you were bending over to look at something that's something

10:30.640 --> 10:32.640
that's always interesting part of the story.

10:32.640 --> 10:34.640
I feel like that's like the most interesting thing there.

10:34.640 --> 10:35.640
I don't know.

10:35.640 --> 10:36.640
I think I put my bag down.

10:36.640 --> 10:37.640
I think it was when I was on the platform.

10:37.640 --> 10:38.640
I think I put my bag down.

10:38.640 --> 10:39.640
That made my feet.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.640
That makes sense.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.640
That's a better thing.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.080
Because that's a huge thing to have your pants rip.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.120
It's kind of humiliating.

10:46.120 --> 10:49.680
And I, when I'm on the subway, I walk down the stairs.

10:49.680 --> 10:52.600
I get on the bus and then I get on the fucking tracks.

10:52.600 --> 10:53.600
Right?

10:53.600 --> 10:54.600
I don't end up bending over.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.600
What?

10:55.600 --> 10:57.600
You're talking about the tracks.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.600
Right?

10:59.600 --> 11:01.600
You go ahead and learn from them.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.600
How do you like it?

11:02.600 --> 11:04.680
In public with other people.

11:04.680 --> 11:07.080
I don't really end up in your office.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.080
Yeah.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.080
You stand out.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.080
I'm in a city and I'm in here.

11:11.080 --> 11:13.080
You're the biggest, I'm a student.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.080
I'm a student.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.080
Stay here.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.080
She oscillated.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.080
Separated.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.080
I am.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.080
I am.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.080
I am.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.080
You taint and poisons.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.080
Like a drop.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.080
Yeah.

11:23.080 --> 11:24.080
In a pool.

11:24.080 --> 11:27.080
But I also paint with poison on the pork belly.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.080
It's drool.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.080
Jesus.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.080
I don't know.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.080
I don't like grum.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.080
What else am I?

11:33.080 --> 11:35.080
So what did they say at the doctor?

11:35.080 --> 11:36.080
Do you have cavities or?

11:36.080 --> 11:38.080
Well, she wants me to get my wisdom teeth out.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.080
She's out of your fun.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.080
I'm going to get the laughing gas.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.080
The fucking oxide.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.080
I do like the laughing gas.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.080
So you're kind of laughing gas.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.080
But without the to surgery.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.080
Oh, I think you're done with that too.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.080
Yeah, you get both.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.080
That's cool.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.080
I don't know.

11:51.080 --> 11:52.080
I mean, I actually don't know.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.080
I've never done it before.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.080
Because I was told I didn't need it.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.080
But she has some different ideas.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.080
Sorry.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.080
Obviously.

11:58.080 --> 12:01.080
Because some people, some camps, rather.

12:01.080 --> 12:05.080
We'll say, you got to get those molars removed.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.080
Others will be like, you know,

12:07.080 --> 12:08.080
you're 29.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.080
Whatever.

12:09.080 --> 12:11.080
Like, you don't need that.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.080
Get on me.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.080
Are you speaking from experience or?

12:14.080 --> 12:17.080
I got my wisdom teeth out when I was 16.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.080
Hey, me too.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.080
I feel like that's the time.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.080
I mean, that's the time to do it.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.080
I mean.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.080
And my dentist told me the same thing.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.080
You'll never need it done.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.080
And then you needed it.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.080
I haven't got to the dentist.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.080
Yeah.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.080
Good amount of time.

12:29.080 --> 12:33.080
Let's see those gums.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.080
I've never done this.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.080
But well, let's see those.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.080
No.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.080
No.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.080
Not interested in sharing the info.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.080
Maybe on a Friday call.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.080
No.

12:43.080 --> 12:47.080
See, this is, I know you're pissed.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.080
But this is better.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.080
Because you have just this going on.

12:50.080 --> 12:52.080
Yeah.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.080
Yeah.

12:53.080 --> 12:55.080
I never had wisdom teeth.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.080
You never grew them.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.080
Never had them.

12:58.080 --> 13:01.080
Never had them.

13:01.080 --> 13:05.080
Well, I've won a few genetic lotteries in my day.

13:05.080 --> 13:10.080
I'd say not having wisdom teeth was a joy unparalleled to most.

13:10.080 --> 13:14.080
I kind of feel like it's modern leprosy to not have those.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.080
Because then you're not part of this club where it's like,

13:16.080 --> 13:19.080
Oh, well, like what crazy thing did you say when you were coming off the,

13:19.080 --> 13:23.080
Yeah.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.080
Flaps.

13:24.080 --> 13:26.080
Laughing gas.

13:26.080 --> 13:30.080
Um, and that, you know, is it represented physically even in the way that we're kind of set up here?

13:30.080 --> 13:32.080
There's like a whole party going on in New York.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.080
I'm behind the desk, which is closest to everyone else in the office.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.080
And you're kind of in this corner.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.080
And no one's in.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.080
I'm here.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.080
I'm here.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.080
He's taking my corner.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.080
Yeah.

13:42.080 --> 13:48.080
I gave like, posting my eyes and hoping to got that, like, when I open them,

13:48.080 --> 13:49.080
I'm somewhere else.

13:49.080 --> 13:55.080
Anything else from your morning, Emma?

13:55.080 --> 13:59.080
No, I think that's pretty much all I've got to.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.080
Twill.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.080
Get off my chest.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.080
Twill.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.080
Me?

14:04.080 --> 14:05.080
No, no.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.080
Twill.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.080
Winning.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.080
Wool.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.080
What were the pants?

14:09.080 --> 14:14.080
Because I feel like it's like some fabrics are a little bit more poor as a little easier to snap.

14:14.080 --> 14:18.080
Well, these are like stretchy, which just makes it double embarrassing.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.080
So they're jeans.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.080
I can't.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.080
No, they're not jeans.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.080
Okay.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.080
It'd be good if it'd be, worst case scenario is it's denim.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.080
It's not denim.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.080
Okay.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.080
I'm not going fully.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.080
And it isn't twill.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.080
Or did you say it was twill?

14:31.080 --> 14:33.080
Is it a cotton polyester?

14:33.080 --> 14:34.080
Okay.

14:34.080 --> 14:35.080
I don't know what that is.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.080
Yeah.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.080
I think probably a polyester blend.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.080
Probably a polyester blend, eh?

14:39.080 --> 14:40.080
I don't know what you're talking about.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.080
I don't know what you're talking about.

14:42.080 --> 14:46.080
The fucking episode is Jeffrey O'Brien needs a feed.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.080
It's fucking worth it.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.080
So smile.

14:48.080 --> 14:52.080
I'm talking about the fucking material on a pants.

14:52.080 --> 14:53.080
It's on his tears.

14:53.080 --> 14:56.080
You can't feel off the glare.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.080
You can't throw brand new stew.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.080
It's called G.

14:59.080 --> 15:02.080
Eat blue stew for your D.

15:02.080 --> 15:07.080
I can tell that we are going to be themes.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.080
Yes.

15:08.080 --> 15:15.080
I can tell that we are going to be themes.

15:15.080 --> 15:19.080
Will anything you want to get off your chest sort of Emma style?

15:19.080 --> 15:22.080
I do feel like Emma's the only one enjoying the show, which I appreciate.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.080
Marie is not even trying.

15:23.080 --> 15:26.080
So I don't know if that's she hasn't been to P.J. Clark's in a minute.

15:26.080 --> 15:29.080
She doesn't know what Joy feels like, but this is me.

15:29.080 --> 15:32.080
Sorry, he's the question for me or Marieka.

15:32.080 --> 15:37.080
And is the question, do I have anything to get off my chest or am I enjoying the show?

15:37.080 --> 15:38.080
Both.

15:38.080 --> 15:41.080
I just wondered if we could kind of bond over her con over.

15:41.080 --> 15:43.080
The song is growing on me.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.080
Every time I play it, I like it better.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.080
All right, all right.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.080
Are you playing the guitar, are you?

15:49.080 --> 15:50.080
Is that ripped?

15:50.080 --> 15:52.080
I mean, it's ripped from YouTube.

15:52.080 --> 15:56.080
I think I feel the opposite way that will does where it's.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.080
It's not growing on me at all.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.080
It's shrinking on you.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.080
Yeah.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.080
I'm sorry to hear that.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.080
Only going up, Jeff.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.080
What's that?

16:04.080 --> 16:08.080
The song, my value to it.

16:08.080 --> 16:11.080
In the corner of Ryan needs a friend podcast.

16:11.080 --> 16:14.080
They kind of have a casual interview for most of the show.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.080
Oh, yeah.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.080
Something got full.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.080
Yeah.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.080
Yeah.

16:20.080 --> 16:24.080
On my end, the zoom might be act capacity.

16:24.080 --> 16:27.080
Do you want to random thumb drive I have?

16:27.080 --> 16:28.080
No, I'm used.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.080
SD.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.080
I know, I mean, I have an SD right here.

16:31.080 --> 16:32.080
Oh, sure.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.080
Ready?

16:33.080 --> 16:34.080
Yep.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.080
Oh, my.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.080
I didn't cry.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.080
I didn't cry.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.080
I didn't cry.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.080
No.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.080
No.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.080
Let him die.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.080
I'm a doctor.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.080
There we go.

16:49.080 --> 16:51.080
Um.

16:51.080 --> 16:56.080
On the Conan podcast, they have these like casual interviews that make up the bulk of the podcast, right?

16:56.080 --> 16:57.080
With celebrities, etc.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.080
But there's two issues, right?

16:59.080 --> 17:04.080
I don't have the people skills to have a normal conversation.

17:04.080 --> 17:06.080
And y'all aren't famous, right?

17:06.080 --> 17:09.080
So people aren't super interested in your actual personal lives.

17:09.080 --> 17:11.080
So what we're going to do is instead of having a casual interview,

17:11.080 --> 17:13.080
we're going to have a hostile interview.

17:13.080 --> 17:18.080
It feels like you backed into the rationale because you want it to have a hostile interview anyway.

17:18.080 --> 17:21.080
Why don't you talk slash smile more?

17:21.080 --> 17:23.080
Who is that to you?

17:23.080 --> 17:24.080
That's to a mirror.

17:24.080 --> 17:26.080
I do talk a lot.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.080
And you smile.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.080
He does smile a lot.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.080
Yeah.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.080
You just stick you late more than you smile.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.080
I'm also kind of famous.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.080
You said I wasn't famous.

17:33.080 --> 17:34.080
But I am.

17:34.080 --> 17:37.080
In circles.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.080
Yeah.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.080
Ooh.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.080
That's what fame is to be known in circles.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.080
I mean, like I'm here.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.080
Uh, sorry.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.080
Emma.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.080
Um.

17:48.080 --> 17:51.080
That's the first thing we'll ever give us all the time.

17:51.080 --> 17:55.080
Um, like, what's the name of the guy from Glee?

17:55.080 --> 17:56.080
Which guy?

17:56.080 --> 17:57.080
Which guy?

17:57.080 --> 17:58.080
Exactly.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.080
So like some people know the Glee.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.080
Have a male.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.080
Have a male.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.080
Kurt something or other?

18:03.080 --> 18:04.080
Yeah.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.080
Kevin McCail.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.080
Like the basketball player.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.080
No.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.080
Like.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.080
Already.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.080
The guy.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.080
Like a chair.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.080
See, this is my point.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.080
Like yes.

18:15.080 --> 18:16.080
Some people know you.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.080
A lot of people don't know other things.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.080
You got no way.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.080
No way.

18:20.080 --> 18:21.080
No way.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.080
Um.

18:22.080 --> 18:25.080
Emma, when are you going to get married?

18:25.080 --> 18:26.080
Oh my god.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.080
I have a list of rude questions to ask.

18:28.080 --> 18:31.080
So I'm asking them to create a hostile environment.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.080
Got it.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.080
I don't know, Jeff.

18:33.080 --> 18:34.080
Okay.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.080
Um.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.080
Will.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.080
What's your cholesterol?

18:38.080 --> 18:40.080
Will is that your real hair?

18:40.080 --> 18:41.080
Yeah.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.080
Okay.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.080
Will.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.080
Why are you still single?

18:44.080 --> 18:45.080
I got two in a row.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.080
I'm not.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.080
Holy shit.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.080
I'm so sorry.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.080
I didn't ask.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.080
Yeah.

18:50.080 --> 18:53.080
I have a wonderful.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.080
Let's talk about dating.

18:55.080 --> 18:58.080
Kings County.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.080
Sorry.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.080
Brooklyn.

19:00.080 --> 19:04.080
Let's talk about dating in Kings County.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.080
I'm not dating.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.080
We're in a long distance relationship.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.080
She's in Cook County.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.080
And it is Marie.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.080
There's no way.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.080
What's Cook's County?

19:15.080 --> 19:16.080
Where's that Chicago?

19:16.080 --> 19:17.080
Cook County, Chicago.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.080
Yeah.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.080
Um.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.080
Why long distance?

19:21.080 --> 19:22.080
Hmm.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.080
Can't go ahead of you.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.080
I'm in person.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.080
Or as well.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.080
Zoom fatigue.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.080
That's the only thing.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.080
Stop playing.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.080
Zoom fatigue.

19:30.080 --> 19:33.080
Isn't the reason for the long distance?

19:33.080 --> 19:40.080
Jeffery O'Brien needs a fan.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.080
Oh.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.080
This is a segment that they do on the Conan podcast where they have fans call in.

19:45.080 --> 19:47.080
We don't have the capabilities to.

19:47.080 --> 19:50.080
We barely have the capabilities to fucking record without running out of

19:50.080 --> 19:51.080
Street.

19:51.080 --> 19:52.080
Yeah.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.080
You do call in shows.

19:53.080 --> 19:55.080
So it's a call in show on our very.

19:55.080 --> 19:58.080
So instead of that, we are going to.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.080
I tweeted last night.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.080
I said, um.

20:01.080 --> 20:04.080
We're doing a special episode of the headgun podcast tomorrow.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.080
Why do you put the question in quotes?

20:06.080 --> 20:07.080
It was the kind of a coincidence.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.080
So you saw the tweet.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.080
Yeah.

20:09.080 --> 20:10.080
I saw the tweet.

20:11.080 --> 20:13.080
I didn't feel like it was for us.

20:13.080 --> 20:14.080
Right.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.080
Here we go.

20:15.080 --> 20:18.080
I was like, tell us why you think it.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.080
You like the show or something.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.080
Why did you put that part in quotes?

20:22.080 --> 20:25.080
Um, I said, doing a special episode of the headgun podcast tomorrow.

20:25.080 --> 20:28.080
Reply to this tweet with the reason you listened to a show.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.080
Right.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.080
Because I did.

20:31.080 --> 20:34.080
I wanted to get a good mix of earnest and not.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.080
And I figured that that gave some.

20:36.080 --> 20:39.080
The last little I checked none of it was earnest.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.080
I kind of, yeah, whatever.

20:41.080 --> 20:43.080
I appreciate at least a couple of minutes.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.080
Yeah.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.080
Well, you put the whole thing in sarcastic.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.080
Yeah.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.080
Johnny responded.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.080
He said to hear my own voice.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.080
Yeah.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.080
I liked Johnny's response.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.080
Tyler McCarthy says a mirror made that.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.080
Y'all ready for fish.

20:55.080 --> 20:56.080
Joke once.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.080
That was fun.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.080
I guess.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.080
Yeah.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.080
That's a lot.

21:01.080 --> 21:02.080
I think about that.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.080
Joke a lot to be honest.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.080
Oh, really.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.080
J.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.080
K.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.080
K.

21:09.080 --> 21:14.080
Ear bursting metal clangs that wake me from horrific night terrors.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.080
Drothers, Marika, otherwise.

21:16.080 --> 21:19.080
To see who's been cast as the next bond.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.080
Pension for green.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.080
God.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.080
You want to get uninterrupted.

21:26.080 --> 21:27.080
He wants to just.

21:27.080 --> 21:28.080
We.

21:28.080 --> 21:32.080
We haven't even brought up the elephant in the room.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.080
Which is what?

21:34.080 --> 21:38.080
Today.

21:38.080 --> 21:46.080
On the internet, it was announced that Aaron Taylor Johnson is about to sign his contract to play

21:46.080 --> 21:47.080
the next bond.

21:47.080 --> 21:53.080
And if we all remember, that was my very first bond of the week.

21:53.080 --> 21:56.080
Jeff is going again.

21:56.080 --> 21:59.080
Why do you think they want Aaron Taylor Johnson as bond?

21:59.080 --> 22:00.080
Is it because he dated?

22:00.080 --> 22:02.080
Is Mary to someone who's like 40 years older than him?

22:02.080 --> 22:04.080
Yeah, he was groomed.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.080
We have to talk about it.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.080
Wait, how old is he?

22:06.080 --> 22:07.080
British.

22:07.080 --> 22:08.080
He's not very innocent.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.080
Is this true?

22:09.080 --> 22:10.080
Why?

22:10.080 --> 22:11.080
Look at him.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.080
Oh, she's 57.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.080
Okay.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.080
This is terrible.

22:15.080 --> 22:16.080
Yeah.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.080
And they've been married for 13 years.

22:18.080 --> 22:20.080
It's really bad.

22:20.080 --> 22:22.080
So he was 20 and she was 45.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.080
And they got married.

22:24.080 --> 22:25.080
Yeah.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.080
And they've been married for 13 years.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.080
Yes.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.080
It's really bad.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.080
So he was 20 and she was 45.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.080
And they got married.

22:33.080 --> 22:34.080
And they're still together.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.080
Yeah.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.080
They have children.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.080
They have kids.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.080
That's kind of cool, actually.

22:39.080 --> 22:42.080
You're trying so hard to move on from this.

22:42.080 --> 22:44.080
It would be another way around.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.080
And everyone would say that's hotter.

22:46.080 --> 22:47.080
That's cool.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.080
And suddenly the women is older.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.080
And then we're like, Oh, my God.

22:50.080 --> 22:51.080
I can't believe it.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.080
No.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.080
That has to stop now.

22:53.080 --> 22:57.080
We have to normalize the abnormalization.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.080
Sounds like me.

22:58.080 --> 22:59.080
Oh, good to say.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.080
He's on.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.080
Yeah.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.080
You.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.080
That's promo for the new.

23:03.080 --> 23:04.080
How long is that?

23:04.080 --> 23:05.080
You're here.

23:05.080 --> 23:07.080
This show.

23:07.080 --> 23:09.080
Jepherty.

23:09.080 --> 23:11.080
Bullying.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.080
On your laughing.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.080
Miles is Jeff.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.080
Lower deep dives.

23:14.080 --> 23:16.080
And me.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.080
That means.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.080
Browns out.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.080
J.K.

23:19.080 --> 23:20.080
Catagaze.

23:20.080 --> 23:22.080
Catataz.

23:22.080 --> 23:24.080
Lista reasons for this.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.080
It was like a very natural conversation happening.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.080
And it felt like it was.

23:27.080 --> 23:28.080
Yeah.

23:28.080 --> 23:31.080
And you brought back to just reading a list.

23:31.080 --> 23:35.080
It feels like with a multi year buildup to the bon thing.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.080
That was a pretty anti-climbing.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.080
He hasn't.

23:38.080 --> 23:41.080
Into the deal.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.080
The second.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.080
The pen touches the page.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.080
I will.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.080
And what?

23:46.080 --> 23:47.080
Host of fucking party.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.080
And guess what else?

23:48.080 --> 23:52.080
The 200th episode is coming up.

23:52.080 --> 23:53.080
Faster approaching.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.080
And how awesome.

23:54.080 --> 23:58.080
I don't interrupt you guys.

23:58.080 --> 24:01.080
People think that is one of us to interrupt.

24:01.080 --> 24:04.080
I have the ability to interrupt.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.080
He's different in interrupting by the way.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.080
He's the same thing.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.080
It's overlapling dial.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.080
And you're starting to be laughing.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.080
My fucking.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.080
You also do interrupt us.

24:13.080 --> 24:15.080
It's not just overlapping dial.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.080
Really.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.080
It's also interrupting.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.080
Yeah.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.080
Name.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.080
Okay.

24:20.080 --> 24:26.320
winners lap and you fucking just wait right back to reading a tweet like it was nothing.

24:27.040 --> 24:34.800
Say it with me now. Overlapped and died. That was a reply to it. So that's why he

24:34.800 --> 24:43.440
listens to the show. Um, a lot of people say to see niche internet history as it unfolds aka my ass.

24:43.440 --> 24:52.400
If you guys ever had your ass unfold, do you keep that up the nude? It's on. Yeah, it's on Twitter.

24:52.400 --> 24:58.000
For, uh, or sorry, X. Um, but I was thinking about deleting my Twitter the other day.

24:58.880 --> 25:03.920
Twitter doesn't use it or my Twitter timeline has a lot of like violence on it. It's a lot of like

25:03.920 --> 25:09.600
street fights that I don't want to see in like, like I don't follow anyone who does that, but the new algorithm

25:09.600 --> 25:15.760
just shoves really sad stuff in my eyes. I think it's like based on watch time. So you must be like engaging

25:15.760 --> 25:21.120
with it and somewhere. Yeah, I think it is based on watch time. It absolutely is. This is my free. It was

25:21.120 --> 25:26.560
nothing like that. Yeah. Mine's like actually really good to be honest. Jeff only follows bum fights.

25:26.560 --> 25:31.200
I was like, I thought it was showing you. And that's the, that's the you follow tab. It's not even

25:31.200 --> 25:38.480
the course. Engaging segments that always leave room for the guests to be themselves while also having

25:38.560 --> 25:44.320
a witty host to back up their banter. I, I really, the opposite. I appreciate that. That one's

25:44.320 --> 25:51.120
from your local chatter racky. Uh, the boring car guy says, it's the cold icy stairs for me.

25:53.280 --> 26:01.440
I thought you were calling one of us the boring car. Yeah, that's. Um, I mean, can we be honest about

26:01.520 --> 26:07.920
something? Sure. There's a canker sore among us. Okay.

26:13.920 --> 26:23.120
The first canker sore award goes to will. Oh, they did not see like wow. That's an upset. Yeah.

26:24.000 --> 26:31.200
Why is he a canker sore? It's an indescribable award, but it's a new kind of fixture in the show

26:31.280 --> 26:38.080
that I've been meaning to beta test, which is to say that every episode does have someone who

26:39.600 --> 26:46.480
has canker sore energy. And he's hit like a thorn in the side. Is it like, uh, it's not that annoying.

26:46.480 --> 26:55.440
It's an illusion in the side. Yeah. It's a herpes virus return, which is like a Saturn. This is me.

26:55.440 --> 27:00.480
What a canker sore. But a little more canker. That's a cold sore. The green sore is herpes.

27:00.480 --> 27:06.240
A canker sore is not a virus. It's just like it's a canker sore. I was going to say in a way.

27:06.240 --> 27:12.960
Yeah, cold sore award or is it still the canker sore? I think it's the cold sore

27:12.960 --> 27:20.080
war. It's sponsored by the cold sore case. And there's going to be a video intro made by

27:20.160 --> 27:30.320
Sora. Yeah. Or that's awesome. Uh, every story can cold sore or more. I thought of a funny

27:30.320 --> 27:39.280
sentence like that the other day. Uh, it was. Oh, that's good. Thank you.

27:40.560 --> 27:46.320
That's five times. All right. Moving on to our last segment here. Uh, kind of true. Not so many

27:46.320 --> 27:52.960
replies and you want more. You guys are not seeming happy about it. Well, I'm just I'm just looking at all of

27:52.960 --> 28:06.400
them. You read these on then. Nobody fucking aids me. Nobody. Let's see Steven Joseph Flex says the

28:06.400 --> 28:13.680
designed chaos, the less in sync everyone seems the better the episode. The more plan that

28:13.680 --> 28:20.960
seemingly go arrive the better the episode. Well, it's a great reason this tweet from Dickson

28:20.960 --> 28:30.160
cider, which is. Do you know that those monks that spend years in the Tibetan mountains getting

28:30.160 --> 28:34.480
kicked in the ball so that they can no longer feel the pain listening to the headgun podcast for

28:34.480 --> 28:40.320
the capacity of the years has trained my ears to be able to withstand that pain with stand that.

28:40.400 --> 28:50.560
Yeah. Some of the team Coco podcast studios in large mud in Los Angeles. Oh, kind of a

28:51.280 --> 28:56.880
wealthier area than Silver Lake should be say. Uh, yeah. It's kind of like the West Village versus

28:56.880 --> 29:05.840
Williamsburg. Yeah. And in terms of the New York office, Union Square versus, um, where we were

29:05.920 --> 29:10.320
in Williamsburg. Oh, okay. So you're saying that the New York office kind of has that large one energy

29:10.320 --> 29:16.000
and the Silver Lake offices and to put it into a mirror's words in the slums? No, it's more of like

29:16.000 --> 29:21.760
the east side artist friendly district of town. Artists friendly because some of the podcast advertising

29:21.760 --> 29:35.200
deals here like you have ****. Don't think that's true. It's the opposite of what. No, it's not really.

29:35.200 --> 29:43.520
Yeah. To close out the podcast. Conversations on Conan O'Brien needs a friend, largely unrelated

29:43.520 --> 29:49.120
to the preceding interview are featured with O'Brien, Moffsessian and Gorley discussing topics,

29:49.120 --> 29:56.080
including minor workplace squabbles, the success of the podcast, O'Brien's idiosyncrasies

29:56.080 --> 30:01.200
and listeners messages. Sorry. Imagine us talking about the success of the podcast. No,

30:01.440 --> 30:09.040
God. It's been amazing to watch the rise of the show. I mean, when was the peak now?

30:13.440 --> 30:21.040
What? Like our peak was like episode. I'm going to go 120. No, it was earlier than that.

30:22.400 --> 30:26.080
I think it was eight. I think it was eight eight seven. What did we do for the hundredth episode?

30:27.040 --> 30:32.320
Uh, we had that was. Yeah, take it away, Marie. No, no, no. Yeah.

30:33.680 --> 30:39.280
Pachelet. You suck, man. You fucking.

30:39.280 --> 30:46.160
We just had playing on the screen behind Jeff, like a digital ad on his soundboard.

30:47.440 --> 30:54.880
Be bothered to move his soundboard off of my face. What's it for? Oh, that's Marieka.

30:56.320 --> 31:04.240
The peak was the grammar see theater. That's why we need another live show.

31:05.040 --> 31:10.080
It's hard to maintain and sustain even the biggest shows can't grow forever.

31:11.280 --> 31:15.680
I mean, didn't smart list like have broke or something deal for like a hundred million dollars. Yeah,

31:15.680 --> 31:20.800
I think more. So it's like that's, but there are three very famous funny people.

31:21.440 --> 31:25.120
Yeah, and what are you? You're one. Not famous.

31:26.080 --> 31:30.880
They're also kind of funny guy. That's worse than you just saying not funny because I'm really

31:32.880 --> 31:38.880
honest opinion. It's like a compliment. No, it's not backhanded, not really milk toast.

31:38.880 --> 31:44.560
Take what you get, man. I don't want to take what I can get. I want to have what I deserve.

31:46.720 --> 31:52.480
Which is being driven million dollars. Which is beans and I don't even need nine figures. By the way,

31:52.560 --> 31:58.160
I'll take seven. Yeah, you'll take a million. I'll take a milli a milli a milli a milli six million.

31:58.160 --> 32:03.760
A milli a milli a milli a milli a milli at Jeffrey James on Instagram at patreon.com

32:03.760 --> 32:08.880
For its last Riley and Jeff told us. Are you trying to leave?

32:09.440 --> 32:15.200
I'm trying to do this segment on Conan's podcast. Well, we're at out of time, right? It's been fucking 46 minutes.

32:15.200 --> 32:19.200
Nobody wants to hear more of them. I'm not sure that was your phone call. You're the phone call.

32:19.200 --> 32:24.640
It's got to be like 18 minutes of that. Right. So you wanted to kill Trump's portion. Let's talk about it. It's already noon.

32:24.640 --> 32:29.120
I don't want to take up another fucking ounce of wills time. Is this $199?

32:30.320 --> 32:34.000
This is a $197. Okay. Never mind.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.280
Which I need to talk to on you before I leave today about the 200th episode.

32:39.680 --> 32:43.680
You sure do. This is $199 and $2009. No, this is $197.

32:44.560 --> 32:48.400
I have a great idea for the 200th episode and nobody's trying to help me get it done.

32:48.480 --> 32:53.760
We have. No, we absolutely have. No, we've talked about it. It's like the live show. It's like,

32:53.760 --> 32:56.880
oh, let's talk about it. Let's talk about it. It's on the calendar.

32:56.880 --> 33:02.160
Move the fucking goal. No, it's on the first of all. I use the planner now. Second of all.

33:02.160 --> 33:05.200
It's on the calendar. It's planned. But nobody's confirmed.

33:06.240 --> 33:12.400
What do you? God. Oh my god. No, you don't. You can't.

33:12.400 --> 33:19.600
You can't. Really? Well, okay. I'm going to bleep all this, but. Yeah.

33:31.440 --> 33:38.400
Yeah. Yeah. Really? Half of. And we have been talking about it. We

33:42.720 --> 33:49.440
don't even start with me. I drop soup on my face.

33:50.800 --> 33:58.640
He's installing hot. I drop soup on my eye. You ordering it a Chinese restaurant.

34:01.520 --> 34:08.880
So not a bowl. Not a bowl. Not a bowl that I go out there and die for.

34:09.840 --> 34:16.640
We're talking about face. We're talking about egg drop soup on my face.

34:17.840 --> 34:26.240
And I think I have made several things. Yeah. Yeah. This episode was a classic B.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.840
Do you think it was a B? We're not your client, but can we get a best

34:31.800 --> 34:37.800
for this episode? No, probably not. Probably not.

34:42.600 --> 34:47.880
So do you guys have any minor workplace squalbles you wanted to talk about? Maybe the success of this podcast?

34:49.640 --> 34:56.600
It's just like what is what are our conversations like talking about the success of their podcast?

34:56.600 --> 35:01.480
It's Conan O'Brien. I think it's Conan being like, I'm shocked that I translated TV

35:01.480 --> 35:04.840
success into podcast success. It's so awesome. I don't have to like do all this stuff.

35:06.840 --> 35:13.720
Well, you're a bad guy. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like I did cover some Jeff idiosyncrasies.

35:13.720 --> 35:19.080
So I feel like at the very least, at the very least, inability to look at the

35:19.080 --> 35:24.680
success of the podcast. Workplace swapples. What's what's the drama in New York? Let's

35:24.680 --> 35:28.280
actually talk about it. Let's take a couple more minutes. You're welcome, audience.

35:30.120 --> 35:35.880
It's not drama, but a question for you. I'm a do you know why there's two leaders of soda?

35:35.880 --> 35:41.960
Yeah, we were curious about that. Oh, yeah. That was Joel brought that in. That was left over from

35:41.960 --> 35:46.920
from his party. He didn't invite me to until day. That he couldn't bring yogurt to. Joel has been using

35:46.920 --> 35:51.640
the Pope. This is good drama. Yeah. Yeah. I heard about Joel's house cooling party that not

35:51.720 --> 36:00.360
everybody has invited to. But he also, he just left three courts of yogurt in our fridge.

36:00.360 --> 36:09.960
Yogurt or coffee. Yogurt. Stony Brook. Yeah, what they said. I just sometimes

36:09.960 --> 36:14.520
feel like a shy about specifics. Yeah. And we were like, who's the yogurt as this? And he was

36:14.520 --> 36:20.920
offended anyone asked. Well, it's a little personal to be like, what are you having for lunch?

36:20.920 --> 36:24.280
It's like kind of judging what people bring in their lunch pale. Because not everybody knew we

36:24.280 --> 36:29.320
we weren't thinking he was eating three courts of yogurt for lunch. You know, on flavor water,

36:29.320 --> 36:35.640
vanilla bean. On flavor flavor. The other piece of East Coast dramas that

36:36.440 --> 36:43.160
recently rinsed into packet. Oh, I got stolen. And it was a bunch of girl scout cookies. So it

36:43.160 --> 36:48.520
really sad. And then he told me that he was sending another package and then he'd to keep my

36:48.520 --> 36:52.040
out for it. It was really important. And I just like, I thought he lived in the Hampton's.

36:53.320 --> 36:59.320
Yeah, but he, you know, he was a little guy. He said, he's so blessed. Oh, my gosh,

36:59.320 --> 37:04.760
how are we starting over? And my house is ending. And now we're like, I wonder if you

37:04.760 --> 37:15.240
am a dancer. Doesn't matter. Hampton Bayers. Hi, Ryan for chambers. We have to end this. Go fire

37:15.960 --> 37:22.680
pale or starting to drift into the studio now. A swell. They're going to stay. We got another

37:22.680 --> 37:33.480
hour of it. We're having a salad rather than a partner. We should have a pancake luncheon.

37:34.520 --> 37:41.880
Hey, my lunch. Okay. Why lunch? I didn't say lunch. I said luncheon, luncheon, but it

37:42.840 --> 37:49.720
I said LinkedIn. Um, I don't know because nobody wants to get here before like 10 people were here

37:49.720 --> 37:57.800
when you got here. Yes, which is done for me. Yes, we're like 30 every morning. I really think that

37:57.800 --> 38:03.400
in terms of what I wanted this episode to be, we got there. We're all fiends. We're all fiends. We're all

38:03.400 --> 38:09.160
enemies and folks. Yeah, fucking a mirror's gesticulation took kind of a sleep down curve as

38:09.160 --> 38:16.120
soon as I pointed it out. He's doing prop work now. I'd rather prop work than what he was doing before.

38:16.120 --> 38:21.000
I have to say Emma. What? Ends right there.

38:39.160 --> 38:44.600
That was a hit-dum original.

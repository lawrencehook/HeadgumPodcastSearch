00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
music

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
music

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
music

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
we got

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
nothing

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
nothing

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
you brought up a tattoo

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
what is it saying

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
it's a jerry Garcia reference

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
i'm curious

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
it's a son souci

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
it's a model after a wood sign that was above his house instance in beach

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
well he recorded

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
what do you say

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
his house

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
it ended up being a wood sign over his house stairs

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
and uh

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
he sort of recorded bluegrass tracks there

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
i love the music i love the vibe

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
and so i put it on my thigh

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
you just said for our words twins

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
right

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
but what if someone's not watching the youtube video

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
now they think i have a thigh tattoo

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
which i think is hot

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
well they think we have matching

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
thigh tattoos

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
yeah

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
which are both visible

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
sure skies out thighs out

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
let's have yams with our games today

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
let's get the energy up

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
the sign was over his house

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
stairs

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
and it's on my arm

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
and i think that's fine

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
yes

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
and who cares

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
let's start it off with every

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
what's that?

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
oh really?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
sorry is that OH space R-E-A-L-L-Y

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
or is that O-R-L-Y all caps?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
um

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
the first one

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
the shit is

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
played out

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
so let's get this over with

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
i'm gonna go

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
what's that?

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
didn't say anything

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
pop fake

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
you bit

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
let's go

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
i understood that reference

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
okay

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
me

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
yeah

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
oh

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
draw the contact

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
still get it off

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
um

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
let's go

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
victor wimbing yama

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
and i think it'd be good to have like a seven foot bond

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
with the handles

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
with the candles

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
i mean he's spedding

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
because victor at this point i mean he's like

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
he's making the money that he could walk into the lalo

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
and just get that

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
that bucket candle that's on tall 26

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
and a hash

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
french bond

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
yeah

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
that's kind of interesting

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
what if like it was all in Paris

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
instead of MI6

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
it's like MIA

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
because you don't know where they are

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
that's cool

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
victor wimbing yama

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
scoot Henderson for me

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
and uh

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
i'll go Daniel Craig

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
haha

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
here we go

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
we we do have a lot to get to

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
but i'm trying to make sure you guys feel like you're getting words in edge-wise

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
because everybody cut and complains about that on the show

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
what do you guys want to talk about and then we'll get to the good stuff

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
um

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
i'm on my iPad

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
and it's doing this weird video thing

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
where it's like zooming in a lot closer than usual

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
but it's okay

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
by the way you own the notes

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
i'm sorry to do like

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
housekeeping stuff from headgun

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
normal stuff but you get you and jaco me notes on uh

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
the jaken mirror that's coming out tomorrow

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
i thought i watched it instead it was good

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
oh it's done

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
you just said it was good it can be good with notes

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
it can be good but there's like

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
it's got two frames off of before you say iPad

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
because you say iPad in this catch

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
which is what made me think of that

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
grace cut that out

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
how much money are you worth?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
have any of rushes?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
be your grace

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
uh you

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
grace do you have any assets?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
i'm probably not right

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
no

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
you don't have a house

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
i'm currently in my new flat

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
nice

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
you just moved this week

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
uh

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
yeah

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
been a slow process this past week

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
i mean

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
that counts i just moved to this menu apartment

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
nice

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
yeah

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
is that your front building?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
yeah

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
yeah

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
yeah

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
well like an iron giant

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
12 foot ceilings

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
12 foot ceilings because i live in a loft now

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
imagine going from a canyon to a lot

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
can i ever get a thought out without you saying like oh that's cool

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
that's awesome

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
good for you

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
that's the same

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
yeah

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
just forget it

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
i live in a loft

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
right

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
i mean

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
also we should say that this laptop is

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
teeter brewing on the edge

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
of New Jersey

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
yeah

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
no it is on a window sill

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
and if i make one wrong move it's

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
flying out the window eight stories down

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
exposed you're on the eighth floor

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
exposed brick and you see that

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
you're on the eighth floor

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
not eighth but i'm trying to make sure people don't know where i live

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
that's cool

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
is i your whole is like a whole studio or is there another room

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
can i can we just can we slow things down for a second

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
it's going to tour

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
um it's all one room this is the

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
the room there is a kitchen over there

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
i need to paint that wall because i don't like the green

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
that's it

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
yeah it's sort of like downtown loft

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
vibes

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
yeah but don't say where i live

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
especially downtown because people could go and they could just figure out which building it is

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
nobody would care to see you you can literally say your address in the title of this episode

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
and it wouldn't affect anything

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
fine

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
the title of this episode will be my old it will be my old address because George still lives there

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
okay

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
yeah

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
yeah

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
I think we end up talking about you when we were talking about a

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
miss

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
net worth

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
i'm put out

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
it

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
what?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
i'm put out

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
by you guys today

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
you're not bringing a lot

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
i'm tired

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
i'm excited

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
i'm ready to do this if you guys are

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
what it requires

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
it's the three of us

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
getting on the same page

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
the three of us wanting to put together

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
good episode

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
because here's the thing

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
the last week's episode was one of the best we've ever done

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
i would say it's one of my favorite

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
which was us the top three

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
no

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
that's the jump

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
it was undeniable

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
yeah it was pretty great

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
this week there's no way it's going to be better

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
right

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
so was the one before that us three

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
the one before that was us three

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
and people wanted more

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
more grace

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
that's no

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
um

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
um

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
continue

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
oh oh oh

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
ozempe

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
how much money do you have in the bank right now?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
can you pull up your bank of America

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
i assume it's bank of

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
you're not a bank of America because that's the closest physical branch to your house

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
move on

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
dot or

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
is it $400,000 do you think?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
it's probably a little bit less than that

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
start to say

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
just in the bank

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
what your balance says

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
400 grand

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
at the very least

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
i'd love to get a numbers crunch on what interest rate you locked in your mortgage at

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
did you refinance in 2020

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
at 3%

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
um

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
no i didn't refinance

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
you didn't refinance when

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
mortgage lending rates were under 3%

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
for like a month

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
hmm

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
because that was already under two

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
oh

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
yeah

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
yeah

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
yeah

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
i actually am kind of

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
underwater

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
a lot of investments

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
um

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
that were made

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
in an illidivized fashion

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
you talk about

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
interest rates

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
i am paying

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
sorry

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
it was on a variable

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
this just in

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
you know

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
how there's that NBA play

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
or midseason tournament

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
yeah

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
i wanted to announce

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
the year at the 12th minute

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
that as that's happening

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
late November, early December

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
there's going to be a mid year

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
headgum podcast

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
turny

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
meaning

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
what do you mean meaning

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
it's a mid journey turning

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
like the AI

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
no

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
no

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
it's going to be people

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
at the network

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
competing for joy

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
and wisdom

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
does that make sense

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
so instead of east versus west

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
it's the wise versus joy

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
and the winner gets cash

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
no one's even a little excited

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
you could both walk on with five

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
hundred bucks

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
why would i be invited

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
because you were

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
not a headgum employee

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
no it's not

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
oh my god

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
it's like that was on call

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
for

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
it's factual

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
no

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
was

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
absolutely

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
you don't want to be part of the

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
turny that's fine

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
but the fact of the matter is that

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
there is no tournament without me

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
because i just came up with it a couple

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
minutes ago

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
okay do you think yourself is

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
joy or wisdom

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
i'm probably i probably have a

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
buy in

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
wise

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
i think i'm the number one seed in

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
wise

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
number one seed in

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
or wisdom

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
you're the youngest

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
i know but it's

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
the least amount of wisdom

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
no because ages but a number

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
and like

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Peter doesn't have wisdom to

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
spend some sort of say

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
like when was the last time you got advice

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
from fucking

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Brad

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
over the weekend

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
really

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
yeah

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
good spots to go climbing

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
and things to eat

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
on the Pacific Northwest

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
because he knows yeah

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
that's kind of cool

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
maybe he's the second seed

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
he might be the second seed

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
he's definitely higher than you

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
who do you guys think is the number one seed for joy

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
though at the network

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
it can't be

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
happy as person

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
yeah

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Alex Bergman

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
me

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
it's definitely not

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
it's William Conover

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
yeah

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
yeah

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
yeah

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
he smiles a lot

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
he smiles a lot

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
yeah

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
grace

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
no phones at the dinner table

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
type of vibe

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
right that's always what the show has been

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
i

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
have a bunch of stuff to do on here

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
but you don't see me tap it away

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
right

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
so let's keep

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
let's keep focused

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
did you say you had to drive like

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
40 miles later

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
that's true

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
have you ever been a thousand oaks

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
you don't want to chuckle with that

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I already heard you say that joke

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
did you say paths

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
so that when I ask you if you said pass

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
the audience doesn't think I'm fucking insane

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
well they are because I'm going to boost me saying

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
whenever I see brown leaves smiling face

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I have to smile myself

I don't know what happened

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
what's under a bridge or something

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
yeah

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
under a bridge

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
can I see outside your window

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
you see that

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
this is laughing

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
laughing at the view

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I live under a fucking overpass

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
what do you have it to say

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
um

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
no there's a very funny billboard outside my right

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
outside my window

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
is it lemon dad

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
is this here did you move

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
finally

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
yeah I finally moved

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
this is an interesting

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
anybody

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
no I agree

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
um

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
what's up

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
I said okay

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
okay

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
how are you

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I'm good thank you how are you

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
she says

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
honestly I can't hear anyone

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
she says she's good how are you

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
I'm doing okay

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I'm here

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
I'm here

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
I'm here

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
it's like a lot of it banks on him

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
and sometimes he brings it sometimes he doesn't

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
it's things

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I don't think you need to rely on him

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
as much in that way

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I think it's kind of like his presence

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
does enough

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
yeah I just get anxious you know

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
because I see like he looks pissed

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
and then I'm like oh shit

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
what did I do wrong

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
and it's like it's not about me

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
it's all about him

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
does that make sense?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
I guess

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
you guess or it is true

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
you guess?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
yeah

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
you're talking to my therapist

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
yeah

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
yes

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
what is true

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
that gave me my ability today

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
being named Toastel

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
I saw that

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000

it's like focus

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
it's like he was right there

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
you know

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
he was almost good

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
oh

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
like Jebilee Beating

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
regardless

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
like a cool dude

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
no one was a problem with

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
exactly

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
yeah this was an odd choice for him

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
this was bizarre

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
he's so insecure

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
did you guys read the text?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
yeah

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
yeah he wanted his girlfriend to take down

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
pictures of her surfing

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
even though she's a professional surfer

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
something

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
so he dates a professional surfer

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
and then this is a text

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
that she

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
he sent her on December 20

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
sorry

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
December 2, 2021

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
this is apropos of nothing

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
because there's that little

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
time stamp right before

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
so they weren't talking already

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
he says plain

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
he says plain and simple

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
if you need

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
you need

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
if you need

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
surfing with men

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
boundaryless

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
inappropriate

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
friendships with men

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
to model

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
to post pictures

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
of yourself

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
in a bathing suit

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
to post sexual pictures

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
friendships

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
this is my favorite one

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
friendships with women

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
who are in unstable

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
places and from your

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
wild recent past

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
beyond getting

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
lunch or coffee

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
slash something

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
respectful

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I am not the partner for you

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
if these things

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
bring you to a place of happiness

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I support it

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
and there will be no

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
hard feelings

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
these are my boundaries

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
for romantic partnerships

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
my boundaries with you

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
based on the ways

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
these actions have hurt

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
our trust

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
what is the

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
hanging out with women

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
in wild situations

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
what's that one

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
oh he's just saying

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
if she needs friendships

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
with women who are in unstable

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
places and from your

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
wild recent past

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
beyond getting a lunch or

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
coffee or something respectful

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
then he's not the right partner

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
for you

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
so if she wanted to get a dinner

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
with a lady friend

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
he's like I'm out

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
that's a bridge too far

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
for me to handle right now

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
it depends

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
where the dinner

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
that's a no go

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
no it doesn't depend

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
it's

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
if it's pet like

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
when do you guys eat lunch

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
for

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
no it's wally

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
really

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
1230

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
I have an

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
lunch yet

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
your

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
bizarre

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
an empty

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
habit so

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
you're not the

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
litmus test of what's

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
average

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
do you think it's better to

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
be bizarre in habit

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
or in fashion

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
fashion

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
okay

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
that was my phone ringing

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
it's my buddy

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
I didn't

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
do you want to go around

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
and we can all list our own

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
boundaries

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
yeah what would be that's a really

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
good idea but I just so

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
these aren't good to have

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
that's what I was trying to figure out

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
why was the internet

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
freaking out because I'd love

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
to not date somebody

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
who sorry let me look

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
back to it

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
I don't want to date somebody

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
who

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
uh

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
models

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
okay

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
really

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
yeah

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
well what's modeling

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
you know like okay here's

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
the two things that we need to nail

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
down

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
when is lunch

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
you're saying it's before

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
or after

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
I would say before

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
three

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
okay so

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
no meals after

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
three

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
with friends or not

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I would say

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
I think that's a good start

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
what do you mean why

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
why is that bad at all

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
if she has a

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
hash after three

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
let alone after four

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I'd rather you cheat

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
on my ass

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
then the cheat

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
on me with hash

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
because that means by the way

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
that she's not eating with me

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
and that's cheating

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
almost

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
second thing we need to figure out

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
is what is modeling

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
because you can get paid to do it

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
and that's a job

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
or

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
you could like take a photo

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
of yourself or with others

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
and post it

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
and that's almost cheating

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
and hash

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
yeah

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
yeah

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
every time

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
I'm on this show

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
I'm modeling

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
right

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
behavior

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
you should actually

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
delete your Instagram photos

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
like we should be mad

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
you I think

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
yeah

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
yeah a lot of them are kind of

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
off-putting in a way

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
off-color off-kilter

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
yeah

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
off-base

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
left center

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
one of them is

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
I think just me playing

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
left right center

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
it's just a video

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Chris

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
what's up

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
what are your boundaries

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
oh

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
uh

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
pass

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I don't think

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
this show has ever found

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
it's stride

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
there have been one off

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
full episodes

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
140 at this point

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
right

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
162

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
yeah

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
162

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
and it

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
it still hasn't

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
found it stride

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
slash pudding

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I just see who's fault

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
you think

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
I don't care

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
really

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
coming

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
denominator

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
there

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
honestly

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
marica

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
no

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
because this episode isn't going

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
super well

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
and she was on it

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
yeah

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
you dragged her in and hung her up

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
yeah

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
yeah

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
yeah

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
I think what we need to do

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
is figure out

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
our boundaries

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
personally and with the show

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Grace what is

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
oh

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
if you

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
sorry let me get there

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
exactly

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
what are your boundaries

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
with your partners

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
based on the way

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
actions have hurt

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
your trust

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
in others

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
for me

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
it's you cannot model

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
which is any photo of you

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
cannot happen

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
that's not okay with me

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
even like

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
simple as

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
on camera on a zoom that

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
is not recorded

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
is going to be a no go for daddy

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
okay

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Eden

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
what's that

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Eden

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
I didn't want to interrupt

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
I know you have a

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
you're kind of a stickler for that

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
I would like

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
to set a boundary right now

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
okay

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
I do think

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
the camera is too close to a

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
maze

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
face

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
I don't even know

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
faces the right word for it today

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
I feel like it's

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
a surprise

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
and it's

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
it's this iPad

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
of

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
my computer

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
sort of acting

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
the fool

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
so I thought I'd go

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
iPad

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
it's doing like this

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
I don't even know

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
this feature is called

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
it's like

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
sort of like

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
tracking my face

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
left

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
right

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
we should have

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Alex Bergman on the show

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
and do a segment

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
called

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Berking a fool

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
and it's basically like

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
her observation

25:19.000 --> 25:22.120
and then off that week at the office.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.120
Burkding a fool.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.120
It's like shakting a fool.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.680
Kind of.

25:28.680 --> 25:30.200
And so it's Alex being like,

25:30.200 --> 25:31.520
Jovelle McGee.

25:34.520 --> 25:36.600
We don't really make fun of Jovelle any more,

25:36.600 --> 25:37.920
sort of prove himself.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.440
What about me and Grace, basketball trivia

25:42.440 --> 25:44.680
because we're both sort of hoops heads.

25:44.680 --> 25:45.520
Okay, right?

25:45.520 --> 25:47.680
And then maybe instead of that,

25:47.680 --> 25:51.080
we dive into 36 hours and wall saw.

25:51.080 --> 25:54.720
Right, so like I'm pitching you kind of fun little ideas

25:54.720 --> 25:56.880
and like when Marieka's on things are going well

25:56.880 --> 25:58.840
and you hand up and cut to a commercial,

25:58.840 --> 26:00.040
then like I pitch you something.

26:00.040 --> 26:02.480
It's just thing you say, actually let's do the opposite.

26:02.480 --> 26:05.600
You're sort of a burst any natural joy

26:05.600 --> 26:09.160
that could accidentally happen out of this thing.

26:09.160 --> 26:11.720
I know what goes growing out of concrete

26:11.720 --> 26:13.760
and you're just plucking it over and over.

26:13.760 --> 26:15.720
I'm offering you some insight.

26:15.720 --> 26:18.680
And I'm putting it in a bottle with some water

26:18.680 --> 26:20.080
putting it on a desk.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.360
Yes, that's good stuff.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.960
Grace, I don't think I have you on Instagram.

26:25.960 --> 26:26.800
What's your Instagram?

26:27.880 --> 26:28.720
We were just texting.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.960
Where did the trolls bolt-cleat we had to take?

26:30.960 --> 26:32.120
I got it, I got it.

26:32.120 --> 26:32.960
Okay.

26:34.640 --> 26:37.360
So as we know, the last time you were on,

26:37.360 --> 26:38.880
we were talking about the best fish and chips

26:38.880 --> 26:40.240
and wall saw, right?

26:41.880 --> 26:44.240
Did you nail down where they are?

26:46.240 --> 26:49.520
No, but I can verify that I gave a bad answer.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.360
Okay.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.480
Aval well, it's not the one.

26:51.480 --> 26:54.040
And I was recently in Traverse City

26:54.040 --> 26:57.120
and I was wondering if it maybe could give wall saw

26:57.120 --> 26:58.680
or run for its money

26:58.680 --> 27:02.000
because there was a recently shuttered storefront

27:02.000 --> 27:04.800
called Scalawags, white fish and chips

27:04.800 --> 27:06.800
and on the sign they have a website

27:06.800 --> 27:08.880
which is helpful because you're already at the store.

27:11.720 --> 27:14.320
What's wall saw is answered as Scalawags

27:14.320 --> 27:15.520
in Traverse City, Michigan.

27:18.520 --> 27:19.360
Uh...

27:20.800 --> 27:22.480
The equivalence.

27:22.480 --> 27:24.880
Sometimes this show makes me want to...

27:26.640 --> 27:29.280
shift back to like, I don't know, find the answer something.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.120
Let's keep going.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.000
Never, never, never find it.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Never find it.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
I, well, I had a savings once.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.560
Yeah, that's unrelated.

27:36.560 --> 27:39.440
Was working at Carpool, karaoke and getting overpaid.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.120
So I had like a savings account.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.760
And it took you all once.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.280
Yeah, that was a while ago.

27:45.040 --> 27:47.680
You peaked at age 20.

27:47.680 --> 27:51.240
That's really fucking sad.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.480
I know, and it's hard to like reconcile with.

27:53.480 --> 27:55.160
Also 26.

27:55.160 --> 27:59.200
It's hard to like, hard to stomach slash fathom, right?

27:59.200 --> 28:00.040
I know.

28:00.040 --> 28:03.360
And I feel like the only method that could make it all late 20s yet.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.200
Yeah.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.720
And it feels like the best is behind.

28:06.720 --> 28:10.720
Like that's such a weird timeline to be on.

28:11.680 --> 28:17.320
You peaked so fast and young that it's weird to be like,

28:17.320 --> 28:22.400
thinking about new step slash directions in your life.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.240
And are you still 25?

28:26.360 --> 28:31.360
Yeah, I'm not like, how does that happen, man?

28:31.360 --> 28:34.160
And you can't even like pinpoint it.

28:34.160 --> 28:37.160
You can't feel like this one thing went wrong.

28:37.160 --> 28:39.000
It's not like you had a rock bottom.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.840
It's just been a slow kind of fucking set.

28:42.840 --> 28:43.160
Oh, yeah.

28:43.160 --> 28:47.960
Because we were talking about very briefly about Chef Kevin

28:47.960 --> 28:49.560
last time I was on.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.960
And you were saying that he owns a house now.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.240
He has a house, yeah.

28:53.240 --> 29:00.240
And in many ways, you are kind of work kind of the Chef Kevin

29:00.240 --> 29:01.680
to exactly.

29:01.680 --> 29:05.280
Jake and Amiz, Hollywood Hamburg, as it were.

29:05.360 --> 29:09.720
My theory is, well, do you feel like you bet on the wrong horse?

29:09.720 --> 29:11.520
Because Kevin has a house.

29:11.520 --> 29:14.840
You don't even have a job.

29:14.840 --> 29:18.440
So Amiz saying you can't pinpoint the moment

29:18.440 --> 29:19.360
where everything went wrong.

29:19.360 --> 29:22.720
But I think there's a pretty clear indicator that that's

29:22.720 --> 29:26.000
a sliding door moment, yeah.

29:26.000 --> 29:26.760
Yeah.

29:26.760 --> 29:30.960
So you think I should've hitched my wagon to Hazen Sean?

29:30.960 --> 29:34.400
Just from evidence we have.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.240
Yeah.

29:35.240 --> 29:35.760
It could have been.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.760
Well, we don't know if Kevin should too.

29:37.760 --> 29:40.000
Yeah, because it might be like, how I spend my money and how

29:40.000 --> 29:41.440
he spend his money or didn't.

29:41.440 --> 29:42.800
And then he's also, I think, married.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.040
So he has like a dual income.

29:44.040 --> 29:46.760
And I'm alone in thin and goal.

29:46.760 --> 29:47.800
You move a lot.

29:47.800 --> 29:50.400
I move a lot because everybody costs me an hour.

29:50.400 --> 29:54.000
Yeah, it's hard because I got movers and there was like $600.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.200
And then like, that's a lot of money.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.320
That's basically if you parse it out, that's $50 a month.

29:58.320 --> 30:01.000
I could've spent on extra rent.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.760
And then you have some new furniture.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.760
What's that?

30:03.760 --> 30:07.120
So it is very sweet that you're willing to blame yourself and not

30:07.120 --> 30:11.680
I did just give you a an out to blame a man, but you.

30:11.680 --> 30:15.040
Oh, I don't think ultimately it's my fault.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.880
I'm just trying to like, because it's better to take back your

30:16.880 --> 30:19.760
agency and be like, oh, what can I change?

30:19.760 --> 30:23.120
If I blame it all on a mirror, I can't change anything.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.280
But there's always travel.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.280
Good travel.

30:27.280 --> 30:30.280
Oh, oh, oh.

30:30.280 --> 30:34.280
Oh, have a good break down at TSA.

30:34.280 --> 30:36.280
Shilas.

30:36.280 --> 30:39.280
I could've been Kevin.

30:39.280 --> 30:43.280
And let's spend 36 minutes in Walsaw, England.

30:43.280 --> 30:45.280
Kertis, he has six minutes.

30:45.280 --> 30:51.880
She, Grace sent me this Instagram story of how to spend 36 minutes in

30:51.880 --> 30:53.280
Walsaw.

30:53.280 --> 30:56.280
Our tour begins says Harper.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.280
That's a great first name.

30:58.280 --> 31:00.280
Why isn't your first name Harper?

31:00.280 --> 31:03.280
And your last name like, I don't know.

31:03.280 --> 31:05.280
Sorry, go ahead.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.280
No, please suggest your last name for me.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.280
Oh, like Hansen.

31:09.280 --> 31:11.280
You're my name to be Harper Hansen.

31:11.280 --> 31:14.280
I think you would've been an erotic novelist.

31:14.280 --> 31:16.280
I really do.

31:16.280 --> 31:18.280
Okay.

31:18.280 --> 31:21.280
Our tour begins upon your arrival at Walsaw Busters.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.280
Go on.

31:24.280 --> 31:27.280
They built it in the year 2000.

31:27.280 --> 31:28.280
Wait.

31:28.280 --> 31:32.280
And my class took a trip to visit it and had to ask people on the street what they thought

31:32.280 --> 31:33.280
about it.

31:33.280 --> 31:38.280
It was a geography project.

31:38.280 --> 31:42.280
We took a public bus and all had to bring bus fare from home.

31:42.280 --> 31:46.280
On this trip, we also visited a new roundabout, which was a six foot diameter

31:46.280 --> 31:50.280
lightly domed circle at the center of a junction.

31:50.280 --> 31:51.280
Who wrote this?

31:51.280 --> 31:52.280
Grace.

31:52.280 --> 31:55.280
Got it.

31:55.280 --> 31:59.280
On the way back from the school trip, we got on a different bus that took us to the back

31:59.280 --> 32:04.280
of school.

32:04.280 --> 32:06.280
But the gate was locked.

32:06.280 --> 32:12.280
So we all crawled through a known hole in the fence, including our teacher.

32:12.280 --> 32:15.280
Two people have died due to this Busters.

32:16.280 --> 32:21.280
So that's the first minute in Walsaw.

32:21.280 --> 32:23.280
The second one is five more.

32:23.280 --> 32:28.280
The second one is this piece of art with no title or artist attributed to it.

32:28.280 --> 32:33.280
I don't think it's that bad, but yeah.

32:33.280 --> 32:36.280
Walsaw High Street.

32:36.280 --> 32:39.280
Here we see the lower end of Walsaw High Street.

32:39.280 --> 32:43.280
When I was a teenager, the market, just so you guys can all see.

32:43.280 --> 32:46.280
A minute three of 36 that you're reading.

32:46.280 --> 32:47.280
I don't know how many minutes.

32:47.280 --> 32:49.280
Another hour to get through this.

32:49.280 --> 32:52.280
You're spending two to five minutes for every second.

32:52.280 --> 32:53.280
All right.

32:53.280 --> 32:59.280
Well, this one is just for anybody who has swag apparently.

32:59.280 --> 33:00.280
So.

33:00.280 --> 33:01.280
I didn't think that's the point.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.280
It's for you specifically.

33:02.280 --> 33:03.280
Yeah.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.280
Thank you.

33:04.280 --> 33:05.280
Have swag.

33:05.280 --> 33:06.280
Oh, poundland.

33:06.280 --> 33:08.280
Is that a.

33:08.280 --> 33:10.280
What is that?

33:10.280 --> 33:11.280
It's a brothel.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.280
It is.

33:12.280 --> 33:15.280
I thought it was a brothel. Yeah.

33:15.280 --> 33:20.280
Do you think that brothels and Bethel?

33:20.280 --> 33:22.280
Bethel?

33:22.280 --> 33:23.280
That could be cool.

33:23.280 --> 33:25.280
So what if it was like a.

33:25.280 --> 33:28.280
What if it was a brothel called ham in Bethel?

33:28.280 --> 33:30.280
Ham.

33:30.280 --> 33:34.280
What if it was a bone brothel?

33:34.280 --> 33:38.280
Just as a disaster.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.280
Oh, the new art gallery of Walsal.

33:47.280 --> 33:49.280
There's a warf.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.280
Yeah.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.280
Episode ends right there.

33:53.280 --> 33:57.280
There's a warf.

33:57.280 --> 34:01.280
Gray said in France the geese say Hong Kong.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.280
I don't know if that joke landed.

34:03.280 --> 34:06.280
I just want to rewind 20 minutes.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.280
We got to go.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.280
We got a lot to get through today.

34:10.280 --> 34:11.280
Now it's.

34:11.280 --> 34:12.280
We've done nothing.

34:12.280 --> 34:14.280
And you're just reading an instrument.

34:14.280 --> 34:15.280
We were supposed to say.

34:15.280 --> 34:19.280
We were supposed to dissect the Jonah Hill Contravers.

34:19.280 --> 34:20.280
We did that.

34:20.280 --> 34:21.280
We did it.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.280
We did it.

34:22.280 --> 34:23.280
We did it.

34:23.280 --> 34:26.280
We said he was a bad guy and could have been good.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.280
We said he was insecure.

34:28.280 --> 34:29.280
Good.

34:29.280 --> 34:31.280
Everybody would have been a good guy.

34:31.280 --> 34:33.280
You're shitting yourself if you didn't think.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.280
Oh, that guy could be a good guy.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.280
By the way, can be a good guy.

34:37.280 --> 34:40.280
You have you have famous people in your phone number.

34:40.280 --> 34:42.280
You know what bothers me about famous people.

34:42.280 --> 34:43.280
At least the famous people I know.

34:43.280 --> 34:46.280
They don't bother with like texting normal.

34:46.280 --> 34:51.280
All of these texts from Jonah have like weird punctuation periods where they don't need to be.

34:51.280 --> 34:52.280
Capital letters.

34:52.280 --> 34:53.280
Heather, then they're there.

34:53.280 --> 34:59.280
I'm like, just because your famous doesn't mean you can't like format this so that it doesn't look like you're having a panic attack.

35:06.280 --> 35:08.280
You don't find that to be true.

35:08.280 --> 35:11.280
Rosemick, I ver Ben Schwartz.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.280
Fucking normal.

35:13.280 --> 35:14.280
They text normal.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.280
Really.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.280
You T.K.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.280
What about him?

35:17.280 --> 35:18.280
Pretty normal.

35:18.280 --> 35:19.280
Yeah.

35:19.280 --> 35:21.280
You're still on mayors close friend story, right?

35:21.280 --> 35:22.280
Does he ever punctuate normal?

35:22.280 --> 35:23.280
John mayor.

35:23.280 --> 35:24.280
Yeah.

35:24.280 --> 35:25.280
He's normal.

35:25.280 --> 35:26.280
So it's maybe just Jonah Hill.

35:26.280 --> 35:27.280
It's.

35:27.280 --> 35:28.280
Finn.

35:28.280 --> 35:29.280
We'll text weird.

35:29.280 --> 35:32.280
He just doesn't capitalize things sometimes.

35:32.280 --> 35:33.280
Although.

35:33.280 --> 35:34.280
No.

35:34.280 --> 35:35.280
Well, I'm just texting.

35:35.280 --> 35:38.280
It's been fine.

35:38.280 --> 35:41.280
Wait, what was the last thing you just said, Grace?

35:41.280 --> 35:42.280
I wanted it.

35:42.280 --> 35:43.280
What's on the wall behind the mayor?

35:43.280 --> 35:44.280
Like a.

35:44.280 --> 35:45.280
Bloodspot.

35:45.280 --> 35:46.280
Well, I can't show you.

35:46.280 --> 35:48.280
I have to move my head and then have it.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.280
Follow me there.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.280
Wait, did you finally get rid of that?

35:51.280 --> 35:52.280
Oh.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.280
Oh, right.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.280
Yeah.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.280
It's the right.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.280
Cool.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.280
What is.

35:58.280 --> 35:59.280
What is this app?

35:59.280 --> 36:00.280
Is this for like camp girling?

36:00.280 --> 36:03.280
I think it's my iPad like built in.

36:04.280 --> 36:05.280
Maybe it's Zoom.

36:05.280 --> 36:07.280
That's like doing motion.

36:09.280 --> 36:10.280
Or the week.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.280
Can't believe it took 38 minutes.

36:12.280 --> 36:13.280
Oh, what?

36:13.280 --> 36:14.280
iPad.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.280
I definitely said that.

36:16.280 --> 36:18.280
It's one of the first things I've said.

36:18.280 --> 36:19.280
Oh.

36:22.280 --> 36:25.280
Grace, let's talk about dating and wall saw.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.280
Okay.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.280
Has the dating.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.280
I told him.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.280
Just.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.280
Yeah.

36:30.280 --> 36:31.280
Okay.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.280
It's going to be loud.

36:32.280 --> 36:37.280
D-E-N-E-R-S or G-U-A-R-D-N-E-R-S.

36:37.280 --> 36:42.280
The second one being someone who shows up to sort of protect the home.

36:42.280 --> 36:43.280
Yeah.

36:43.280 --> 36:44.280
The fort.

36:44.280 --> 36:45.280
Yeah.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.280
Yeah.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.280
Grace, how's the dating pool and wall saw?

36:48.280 --> 36:49.280
And surf fast.

36:49.280 --> 36:52.280
And to be honest, I've been pretty busy.

36:52.280 --> 36:53.280
Yeah.

36:53.280 --> 36:55.280
I haven't made time for it.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.280
And that's fine.

36:56.280 --> 37:00.280
So no one sort of tickling your fancy or your fancying them.

37:01.280 --> 37:02.280
What are the people saying, Britain, Linda?

37:02.280 --> 37:03.280
They say fancy?

37:03.280 --> 37:04.280
Oh, I fancy him.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.280
Yeah.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.280
But it's more, that's more, yeah.

37:07.280 --> 37:08.280
Sure.

37:08.280 --> 37:09.280
I guess.

37:09.280 --> 37:10.280
Especially a uni.

37:10.280 --> 37:11.280
Right.

37:11.280 --> 37:12.280
Yeah.

37:12.280 --> 37:13.280
That's like having a crush.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.280
And what we're talking about here is what you're saying is true love.

37:15.280 --> 37:16.280
Yeah.

37:16.280 --> 37:18.280
I'm saying I'm not looking for that right now.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.280
What do you want?

37:19.280 --> 37:20.280
You want to just have fun?

37:20.280 --> 37:21.280
You want to be alone forever.

37:21.280 --> 37:25.280
This is a really bad zoom date, man.

37:25.280 --> 37:27.280
You know what you want.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.280
It's the not answer these questions from you.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.280
Publicly.

37:31.280 --> 37:34.280
I can believe anything you don't want shown.

37:34.280 --> 37:37.280
I'm just trying to get to the crux of the episode.

37:37.280 --> 37:39.280
We haven't had that moment where it's like, there it is.

37:39.280 --> 37:40.280
You know what I mean?

37:40.280 --> 37:43.280
I think the last week I think it was it.

37:43.280 --> 37:45.280
So we should end it at 35.

37:45.280 --> 37:47.280
Whenever you said that would be funny if you ended it right there.

37:47.280 --> 37:48.280
Maybe we do that.

37:48.280 --> 37:50.280
Now it's a little, that was a little early.

37:50.280 --> 37:51.280
I was cutting it off a little earlier.

37:51.280 --> 37:52.280
Yeah.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.280
But then we can edit it quicker and get it done.

37:54.280 --> 37:55.280
Yeah.

37:55.280 --> 37:57.280
That's what we're talking about.

37:57.280 --> 37:58.280
Think about freezing eggs.

37:59.280 --> 38:02.280
Um, eggs aren't that expensive.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.280
I feel like just keep getting them every week.

38:04.280 --> 38:06.280
Eggs are pretty expensive.

38:13.280 --> 38:17.280
Um, you mean freezing over eggs?

38:17.280 --> 38:18.280
Yeah.

38:18.280 --> 38:23.280
I'm I'm pro because I think a lot of people have to change their life when they're not ready.

38:23.280 --> 38:26.280
But they know they want to have kids, but maybe not at 32.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.280
So what if you could do it at 49?

38:29.280 --> 38:31.280
What if you could do it at 80?

38:31.280 --> 38:32.280
Let's freeze them eggs.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.280
What?

38:33.280 --> 38:34.280
Yeah.

38:34.280 --> 38:35.280
Let's trim.

38:35.280 --> 38:36.280
Eight year olds can.

38:38.280 --> 38:39.280
What?

38:39.280 --> 38:41.280
That's what you sound like sometimes.

38:41.280 --> 38:43.280
When you hiccup specifically.

38:43.280 --> 38:44.280
Gardener is a common.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.280
It's going to be loud.

38:45.280 --> 38:46.280
It's going to be real.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.280
What you haven't done?

38:48.280 --> 38:52.280
Just like generally blowing weed, whack and.

38:52.280 --> 38:54.280
It's just slinging.

38:55.280 --> 38:58.280
Loudness creating a dog to be loud.

38:58.280 --> 39:02.280
Can I ask you how many times a week do your gardeners come?

39:02.280 --> 39:04.280
Uh, it's every other week.

39:04.280 --> 39:05.280
But there you go.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.280
That's what they should do.

39:07.280 --> 39:08.280
My old house.

39:08.280 --> 39:10.280
We lived below the landlords and.

39:10.280 --> 39:12.280
Every Thursday.

39:12.280 --> 39:14.280
Guy with a leaf lower.

39:14.280 --> 39:15.280
I'm like, there aren't enough.

39:15.280 --> 39:17.280
The seasons don't change in the city.

39:17.280 --> 39:21.280
You don't need someone to come in once a week.

39:22.280 --> 39:24.280
You need them to come twice a month.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.280
That most.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.280
Grace, let's hear from you about freezing eggs.

39:27.280 --> 39:29.280
Just look at the trees.

39:29.280 --> 39:30.280
Haven't.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.280
What else.

39:31.280 --> 39:33.280
I think about.

39:33.280 --> 39:36.280
You know, isn't it really expensive?

39:36.280 --> 39:37.280
Yeah.

39:37.280 --> 39:39.280
And that is the consideration too.

39:39.280 --> 39:40.280
Yeah.

39:40.280 --> 39:42.280
But maybe.

39:44.280 --> 39:46.280
That probably isn't covered by insurance.

39:46.280 --> 39:49.280
Let alone headgams insurance, which for the record is not good.

39:50.280 --> 39:52.280
Can I invoice for this too?

39:52.280 --> 39:53.280
I think so.

39:53.280 --> 39:54.280
Oh, fun.

39:54.280 --> 39:57.280
Also, are we doing double drive time for the headgum podcast going forward?

39:57.280 --> 40:01.280
Where it's like everybody who does it gets paid twice.

40:01.280 --> 40:05.280
For the hour because it's so hard for y'all for some reason.

40:05.280 --> 40:10.280
I can't stress how close this gardener is to my.

40:10.280 --> 40:13.280
My how he's six inches away from the wall and so my.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.280
I feel like I've never been closer.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.280
Can you tell what?

40:17.280 --> 40:19.280
No, I don't.

40:19.280 --> 40:21.280
I'm not.

40:21.280 --> 40:22.280
I'm not.

40:22.280 --> 40:23.280
No.

40:23.280 --> 40:24.280
No.

40:24.280 --> 40:26.280
Jeff, what would you do on Patreon?

40:26.280 --> 40:28.280
On Patreon for this show?

40:28.280 --> 40:29.280
Yeah.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.280
I would do like a mailbag.

40:30.280 --> 40:33.280
I would do like a one on one 60 minute.

40:33.280 --> 40:37.280
I'll think, you know, where I really take it to somebody's ass.

40:37.280 --> 40:42.280
I would do live streams where people could ask me anything.

40:42.280 --> 40:44.280
Maybe like.

40:44.280 --> 40:45.280
So why don't you?

40:45.280 --> 40:51.280
because I don't own the rights to the show, so to do that, we need Marty's approval.

40:51.280 --> 40:54.280
And so far, the budget's not there, even though.

40:54.280 --> 40:57.280
What do you do like a knockoff?

40:57.280 --> 40:59.280
You're a chair now.

40:59.280 --> 41:01.280
I forgot he had that sign.

41:01.280 --> 41:04.280
A knockoff of this show just on Patreon.

41:04.280 --> 41:06.280
I don't, I don't know how many people would subscribe to that.

41:06.280 --> 41:09.280
And also, they would maybe be like, you can't do that.

41:09.280 --> 41:10.280
That's the thing.

41:10.280 --> 41:14.280
Headgun likes to act like it's so creator friendly, but it's only creator friendly when they

41:14.280 --> 41:16.280
want to help the specific person.

41:16.280 --> 41:21.280
You don't they mean, they don't particularly care about my ass.

41:21.280 --> 41:24.280
They just don't want me to sue.

41:24.280 --> 41:28.280
This is the age I just don't want me to sue.

41:40.280 --> 41:46.280
That was a hit dumb original.

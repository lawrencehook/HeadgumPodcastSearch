WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
There we go.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
Now we have the energy inside.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
You're going good.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
You're going good.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Feeling amazing right now.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
There you go.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Played against me.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Yeah, I've been mad at the story over here.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
She's good for me.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
No, I'm not working here.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Okay.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
I've got nothing but time.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Yeah, it is late on a Monday.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Monday for PM.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
It's the Monday after Thanksgiving.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
So we're all kind of coming into this episode with like a little extra fat, right?

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
A little extra joy.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
And I'd like to ride that wave into the episode.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Yeah.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Yeah.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
It's just like today.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Yeah.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Yeah.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
That's the bigger story.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
It's not the Monday.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Yeah.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
It's your actual birthday.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
It might be the first one to say happy birthday job.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Yeah.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I'll be the third to say happy birthday.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
The first was actually Johnny.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Johnny works at that ago.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Yeah.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
And he texted me last night at 1140.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Okay.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
So too early, almost.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
He's wrong.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Yeah.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
That's true.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Then my mother was the first to say happy birthday.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
After midnight.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Yeah.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
midnight a class.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
She and night L.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Mm-hmm.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
She.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
I think she.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Two a.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
It's that.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Two a.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Yeah.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
She.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I wonder if she said in alarm for that or something.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
She must have.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Um.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Next to you.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
But we sweet.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
No.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I mean, it came from like family.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Very defensive.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I would say it was sweet.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
You took it.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Is it hard being a holiday baby?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Do you have a complex about that?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I don't like my birthday.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
That's why I wasn't burying the lead.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Oh.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
That's a nice.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Oh.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
You don't like that.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
It's November 28th or you don't like having a birthday.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I don't like the attention.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Interesting.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
When people ask me about you, I'm like he hates attention.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
That's like.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
No, that's the thing.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
I like other attention.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Okay.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
But on the birthday, you didn't do anything.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
It's too easy.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
So you want to earn it through your clothing and stuff.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
That's what it was overalls.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Yeah.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
And that's why I got a hair clip.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Right.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Right.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
I knew it was.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
It was covered in wine.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Look at that thing.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Stinks.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
No.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Your birthday is just that you didn't die that year.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
I don't know.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
I don't know.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
It is that you know people celebrating that you're a part of their life.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Yeah.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Right.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
But mostly I'm like celebrate me every other day.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
You know what I mean?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Okay.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
So you would you prepare.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
We just celebrated you every other day.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Except you're prepared.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
That's the one day off that we get where we go.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
It's like, oh my God.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Okay.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
We can start that now.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Monday after Thanksgiving is the worst birthday to have.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
It's like everyone's done with celebrating.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
It's really time to get back to work that you're like, today's my day now.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Right.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
She's just Christ.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Come on, man.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
It's better than having it on Thanksgiving though, which sometimes it is.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Mm-hmm.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Yeah.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
But at the same time then it's like everyone's thinking about Thanksgiving.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
And then I don't have to feel all these textures.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Which I appreciate you like that.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Yeah.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Okay.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Got it.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
It would be hard for me to have a predetermined dinner meal on my birthday.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
That's true.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
That's Thanksgiving dinner.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Because Thanksgiving dinner is not good to eat.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
That's it.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I like it.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Me too.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
I like it every day.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
It's just good.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
That's all I'm here by the way.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
What is this?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
The five timers club?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Um.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Is it the five timers club?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I think it's the four timers club.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Which is a bigger deal than the five timers club.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
I think so.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
You know, I'm not sure.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I will say I think it was the first sort of outside guest on this podcast.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Yeah.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
That's true.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Just for my keeping tabs from distance.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Other guests have passed me a number.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Probably since then.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
But I'm still the first.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
No one can take that away from me.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
I think you're the four times.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Really?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Four times are a non-employee.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Right.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
And I don't, I'm not an employee.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Yeah.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Yeah.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Maybe five times.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
That's the five.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
You are one year contract.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
That's amazing.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Cart Blanche access to do anything you want with the company.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Any thing you want to go on anything.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Literally anything.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
You could be an accountant or a toilet.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
You could do whatever you want.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I'm not going to pick yet.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Okay.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Because I guess I have some time to think.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
But I believe in CEO.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
If anything is on the table.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
That sucks for.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
I know.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Yeah.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
The current CEO.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Yeah.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
I think.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Because Marty really hangs his hat on.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
That's his whole identity.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
That's his identity.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Right.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
It's his personality.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Totally.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm not even doing a bit.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
I'd like to take that away from him would be devastated.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
It sounds like it'd be helpful.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
People should contain multitudes.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
They should be more than just their job.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
So it's like, okay.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Now live your job.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
You'd be something else.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
I'd be you.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Yeah.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
He could be me.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
So it's sort of a freaky Friday that happens.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I'm so sorry.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
I got it.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Okay.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Then this five timers thinks that's amazing.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I can't wait for that episode.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
This is real or not.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
This is for.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Let's focus on the moment.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
It's sort of a smaller deal.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
It is 4 p.m.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Which in the LA office no one's around.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Like you don't work out of the office most days, right?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Twice a week.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Maybe even honestly sometimes a little less than that.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
I haven't been in it a couple weeks.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
And have you ever stayed past 4 p.m.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Only if I have to.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Exactly.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Like for live shows.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Yeah.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
For live shows and stuff.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
We run like an elementary school schedule, basically.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Like we get here at 7.30 a.m.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Yeah.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
No, we don't.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
No, we don't.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
But then we're out of here at 2.30.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Correct.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yeah.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
I like that.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
So the back half is very elementary school style.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Yeah.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
And the front half is.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I try to get here by noon.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
So you're for two and a half hours.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
It's like a New York brunch beginning into an elementary school.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Goodbye.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
I'm going to love working here.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
I mean, you'll dictate the hours for the CEO.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
You're making so much noise.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
It's just like.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
A normal amount of.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Sorry.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
I know it's hard when it's your birthday.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Right.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
People are just wondering if you're laptop.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
A normal day's texts stress me out.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
And that's only like four.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Yeah.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
So that's another reason why I don't like.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
But I appreciate the sentiment.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
But it's.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Can we get account too many notifications?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I mean, I've read a lot of them.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
So I don't know what the count is.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
But you could see on the eye message.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Just how many.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
You want to see how many people have texted me today?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Yeah.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
That's what I said by the count.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Okay.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
He's scrolling books.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
He is scrolling.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
This is cool.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
This is not just like a.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
You know, I thought it'd be like.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
All right.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
There's not people.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Oh.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
He wished you have a birthday.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
How does he know your birthday?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
We like really hit it off.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
This was like the really did.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
When you would give the lift driver your birthday.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
When you would sort of really talk to them and bear your birthday.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Okay.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
That's a mustache in the front.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
And you used to sit shotgun.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
And then you say my birthday.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
So what do we have?

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
Just because I'm listing names doesn't give you license to like talk over me and shit.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
It is my birthday.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
We weren't.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
I got something else.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000

Damn.

And Marie Cabrondley.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Billy Scafiri beat me in fan duel by point four points the other night.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
I want to talk to you about that on this show.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Okay.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Good.

08:35.000 --> 08:35.500
What did it come down to?

08:35.500 --> 08:36.500
It was really sad.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.500
It was really sad.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.500
Turn over.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.500
Jeremy's so hand got injured.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.500
That's what it was.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.500
Pretty easily.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.500
I think.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.500
The viewership of this is really exciting.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.500
I'm scared.

08:45.500 --> 08:46.500
Spurs.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.500
Ricky.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.500
Jeremy.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.500
He's from Poland.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.500
He's sort of as a dentist.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.500
He's very cool.

08:51.500 --> 08:52.500
He's got a cool vibe.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.500
He has actually.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.500
You were talking about buzzing your hair and dying at pink.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.500
Yeah.

08:57.500 --> 08:58.500
Jeremy pulled the trigger.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.500
But he's wearing 10 on the spurs, which is what Dennis Rodman used.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.500
He's running a lapse around you, my man.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.500
That's right.

09:04.500 --> 09:08.500
I think this is kind of an interesting rooster-esque way to where you're hair.

09:08.500 --> 09:09.500
For now.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.500
Okay.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.500
For now.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.500
What do you think I should do?

09:12.500 --> 09:14.500
With your hair?

09:14.500 --> 09:15.500
Hmm.

09:15.500 --> 09:16.500
I'll think about it.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.500
Okay.

09:17.500 --> 09:21.500
Last time I talked to you in this office, you'd gone a date.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.500
Ooh.

09:22.500 --> 09:23.500
How's that going?

09:23.500 --> 09:24.500
Dude.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.500
It's already over.

09:25.500 --> 09:26.500
What?

09:26.500 --> 09:27.500
No.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.500
Was it the COVID?

09:28.500 --> 09:29.500
No.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.500
The COVID was not related.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.500
It just, you know, it's just...

09:34.500 --> 09:35.500
These things.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.500
Sometimes these things...

09:36.500 --> 09:38.500
It doesn't go that way.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.500
Sometimes these things don't go our ways.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.500
Wow.

09:41.500 --> 09:42.500
You're in a relationship.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.500
Yeah.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.500
I love that this podcast.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.500
I've never seen this side of you.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.500
Or you're sort of getting into, like,

09:46.500 --> 09:48.500
love lines, style, like,

09:48.500 --> 09:49.500
who's dating, who?

09:49.500 --> 09:50.500
Yeah.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.500
Like, this is cool.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.500
Well, thought it was just fantasy basketball.

09:53.500 --> 09:54.500
Failing fantasy.

09:54.500 --> 09:55.500
Yeah.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.500
Birthday neighbor with Jason.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.500
Yeah.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.500
And then it ends.

09:59.500 --> 10:00.500
Oh, no.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.500
This is amazing.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.500
Yeah.

10:02.500 --> 10:03.500
Yeah.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.500
We had Sally Dar Griffin on the show.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.500
You know who that is?

10:05.500 --> 10:06.500
TikTok star.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.500
Okay.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.500
Yeah.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.500
And like, she always talks about date she goes on.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.500
Okay.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.500
So we kind of have this mini segment called dating in LA.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.500
Oh.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.500
And, uh, because I feel like if people on the internet

10:16.500 --> 10:18.500
always don't want to know about internet

10:18.500 --> 10:22.500
personalities dating in Los Angeles,

10:22.500 --> 10:23.500
you're dating in Los Angeles.

10:23.500 --> 10:24.500
Right.

10:24.500 --> 10:25.500
I don't think I've edited that personality,

10:25.500 --> 10:26.500
but...

10:26.500 --> 10:27.500
Yeah.

10:27.500 --> 10:28.500
Kind of a R.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.500
You're the most requested guest on the show.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.500
God.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.500
You're saying...

10:33.500 --> 10:34.500
I'm sorry.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.500
I don't know what you're really, but you suck.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.500
Yeah.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.500
I got to get that in the way.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.500
Um, were we talking?

10:41.500 --> 10:42.500
Yes.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.500
I bit early.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.500
What is it?

10:44.500 --> 10:45.500
It's the corner of...

10:45.500 --> 10:46.500
Okay.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.500
Yeah.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.500
So your sort of yours thoughts to my feed thing is

10:50.500 --> 10:51.500
doxing me.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.500
I show big as you genuinely doxing.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.500
All of it is done heads.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.500
We're going to show it.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.500
Yeah.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.500
Okay.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.500
Wait.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.500
Wait.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.500
What are you doing for you?

11:00.500 --> 11:01.500
Yeah.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.500
We just want to say hi.

11:03.500 --> 11:06.500
Notice I didn't like a tweet of mine three years ago.

11:06.500 --> 11:10.500
Also, there was kind of a lot to cover.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.500
Yeah.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.500
You've been pretty prominent on Twitter.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.500
Twitter's going belly up.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.500
I don't think I have been prominent on Twitter.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.500
You've gone viral?

11:18.500 --> 11:19.500
I've gone...

11:19.500 --> 11:22.500
I go viral, but does it really translate into me, like,

11:22.500 --> 11:24.500
kind of go viral?

11:24.500 --> 11:26.500
I guess lost in the shuffle.

11:26.500 --> 11:27.500
Yeah.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.500
I talked to you guys about it.

11:28.500 --> 11:32.500
There's a funnel that's, like, engagement likes retweets new followers.

11:32.500 --> 11:37.500
And it really is like 10% of 10% of 10% of 10% by the time you reach that last one,

11:37.500 --> 11:39.500
it's like four new followers.

11:39.500 --> 11:40.500
Yeah.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.500
And you start to think, was it worth?

11:41.500 --> 11:42.500
Totally.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.500
Yeah.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.500
I definitely worth it.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.500
Years ago, I have started telling myself a story, which is just, like,

11:47.500 --> 11:49.500
who needs more followers?

11:49.500 --> 11:50.500
Yeah.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.500
Which of course, I'd like more followers.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.500
And it's also, I tell myself a thing of, like,

11:53.500 --> 11:54.500
well, I'm not selling out.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.500
You know what I mean?

11:55.500 --> 11:59.500
I've got posting a ton, posting memes, trying to get in the thing.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.500
You're not playing the game.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.500
That's why I don't have more followers.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.500
It's like, maybe.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.500
You don't think it's accurate about a followers that I deserve.

12:07.500 --> 12:12.500
Your Instagram is just photos of a Dell background of a beach.

12:12.500 --> 12:13.500
But that, I don't...

12:13.500 --> 12:15.500
That I have way less followers.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.500
That's even worse.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.500
I'm falling apart.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.500
But again, I'm not seeking the followers, but I'm in hurt.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.500
Yeah.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.500
I mean, everyone is passively seeking followers.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.500
Right.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.500
But yeah, how do I feel about Twitter's demands?

12:27.500 --> 12:31.500
I mean, it seems to still exist, so I don't know.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.500
But I mean, I, when it seemed like it was going to die,

12:34.500 --> 12:35.500
I was kind of excited.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.500
Yeah.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.500
I thought it would have been nice of it died.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.500
I agree.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.500
I would have, like, I have more time to do other stuff.

12:41.500 --> 12:44.500
The, one of the last things I tweeted was a photo of my ass.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.500
I don't know if you say that.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.500
I saw that. Yeah.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.500
That was cool.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.500
So I was...

12:48.500 --> 12:50.500
What do I, what are you supposed to say?

12:50.500 --> 12:52.500
Sorry.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.500
And, well, what are your genuine thoughts on my ass?

12:55.500 --> 12:56.500
On your ass?

12:56.500 --> 12:57.500
It's great.

12:57.500 --> 12:58.500
Yeah.

12:58.500 --> 12:59.500
Strong.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.500
Big.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.500
I don't know.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.500
I'm like such a bad ass.

13:04.500 --> 13:07.500
You know, and so for me, the bar is lower than that ass.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.500
Yeah.

13:08.500 --> 13:12.500
But I'm very, you know, it's just nothing going on back there.

13:12.500 --> 13:16.500
It wouldn't like impress whenever I see stuff happening back there.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.500
It really would have been ideal timing for me.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.500
Because that would have been, I think at the time that he bought it,

13:21.500 --> 13:22.500
yeah, I posted it.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.500
Look, that's what put him over the edge to buy it.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.500
He's like, wow.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.500
Look at this.

13:26.500 --> 13:27.500
The content.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.500
Yeah.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.500
Unbelievable.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.500
All right.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.500
Did you see my ass?

13:31.500 --> 13:32.500
I did.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.500
What did you think?

13:33.500 --> 13:34.500
That's off.

13:34.500 --> 13:35.500
Yeah.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.500
Good for you.

13:36.500 --> 13:37.500
Thanks.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.500
Thanks.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.500
That was good.

13:39.500 --> 13:40.500
But yeah.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.500
Let's talk about dating in LA.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.500
You've been gainfully in a relationship for the better part of a decade.

13:44.500 --> 13:45.500
No.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.500
Right.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.500
Little less than that.

13:47.500 --> 13:48.500
Yeah.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.500
Two years.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.500
Yeah.

13:51.500 --> 13:52.500
Let's round up.

13:52.500 --> 13:53.500
Let's round up.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.500
I need to go.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.500
I'll get four.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.500
Let's say four.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.500
I'll change.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.500
Because you knew her before you started dating.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.500
That's true.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.500
But we were at a relationship then.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.500
You were laying the ground.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.500
It wasn't.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.500
I wasn't.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.500
I need to say for the record that I was not.

14:07.500 --> 14:08.500
All right.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.500
Four years.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.500
Yep.

14:10.500 --> 14:11.500
Okay.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.500
What is it like dating in a relationship?

14:13.500 --> 14:14.500
Yeah.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.500
Being in a relationship dating active.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.500
Because you never want to stop dating your partner.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.500
No.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.500
Yeah.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.500
What's your experience dating?

14:22.500 --> 14:23.500
Yeah.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.500
I mean, it's though.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.500
Thank you for asking me about this.

14:26.500 --> 14:31.500
It's, you know, it's feels similar to dating other places for me.

14:31.500 --> 14:34.500
Because again, it's just the real one relationship.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.500
Yeah.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.500
A few years.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.500
So it's just kind of hanging out with each other.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.500
Going to restaurants.

14:39.500 --> 14:40.500
You go to the movies a lot.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.500
I want restaurants.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.500
I think that's what people get interested in.

14:43.500 --> 14:46.500
How often are you at like found oyster?

14:46.500 --> 14:47.500
Right.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.500
You, we have gone on a date to found oyster before.

14:50.500 --> 14:51.500
I think that's.

14:51.500 --> 14:52.500
And now oysters really good.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.500
Yeah.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.500
I don't really like oysters.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.500
But there's, you were talking about the lonely oysters.

14:56.500 --> 14:57.500
There's Eleneo oysters.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.500
There's just a lot of oysters going around.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.500
Elenees like one of my favorite restaurants.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.500
I, because it's an average yak, right?

15:02.500 --> 15:04.500
So you have to understand that like red wine and that.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.500
You can't help but end up in the sack.

15:06.500 --> 15:07.500
No, you have to understand.

15:07.500 --> 15:08.500
Yeah.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.500
You have to.

15:10.500 --> 15:13.500
You really literally have to understand that.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.500
Is there anything there other than oysters?

15:15.500 --> 15:16.500
Are you just getting oysters?

15:17.500 --> 15:19.500
I'm going to call from around in a numbers.

15:19.500 --> 15:20.500
Yeah.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.500
This is never happened on the show.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.500
Hello.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.500
You don't want to pause speaker.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.500
I think this is more interesting.

15:26.500 --> 15:27.500
Because we only hear one side.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.500
Yeah.

15:32.500 --> 15:33.500
Yeah.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.500
Well, this was probably how you became friends with that lift drive.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.500
It's not that part does make a long run.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.500
Yeah.

15:39.500 --> 15:40.500
I don't know how to describe it.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.500
It's.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.500
Tell that you.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.500
Okay.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.500
Thank you.

15:53.500 --> 15:54.500
You didn't do it.

15:54.500 --> 15:55.500
You didn't seem happy.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.500
You didn't do it.

15:56.500 --> 15:59.500
There was two times on that call where he was like.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.500
Damn.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.500
He was just not where you wanted him to.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.500
Got it.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.500
So it's sort of a light prank wouldn't have been good.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.500
I, he seemed really exasperated.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.500
So I think if I'd been like, by the way,

16:09.500 --> 16:10.500
it's my birthday.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.500
So really, I need this package.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.500
It was an Amazon package, which I had going to,

16:14.500 --> 16:15.500
I don't know.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.500
The only thing I order for Amazon is like utility things.

16:17.500 --> 16:18.500
Like I drops.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.500
Hmm.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.500
Um, what the hell were we talking about before?

16:21.500 --> 16:22.500
Oh, the found oyster, right?

16:22.500 --> 16:24.500
So like, what are the dating spots?

16:24.500 --> 16:25.500
Because you're talking.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.500
When you were in the color,

16:26.500 --> 16:29.500
we're talking about like, like sort of the looseness of the podcast.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.500
Right.

16:30.500 --> 16:31.500
Now.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.500
Well, the other thing is we've been, we've been banking episodes.

16:33.500 --> 16:34.500
All in October.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.500
We haven't recorded in four weeks.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.500
Got it.

16:36.500 --> 16:37.500
So I'm like off my gamer.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.500
Okay.

16:38.500 --> 16:39.500
Got it.

16:39.500 --> 16:40.500
Okay.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.500
So maybe we can help you kind of tighten back up a little bit and get back

16:42.500 --> 16:43.500
in the swing of things.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.500
Why did you want to record on your birthday specifically?

16:45.500 --> 16:47.500
Because this one was scheduled way in advance.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.500
I thought it was going to be like a birthday spectacular.

16:49.500 --> 16:50.500
Yeah.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.500
Me too.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.500
But now it's just like, you didn't even want to address it.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.500
This could have been a Tuesday recording.

16:55.500 --> 16:59.500
You just asking us about a restaurant that I went to like a year ago.

16:59.500 --> 17:02.500
I was like, I don't know what I'm supposed to say about it.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.500
I already said it was good.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.500
I thought like a food reviewing podcast.

17:06.500 --> 17:07.500
Yeah.

17:07.500 --> 17:08.500
No.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.500
I'm confused.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.500
I just thought it would be something nice to do.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.500
It's a Monday, right?

17:13.500 --> 17:14.500
And it's late.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.500
We also need the episode to go out this Friday.

17:17.500 --> 17:21.500
So I was like, I'd rather have more time to edit it tomorrow.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.500
I see.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.500
And last week was a holiday.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.500
My thing going into it wasn't a birthday spectacular.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.500
It was more for me to be like,

17:29.500 --> 17:31.500
I don't have to do anything.

17:31.500 --> 17:35.500
I could, I could, I could not talk for this whole hour.

17:35.500 --> 17:36.500
The opposite.

17:36.500 --> 17:39.500
But no time and effort into it.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.500
I see.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.500
You know, you get will feel bad.

17:42.500 --> 17:43.500
Calling you out.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.500
You can't say anything to me today.

17:45.500 --> 17:46.500
Right.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.500
Although you did say I suck.

17:48.500 --> 17:49.500
Right.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.500
So you're getting right to the point that I did.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.500
Yeah, but you can say that if you start out with,

17:53.500 --> 17:54.500
I know it's your birthday.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.500
Yeah.

17:55.500 --> 17:56.500
Exactly.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.500
Wrong.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.500
Ali, let's get into you.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.500
Okay.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.500
I want you to open up on the show.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.500
Okay.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.500
Say things that you'll kind of be driving home and be like,

18:06.500 --> 18:07.500
I was kind of personal.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.500
I feel like every day anyway.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.500
That's fair.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.500
That's cool.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.500
What's like a secret you feel comfortable with your.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.500
But yourself or someone close to you is.

18:18.500 --> 18:19.500
Oh, man.

18:19.500 --> 18:20.500
Secret.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.500
You can't put someone on the spot.

18:22.500 --> 18:23.500
It's like weird.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.500
You're weird.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.500
You're weird.

18:25.500 --> 18:26.500
It's weird.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.500
I understand what you're saying.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.500
I don't have very many.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.500
I don't really think I even have very many secrets.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.500
I think at least one person.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.500
I've told.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.500
I remember an open book.

18:35.500 --> 18:36.500
Yeah.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.500
Right, but a secret can be something that you share.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.500
Like, uh.

18:41.500 --> 18:42.500
Well, okay, right.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.500
When I was 18.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.500
But no, that's too impressive.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.500
Wow.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.500
When I was 18, I had to go see yourologist.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.500
Okay.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.500
And he gave me the steroid cream.

18:50.500 --> 18:54.500
And because I had a sexual encounter with somebody.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.500
Where my dick had been broken, basically.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.500
And you and I knew each other at that point.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.500
Yeah, but we didn't talk about this.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.500
I know.

19:02.500 --> 19:03.500
That's what I'm saying.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.500
Like, that was the secret I'd kept from everyone.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.500
This is all was a creep.

19:06.500 --> 19:10.500
That I was supposed to use as I pleased.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.500
Okay.

19:11.500 --> 19:12.500
And it fixed the issue.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.500
As you pleased.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.500
Myself.

19:15.500 --> 19:19.500
So, so.

19:19.500 --> 19:22.500
I mean, can I ask you more questions about what happened?

19:22.500 --> 19:24.500
I guess I don't want to pry.

19:24.500 --> 19:25.500
Yeah.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.500
I mean, I don't want to get to graphic.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.500
The last thing I want to do is like.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.500
Be.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.500
Crass on the show.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.500
Right.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.500
You talk about breaking your dick and using a cream.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.500
I think you brought up.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.500
But you're in a court.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.500
Yeah.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.500
Yeah.

19:38.500 --> 19:39.500
That's true.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.500
So we knew each other.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.500
We knew each other.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.500
You didn't bring this up to me at the time.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.500
I think I was embarrassed.

19:44.500 --> 19:45.500
Right.

19:45.500 --> 19:46.500
I'm 18 years old.

19:46.500 --> 19:47.500
I'm at the neurologist.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.500
That doesn't happen to anyone.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.500
No, life happens fast.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.500
Yes.

19:51.500 --> 19:52.500
I'll be happy.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.500
I mean, it was kind of from like a cool, like, you know,

19:54.500 --> 19:57.500
not cool, but like you were having sex.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.500
Yeah.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.500
Sex really.

19:59.500 --> 20:00.500
That's true.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.500
That's true.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.500
It wasn't it impact your life.

20:03.500 --> 20:04.500
Actually, the person.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.500
You know the person.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.500
Oh, my God.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.500
Yeah.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.500
That's crazy.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.500
Well, you definitely shouldn't say who it was, but I'm really curious.

20:12.500 --> 20:16.500
Are you going to bleep it out?

20:16.500 --> 20:17.500
I'll bleep it out.

20:17.500 --> 20:18.500
Yeah.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.500
At least now you know.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.500
You know your penis.

20:20.500 --> 20:21.500
In a way.

20:21.500 --> 20:22.500
Yeah.

20:22.500 --> 20:23.500
I didn't even tell her.

20:23.500 --> 20:24.500
You didn't.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.500
You just cut that inside?

20:26.500 --> 20:27.500
Mm-hmm.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.500
I have a lot of questions.

20:30.500 --> 20:31.500
You want to answer them.

20:31.500 --> 20:32.500
Okay.

20:32.500 --> 20:33.500
Did.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.500
Did you continue your encounter?

20:35.500 --> 20:36.500
Yeah.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.500
Okay.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.500
Did that really hurt?

20:38.500 --> 20:39.500
Yeah.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.500
Oh my God.

20:41.500 --> 20:44.500
I can't imagine a cream helping like a muscle's right.

20:44.500 --> 20:45.500
That's what's confusing me.

20:45.500 --> 20:46.500
Yeah.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.500
Yeah.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.500
Again.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.500
I was like, here's a steroid ointment.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.500
Yeah.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.500
It didn't look like a cap in half.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.500
I don't know what you guys are picture.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.500
Yeah.

20:56.500 --> 20:59.500
I think the remedy is like a popsicle stick in some strength.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.500
I'm kind of like, yeah.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.500
Okay.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.500
Making sure a plant grows vertically.

21:05.500 --> 21:06.500
Yeah.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.500
Making sure you can corner something.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.500
Yeah.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.500
More than you usually do.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.500
The muscle was fine.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.500
The skin was not so scary.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.500
So scary.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.500
Did you finish?

21:19.500 --> 21:20.500
Excuse me.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.500
Yeah.

21:22.500 --> 21:25.500
It was a topical steroid ointment.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.500
Okay.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.500
It seemed like a chafing dermatological issue more than a...

21:28.500 --> 21:29.500
Erologist.

21:29.500 --> 21:30.500
Yeah.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.500
It was like the same brook as you did.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.500
At what point would you say I'm back baby?

21:35.500 --> 21:36.500
Like it was...

21:36.500 --> 21:38.500
I love what were you like I back to a hundred percent.

21:38.500 --> 21:41.500
I think I had sex four weeks after that because it was New Year's Eve.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.500
Yeah.

21:42.500 --> 21:43.500
You got it.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.500
Well weeks after that.

21:45.500 --> 21:46.500
Yeah.

21:46.500 --> 21:47.500
Interesting.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.500
But we're saying you were back at that point.

21:49.500 --> 21:50.500
Now it's all flooding back to you.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.500
You're at the same party that this happened.

21:52.500 --> 21:53.500
Must have been a Halloween party.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.500
I was at the party with the dick skin.

21:55.500 --> 21:56.500
No, no.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.500
This happened after years.

21:58.500 --> 21:59.500
No.

21:59.500 --> 22:00.500
Halloween to New Year's.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.500
Why is it too much?

22:01.500 --> 22:04.500
I was supposed to talk about Ali the night of the night of the night of the

22:04.500 --> 22:05.500
night of the had hung out.

22:05.500 --> 22:07.500
It was at your apartment.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.500
It was at my apartment.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.500
It was at my apartment.

22:09.500 --> 22:10.500
Yeah.

22:10.500 --> 22:11.500
Your senior year.

22:11.500 --> 22:12.500
You would hung...

22:12.500 --> 22:13.500
That had...

22:13.500 --> 22:14.500
Okay.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.500
And that sort of proceeded what happened.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.500
Yeah.

22:16.500 --> 22:17.500
That's very crazy.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.500
Green fleece.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.500
Because I remember there was a photo of it.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.500
I was wearing a party hat.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.500
Wow.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.500
Well thank you for sharing that with me.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.500
I think that's really...

22:24.500 --> 22:25.500
Do you...

22:25.500 --> 22:27.500
Are you like that's the fleece I broke.

22:27.500 --> 22:30.500
I don't have the same fleece anymore.

22:30.500 --> 22:31.500
Oh.

22:31.500 --> 22:35.500
All this to say we can participate in a shared vulnerability.

22:35.500 --> 22:36.500
We can sort it.

22:36.500 --> 22:39.500
That was just to open the floor for you to share a secret.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.500
Okay.

22:40.500 --> 22:41.500
I really...

22:41.500 --> 22:43.500
It doesn't have to be steroidal in nature.

22:43.500 --> 22:44.500
All right.

22:44.500 --> 22:45.500
Well, there was this one time.

22:45.500 --> 22:49.500
It was like four weeks before New Year's.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.500
And I broke my dad.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.500
Oh my God.

22:52.500 --> 22:53.500
That's yeah.

22:53.500 --> 22:54.500
And that's got to be very cool.

22:54.500 --> 22:55.500
The Doctor King.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.500
Yeah.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.500
Was this 2015?

22:57.500 --> 22:58.500
Yeah.

22:58.500 --> 22:59.500
Damn.

22:59.500 --> 23:02.500
Can you believe we broke our decks on the same night?

23:02.500 --> 23:03.500
So crazy.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.500
Like that's why you guys got...

23:05.500 --> 23:06.500
Yeah.

23:06.500 --> 23:10.500
That's really crazy.

23:10.500 --> 23:11.500
Yeah.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.500
We have to get some of the sort of...

23:13.500 --> 23:14.500
Awesome.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.500
We have to take a break and then we have so much more to get to.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.500
We haven't gotten into any of the things that I had prepared.

23:19.500 --> 23:20.500
Yeah, I wonder.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.500
You wonder what...

23:21.500 --> 23:30.500
What it could be.

23:30.500 --> 23:31.500
Guys, we're coming up on the holidays.

23:31.500 --> 23:32.500
The happiest season, right?

23:32.500 --> 23:34.500
Well, let's be real.

23:34.500 --> 23:39.500
Between hectic holiday travel, stressing over getting that family recipe just right.

23:39.500 --> 23:43.500
And dealing with that uncle's politics that are just wrong.

23:43.500 --> 23:47.500
The last thing you want to worry about is finding a great gift for everyone on your list.

23:47.500 --> 23:54.500
When the spirit of giving, I'm sharing my go-to gift idea premium audio products from Raycon.

23:54.500 --> 24:00.500
Raycon's wireless earbuds, headphones and speakers offer premium sound, useful features,

24:00.500 --> 24:06.500
and almost custom comfortable fit and up to 54 hours of battery life.

24:06.500 --> 24:08.500
Again, 54 hours of battery life.

24:08.500 --> 24:12.500
That is a lot more than the other leading audio brands.

24:12.500 --> 24:15.500
Anyone you give them to will find a use for them right away.

24:15.500 --> 24:20.500
Whether they use their speakers to start a party in the living room or escape the party completely

24:20.500 --> 24:23.500
and use the earbuds for some much needed Zen meditation.

24:23.500 --> 24:30.500
And as the person gifting them, you've got to love that they start at half the price of other premium audio brands.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.500
I've said this before.

24:31.500 --> 24:32.500
I'll say it again.

24:32.500 --> 24:37.500
I use my Raycon wireless earbuds for my hot girl walks.

24:37.500 --> 24:40.500
And they really are a comfortable fit.

24:40.500 --> 24:43.500
Whether you're staying active, rock climbing because they fit better.

24:43.500 --> 24:46.500
They don't fall out when you hit the mat, right?

24:46.500 --> 24:48.500
They don't fall out when you're on your little wall.

24:48.500 --> 24:53.500
It's rocking up public staircases, daunting a little bit moving your hips because you don't have

24:53.500 --> 24:55.500
a good body control.

24:55.500 --> 25:00.500
And they don't fall out like other premium audio brand earbuds have in my life.

25:00.500 --> 25:06.500
And for the next month, Raycon will have a countdown to Christmas with a new pop-up flash deal

25:06.500 --> 25:09.500

Thanks Raycon.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.500
Okay.

25:57.500 --> 26:02.500
Let's take it into everyone's bonds of the week.

26:02.500 --> 26:06.500
Yeah.

26:06.500 --> 26:11.500
I think that James Bond is like an action adventure series that is a little more sophisticated.

26:11.500 --> 26:12.500
Right?

26:12.500 --> 26:15.500
There's the clothes, there's the cars, there's the one.

26:15.500 --> 26:16.500
Yes.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.500
You know, you think that.

26:18.500 --> 26:19.500
Go on, sorry.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.500
That's something I've been doing with.

26:21.500 --> 26:22.500
Right.

26:22.500 --> 26:29.500
And what other IP does it take a certain level of intelligence to understand?

26:30.500 --> 26:32.500
Pickle rack.

26:32.500 --> 26:33.500
Right?

26:33.500 --> 26:34.500
What's that?

26:34.500 --> 26:35.500
Who?

26:35.500 --> 26:36.500
Rick and Morty.

26:36.500 --> 26:39.500
I think you have to be really smart to get those jokes.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.500
I don't think so.

26:41.500 --> 26:44.500
Really pretty broad and immature.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.500
Yeah.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.500
I like 11 year old cousin loves that.

26:47.500 --> 26:48.500
Right.

26:48.500 --> 26:49.500
Okay.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.500
Because I was going to say Rick and Morty could be James Bond.

26:51.500 --> 26:52.500
Both of them.

26:52.500 --> 26:53.500
Oh, yeah.

26:53.500 --> 26:54.500
Yeah.

26:54.500 --> 26:55.500
Okay.

26:55.500 --> 26:56.500
But you didn't know.

26:56.500 --> 26:57.500
It's like.

26:57.500 --> 26:58.500
Pickle rack.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.500
That's not everybody.

27:00.500 --> 27:04.500
You have to have read a couple books to understand that.

27:04.500 --> 27:07.500
Like comic books about Rick and Morty.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.500
I don't know.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.500
Like naked lunch.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.500
Okay.

27:11.500 --> 27:12.500
It's interesting.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.500
We're talking about the ways the podcast has changed when you're on the phone earlier.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.500
And it's on the podcast.

27:17.500 --> 27:18.500
I like that.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.500
You know, this segment is still happening.

27:20.500 --> 27:21.500
Yeah.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.500
But other things are changed.

27:23.500 --> 27:24.500
Yeah.

27:24.500 --> 27:25.500
Five of change.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.500
But we're still doing the bond of the week always.

27:27.500 --> 27:28.500
We're doing these in studio more.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.500
It's always harder for me to be an utter asshole.

27:30.500 --> 27:31.500
Right.

27:31.500 --> 27:32.500
And I'm looking someone dead in the air.

27:32.500 --> 27:33.500
That makes sense.

27:33.500 --> 27:34.500
That makes sense.

27:34.500 --> 27:35.500
You got.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.500
So you don't.

27:36.500 --> 27:39.500
So you don't have to be smart to get Rick and Morty.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.500
No.

27:40.500 --> 27:41.500
No.

27:41.500 --> 27:42.500
It's Dan Harmon.

27:42.500 --> 27:43.500
I think.

27:43.500 --> 27:44.500
I think.

27:44.500 --> 27:46.500
I don't want to be smart to write Rick and Morty.

27:46.500 --> 27:47.500
Yeah.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.500
Like Grace Freud.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.500
Sure.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.500
But you don't have to be smart to enjoy Rick and Morty.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.500
But that's what everybody says.

27:53.500 --> 27:54.500
Who says?

27:54.500 --> 27:56.500
Everybody's like, everybody who watches Rick and Morty is like,

27:56.500 --> 27:58.500
it's really smart humor.

27:58.500 --> 28:01.500
So I've just taken that as gospel.

28:01.500 --> 28:02.500
I don't watch the show.

28:02.500 --> 28:03.500
Okay.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.500
So how did you know the pickle Rick?

28:05.500 --> 28:06.500
Yeah.

28:06.500 --> 28:07.500
Because you see that on Twitter.

28:07.500 --> 28:08.500
And for the longest time was like,

28:08.500 --> 28:09.500
What is that?

28:09.500 --> 28:10.500
I don't know why is that funny.

28:10.500 --> 28:13.500
I guess I'm just too dumb to get it.

28:13.500 --> 28:14.500
Okay.

28:14.500 --> 28:15.500
Why is that old man?

28:15.500 --> 28:16.500
So you're earning into a pickle.

28:16.500 --> 28:19.500
You want to believe that the show is too smart.

28:19.500 --> 28:20.500
I don't explain why you don't.

28:20.500 --> 28:22.500
When I've seen it, I don't laugh.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.500
So I don't know.

28:23.500 --> 28:24.500
So I must be too dumb.

28:24.500 --> 28:25.500
Right.

28:25.500 --> 28:26.500
That's what people told me.

28:26.500 --> 28:27.500
I got it.

28:27.500 --> 28:28.500
Would they trade off?

28:28.500 --> 28:30.500
Being James Bond or would it just be like,

28:30.500 --> 28:31.500
There's two James Bond's.

28:31.500 --> 28:34.500
Well, that's, it's like, I don't think like scientists.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.500
Yeah.

28:35.500 --> 28:36.500
So they could be.

28:36.500 --> 28:37.500
You brought this up.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.500
Like, I don't even know the show.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.500
You brought it up.

28:40.500 --> 28:41.500
What are you so mad?

28:41.500 --> 28:42.500
That's my bond of the week.

28:42.500 --> 28:43.500
That's my bond of the week.

28:43.500 --> 28:44.500
What are your guys?

28:44.500 --> 28:45.500
Okay.

28:45.500 --> 28:46.500
All right.

28:46.500 --> 28:50.500
I have been watching to make myself fall asleep at night.

28:50.500 --> 28:51.500
Murder, she wrote.

28:51.500 --> 28:52.500
Yeah.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.500
So Angela landsbury's hologram.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.500
That's pretty good.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.500
Yeah.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.500
Like, just digital.

28:57.500 --> 28:58.500
Just put her in the shot.

28:58.500 --> 29:02.500
And you don't think that's like too much to digest.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.500
Like, there's a new plot line storyline.

29:04.500 --> 29:07.500
Ray finds his M. Judy dunches out.

29:07.500 --> 29:08.500
And then.

29:08.500 --> 29:13.500
Is it acknowledged that she's a hologram or the hologram is the actor playing

29:13.500 --> 29:14.500
bomb?

29:14.500 --> 29:15.500
She, it's acknowledged that she's a hologram.

29:15.500 --> 29:17.500
And that's almost what makes her job hard.

29:17.500 --> 29:18.500
It's hard.

29:18.500 --> 29:19.500
So it means like,

29:19.500 --> 29:21.500
There's really some benefits.

29:21.500 --> 29:22.500
You shoot a hologram.

29:22.500 --> 29:23.500
You're fine.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.500
That's that'll help bond.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.500
But can you even hold a gun?

29:26.500 --> 29:29.500
No, she has what she has to work to overcome.

29:29.500 --> 29:34.500
So it's the plot of the first one heard overcoming the adversity

29:34.500 --> 29:35.500
that comes with being a hologram.

29:35.500 --> 29:36.500
Yeah.

29:36.500 --> 29:37.500
Is there even a villain?

29:37.500 --> 29:38.500
Mm, herself.

29:38.500 --> 29:39.500
Got it.

29:39.500 --> 29:40.500
I'm in.

29:40.500 --> 29:41.500
Sounds good.

29:41.500 --> 29:42.500
Yeah.

29:42.500 --> 29:43.500
Better than the Rick and Morty one for sure.

29:43.500 --> 29:44.500
Definitely.

29:44.500 --> 29:45.500
Yeah.

29:45.500 --> 29:46.500
There's a top two.

29:46.500 --> 29:47.500
That'd be number one.

29:47.500 --> 29:48.500
Weird.

29:48.500 --> 29:49.500
Maybe you were too dumb to understand.

29:49.500 --> 29:50.500
Probably.

29:50.500 --> 29:51.500
Is your bond of the week?

29:51.500 --> 29:52.500
Mario.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.500
Oh, that's cool.

29:53.500 --> 29:54.500
It's funny.

29:54.500 --> 29:55.500
Is it Chris Pratt as Mario?

29:55.500 --> 29:56.500
Yep.

29:56.500 --> 29:57.500
And he's doing the voice in it.

29:57.500 --> 29:58.500
Doesn't sound quite right.

29:58.500 --> 29:59.500
He's doing the British.

29:59.500 --> 30:00.500
Yeah.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.500
He's doing that voice in a way.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.500
That is.

30:02.500 --> 30:03.500
Theo James.

30:03.500 --> 30:04.500
Oh.

30:04.500 --> 30:05.500
Theo James.

30:05.500 --> 30:06.500
So I've been watching White Lotus.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.500
And he's in White Lotus.

30:07.500 --> 30:08.500
He's a tall handsome, funny guy.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.500
And he's actually British.

30:10.500 --> 30:11.500
I found out not to recently.

30:11.500 --> 30:14.500
Is that the guy who was always sitting like this and like talking to.

30:14.500 --> 30:15.500
Yeah.

30:15.500 --> 30:16.500
He should be.

30:16.500 --> 30:17.500
Yeah.

30:17.500 --> 30:18.500
It's dick out at one point.

30:18.500 --> 30:19.500
But it was fake.

30:19.500 --> 30:20.500
Yeah.

30:21.500 --> 30:22.500
Is it the.

30:22.500 --> 30:23.500
It's the asshole.

30:23.500 --> 30:24.500
It's the sort of.

30:24.500 --> 30:25.500
Yeah.

30:25.500 --> 30:26.500
It's the asshole.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.500
Yeah.

30:27.500 --> 30:28.500
It's the asshole.

30:28.500 --> 30:29.500
You're a man.

30:29.500 --> 30:31.500
It's totally down to labor.

30:31.500 --> 30:32.500
As an asshole to me.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.500
He's a lot more intricate.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.500
If that makes sense.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.500
Not like bond would be.

30:36.500 --> 30:37.500
Did you watch last night's episode?

30:37.500 --> 30:38.500
I did.

30:38.500 --> 30:39.500
I really liked it.

30:39.500 --> 30:40.500
I really liked it.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.500
I saw it too.

30:41.500 --> 30:42.500
Crazy.

30:42.500 --> 30:43.500
What's that?

30:43.500 --> 30:44.500
I saw it too.

30:44.500 --> 30:46.500
You think?

30:46.500 --> 30:47.500
I watched it.

30:47.500 --> 30:48.500
Yeah.

30:48.500 --> 30:49.500
I said.

30:49.500 --> 30:50.500
It was that guy.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.500
Yeah.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.500
Like you had watched four minutes of the pilot.

30:53.500 --> 30:54.500
Well, so much.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.500
So many of those actors are people that we don't know yet.

30:56.500 --> 30:57.500
And now we know them.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.500
But I don't know which name is the actor.

30:59.500 --> 31:00.500
Right.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.500
Yeah.

31:01.500 --> 31:02.500
So.

31:02.500 --> 31:03.500
Can I change my mind a week?

31:03.500 --> 31:04.500
Yeah.

31:04.500 --> 31:05.500
Yeah.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.500
Luigi.

31:06.500 --> 31:07.500
Nice.

31:07.500 --> 31:08.500
Um.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.500
These games would be a good Luigi.

31:10.500 --> 31:11.500
Oh, my God.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.500
Can you imagine how fucking asshole out?

31:13.500 --> 31:14.500
Yeah.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.500
And if you guys had a birthday today.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.500
I would sort of seed the floor to you at the moment.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.500
You started speaking.

31:18.500 --> 31:19.500
Yeah.

31:19.500 --> 31:20.500
And I feel like I've been talked over.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.500
It's hard for me to get a word.

31:21.500 --> 31:22.500
And I just was.

31:22.500 --> 31:23.500
When's your birthday?

31:23.500 --> 31:24.500
June 3rd.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.500
October 20th.

31:25.500 --> 31:26.500
Oh.

31:26.500 --> 31:27.500
Okay.

31:27.500 --> 31:28.500
January 18th.

31:28.500 --> 31:29.500
Yeah.

31:29.500 --> 31:30.500
Um.

31:30.500 --> 31:31.500
Percy and BC.

31:31.500 --> 31:32.500
We got to get into the news of the day.

31:32.500 --> 31:33.500
Yep.

31:33.500 --> 31:34.500
Percy and BC.

31:34.500 --> 31:36.500
Parents of successful kids don't worry about screen time.

31:36.500 --> 31:41.500
Experts says they teach these three skills instead.

31:41.500 --> 31:45.500
What do we think they are?

31:45.500 --> 31:47.500
Um.

31:47.500 --> 31:48.500
Um.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.500
It works better for the edit if you kind of like.

31:50.500 --> 31:51.500
So there's overlapping dialogue.

31:51.500 --> 31:53.500
Economic literacy.

31:53.500 --> 31:54.500
Um.

31:54.500 --> 31:55.500
Um.

31:55.500 --> 31:56.500
Um.

31:56.500 --> 31:57.500
Kind compassion.

31:57.500 --> 32:01.500
Compassion and I don't know what else.

32:01.500 --> 32:02.500
Um.

32:02.500 --> 32:03.500
Risk my tech.

32:03.500 --> 32:04.500
Yeah.

32:04.500 --> 32:05.500
All wrong.

32:05.500 --> 32:06.500
Okay.

32:06.500 --> 32:07.500
One.

32:07.500 --> 32:10.500
How do we evaluate media?

32:10.500 --> 32:11.500
There's no way.

32:11.500 --> 32:12.500
Parents.

32:12.500 --> 32:13.500
Yeah.

32:13.500 --> 32:14.500
Why?

32:14.500 --> 32:15.500
Let me elaborate.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.500
That's our team of successful kids of kids that turn out fine.

32:18.500 --> 32:19.500
Good.

32:19.500 --> 32:23.500
They research and explore apps, games and websites.

32:23.500 --> 32:26.500
Read the user agreement and reviews together.

32:26.500 --> 32:27.500
And shit.

32:27.500 --> 32:28.500
Really?

32:28.500 --> 32:32.500
The user agreement like the legal terms like service.

32:32.500 --> 32:33.500
They agree too.

32:33.500 --> 32:40.500
And they share any values or concerns that they have about the agreement.

32:40.500 --> 32:44.500
That's how you get into fucking Yale.

32:44.500 --> 32:47.500
This isn't news for us.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.500
Seems like one crazy man's opinion.

32:49.500 --> 32:50.500
What's number two?

32:50.500 --> 32:53.500
How to draw screen boundaries.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.500
Let me.

32:55.500 --> 32:56.500
What's the net?

32:56.500 --> 32:57.500
Okay.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.500
So the title of the article is parents of successful kids don't worry about screen time.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.500
They focus on these three skills instead.

33:01.500 --> 33:04.500
And number two is how to draw screen boundaries.

33:04.500 --> 33:08.500
So the kids are choosing whether or not to use the screen.

33:08.500 --> 33:11.500
And that's the difference.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.500
Parents can come up with guidelines that create a balance.

33:13.500 --> 33:18.500
And teach your kids how to use screens constructively.

33:18.500 --> 33:19.500
Okay.

33:19.500 --> 33:22.500
Like, I don't think any of us here are parents.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.500
You know.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.500
So it's like what?

33:24.500 --> 33:26.500
What do you want us to say?

33:26.500 --> 33:28.500
Jesus.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.500
That wasn't me being like confirming.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.500
You're never going to have kids.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.500
You didn't say it like that the first time.

33:35.500 --> 33:36.500
You said it like that.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.500
He's been a pretty messed up.

33:39.500 --> 33:40.500
Yeah.

33:40.500 --> 33:42.500
Do you guys want to have kids eventually?

33:42.500 --> 33:43.500
I don't know.

33:43.500 --> 33:44.500
I don't know.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.500
I go back and forth every day.

33:46.500 --> 33:47.500
Yeah.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.500
What about Ali Jr.

33:49.500 --> 33:52.500
Not does that change your mind?

33:52.500 --> 33:53.500
No.

33:53.500 --> 33:54.500
No.

33:54.500 --> 33:55.500
I would love.

33:55.500 --> 33:56.500
You're husband.

33:56.500 --> 33:59.500
Ali Jr.

33:59.500 --> 34:02.500
You don't want that reminds me of, well, I don't know.

34:02.500 --> 34:06.500
There's just so many times where I'm like, I'd love to be able to pass along.

34:06.500 --> 34:09.500
Like, pop culture influences on to a child.

34:09.500 --> 34:12.500
But that's kind of like the amount of mothering that I'm interested in.

34:12.500 --> 34:16.500
Like, I want to like show them a show and be like, oh, that was important.

34:16.500 --> 34:19.500
Like, like, wipe a diaper for seven times.

34:19.500 --> 34:20.500
You don't wipe the diaper.

34:20.500 --> 34:21.500
I don't know.

34:21.500 --> 34:23.500
You know what I really don't want to do?

34:23.500 --> 34:26.500
I don't want to have to shut up other people's plans for them.

34:26.500 --> 34:27.500
Yeah.

34:27.500 --> 34:28.500
That's what moms do.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.500
Like, they're always like, does your kid want to come over and have a pleading?

34:31.500 --> 34:32.500
Oh, I have to talk to.

34:32.500 --> 34:33.500
I don't want to drive them over.

34:33.500 --> 34:34.500
Yeah.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.500
And then I have to talk to the other parents.

34:36.500 --> 34:40.500
I have to stay in their their foyer and make sure everybody's comfortable for a little late.

34:40.500 --> 34:41.500
They eat dinner.

34:41.500 --> 34:42.500
Like, oh, my God.

34:42.500 --> 34:43.500
I don't want to do it.

34:43.500 --> 34:44.500
Yeah.

34:44.500 --> 34:47.500
Or like, if Mike is a fighter, I have to call the mom be like, so sorry.

34:47.500 --> 34:48.500
My kid bit your kid.

34:48.500 --> 34:49.500
Yeah.

34:49.500 --> 34:50.500
I'm not interested in that.

34:50.500 --> 34:55.500
But I am interested in showing a child that the secret garden is good back.

34:55.500 --> 34:57.500
And you're talking about being an aunt.

34:57.500 --> 34:58.500
Yeah.

34:58.500 --> 34:59.500
Yeah.

34:59.500 --> 35:00.500
I guess that's what I want.

35:00.500 --> 35:01.500
Yeah.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.500
Are you an aunt?

35:02.500 --> 35:03.500
No.

35:03.500 --> 35:04.500
No.

35:04.500 --> 35:05.500
No.

35:05.500 --> 35:06.500
No.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.500
No.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.500
On the side.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.500
The last one is how do you scream for good?

35:10.500 --> 35:13.500
Which I think they mean for like the good of humanity.

35:13.500 --> 35:16.500
But I'm thinking just in perpetuity.

35:16.500 --> 35:22.500
A new book claims Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip kept their distance in final years.

35:22.500 --> 35:27.500
The Duke of Edinburgh reportedly spent his days in his own way.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.500
Fast forward to the next.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.500
You've chosen to spend your birthday.

35:31.500 --> 35:34.500
All right.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.500
No thoughts on that.

35:35.500 --> 35:36.500
No.

35:36.500 --> 35:37.500
All right.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.500
Can't hear what actors are saying on TV.

35:39.500 --> 35:46.500
It's not you, probably.

35:46.500 --> 35:52.500
There are things you can do per the Wall Street Journal to address audio issues introduced

35:52.500 --> 35:55.500
by the production process.

35:55.500 --> 35:56.500
Okay.

35:56.500 --> 35:58.500
This is like a great help.

35:58.500 --> 35:59.500
People now watch.

35:59.500 --> 36:01.500
I feel like I'm just visiting my grandfather.

36:01.500 --> 36:04.500
He's reading TV guide from 2015.

36:04.500 --> 36:05.500
This is it.

36:05.500 --> 36:08.500
More interesting than like reading the Washington Post.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.500
No.

36:09.500 --> 36:10.500
No context.

36:10.500 --> 36:13.500
It feels like we're reading the user agreement as a family.

36:13.500 --> 36:14.500
Yes.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.500
We're old.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.500
Oldest meal discovered in a $550 million.

36:19.500 --> 36:20.500
Sorry.

36:20.500 --> 36:21.500
You're old.

36:21.500 --> 36:22.500
I've been shopping.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.500
$550 million.

36:24.500 --> 36:25.500
You're old fossil.

36:25.500 --> 36:28.500
In a fossilized specimen of a of the slug like Kimberly.

36:28.500 --> 36:32.500
A team detected molecules of fight fight.

36:32.500 --> 36:35.500
Tossural preserved in the creature's gut.

36:35.500 --> 36:37.500
The chemical product, which is found in plants,

36:37.500 --> 36:41.500
suggested it ate algae and bacteria from the ocean floor.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.500
My question is, no sides.

36:44.500 --> 36:50.500
We all crack up for nine minutes.

36:50.500 --> 36:54.500
That was great.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.500
You got to make birthday last.

36:56.500 --> 36:57.500
That was awesome.

36:57.500 --> 37:03.500
They also found onion rings in his underwear.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.500
I like that.

37:05.500 --> 37:06.500
I like that.

37:06.500 --> 37:07.500
Yeah.

37:07.500 --> 37:08.500
For the supermark.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.500
We were talking about how.

37:11.500 --> 37:13.500
But the last time we were on the show is still the episode.

37:13.500 --> 37:16.500
At least point to people to to be like, if you don't listen to the show,

37:16.500 --> 37:19.500
but if you want to, this is a good episode.

37:19.500 --> 37:23.500
You're still a writer on what we're doing the shadows.

37:23.500 --> 37:24.500
Yep.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.500
CoEP.

37:27.500 --> 37:30.500
You always guess title, which is not easy to get.

37:30.500 --> 37:31.500
I'm not a coEP.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.500
They'd be like, really big.

37:33.500 --> 37:34.500
Yeah.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.500
You're still, you're still just executive story out of there?

37:36.500 --> 37:37.500
No.

37:37.500 --> 37:40.500
I mean, I think you got to get walked.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.500
You're a producer.

37:41.500 --> 37:42.500
You're a producer.

37:42.500 --> 37:43.500
Producer.

37:43.500 --> 37:44.500
Wow.

37:44.500 --> 37:45.500
You already nailed it.

37:45.500 --> 37:46.500
And then stop guessing.

37:46.500 --> 37:50.500
And just, well, hey, let me look at the schedule.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.500
Why are you talking about?

37:53.500 --> 37:54.500
Yeah.

37:54.500 --> 37:57.500
Actually, I guess this W.J. East isn't it.

37:57.500 --> 38:00.500
You're going to ask about rates.

38:00.500 --> 38:02.500
I'm looking at the schedule of minimums.

38:02.500 --> 38:03.500
Right.

38:03.500 --> 38:04.500
Why would you do this?

38:04.500 --> 38:06.500
What was that producer?

38:06.500 --> 38:07.500
Producer.

38:07.500 --> 38:08.500
Yeah.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.500
Although, I guess you're PGA now.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.500
That's not how it works.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.500
I'm a producer level writer.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.500
I'm still on the writer's field.

38:16.500 --> 38:17.500
Okay.

38:17.500 --> 38:19.500
So it's like, this isn't interesting to anyone.

38:19.500 --> 38:20.500
Not necessarily.

38:20.500 --> 38:21.500
It makes me uncomfortable.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.500
How so?

38:22.500 --> 38:24.500
I think you're trying to talk about how much money I make.

38:24.500 --> 38:26.500
It's important that we discuss our finances

38:26.500 --> 38:28.500
so that everyone gets paid fairly.

38:28.500 --> 38:31.500
But like, you're trying to think that a union has picked.

38:31.500 --> 38:32.500
Like, there's no, like, if someone's doing,

38:32.500 --> 38:34.500
we're going to guild show.

38:34.500 --> 38:36.500
It doesn't matter what they don't need to know what I make.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.500
$5,000 a week.

38:38.500 --> 38:40.500
I don't want to talk about it.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.500
So it's more than that.

38:42.500 --> 38:43.500
Yeah.

38:43.500 --> 38:50.500
But for the viewership, it's important to recognize that we live in a

38:50.500 --> 38:53.500
gig economy in this industry, right?

38:53.500 --> 38:56.500
So you might be getting $7,200 a week.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.500
You have agency fees, your manager fees.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.500
You have taxes, obviously.

39:00.500 --> 39:02.500
And that has, you only work for what?

39:02.500 --> 39:03.500
16 weeks out of the year.

39:03.500 --> 39:04.500
Yep.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.500
So that has to last the whole year.

39:06.500 --> 39:08.500
So it's not $7,000 a week.

39:08.500 --> 39:10.500
It's not $7,000 times 52.

39:10.500 --> 39:13.500
So it's like, it's something up.

39:13.500 --> 39:15.500
The nation is selling.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.500
It's like, no one was talking about this.

39:17.500 --> 39:19.500
No one's curious about it.

39:19.500 --> 39:21.500
It's just completely unnecessary.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.500
The entire thing.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.500
I want to make $7,000 a week.

39:25.500 --> 39:26.500
Sure.

39:26.500 --> 39:27.500
Yes.

39:27.500 --> 39:28.500
But you suck.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.500
Number.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.500
You remember?

39:31.500 --> 39:32.500
You remember?

39:32.500 --> 39:33.500
I said, I said you suck.

39:33.500 --> 39:34.500
Yeah.

39:34.500 --> 39:35.500
That hasn't changed.

39:35.500 --> 39:38.500
I wrote more scenes to get your advice on.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.500
I want to see how I've grown as a writer in the past year.

39:40.500 --> 39:41.500
Okay.

39:41.500 --> 39:42.500
Your eyes in your...

39:42.500 --> 39:44.500
So we're sure of doing like a sequel to the last...

39:44.500 --> 39:45.500
Yeah.

39:45.500 --> 39:46.500
It's sort of table read.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.500
The table read episode.

39:48.500 --> 39:49.500
Yes.

39:49.500 --> 39:50.500
So I...

39:50.500 --> 39:51.500
I sent it to you over Slack.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.500
I said it to you guys over text.

39:53.500 --> 39:56.500
Five different scenes.

39:56.500 --> 39:57.500
And would love to get your...

39:57.500 --> 39:58.500
No.

39:58.500 --> 39:59.500
It's pulled a room.

39:59.500 --> 40:00.500
And there's scene direction.

40:00.500 --> 40:01.500
So I'll assign roles.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.500
I'll sort of cast it as we go.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.500
This first scene takes place.

40:05.500 --> 40:06.500
It's sort of a...

40:06.500 --> 40:08.500
You know, first date scene.

40:08.500 --> 40:09.500
Is that...

40:09.500 --> 40:11.500
I mean, why don't you be man?

40:11.500 --> 40:12.500
And Ali, why don't you be woman?

40:12.500 --> 40:13.500
Sure.

40:13.500 --> 40:14.500
And they cast me.

40:14.500 --> 40:15.500
Zack, can you...

40:15.500 --> 40:16.500
All right.

40:16.500 --> 40:17.500
Ali, why don't you be man?

40:17.500 --> 40:18.500
I'm here.

40:18.500 --> 40:19.500
You be woman.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.500
Actually, that works.

40:20.500 --> 40:21.500
You're man, you're woman.

40:21.500 --> 40:22.500
You have woman.

40:22.500 --> 40:23.500
You...

40:23.500 --> 40:24.500
You're me, Rory.

40:24.500 --> 40:27.500
You do seem direction and sort of call action.

40:27.500 --> 40:28.500
Okay.

40:28.500 --> 40:29.500
Just so I can hear it.

40:29.500 --> 40:30.500
And I don't have to book this at all.

40:30.500 --> 40:31.500
Yeah.

40:31.500 --> 40:32.500
Sounds good.

40:32.500 --> 40:33.500
You don't have to focus.

40:33.500 --> 40:34.500
I can sort of zone out.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.500
There.

40:35.500 --> 40:36.500
Yeah.

40:36.500 --> 40:37.500
Unlike the rest of the podcast.

40:37.500 --> 40:38.500
Ready?

40:38.500 --> 40:39.500
Yeah.

40:39.500 --> 40:40.500
Okay.

40:40.500 --> 40:41.500
And...

40:41.500 --> 40:42.500
Okay.

40:42.500 --> 40:43.500
We're exterior apartment building.

40:43.500 --> 40:44.500
Night.

40:44.500 --> 40:45.500
And action.

40:45.500 --> 40:46.500
Wanna come up?

40:46.500 --> 40:48.500
Just watch you kick it down.

40:48.500 --> 40:50.500
I just watch you kick it down.

40:50.500 --> 40:51.500
The neck.

40:51.500 --> 40:52.500
That's true.

40:52.500 --> 40:55.500
You saw a blind, three-legged dash.

40:55.500 --> 40:56.500
Dash sound.

40:56.500 --> 40:58.500
Start only to cross the street.

40:58.500 --> 41:00.500
You turned to me and said, watch this.

41:00.500 --> 41:03.500
Then you position yourself for a punt.

41:03.500 --> 41:05.500
Then dashed forward and center flying through the air.

41:05.500 --> 41:08.500
She hit the cement with a sickening slap.

41:08.500 --> 41:12.500
And which point you turned back around and yelled at the top of your lungs.

41:12.500 --> 41:14.500
Goal.

41:14.500 --> 41:15.500
Wrong sport by the way.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.500
It's all football.

41:18.500 --> 41:19.500
Yeah.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.500
You've tripped on every side.

41:21.500 --> 41:22.500
You've walked on.

41:22.500 --> 41:26.500
And you've stolen mail from every stupid way fast.

41:26.500 --> 41:28.500
I'm not convinced you live here.

41:28.500 --> 41:31.500
I'm gathering you want to take it slow.

41:31.500 --> 41:34.500
I want you to die.

41:34.500 --> 41:35.500
Hey, wait.

41:35.500 --> 41:36.500
Before you go.

41:36.500 --> 41:38.500
Wanna watch me do a magic trick?

41:38.500 --> 41:41.500
The man takes out a deck of cards.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.500
But they're all stuck together.

41:44.500 --> 41:45.500
Shit.

41:45.500 --> 41:49.500
You probably think I jack off to these now, huh?

41:52.500 --> 41:53.500
Do you?

41:53.500 --> 41:55.500
Well, yeah.

41:55.500 --> 41:57.500
But now you think that.

41:57.500 --> 42:00.500
The woman spits in the man's eye.

42:00.500 --> 42:01.500
Oh.

42:01.500 --> 42:03.500
She shoves him into a pile of trash.

42:03.500 --> 42:04.500
Oh.

42:04.500 --> 42:06.500
She lights the match.

42:06.500 --> 42:08.500
It tosses it onto his shirt.

42:08.500 --> 42:10.500
Of course.

42:10.500 --> 42:11.500
And.

42:12.500 --> 42:13.500
All right.

42:13.500 --> 42:14.500
Great.

42:14.500 --> 42:18.500
So my goal with this scene was to sort of show and not tell.

42:18.500 --> 42:19.500
Okay.

42:19.500 --> 42:20.500
Yeah.

42:20.500 --> 42:22.500
Which is the opposite, right?

42:22.500 --> 42:23.500
Of what?

42:23.500 --> 42:25.500
They tell you to do.

42:25.500 --> 42:26.500
No way.

42:26.500 --> 42:29.500
They show what they show you to do.

42:29.500 --> 42:30.500
Nice.

42:30.500 --> 42:31.500
Oh, yeah.

42:31.500 --> 42:33.500
They tell you to show and not tell.

42:33.500 --> 42:34.500
But you did the opposite.

42:34.500 --> 42:35.500
You just told.

42:35.500 --> 42:37.500
What about the lighting about something?

42:37.500 --> 42:39.500
I guess at the way end.

42:39.500 --> 42:41.500
This was an interesting scene.

42:41.500 --> 42:42.500
Yeah.

42:42.500 --> 42:44.500
I mean, I think as with last time,

42:44.500 --> 42:46.500
I don't know what like.

42:46.500 --> 42:47.500
What this is.

42:47.500 --> 42:49.500
Like it's like, is it a.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.500
Is it a scene from a pilot?

42:51.500 --> 42:52.500
You've written, you know,

42:52.500 --> 42:54.500
Is there a complete short?

42:54.500 --> 42:55.500
Yeah.

42:55.500 --> 42:57.500
Or is there more to it?

42:57.500 --> 43:00.500
Is it like the big short?

43:00.500 --> 43:04.500
I really like the way you demonstrated cause and effect.

43:04.500 --> 43:05.500
Thank you.

43:05.500 --> 43:06.500
Yeah.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.500
And you also worked as a development executive before

43:08.500 --> 43:09.500
I had gum, right?

43:09.500 --> 43:10.500
That's.

43:10.500 --> 43:11.500
Thank you for saying I was an executive.

43:11.500 --> 43:12.500
I wasn't.

43:12.500 --> 43:13.500
I was still in a coordinator.

43:13.500 --> 43:15.500
But that's still you're reading a lot of material.

43:15.500 --> 43:16.500
No, I'm reading.

43:16.500 --> 43:17.500
Yeah, scripts all that.

43:17.500 --> 43:18.500
Yeah.

43:18.500 --> 43:19.500
And you've sort of had.

43:19.500 --> 43:20.500
You've been told that you're writing is bad.

43:20.500 --> 43:21.500
And you have to edit a lot because you like.

43:21.500 --> 43:22.500
What is it for?

43:22.500 --> 43:23.500
Phil pilots?

43:23.500 --> 43:26.500
Uh, not Phil pilots, but.

43:26.500 --> 43:27.500
Um.

43:27.500 --> 43:28.500
Got it.

43:28.500 --> 43:30.500
So now you're sort of being mean.

43:30.500 --> 43:31.500
I wasn't trying to mean.

43:31.500 --> 43:32.500
I was trying to clarify.

43:32.500 --> 43:35.500
Just your qualifications for what I know.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.500
You're trying to clarify something.

43:38.500 --> 43:39.500
You said.

43:39.500 --> 43:41.500
Similar to the other thing.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.500
You keep creating issues.

43:43.500 --> 43:44.500
And then.

43:44.500 --> 43:45.500
That makes sense.

43:45.500 --> 43:46.500
I'm not trying to be mean.

43:46.500 --> 43:47.500
I'm just.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.500
I'm trying to clarify what I said.

43:49.500 --> 43:50.500
Um.

43:50.500 --> 43:51.500
Yeah.

43:51.500 --> 43:52.500
There's sort of like writing exercises.

43:52.500 --> 43:54.500
You try to do like a couple pages every day.

43:54.500 --> 43:57.500
And then maybe one of them sparks joy slash inspiration.

43:57.500 --> 44:00.500
And then you decide to write a pilot around that.

44:00.500 --> 44:02.500
So it's a pilot for a pilot in a way.

44:02.500 --> 44:04.500
Like maybe this could be like a big sick.

44:04.500 --> 44:05.500
You know what I mean?

44:05.500 --> 44:06.500
Like brown guy, white girl.

44:06.500 --> 44:07.500
Right.

44:07.500 --> 44:08.500
That's what you say.

44:08.500 --> 44:09.500
Correct.

44:09.500 --> 44:10.500
My wife.

44:10.500 --> 44:11.500
Yeah.

44:11.500 --> 44:12.500
So yeah.

44:12.500 --> 44:13.500
I think of course at the end.

44:13.500 --> 44:16.500
That felt a little bit like that's like sort of a catchphrase type

44:16.500 --> 44:17.500
big of yours.

44:17.500 --> 44:19.500
And you're kind of trying to jam that in.

44:19.500 --> 44:20.500
Yeah.

44:20.500 --> 44:21.500
Which I would say writing wise.

44:21.500 --> 44:23.500
Don't do that because you don't know who's.

44:23.500 --> 44:24.500
I don't know if you're going to play the part.

44:24.500 --> 44:26.500
You know what I mean at the end of the day.

44:26.500 --> 44:27.500
You know.

44:27.500 --> 44:28.500
Alley could be playing the part.

44:28.500 --> 44:29.500
And that's not her catchphrase.

44:29.500 --> 44:30.500
And so then suddenly.

44:30.500 --> 44:31.500
So maybe keep stuff like that.

44:31.500 --> 44:33.500
Your personal catchphrases out of your scripts.

44:33.500 --> 44:34.500
That's just friendly advice.

44:34.500 --> 44:35.500
No, that makes sense.

44:35.500 --> 44:36.500
And it's actually.

44:36.500 --> 44:37.500
It's funny you said that because I was dying.

44:37.500 --> 44:39.500
Judge Ryan Hart for that part.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.500
Brown guy.

44:41.500 --> 44:43.500
Judges attached.

44:43.500 --> 44:44.500
That's awesome.

44:44.500 --> 44:45.500
Yeah.

44:45.500 --> 44:46.500
All right.

44:46.500 --> 44:47.500
Let's go on to this next one.

44:47.500 --> 44:48.500
This one sort of like.

44:48.500 --> 44:49.500
If you guys seen the sopranos.

44:49.500 --> 44:50.500
Yes.

44:50.500 --> 44:51.500
So this is like.

44:51.500 --> 44:52.500
Similar to the sopranos.

44:52.500 --> 44:53.500
So that's the tone.

44:53.500 --> 44:54.500
Okay.

44:54.500 --> 44:55.500
And kind of a lofty.

44:55.500 --> 44:56.500
That's just.

44:56.500 --> 44:57.500
A little pre-advice.

44:57.500 --> 44:58.500
Yeah.

44:58.500 --> 45:00.500
I said the bar so high always when you're showing someone something.

45:00.500 --> 45:01.500
Yeah.

45:01.500 --> 45:04.500
Kind of like what is widely considered as the best television show of all time.

45:04.500 --> 45:05.500
Well, you know.

45:05.500 --> 45:06.500
You got to aim high.

45:06.500 --> 45:08.500
I don't want to like try and write a show that's like.

45:08.500 --> 45:09.500
I don't know.

45:09.500 --> 45:10.500
No.

45:10.500 --> 45:11.500
I respect that.

45:11.500 --> 45:13.500
Spy.

45:13.500 --> 45:14.500
Who series.

45:14.500 --> 45:15.500
No.

45:15.500 --> 45:18.500
Why don't we have a mirror.

45:18.500 --> 45:19.500
You're the therapist.

45:19.500 --> 45:20.500
Okay.

45:20.500 --> 45:21.500
Zack, why don't you be third good.

45:21.500 --> 45:24.500
And Ali, why don't you call scene direction for this?

45:24.500 --> 45:25.500
Okay.

45:25.500 --> 45:27.500
Interior therapy office.

45:27.500 --> 45:30.500
A therapist sits with their patient.

45:30.500 --> 45:32.500
He's because you're kind of dorky.

45:32.500 --> 45:33.500
What?

45:33.500 --> 45:35.500
I mean, your name is Thurgood.

45:35.500 --> 45:36.500
That's.

45:36.500 --> 45:37.500
Ha-ha.

45:37.500 --> 45:38.500
Ha-ha.

45:38.500 --> 45:39.500
Ha-ha.

45:39.500 --> 45:40.500
Ha-ha.

45:40.500 --> 45:41.500
Ha-ha.

45:41.500 --> 45:42.500
Ha-ha.

45:42.500 --> 45:43.500
Ha-ha.

45:43.500 --> 45:45.500
Ha-ha.

45:45.500 --> 45:46.500
Ha.

45:46.500 --> 45:47.500
Ha-ha.

45:47.500 --> 45:48.500
Ha-ha.

45:48.500 --> 45:50.500
Ha-ha.

45:50.500 --> 45:51.500
Ha-ha.

45:51.500 --> 45:52.500
Ha-ha.

45:52.500 --> 45:53.500
Ha-ha.

45:53.500 --> 45:54.500
Ha-ha.

45:54.500 --> 45:55.500
Ha-ha.

45:55.500 --> 45:56.500
I mean, your name is Thurgood.

45:56.500 --> 45:58.500
That's not exactly sexy.

45:58.500 --> 45:59.500
Ha-ha.

45:59.500 --> 46:05.340
I tell you my wife has an initiated sex in two years, and that's your response.

46:05.340 --> 46:06.940
Let me level with you.

46:06.940 --> 46:08.940
I'm retiring.

46:08.940 --> 46:13.900
I'm retiring, yeah, check swatch.

46:13.900 --> 46:17.300
25 minutes.

46:17.300 --> 46:29.460
So frankly, I couldn't give a shit if your wife has thought.

46:29.900 --> 46:32.220
I think we've got to get some of the potatoes.

46:32.220 --> 46:33.220
Let's go for this.

46:33.220 --> 46:34.220
Yeah, let's go for this.

46:34.220 --> 46:36.100
And then again, I'll just have it in me, right?

46:36.100 --> 46:41.100
Any notes performance wise for us or going back?

46:41.100 --> 46:42.460
That was a cold read by the way.

46:42.460 --> 46:43.260
I'd never read that.

46:43.260 --> 46:44.260
Same.

46:44.260 --> 46:46.580
Let's really try to hit that sopranos tone.

46:46.580 --> 46:47.340
OK.

46:47.340 --> 46:51.740
And then I at least, can I make a recommendation that I'm

46:51.740 --> 46:54.820
third good and you're the therapist just because of how I feel

46:54.820 --> 46:56.940
like we come across anyway?

46:56.940 --> 46:58.580
You seem like more of the therapist type.

46:58.580 --> 47:00.660
You know, my parents are both therapists.

47:00.660 --> 47:02.020
There we go.

47:02.020 --> 47:02.500
All right.

47:02.500 --> 47:04.300
Yeah, why don't you be therapists and you be third good?

47:04.300 --> 47:08.300
I'm going to try to harness stuff for my parents and ancestors.

47:08.300 --> 47:09.340
What do you call you?

47:09.340 --> 47:11.100
Take a second to just switch roles.

47:11.100 --> 47:11.740
OK, thank you.

47:11.740 --> 47:13.740
OK, yeah.

47:13.740 --> 47:17.620
OK, interior, therapy office, a therapist,

47:17.620 --> 47:19.780
sits with their patients.

47:19.780 --> 47:22.180
Maybe it's because you're kind of doorky.

47:22.180 --> 47:23.300
What?

47:23.300 --> 47:25.100
I mean, your name's Thurgood.

47:25.100 --> 47:26.900
That's not exactly sexy.

47:26.900 --> 47:30.260
I tell you what, my wife has an initiated sex in two years.

47:30.260 --> 47:31.860
And that's your response.

47:31.860 --> 47:34.180
Sorry, and that's your response.

47:34.180 --> 47:35.420
Let me level with you.

47:35.420 --> 47:38.420
I'm retiring in 25 minutes.

47:38.420 --> 47:41.020
So frankly, I couldn't give a shit if your wife has the hot

47:41.020 --> 47:42.620
so that you are not.

47:42.620 --> 47:45.860
Bottom line is I'm moving to Hawaii, Tobaro.

47:45.860 --> 47:47.900
So you say whatever it is you need to say.

47:47.900 --> 47:50.180
You already have my recommendation for your next shrink.

47:50.180 --> 47:52.460
Just fucking rail your wife tonight.

47:52.460 --> 47:55.060
It'll be fine.

47:55.060 --> 47:57.980
Make sure she comes like, I don't know, five or six times.

47:57.980 --> 47:58.820
Doctor.

47:58.820 --> 48:00.420
I'm not a doctor.

48:00.420 --> 48:01.900
I'm an MFT.

48:01.900 --> 48:05.180
I've never corrected you because I liked how it sounded.

48:05.180 --> 48:07.780
The therapist lights a cigarette.

48:07.780 --> 48:10.340
Also, you might invest in a leather jacket.

48:10.340 --> 48:11.780
We'll love that bike or shit.

48:11.780 --> 48:14.820
You even need a Harley, just the leather jacket.

48:14.820 --> 48:15.460
SIGER at?

48:15.460 --> 48:16.460
I'm good.

48:16.460 --> 48:19.060
No, you're terrible.

48:19.060 --> 48:21.260
And that's the problem.

48:21.260 --> 48:22.060
Oh, shit.

48:26.060 --> 48:26.980
Oh, shit.

48:26.980 --> 48:30.780
My prawns are here.

48:30.780 --> 48:33.580
You might have eaten some prawns during these last 20 minutes.

48:40.220 --> 48:42.820
I mean, yeah, I kind of do.

48:42.820 --> 48:44.220
You suck ass.

48:48.220 --> 48:49.540
There you go.

48:49.540 --> 48:51.980
That one's like characters who are immediately at odds

48:51.980 --> 48:54.380
with each other, like trying to create conflict

48:54.380 --> 48:58.140
in like, not only the moment, but also the characters

48:58.140 --> 48:59.140
like disposition.

48:59.140 --> 49:01.580
Well, it seems like we've had a long standing relationship.

49:01.580 --> 49:03.300
This therapist is about to retire.

49:03.300 --> 49:08.140
They have names for each other, built in jokes, sort of.

49:08.140 --> 49:10.020
It's an inciting incident, potentially.

49:10.020 --> 49:10.980
Yeah, this is interesting.

49:10.980 --> 49:14.020
I mean, it feels a little bit like the way it starts, right?

49:14.020 --> 49:16.580
It's like, maybe it's because you're kind of dorky.

49:16.580 --> 49:17.180
What?

49:17.180 --> 49:18.220
I mean, your name is Thurgood.

49:18.220 --> 49:21.500
It feels like you like, name the character, Thurgood.

49:21.500 --> 49:23.780
And then we're like, all right, what do we know about this guy?

49:23.780 --> 49:24.820
It's Thurgood.

49:24.820 --> 49:27.980
You know, it's like, it's like, maybe try to get a little deeper

49:27.980 --> 49:31.620
into who the character is before you get there rather than just

49:31.620 --> 49:33.380
being like, well, I named him Thurgood.

49:33.380 --> 49:36.580
So I'm going to make a joke about those names, Thurgood.

49:36.580 --> 49:39.420
So like more specific specific specificity.

49:39.420 --> 49:40.580
Yeah, no, totally.

49:40.580 --> 49:42.180
Specificity, exactly, man.

49:42.180 --> 49:45.340
And I think that, but this is like really good, obviously.

49:45.340 --> 49:46.900
Like, I think it's really good.

49:46.900 --> 49:48.980
Yeah, it's like powerful, interesting.

49:48.980 --> 49:51.020
And you guys aren't just saying that because it's my birthday.

49:51.020 --> 49:52.580
No, is that your birthday still?

49:52.660 --> 49:53.980
Yeah, I guess it is, yeah.

49:53.980 --> 49:56.100
I'm not even thinking about your birthday anymore.

49:56.100 --> 49:57.380
I'm thinking about other stuff.

49:57.380 --> 50:00.500
And like, I, I think this is solid and nothing

50:00.500 --> 50:01.780
or nothing to worry about, you know?

50:01.780 --> 50:01.980
OK.

50:01.980 --> 50:04.460
And it's not so not that the, if we've been going for 50 minutes

50:04.460 --> 50:06.220
and you guys want to get out of here, we do.

50:06.220 --> 50:07.460
We, is it almost five?

50:07.460 --> 50:09.220
Because I do have a hard out.

50:09.220 --> 50:10.700
Let's get these less scenes out of the way.

50:10.700 --> 50:12.180
OK.

50:12.180 --> 50:12.380
OK.

50:12.380 --> 50:17.500
So I know that staffing, like when you apply to write for a TV show,

50:17.500 --> 50:19.580
doesn't really operate on spec scripts anymore.

50:19.580 --> 50:20.580
And you do.

50:20.620 --> 50:24.460
But I'm like, what, it also need to like catch people's eye.

50:24.460 --> 50:25.380
You have to be different.

50:25.380 --> 50:27.780
And if everyone's doing original pilots as submissions,

50:27.780 --> 50:29.420
I'm wondering if I do a spec script.

50:29.420 --> 50:31.100
So I wrote a spec script for a new girl.

50:31.100 --> 50:32.460
One of my favorite shows.

50:32.460 --> 50:34.500
Just to show that I know these characters.

50:34.500 --> 50:35.740
I can write for someone else's voice.

50:35.740 --> 50:36.740
Yeah.

50:36.740 --> 50:37.260
OK.

50:37.260 --> 50:41.900
Let's have, let's have Zach B. Schmitt.

50:41.900 --> 50:44.860
And then, Ali, can you be every other character?

50:44.860 --> 50:45.860
Sure.

50:45.860 --> 50:47.380
Actually, no, let's, sorry.

50:47.380 --> 50:48.140
You be Schmitt.

50:48.140 --> 50:49.580
You be Jess.

50:49.580 --> 50:52.580
And Winston, and you be Nick and C.C.

50:52.580 --> 50:53.780
OK.

50:53.780 --> 50:55.060
And I'll read scene direction.

50:55.060 --> 50:57.140
Interior, new girl loft.

50:57.140 --> 50:58.460
Charge, Schmitt.

50:58.460 --> 51:01.260
I'm being serious, Zoe.

51:01.260 --> 51:02.620
I'll be back.

51:02.620 --> 51:05.500
We can do a quick pop at of that is, yeah.

51:05.500 --> 51:06.620
You have her characters.

51:06.620 --> 51:08.580
They listen as Jess, right above it.

51:08.580 --> 51:10.100
And then he calls her Zoe.

51:10.100 --> 51:12.420
Maybe that comes into play later.

51:12.420 --> 51:13.300
Yeah, let's finish.

51:13.300 --> 51:13.740
Yeah.

51:13.740 --> 51:14.820
I'm being serious, Zoe.

51:14.820 --> 51:16.140
I feel like I'm having a seizure.

51:16.140 --> 51:18.220
Can we stop the cameras, please?

51:18.220 --> 51:19.380
Schmitt, sure.

51:19.380 --> 51:20.380
OK, I see.

51:20.380 --> 51:21.820
I'm not in character as Schmitt.

51:21.820 --> 51:23.100
I'm Max Greenfield.

51:23.100 --> 51:25.460
And I think I'm having a political episode.

51:25.460 --> 51:27.340
What's Schmitt doing today?

51:27.340 --> 51:29.860
He's being a big old douchebag.

51:29.860 --> 51:31.460
Why is nobody helping me?

51:31.460 --> 51:32.300
Where's Hannah?

51:32.300 --> 51:34.180
She'll know what to do.

51:34.180 --> 51:36.340
Oh, you want to talk to C.C. huh?

51:36.340 --> 51:38.460
Let me guess, because she's brown.

51:38.460 --> 51:38.940
What?

51:38.940 --> 51:40.740
No.

51:40.740 --> 51:42.140
Charge, Schmitty.

51:42.140 --> 51:42.940
What is jar?

51:42.940 --> 51:45.700
Be like, when you curve a douchebag jar, got it.

51:45.700 --> 51:47.420
I can't feel, oh, my god.

51:47.460 --> 51:49.980
I can't feel anything.

51:49.980 --> 51:51.860
Schmitt, you got to condom?

51:51.860 --> 51:54.380
No, someone called ambulance.

51:54.380 --> 51:58.180
Charge, Schmitt passes out, C.C. enters.

51:58.180 --> 51:59.900
Wow, real nice Schmitt.

51:59.900 --> 52:02.580
You had so much to say, you fainted.

52:02.580 --> 52:03.580
jar.

52:09.620 --> 52:10.820
Yeah.

52:10.820 --> 52:12.700
That one is not really a new girl.

52:12.700 --> 52:17.380
That one's more like a meta commentary on.

52:17.380 --> 52:18.380
Yeah.

52:18.380 --> 52:21.820
It was like when they did Seinfeld reunions on curve.

52:21.820 --> 52:22.820
Right.

52:22.820 --> 52:24.460
But that was a hit.

52:24.460 --> 52:25.460
Yes.

52:25.460 --> 52:26.460
Yes.

52:26.460 --> 52:27.460
I'm going to say this.

52:27.460 --> 52:28.300
I think you need to hear honesty.

52:28.300 --> 52:30.460
I didn't like this one.

52:30.460 --> 52:31.460
That's fair.

52:31.460 --> 52:32.820
I mean, I'm open to criticism.

52:32.820 --> 52:33.820
Let's move on to the Titanic.

52:33.820 --> 52:34.820
Great.

52:34.820 --> 52:37.660
Uh, seen.

52:37.660 --> 52:40.860
Um, this is me trying to do something a little bit more grounded.

52:40.860 --> 52:41.860
Okay.

52:41.860 --> 52:42.860
Oh.

52:42.860 --> 52:43.860
Um.

52:44.860 --> 52:48.420
Zach, why don't you be Rose and Aliby Jack and Amiria Reed's

52:48.420 --> 52:49.420
Indirection?

52:49.420 --> 52:51.500
All right, interior Titanic.

52:51.500 --> 52:53.900
Paint me like one of your French girls.

52:53.900 --> 52:57.060
Okay, but you're not going to like what you see.

52:57.060 --> 52:58.260
Jack paints her.

52:58.260 --> 52:59.940
We're building painting.

52:59.940 --> 53:05.260
This is a fat ass and two massive honkers.

53:05.260 --> 53:06.420
Wow.

53:06.420 --> 53:08.260
That's incredibly offensive.

53:08.260 --> 53:10.100
I told you that you wouldn't like it.

53:10.180 --> 53:13.700
I only know how to paint French girls with huge butts and

53:13.700 --> 53:15.460
massive honkers.

53:15.460 --> 53:19.900
Also, I do hate, I hate to do this, but I do have to charge you.

53:19.900 --> 53:20.900
What?

53:20.900 --> 53:24.620
I'm not just going to do a commission painting for free.

53:24.620 --> 53:26.180
It was supposed to be romantic.

53:26.180 --> 53:29.060
Oh, oh, oh, that's what this was.

53:29.060 --> 53:30.060
It's not anymore.

53:30.060 --> 53:30.380
What?

53:30.380 --> 53:33.100
Okay, well, then you owe me $150.

53:33.100 --> 53:34.340
You're an asshole Jack.

53:34.340 --> 53:37.100
I fact this whole thing up.

53:37.100 --> 53:38.100
Uh, interior.

53:38.180 --> 53:39.380
No, that's interesting.

53:39.380 --> 53:40.380
Thank you.

53:40.380 --> 53:43.100
You've been writing end on the other ones.

53:43.100 --> 53:45.180
Yeah, I didn't have space on that page and sometimes it's

53:45.180 --> 53:45.980
going to consolidate.

53:45.980 --> 53:46.700
Like, because you don't want it.

53:46.700 --> 53:49.220
Well, whole page was just, yeah, that's all on one page.

53:49.220 --> 53:50.180
Can you believe that?

53:50.180 --> 53:51.700
All that packed into one page.

53:51.700 --> 53:52.060
Really good.

53:52.060 --> 53:52.700
Sort of.

53:52.700 --> 53:53.540
Yeah, yeah.

53:53.540 --> 53:55.500
I love Titanic fanfack.

53:55.500 --> 53:55.940
Sure.

53:55.940 --> 53:57.420
Yeah.

53:57.420 --> 53:57.780
Okay.

53:57.780 --> 53:59.260
I don't know what you want at it.

53:59.260 --> 54:02.540
Like, this is, you know, it's not serious stuff.

54:02.540 --> 54:04.940
It's not real writing.

54:04.940 --> 54:07.660
Shorts are something like sketches, almost like little

54:07.660 --> 54:08.500
interstitials.

54:08.500 --> 54:09.980
Like, it's a sketch.

54:09.980 --> 54:11.100
You know what I mean?

54:11.100 --> 54:12.140
It's like robot chicken.

54:12.140 --> 54:14.380
If you guys remember that, like, little animated shorts

54:14.380 --> 54:16.860
that can go anywhere, or live anywhere, right?

54:16.860 --> 54:17.140
Yeah.

54:17.140 --> 54:19.860
Those like have, like, a specific idea to them.

54:19.860 --> 54:22.820
And they fall through them in a specific way.

54:22.820 --> 54:26.260
This one seemed like stream of consciousness a little bit.

54:26.260 --> 54:27.260
Yeah.

54:27.260 --> 54:27.900
Last one.

54:27.900 --> 54:29.620
I think it was just to be like, last one.

54:29.620 --> 54:30.620
Last one.

54:30.620 --> 54:31.620
Last one.

54:31.620 --> 54:33.620
Okay.

54:33.620 --> 54:34.900
It was supposed to be a little bit.

54:35.220 --> 54:35.740
What was it?

54:35.740 --> 54:36.580
Who should be?

54:36.580 --> 54:38.660
It's supposed to be like a check-in on, like, how is my writing ability

54:38.660 --> 54:40.780
changed from last November to this November?

54:40.780 --> 54:41.780
Yeah.

54:41.780 --> 54:42.380
Okay.

54:42.380 --> 54:43.220
Better word.

54:43.220 --> 54:43.820
No, no, no, yeah.

54:43.820 --> 54:45.460
I mean, I don't think you want to know the end.

54:45.460 --> 54:46.140
It's your birthday.

54:46.140 --> 54:49.740
Like, I'm not going to come in on your fucking birthday.

54:49.740 --> 54:51.900
And like, tell you, you don't have what it takes.

54:53.740 --> 54:54.580
I would not.

54:54.580 --> 54:55.420
But that is what you would say.

54:55.420 --> 54:56.900
I would never do that to you.

54:56.900 --> 54:58.020
You're my friend.

54:58.020 --> 54:59.940
What if it's tomorrow?

54:59.940 --> 55:00.780
Yeah.

55:00.780 --> 55:01.620
No, yeah.

55:01.620 --> 55:04.580
I think tomorrow, you know, maybe let's have a conversation tomorrow.

55:04.580 --> 55:05.580
Okay.

55:05.580 --> 55:07.180
But what might you say at the conversation tomorrow?

55:07.180 --> 55:10.140
I don't, I mean, it's impossible to predict the future.

55:10.140 --> 55:11.140
You know what I mean?

55:11.140 --> 55:13.220
But you're feeling like thinking those thoughts out.

55:13.220 --> 55:16.100
I'm, it's like, it's a mismatch of things, you know?

55:16.100 --> 55:17.100
Yeah.

55:17.100 --> 55:18.100
So much, it needs your birthday.

55:18.100 --> 55:19.100
You know what I mean?

55:19.100 --> 55:20.100
I know you for years.

55:20.100 --> 55:21.100
Yeah.

55:21.100 --> 55:23.420
Like, I knew you back when your dick was broken in half.

55:23.420 --> 55:28.220
It's like now to see you here, like, trying your best, like, it's amazing.

55:28.220 --> 55:29.220
Doing my best or trying your best.

55:29.220 --> 55:30.220
Yeah.

55:30.220 --> 55:31.220
Exactly.

55:31.220 --> 55:34.260
And so like, let's just finish this out and like have the best birthday ever.

55:34.300 --> 55:35.260
That's cool.

55:35.260 --> 55:36.260
Okay.

55:36.260 --> 55:37.260
Yeah.

55:37.260 --> 55:38.260
Yeah.

55:38.260 --> 55:41.260
Down to do the last one.

55:41.260 --> 55:42.260
Yeah.

55:42.260 --> 55:45.180
I mean, you're running, you're running, you're running, you're Nicolas Cage.

55:45.180 --> 55:50.780
And then, Ali, you want to, you be the director of the Unbearable Matt, the Unbearably

55:50.780 --> 55:53.100
Massive, the Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent.

55:53.100 --> 55:56.500
Sorry, I'm getting clusterd because like, I'm really thinking about what you think about

55:56.500 --> 55:57.500
in terms of the quality of your life.

55:57.500 --> 55:59.500
Just literally act like I'm not here.

55:59.500 --> 56:00.500
All right.

56:00.500 --> 56:01.500
Yeah.

56:01.500 --> 56:04.460
That's a huge Tom director of the movie.

56:04.460 --> 56:06.980
This is supposed to be like, did you guys see the Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent?

56:06.980 --> 56:07.980
Yeah.

56:07.980 --> 56:08.980
Yeah.

56:08.980 --> 56:09.980
Yeah.

56:09.980 --> 56:10.980
It was very good.

56:10.980 --> 56:12.180
And I thought that it would be like, what if this was like a deleted scene,

56:12.180 --> 56:17.580
or like, maybe a real kind of conversation that happened preceding the production, either

56:17.580 --> 56:18.580
one.

56:18.580 --> 56:20.580
Is he in the right?

56:20.580 --> 56:21.580
Yep.

56:21.580 --> 56:25.380
Interior, WME offices day.

56:25.380 --> 56:27.420
This movie is about my life, Tom.

56:27.420 --> 56:29.260
My jerk off in real life.

56:29.260 --> 56:30.260
Right.

56:30.260 --> 56:31.260
But.

56:31.300 --> 56:33.260
All the Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent.

56:33.260 --> 56:34.420
I'm the Massive Talent.

56:34.420 --> 56:36.420
You are your a massive talent.

56:36.420 --> 56:40.500
So then why is there a scene of me straight winking in this movie?

56:40.500 --> 56:41.500
Okay, Nick.

56:41.500 --> 56:42.500
I hear you.

56:42.500 --> 56:43.500
All right.

56:43.500 --> 56:44.500
I'll draft it.

56:44.500 --> 56:45.500
And send it to you by Friday.

56:45.500 --> 56:46.500
Okay.

56:46.500 --> 56:47.500
Are we happy?

56:47.500 --> 56:49.500
We're happy.

56:49.500 --> 56:51.500
Nice.

56:51.500 --> 56:55.260
I didn't like that one because it was just sort of one note.

56:55.260 --> 56:56.260
Yeah.

56:56.260 --> 56:57.260
I was one note.

56:57.260 --> 56:58.260
The performances were flat.

56:58.260 --> 57:03.060
I was illid-ease since the comment about Zach thinking things about my writing.

57:03.060 --> 57:04.860
The performances were flat.

57:04.860 --> 57:05.860
Definitely.

57:05.860 --> 57:06.860
I mean, I was loving it before.

57:06.860 --> 57:07.860
Allie was great.

57:07.860 --> 57:08.860
Allie was an actor.

57:08.860 --> 57:09.860
Both of them.

57:09.860 --> 57:10.860
Yeah.

57:10.860 --> 57:11.860
I felt tough.

57:11.860 --> 57:12.860
You were great.

57:12.860 --> 57:13.860
Allie was great.

57:13.860 --> 57:14.860
Allie dropped in.

57:14.860 --> 57:15.860
Allie was great.

57:15.860 --> 57:16.860
Yeah.

57:16.860 --> 57:17.860
Yeah.

57:17.860 --> 57:18.860
It was writing notes.

57:18.860 --> 57:20.860
I mean, this movie came out.

57:20.860 --> 57:21.860
Yep.

57:21.860 --> 57:22.860
You know.

57:22.860 --> 57:23.860
Yeah.

57:23.860 --> 57:27.380
Well, with that being, like a DVD expert or some weird thing.

57:27.380 --> 57:28.380
They're going to produce that.

57:28.380 --> 57:29.380
It's going to be threats.

57:29.380 --> 57:31.540
No, it's like we all are rooting for you, man.

57:31.540 --> 57:35.620
And like I had such an interesting time doing this segment.

57:35.620 --> 57:36.620
Yeah.

57:36.620 --> 57:40.020
But even like that, it's like there's so many ways to interpret like we're all rooting

57:40.020 --> 57:41.020
for you.

57:41.020 --> 57:43.500
Is it like everyone's sad at the way in my life's going?

57:43.500 --> 57:47.100
Because I'm like 25 now and wow, 25.

57:47.100 --> 57:48.100
Yeah.

57:48.100 --> 57:49.620
Over the hill is they say.

57:49.620 --> 57:50.620
Yeah, geez.

57:50.620 --> 57:51.620
Yeah.

57:51.620 --> 57:53.460
I mean, I could die at 50.

57:53.460 --> 57:55.100
You could die tomorrow.

57:55.100 --> 57:56.100
What's that?

57:56.100 --> 57:57.100
I did.

57:57.100 --> 57:58.100
I did that before 50.

57:58.100 --> 57:59.100
Sure.

57:59.100 --> 58:00.100
Yeah.

58:00.100 --> 58:01.100
Yeah.

58:01.100 --> 58:02.100
We're all, you know.

58:02.100 --> 58:03.100
It's always a risk.

58:03.100 --> 58:04.100
And that's why birthdays are fun.

58:04.100 --> 58:05.100
Yeah.

58:05.100 --> 58:06.100
Yeah.

58:06.100 --> 58:07.100
Yeah.

58:07.100 --> 58:08.100
Yeah.

58:08.100 --> 58:09.100
This is because you could die at 50.

58:09.100 --> 58:10.100
Yeah.

58:10.100 --> 58:11.100
I'm going to really think about this stuff.

58:11.100 --> 58:12.100
You wrote.

58:12.100 --> 58:13.100
Okay.

58:13.100 --> 58:16.100
And I think you could have a really serious chance.

58:16.100 --> 58:17.100
Pat.

58:17.100 --> 58:19.100
I think that if you're going to take anything and run with it, maybe third

58:19.100 --> 58:20.100
guy.

58:20.100 --> 58:24.100
As an as like a pilot or as like a new name for me.

58:25.100 --> 58:27.100
Maybe both.

58:27.100 --> 58:28.100
All right.

58:28.100 --> 58:31.100
That could have been good because it could be like Romney, right?

58:31.100 --> 58:34.100
So I like changed my name to work.

58:34.100 --> 58:35.100
That's his real name.

58:35.100 --> 58:37.100
And then I write a pilot about my life.

58:37.100 --> 58:38.100
And it's just.

58:38.100 --> 58:39.100
I would just be a pilot.

58:39.100 --> 58:40.100
Facial pilot.

58:40.100 --> 58:41.100
Facial pilot.

58:41.100 --> 58:42.100
There you go.

58:42.100 --> 58:44.100
What do you have to change your name?

58:44.100 --> 58:45.100
So make the pilot.

58:45.100 --> 58:46.100
Plugs.

58:46.100 --> 58:47.100
What do you have going on?

58:47.100 --> 58:48.100
I'm here.

58:48.100 --> 58:49.100
What do you have?

58:49.100 --> 58:50.100
I'm on TikTok.

58:50.100 --> 58:51.100
I know.

58:51.100 --> 58:52.100

58:52.100 --> 58:56.100
But for the last three plus years I've been making some pretty

58:56.100 --> 58:58.100
bomb ass content on there.

59:32.100 --> 59:34.100
I'm still trying to sell that handle.

59:34.100 --> 59:35.100
Yeah.

59:35.100 --> 59:38.100
Any a mirror out there like a brand wants that handle.

59:38.100 --> 59:42.100
I'm trying to let it go for it.

59:42.100 --> 59:45.100
Five figures.

59:45.100 --> 59:47.100

59:48.100 --> 59:54.100

You can follow me on Twitter, which I don't care about.

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.100

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.100

Try that.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:34.100
Appreciate that.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:35.100
Awesome man.

01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:36.100
No, really positive.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.100
Honestly.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.100
No.

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:39.100
This was.

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.100
Yeah.

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.100
Honestly.

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.100
Yeah.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.100
You've never done that on the show before.

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:47.100
I don't have had my birthday on the show.

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.100
I have Jeffrey James on Instagram at Jeff.

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:50.100
I already on Twitter.

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:52.100
Well, the last.

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:55.100
And watch what we do in the shadows.

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:56.100
All right.

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.100
Watch what we do in the shadows.

01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:59.100
On.

01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:00.100
Cool.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:03.100
What is this?

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.100
What?

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:05.100
No.

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:06.100
We're worried about you, man.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.100
I just don't want to leave here.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:08.100
Yeah.

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.100
There's like an elephant in the room.

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.100
I don't want to leave here if you're feeling bad.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.100
No.

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.100
I'm feeling.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:13.100
What can I say?

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:14.100
And I'll say it.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:15.100
That's awesome.

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:23.100
The writing you produced made me consider sending an email

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:28.100
on your behalf to someone who could change your life.

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.100
Wow.

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:35.100
The writing you produced made me consider sending an email

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:41.100
on your behalf that could change your life.

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:59.100
That's downstairs.

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:01.100
That was a hit-dum original.

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.100
Thank you.

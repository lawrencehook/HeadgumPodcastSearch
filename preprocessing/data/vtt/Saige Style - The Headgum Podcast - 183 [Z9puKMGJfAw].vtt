WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
And need they now, we're going to start.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
You're ready to push it.

00:11.000 --> 00:29.000
Are you going to be nice to say?

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Are you going to be nice to say?

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
That's what I wanted to know about.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
If I was going to be nice to sage, probably.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Sage and I don't know if you're going to be very well.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
So I can't be mean to her.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Don't call it a comeback, I said.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Call it a debut.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Welcome sage.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Sorry.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
The one thing I won't say.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Why do I hear Jeff so loud, but I can't hear.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
One thing I want to hear me at all.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
What?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
I hear you from the room.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
The one thing I won't accept today.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Is any stepping on toes of sage?

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
I don't think on your words.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Really?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
So you're worried about me?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
I don't know you now.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
It's just that...

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
That was me inserting the clip of Mariaca already stepping on Sage's toes.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
I was saying I would never.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
You already did it once already.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
We've only been recording for what?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Twenty seconds.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Right?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
I don't say I still love you.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
It's not sage's.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
This is why I sit behind the desk usually.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
So that was not what I thought.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
No, it's not.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
The real reason is what that we can't afford to produce from the show.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Did you tell me about the little note I had to make for you?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Is you want to dive into that right now?

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I thought we'd start there.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Well, because I mean, I'll be honest.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
You know, fast up.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Sage style.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Basically.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Basically, I forgot to record the video.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
A couple weeks back.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
And again.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
And then again, the week after.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Different videos, though.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Right?

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
The first time I just forgot to press record on the switchboard.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
I just forgot.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Yeah.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
He's my mom.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
The next week.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Obviously, there's like three different computers logged onto a zoom.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
I didn't know that the zoom that needed to be recording was the one that wasn't recording.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Sure.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
I genuinely, I just, I need to get the bottom of this.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Why is Jeff so loud?

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
It's because the mic is on here.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
And so it's closer to me.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Wait.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
What?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Is that true?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
It's not connected.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Because when you connect it to the boom, it's because I use a soundboard, basically.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Oh, I know.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
He wasn't using.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
I would, I could connect the USB codec to this, but we've already started.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Sage style.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
And it's not worth it.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
I just want to, I don't want to lean in.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
I love you.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
I love you.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Lean in just energetically for the episode.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Right?

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Like, by into this program.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
If I miss here on you, if I accidentally talk over her, it's not my fault.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I would never just Jeff is so loud.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
No.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
And I agree in terms of interrupting on yet.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
That's not your first fault.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
My voice doesn't carry in a way that Jeff's.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Boom.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
And I appreciate someone finally acknowledging that I kind of command a room anytime I walk.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Like, like, I don't think I'll have her not acknowledged it.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
Like the room that he walked into where I was having a meeting with someone about a new show

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
or bringing on.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Big show, bigger numbers than this show will ever say.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
But they weren't on the call.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
It was Kevin Bartlett.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Love it guy.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
That's actually not how you pronounce his last name.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Eric.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
How do you say it?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Brutlet.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Bartlett.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
How do you say Kevin's last name?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
I'm so sorry, Kevin.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
We should have Kevin on the show.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Sage.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
If you look at a bar lay, it's not ever met Kevin.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
I'm in Telt.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Ridley?

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
I don't think the L is after I think the L is after the E.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Bond of the week.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Let's get it over with.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
I'm going to go Wilcon over because he hates the segment and he skips it every time.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Skips it when listening or when on the show.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Which yeah, thank you.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
At least he listens.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
But either right.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.320
You do that, he's getting sick.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.720
He's only been on the shirt twice.

04:24.720 --> 04:25.560
He's refused both.

04:25.560 --> 04:29.600
I'm gonna go Paul Giamati in honor of Volcanover

04:29.600 --> 04:33.080
because he saw the, oh my god, the whole dovers.

04:33.080 --> 04:33.920
Twice.

04:33.920 --> 04:34.760
He was good.

04:34.760 --> 04:38.520
I thought it was in honor of his stint at McDonald's.

04:38.520 --> 04:39.760
Paul Giamati's?

04:39.760 --> 04:41.240
Yeah.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.000
I just watched Donnie Brasco and he was in that.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.120
Donnie Brasco is kind of a Donnie Brasco.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.120
It's a Disasco.

04:48.120 --> 04:49.280
Have you guys seen...

04:49.280 --> 04:50.280
That's true.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.920
Have you guys seen the episode?

04:52.880 --> 04:55.520
The Chris Guthrie show.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.680
We can let Sage go, but I, I was all finished.

04:58.680 --> 04:59.680
I'm pretty good.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.520
Thank you so much.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.040
That's gonna end up being strike two in terms

05:02.040 --> 05:03.200
of Marieka's stepping on Sage's.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.360
I do anything wrong.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.200
I didn't really do anything.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.200
I interrupted me.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.160
I interrupted you for sure, but that's part of the course.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.040
Yeah, of course.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.400
The episode of The Chris Guthrie show

05:13.400 --> 05:16.600
where Paul Giamati is in a dumpster.

05:16.600 --> 05:17.440
For sure.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.400
As soon as I say the word Sage,

05:19.400 --> 05:23.000
and so anybody continues speaking after I say Sage is...

05:23.000 --> 05:24.160
You're speaking.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.360
No, 100%.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.920
But that wasn't, that was just me using it as example.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.960
So like, how I was like Sage?

05:29.960 --> 05:30.800
Okay.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.720
My bond of the week is Walton Goggins.

05:32.720 --> 05:37.200
Yes, I love Walton.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.680
I've never seen any of his shows

05:40.680 --> 05:42.360
just Cowboys versus Aliens,

05:42.360 --> 05:46.120
but I like how he looks like the Cynthia doll

05:46.120 --> 05:47.120
from Rugrats.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.520
Cowboys and Aliens.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.520
Sorry, Cowboys and Aliens.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.760
I think that's like the news one, the counter.

05:53.760 --> 05:54.760
I think that's the first one.

05:54.760 --> 05:55.560
Like a woman.

05:55.560 --> 05:56.560
That's the second one.

05:56.560 --> 05:57.760
Yeah, it's Cowboys.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.160
Yeah, it's daily in stage.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.200
That was Andy and Mike is trying to point out.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.960
So she is better for us as well.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.640
Mike is not stepping on my toes.

06:04.640 --> 06:07.200
I'm sure that's correct to me.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.160
Okay, Marieka's up and she's trying to find the chance.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.200
She's just having me recently.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.960
And I appreciate it.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.800
It's called Stockholm Syndrome Sage,

06:13.800 --> 06:15.200
because I just learned that Marieka's

06:15.200 --> 06:16.440
who you report to directly.

06:16.440 --> 06:17.560
And I'm so sorry to hear that.

06:17.560 --> 06:18.960
You just learned that.

06:18.960 --> 06:19.960
Yeah.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.680
What is going to say this?

06:21.680 --> 06:22.400
It does not know.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.880
I thought she made, you know, magic with the social clips

06:25.880 --> 06:28.800
and with the, you know, the energy of the New York office

06:28.800 --> 06:30.000
any time you're so sorry to tell you.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.840
Right.

06:30.840 --> 06:34.200
The word social, to you, what does it like fall into?

06:34.200 --> 06:35.440
synonymous with Sage.

06:35.440 --> 06:39.520
The SG and Sage's Instagram is social girl.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.920
Yes.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.720
Was this Instagram as like social?

06:42.720 --> 06:42.920
Yeah.

06:42.920 --> 06:43.920
I love it, Sage.

06:44.000 --> 06:44.920
Thank you.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.920
Bond 3.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.920
Mr. Bean.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.920
Ooh, alright, Pete.

06:56.920 --> 06:57.920
The care.

06:57.920 --> 06:58.920
What does this look like?

06:58.920 --> 06:59.920
What's the name?

06:59.920 --> 07:00.920
Storm End.

07:00.920 --> 07:01.920
Storm End.

07:01.920 --> 07:02.920
Storm End.

07:02.920 --> 07:03.920
Storm End.

07:03.920 --> 07:04.920
Storm End.

07:04.920 --> 07:05.920
Storm End.

07:05.920 --> 07:06.920
Storm End.

07:06.920 --> 07:07.920
Storm End.

07:07.920 --> 07:08.920
Storm End.

07:08.920 --> 07:09.920
Storm End.

07:09.920 --> 07:10.920
Storm End.

07:10.920 --> 07:11.920
Storm End.

07:11.920 --> 07:12.920
Storm End.

07:12.920 --> 07:13.920
Storm End.

07:13.920 --> 07:14.920
Storm End.

07:14.920 --> 07:15.920
Storm End.

07:15.920 --> 07:16.920
Storm End.

07:16.920 --> 07:17.920
Storm End.

07:17.920 --> 07:18.920
Storm End.

07:18.920 --> 07:19.920
Storm End.

07:19.920 --> 07:20.920
Storm End.

07:20.920 --> 07:21.920
Storm End.

07:21.920 --> 07:22.920
Storm End.

07:22.920 --> 07:23.920
Storm End.

07:23.920 --> 07:24.920
Storm End.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.920
Storm End.

07:26.920 --> 07:27.920
Storm End.

07:27.920 --> 07:28.920
Storm End.

07:28.920 --> 07:29.920
Storm End.

07:29.920 --> 07:30.920
Storm End.

07:30.920 --> 07:31.920
Storm End.

07:31.920 --> 07:32.920
Storm End.

07:32.920 --> 07:33.920
Storm End.

07:33.920 --> 07:34.920
Storm End.

07:34.920 --> 07:35.920
Storm End.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.920
Storm End.

07:36.920 --> 07:37.920
Storm End.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.920
Storm End.

07:39.920 --> 07:40.920
Storm End.

07:40.920 --> 07:41.920
Storm End.

07:41.920 --> 07:42.720
Storm End.

07:42.720 --> 07:45.560
Should I tell Jeff what I discovered over the weekend?

07:45.560 --> 07:46.160
No, I'm not.

07:46.160 --> 07:46.760
No, I'm not.

07:46.760 --> 07:47.760
I'm not.

07:47.760 --> 07:48.760
I'm not.

07:48.760 --> 07:53.520
Yeah, so I didn't know this, but I googled my own name to see what comes out.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.400
I didn't have that in a while, I felt like it was time.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.600
Sure.

07:56.600 --> 08:04.240
And I am an IMDB page and 50% of my credits are Jeffrey the dumbass.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.000
And then that's what?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
That'd be more.

08:06.000 --> 08:06.680
That'd be more.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.480
Yeah, I should have called her.

08:08.480 --> 08:12.360
But I just meant like, I only have two things listed.

08:12.480 --> 08:13.600
What's the other thing?

08:13.600 --> 08:14.600
Off days.

08:16.600 --> 08:20.840
If you look at it, what comes up on the Google result?

08:20.840 --> 08:22.920
It just says, on your kind of sky, and then it says,

08:22.920 --> 08:24.440
Jeffrey, the dumbass, right underneath.

08:24.440 --> 08:27.040
It's a lighter font, a lighter gray.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.960
And so lighter, anyone who goes, me, it's my mom.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.880
Like, she's going to have to explain to people.

08:33.880 --> 08:34.880
What?

08:34.880 --> 08:37.360
She moved to LA.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.480
This is what she has in her crying.

08:39.480 --> 08:41.640
It's so funny to be like, what's the other one?

08:41.640 --> 08:42.640
Off days.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.320
We're talking nonsense that you originally did.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.960
I didn't think this company was going to turn in anything.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.920
I didn't think we were putting an IMDB.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.240
I didn't think that we would have more of a staff.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.240
Yeah.

08:53.240 --> 08:57.400
I shouldn't have said anything about the network.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.400
Marty heard at night.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.400
Yeah.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.400
Yeah.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.400
Yeah.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.400
He did do that.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.400
The big one.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.400
The big one is a table here.

09:04.400 --> 09:05.400
Okay.

09:05.400 --> 09:06.400
It was a big one.

09:06.400 --> 09:07.400
I can't.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.400
Our computers in the way.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.400
I can't see it.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.400
Got it.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.400
That concerns a good choice.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.400
No, I think it's fine.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.000
I always thought you had the character, Mr. B.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.040
I forgot his name for a second, but he was in that, he was already in Johnny English,

09:19.040 --> 09:23.400
so you can kind of, you can kind of, you know, you can actually, yeah, you can kind of

09:23.400 --> 09:25.400
building on as, yeah, on the end.

09:25.400 --> 09:31.000
He was in my favorite movie, Scooby-Doo, the live action, the 2002, and he's kind

09:31.000 --> 09:33.840
of like a bond villain and not one.

09:33.840 --> 09:34.840
Okay.

09:34.840 --> 09:35.840
Sage.

09:35.840 --> 09:36.840
Supporting me.

09:37.840 --> 09:38.840
That was cool.

09:38.840 --> 09:39.840
Sorry.

09:39.840 --> 09:40.840
Jesus.

09:40.840 --> 09:41.840
What did you up?

09:41.840 --> 09:42.840
Doesn't matter.

09:42.840 --> 09:45.840
I'm trying to hear them.

09:45.840 --> 09:46.840
Marika.

09:46.840 --> 09:47.840
That was so loud.

09:47.840 --> 09:51.840
Save them so sorry that you had to hear that.

09:51.840 --> 09:52.840
What?

09:52.840 --> 09:54.840
Travis and Taylor.

09:54.840 --> 09:55.840
Yes.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.840
What's talk about it?

09:58.840 --> 10:00.840
This is going to come out.

10:00.840 --> 10:01.840
I'm already tired.

10:01.840 --> 10:02.840
Yeah.

10:02.840 --> 10:03.840
Yeah.

10:03.840 --> 10:04.840
I'm over it.

10:04.840 --> 10:08.840
I'm a Joelle and Stan ultimately, and I feel like he's been done.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.840
The last act from Marika.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.840
The truck's ready to go.

10:12.840 --> 10:13.840
Yeah.

10:13.840 --> 10:14.840
A little British boy.

10:14.840 --> 10:15.840
A little British boy.

10:15.840 --> 10:23.840
I think, um, I, I mean, ultimately, she is a friend of the network, so I don't

10:23.840 --> 10:24.840
know if we can say anything.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.840
Taylor swims a friend of head.

10:26.840 --> 10:27.840
Go.

10:27.840 --> 10:28.840
Yeah.

10:28.840 --> 10:29.840
How?

10:29.840 --> 10:30.840
She would drink and chill.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.840
And she had a head, true.

10:32.840 --> 10:33.840
What?

10:33.840 --> 10:34.840
And she has.

10:34.840 --> 10:35.840
She had head.

10:35.840 --> 10:36.840
Oh, this is bullshit.

10:36.840 --> 10:37.840
She had head to post.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.840
It's a hundred percent per.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.840
Like the biggest tour of all time.

10:41.840 --> 10:42.840
Areas.

10:42.840 --> 10:43.840
Yeah.

10:43.840 --> 10:44.840
So you have to head them.

10:44.840 --> 10:45.840
Head them hosts.

10:45.840 --> 10:46.840
Yeah.

10:46.840 --> 10:47.840
Open up for her there.

10:47.840 --> 10:48.840
She doesn't know but head gum is.

10:48.840 --> 10:49.840
She doesn't listen to it.

10:49.840 --> 10:50.840
She's been to a Jake in a mirror.

10:50.840 --> 10:51.840
No, she has.

10:51.840 --> 10:52.840
That's true.

10:52.840 --> 10:53.840
No, Marika.

10:53.840 --> 10:54.840
You're first.

10:54.840 --> 10:55.840
Well, I know you're lying.

10:55.840 --> 10:56.840
No, I'm already.

10:56.840 --> 10:57.840
I'm not lying.

10:57.840 --> 10:58.840
Ask him here.

10:58.840 --> 10:59.840
I don't trust you.

10:59.840 --> 11:00.840
Marty or on you.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.840
Marty Met Calvin Harris there.

11:02.840 --> 11:03.840
Calvin Harris.

11:03.840 --> 11:04.840
I buy.

11:04.840 --> 11:05.840
But that he was.

11:05.840 --> 11:06.840
She was with Calvin Harris.

11:06.840 --> 11:07.840
Okay.

11:07.840 --> 11:08.840
So she was dating Calvin.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.840
Calvin was the fan.

11:10.840 --> 11:11.840
Calvin.

11:11.840 --> 11:12.840
I don't know.

11:12.840 --> 11:13.840
She's.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.840
Listen.

11:14.840 --> 11:15.840
Sage.

11:15.840 --> 11:16.840
I will say.

11:16.840 --> 11:17.840
If I'm like scrolling through.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.840
The head gum tick talks for you page.

11:19.840 --> 11:22.840
It is a lot of tick talks about Taylor Swift.

11:22.840 --> 11:23.840
Okay.

11:23.840 --> 11:24.840
So I'm thinking.

11:24.840 --> 11:26.840
There's a good connection.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.840
That's like four, bud.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.840
She was supporting me.

11:30.840 --> 11:31.840
That's true.

11:32.840 --> 11:33.840
Yeah.

11:33.840 --> 11:34.840
And ultimately, that's my job.

11:34.840 --> 11:35.840
Yeah.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.840
Well, now the whole conversation shifted to you, isn't it?

11:37.840 --> 11:38.840
That's exactly what you were.

11:38.840 --> 11:40.840
So I have a question.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.840
Have we actually introduced Sage?

11:43.840 --> 11:45.840
Sage.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.840
Let's get your plugs up top because it's.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.840
Again, don't call to come back at the debut.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.840
What do you do at the network?

11:52.840 --> 11:55.840
And let's say your full street address.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.840
Okay.

11:56.840 --> 11:57.840
Thank you.

11:57.840 --> 11:58.840
Yeah.

11:58.840 --> 12:00.840
I'm a marketing intern.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.840
I'm not going to tell you my street address.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.840
But I did just recently moved.

12:04.840 --> 12:05.840
I would have been.

12:05.840 --> 12:06.840
Okay.

12:06.840 --> 12:07.840
That's.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.840
So much information.

12:09.840 --> 12:10.840
Okay.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.840
Can you just say upper west side?

12:12.840 --> 12:14.840
And then I'll insert it where you say you left.

12:14.840 --> 12:15.840
Live.

12:15.840 --> 12:16.840
Uh.

12:16.840 --> 12:17.840
I lived in.

12:17.840 --> 12:18.840
I've done what I'm doing.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.840
Why do you want her to live on the upper west side?

12:20.840 --> 12:21.840
Yeah.

12:21.840 --> 12:22.840
I don't live on the upper west side.

12:22.840 --> 12:23.840
Sorry, because that's straightforward enough.

12:23.840 --> 12:24.840
It's not.

12:24.840 --> 12:25.840
It's literally not.

12:25.840 --> 12:26.840
And a half.

12:26.840 --> 12:27.840
I just like this.

12:27.840 --> 12:28.840
I gave you a half earlier.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.840
So now we're going to be going in half increments.

12:30.840 --> 12:34.840
I just love this idea of sage sort of living out this like sex in the city.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.840
Wait, I have a great story about sage.

12:36.840 --> 12:37.840
All right.

12:37.840 --> 12:38.840
On this topic.

12:38.840 --> 12:43.840
Something I think about really every time I get on a meeting with sage is that we all went out.

12:43.840 --> 12:44.840
I know it's going to be.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.840
We all went out for dinner after.

12:47.840 --> 12:48.840
Was that after show?

12:48.840 --> 12:49.840
Yeah.

12:49.840 --> 12:50.840
Yeah.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.840
You weren't there.

12:52.840 --> 12:53.840
After I had gone a happy hour.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.840
We went to a diner and everyone ordered.

12:57.840 --> 13:04.840
Like food that a 30 year old would eat right before bed and sage ordered a black coffee and french fries.

13:04.840 --> 13:05.840
Yeah.

13:05.840 --> 13:11.840
I was like, what will really put me in a good night's sleep and sage was like, I drink black coffee all day and all night.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.840
It was a very cool flex.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.840
Also the polyunsaturated fats fatty acids rather.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.840
It's like that'll keep me up all night.

13:18.840 --> 13:19.840
I can't do.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.840
I can't eat fries like I used to.

13:21.840 --> 13:22.840
We are 25.

13:22.840 --> 13:23.840
Yes.

13:23.840 --> 13:24.840
I actually very close to me.

13:24.840 --> 13:25.840
I know.

13:25.840 --> 13:26.840
I know.

13:26.840 --> 13:27.840
That's in order that I would like.

13:27.840 --> 13:28.840
Is black coffee.

13:28.840 --> 13:29.840
D.C.

13:29.840 --> 13:30.840
We're not crazy.

13:30.840 --> 13:31.840
Lots of.

13:31.840 --> 13:32.840
She like and so.

13:32.840 --> 13:33.840
No.

13:33.840 --> 13:34.840
No.

13:34.840 --> 13:35.840
D.C.F.

13:35.840 --> 13:36.840
It was regular.

13:36.840 --> 13:37.840
I mean, I was good.

13:37.840 --> 13:38.840
I will say I bet on your members.

13:38.840 --> 13:39.840
Some of the fries were like.

13:39.840 --> 13:40.840
Flasad.

13:40.840 --> 13:41.840
Like they were not crisp.

13:41.840 --> 13:42.840
Yeah.

13:42.840 --> 13:43.840
They were.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.840
You put on your poured water on her fries.

13:46.840 --> 13:47.840
Just eating them.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.840
Which I've never ever experienced before.

13:49.840 --> 13:50.840
Who did that?

13:50.840 --> 13:51.840
You.

13:51.840 --> 13:52.840
Oh.

13:52.840 --> 13:53.840
Wait.

13:53.840 --> 13:54.840
What?

13:54.840 --> 13:55.840
Yeah.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.840
You said I used to have a box who would do this.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.840
And then you dumped your fries.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.840
That's like five.

14:01.840 --> 14:02.840
I have my own counter going.

14:02.840 --> 14:03.840
That's only strike one for me.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.840
That's four strikes.

14:05.840 --> 14:06.840
Uh.

14:06.840 --> 14:07.840
That is strike.

14:07.840 --> 14:08.840
Did do that.

14:08.840 --> 14:09.840
Remember?

14:09.840 --> 14:10.840
We were like.

14:10.840 --> 14:11.840
The diner.

14:11.840 --> 14:12.840
People did.

14:12.840 --> 14:16.840
We were kind of discriminated against in that diner.

14:16.840 --> 14:17.840
Yeah.

14:17.840 --> 14:18.840
They hated us.

14:18.840 --> 14:20.840
They sat us like by the bathroom.

14:20.840 --> 14:21.840
What do you think of what?

14:22.840 --> 14:24.840
I will say I think Casey ordered an end cream.

14:24.840 --> 14:25.840
He did.

14:25.840 --> 14:26.840
He did.

14:26.840 --> 14:27.840
So.

14:27.840 --> 14:28.840
Sage just answered the question.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.840
Because I said, what did you think it was of why your entire table was discriminated against?

14:31.840 --> 14:32.840
Yeah.

14:32.840 --> 14:33.840
She answered it.

14:33.840 --> 14:34.840
That Casey was there.

14:34.840 --> 14:35.840
Now I get it.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.840
Do you guys ever go to Sarah Dippity 3?

14:39.840 --> 14:40.840
No.

14:40.840 --> 14:41.840
What was that?

14:41.840 --> 14:42.840
Have you never?

14:42.840 --> 14:44.840
I recently watched movie.

14:44.840 --> 14:45.840
I was married.

14:45.840 --> 14:46.840
I obviously know what he's talking about.

14:46.840 --> 14:47.840
That's just over.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.840
Actually, just recently learned that that's an important movie.

14:50.840 --> 14:53.840
In the Jeff Cannon.

14:53.840 --> 14:54.840
Yeah.

14:54.840 --> 14:55.840
In the Jeff Cannon.

14:55.840 --> 14:56.840
My life.

14:56.840 --> 14:57.840
Yeah.

14:57.840 --> 14:58.840
Sage.

14:58.840 --> 14:59.840
Yeah.

14:59.840 --> 15:00.840
Recently watched Sarah Dippity.

15:00.840 --> 15:01.840
Not for the first time.

15:01.840 --> 15:02.840
Just again.

15:02.840 --> 15:03.840
A rewatch.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.840
And I don't think I like it that much anymore.

15:06.840 --> 15:07.840
What is this?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.840
The first time I really enjoyed it.

15:09.840 --> 15:10.840
But the second watch.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.840
I was like, I don't know about this.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.840
Okay.

15:14.840 --> 15:15.840
I was just thinking that I should rewatch it.

15:15.840 --> 15:16.840
But I guess I shouldn't say.

15:16.840 --> 15:17.840
I watched it in there.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.840
I watched it once a year on the holidays.

15:19.840 --> 15:20.840
Yeah.

15:20.840 --> 15:21.840
I was doing my holiday watch.

15:21.840 --> 15:22.840
And I thought I was okay back then.

15:22.840 --> 15:23.840
Maybe not.

15:23.840 --> 15:24.840
I was like six for a year.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.840
Is it because you think you have a chance?

15:26.840 --> 15:28.840
With Kate back in sale?

15:28.840 --> 15:29.840
Oh, me?

15:29.840 --> 15:30.840
Yeah.

15:30.840 --> 15:31.840
She dates younger.

15:31.840 --> 15:32.840
She does date younger guys.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.840
He knows that.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.840
I think I could charm her, yeah.

15:40.840 --> 15:41.840
Yeah.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.840
I don't really know what I didn't like about it this time.

15:44.840 --> 15:47.840
I think I think just like they were never together throughout the whole movie.

15:47.840 --> 15:48.840
I don't think I like that.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.840
It's an anti-comedy romance.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.840
It's an anti-romance romantic comedy.

15:53.840 --> 15:54.840
Yeah.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.840
In this new digi era of...

15:58.840 --> 15:59.840
Digi.

16:00.840 --> 16:03.840
Discord instead of discourse.

16:03.840 --> 16:04.840
Right?

16:04.840 --> 16:05.840
Reddit instead of...

16:05.840 --> 16:06.840
I read that.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.840
And instead of XOXO in real life,

16:11.840 --> 16:13.840
IRL instead of...

16:14.840 --> 16:15.840
Fanny.

16:16.840 --> 16:17.840
Right?

16:17.840 --> 16:18.840
What?

16:18.840 --> 16:19.840
Nobody makes woppy anymore.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.840
There's a bunch of articles about how it's like if you don't think you're...

16:21.840 --> 16:25.840
If you think you're the only one in the world not having as much sex as other people, you're actually not.

16:25.840 --> 16:26.840
So...

16:26.840 --> 16:28.840
There is a whole thing about like...

16:28.840 --> 16:29.840
Are you Gen Z?

16:29.840 --> 16:31.840
I'm a Zelenial.

16:31.840 --> 16:32.840
They say...

16:32.840 --> 16:33.840
What about you, Sage?

16:33.840 --> 16:34.840
I'm Gen Z.

16:34.840 --> 16:36.840
I was born in 2001.

16:36.840 --> 16:37.840
Wow.

16:37.840 --> 16:38.840
What month?

16:38.840 --> 16:39.840
I'm 22.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.840
So I don't know.

16:41.840 --> 16:42.840
But I don't know.

16:42.840 --> 16:43.840
You don't know what month?

16:43.840 --> 16:44.840
I'm feeling 22, I think.

16:44.840 --> 16:45.840
Okay.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.840
Maria, I appreciate the restraint you've shown.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.840
Since you got the four in the half strike.

16:51.840 --> 16:52.840
What month?

16:52.840 --> 16:53.840
Sage?

16:53.840 --> 16:54.840
May.

16:54.840 --> 16:55.840
Okay.

16:55.840 --> 16:56.840
Taurus or...

16:56.840 --> 16:57.840
Gemini.

16:57.840 --> 16:58.840
Got it.

16:58.840 --> 17:01.840
But well before 911, so she remembers.

17:01.840 --> 17:02.840
Yeah.

17:02.840 --> 17:03.840
Well, I don't remember.

17:03.840 --> 17:04.840
I was like a couple months old.

17:04.840 --> 17:07.840
911 was actually one of my first memories.

17:07.840 --> 17:10.840
We have to take break.

17:11.840 --> 17:15.840
Oh, yeah.

17:15.840 --> 17:17.840
Wait, wait, don't tell me.

17:17.840 --> 17:20.840
You're a millennial who misses what life was like in the 2000s.

17:20.840 --> 17:24.840
And you had a hard time finding new or curated music?

17:24.840 --> 17:30.840
And you're interested in multiple perspectives on relationships dating and music.

17:30.840 --> 17:34.840
You're the exact type of person who's going to love see the thing is.

17:34.840 --> 17:39.840
A podcast hosted by Grammy Award winning R&B Artist Bridget Kelly and Media personality

17:39.840 --> 17:42.840
and podcast Trailblazer, Mandy Bee.

17:42.840 --> 17:47.840
Twice a week Bridget and Mandy have nostalgic conversations in their grown segments, political

17:47.840 --> 17:52.840
pop culture conversations and their honest segments, and relationship hot-take conversations

17:52.840 --> 17:54.840
in the slightly toxic segment.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.840
The opinions on the show are real and are brought to you by the genuine connections that

17:58.840 --> 18:02.840
the ladies have with the guests who they like to call their friends with benefits.

18:02.840 --> 18:07.840
Each week you'll also leave with some new music recommendations or a full curated playlist

18:07.840 --> 18:11.840
that you didn't even know you needed in their freshly squeezed music segment.

18:11.840 --> 18:16.840
Recently the ladies have sat down with Ari Lennox, Big Fridia, Muni Long, Chloe Bailey,

18:16.840 --> 18:17.840
and Neo.

18:17.840 --> 18:21.840
So go check out one of those episodes if any of those names popped out to you.

18:21.840 --> 18:27.840
Follow and subscribe to see the thing is on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, or on YouTube.

18:27.840 --> 18:32.840
New audio episodes drop every Tuesday and Friday and visuals are available on YouTube, Wednesday

18:32.840 --> 18:33.840
and Saturday.

18:33.840 --> 18:34.840
Check it out.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.840
Guys, I don't always get the best sleep, right?

18:36.840 --> 18:38.840
Show is sort of evidence of that.

18:38.840 --> 18:43.840
But if you're a longtime listener, you might know that I've been drinking AG1 for about two years now

18:43.840 --> 18:49.840
and it's severely helped my sleep quality and the clarity with which I wake up in the morning.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.840
When I started drinking AG1 daily, I was living in New York,

18:52.840 --> 18:56.840
Mike has showed it to me in the office and I kind of tried it just to be like,

18:56.840 --> 18:57.840
what is it tastes like?

18:57.840 --> 18:58.840
And it tasted great.

18:58.840 --> 19:03.840
And I realized that I'd spent all these years spending a ton of money on various pills

19:03.840 --> 19:07.840
and vitamins and supplements in pill form where I was taking like 12 pills a day

19:07.840 --> 19:11.840
and eventually you can't afford it or and or you just don't want to do it.

19:11.840 --> 19:13.840
You don't want to swallow that many pills every day.

19:13.840 --> 19:18.840
And that's where AG1 came in where I was getting a baseline nutritional insurance

19:18.840 --> 19:21.840
where each day I knew I was getting my vitamin C.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.840
I knew I was getting my B vitamins.

19:23.840 --> 19:27.840
I knew I was getting my magnesium to support my immunity and my sleep

19:27.840 --> 19:29.840
and lower my stress levels, et cetera.

19:29.840 --> 19:30.840
It really does work.

19:30.840 --> 19:33.840
And that's because AG1 is a foundational nutritional supplement

19:33.840 --> 19:36.840
that supports your body's universal needs,

19:36.840 --> 19:39.840
like gut optimizations, stress management and immune support,

19:39.840 --> 19:41.840
things everyone needs.

19:41.840 --> 19:44.840
Since 2010, AG1 has led the future of foundational nutrition,

19:44.840 --> 19:47.840
continuously refining their formula to create a smarter,

19:47.840 --> 19:50.840
better way to elvine your baseline health.

19:50.840 --> 19:54.840
I've been telling all my friends and family to start taking it

19:54.840 --> 19:56.840
and I've even had some family members and friends start taking it

19:56.840 --> 19:59.840
and tell me that they do feel like they have more energy when they wake up

19:59.840 --> 20:01.840
like they wake up without that sluggishness.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.840
So, you know, if that's something you value,

20:03.840 --> 20:05.840
I would definitely give AG1 a try.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.840
AG1 is the supplement that I trust

20:07.840 --> 20:10.840
to provide the support my body needs daily.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.840
And that's why they've been a partner of the show for so long.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.840
So, if you want to take ownership over your health,

20:15.840 --> 20:16.840
it starts with AG1.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.840
Try AG1 and get free.

20:18.840 --> 20:21.840
One year supplies a vitamin D3K2

20:21.840 --> 20:25.840
and five free AG1 travel packs with your first purchase.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.840
Go to drinkag1.com slash what's that?

20:28.840 --> 20:31.840
Check it out!

20:31.840 --> 20:34.840
Taylor Swift has the Swifties.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.840
What do I have?

20:36.840 --> 20:37.840
Right?

20:37.840 --> 20:40.840
That's a good, that's a good medical leave.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.840
I said, should we invent one now?

20:42.840 --> 20:43.840
No, no, no, no, no.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.840
What do I have?

20:45.840 --> 20:47.840
That's a great question.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.840
I do think we should come up with this.

20:49.840 --> 20:50.840
Is it the dummy?

20:50.840 --> 20:53.840
I do think we should come up with this.

20:53.840 --> 20:54.840
Is it the dummy?

20:54.840 --> 20:57.840
I do think we should come up with this.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.840
Do you have any ideas?

20:59.840 --> 21:01.840
The dumbassers?

21:01.840 --> 21:03.840
The dumbies?

21:03.840 --> 21:04.840
Jeffeties.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.840
I like the Jeffeties.

21:06.840 --> 21:07.840
The gummies.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.840
Say, can you say Jeffeties with an Indian accent?

21:09.840 --> 21:10.840
I'll give you $1,000.

21:10.840 --> 21:11.840
Oh, no, thank you.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.840
I'm okay.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.840
Uh, that was a test.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.840
The James is...

21:17.840 --> 21:20.840
She doesn't even have the protection of being a full-time employee.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.840
Neither do I.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.840
What about the fucking, yeah, I don't know.

21:25.840 --> 21:26.840
What about the middle name?

21:26.840 --> 21:27.840
Aaron.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.840
Nothing there.

21:29.840 --> 21:30.840
I know.

21:30.840 --> 21:33.840
What about just the Jeffries?

21:33.840 --> 21:34.840
That's...

21:34.840 --> 21:35.840
Sorry.

21:35.840 --> 21:36.840
Can we...

21:36.840 --> 21:38.840
I'm going to strike five and a half.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.840
And he's opening a safe side.

21:41.840 --> 21:42.840
That was me.

21:42.840 --> 21:43.840
Well, I should have done it like this.

21:43.840 --> 21:47.840
That was me turning off the shut off album of Marie Gossol.

21:47.840 --> 21:48.840
She would ding you.

21:48.840 --> 21:49.840
What?

21:49.840 --> 21:50.840
What?

21:50.840 --> 21:54.840
I said shutting off the valve of you.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.840
Maybe just as rude if not rude or by the way.

21:57.840 --> 21:58.840
But not by him.

21:58.840 --> 22:00.840
It would be funny if your...

22:00.840 --> 22:01.840
Travis.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.840
Fan was Kate.

22:02.840 --> 22:03.840
Base.

22:03.840 --> 22:04.840
So...

22:04.840 --> 22:06.840
Was...you're just your full name.

22:06.840 --> 22:08.840
A bit of the Swifties.

22:08.840 --> 22:10.840
The Jeffrey James is...

22:10.840 --> 22:11.840
Jeffrey.

22:11.840 --> 22:12.840
Who's my Travis?

22:12.840 --> 22:14.840
Is it Kate Beckon-Sale or...

22:14.840 --> 22:15.840
No.

22:15.840 --> 22:16.840
Maybe you want to make it.

22:16.840 --> 22:19.840
What would you define as the Travis?

22:19.840 --> 22:23.840
Like the guy that was like thirsty on Maine.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.840
I think it's the woman who came into my world,

22:27.840 --> 22:29.840
not only rocked it, but added security.

22:29.840 --> 22:30.840
Right?

22:30.840 --> 22:31.840
It's like...

22:31.840 --> 22:33.840
No more Joe Allen types.

22:33.840 --> 22:34.840
No more...

22:34.840 --> 22:36.840
No more of me, Lolly Gagging,

22:36.840 --> 22:38.840
by dating someone like the 1975.

22:38.840 --> 22:39.840
And I don't mean the lead singer.

22:39.840 --> 22:40.840
I mean the entire band.

22:42.840 --> 22:44.840
Okay.

22:44.840 --> 22:45.840
Bitch.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.840
I'm kind of hoping for you.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.840
It's my only Cyrus.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.840
Do you think she's milling about her?

22:52.840 --> 22:54.840
In terms of waiting and...

22:54.840 --> 22:55.840
For you.

22:55.840 --> 22:56.840
For me?

22:56.840 --> 22:57.840
She's just being mildly.

22:57.840 --> 22:58.840
Yeah.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.840
Lusely exactly Cyrus.

23:04.840 --> 23:07.840
I don't think I would get along with mildly at all.

23:07.840 --> 23:08.840
Really?

23:08.840 --> 23:10.840
You don't really know her?

23:10.840 --> 23:13.840
I don't know her personally, but I know her brand.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.840
And if my brand is anything like my actual personal life,

23:16.840 --> 23:18.840
she's very different.

23:18.840 --> 23:19.840
Yeah.

23:19.840 --> 23:20.840
I got an ultimately...

23:20.840 --> 23:22.840
None of us really know anything about you.

23:22.840 --> 23:23.840
Or mildly.

23:23.840 --> 23:24.840
As a person.

23:24.840 --> 23:25.840
What do you think you know more?

23:25.840 --> 23:26.840
Miling Cyrus for me?

23:26.840 --> 23:27.840
Probably mildly.

23:27.840 --> 23:28.840
I'm near.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.840
He's not here.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.840
I don't really know you at all.

23:32.840 --> 23:35.840
And I've known mildly as a celebrity for like my whole life.

23:35.840 --> 23:36.840
So...

23:36.840 --> 23:37.840
Wow.

23:37.840 --> 23:38.840
Yeah.

23:38.840 --> 23:39.840
Since May of 2001.

23:39.840 --> 23:40.840
Yeah.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.840
Were you a Hannah Montana fan?

23:42.840 --> 23:43.840
Love.

23:43.840 --> 23:44.840
Hannah Montana.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.840
Still watch it even.

23:45.840 --> 23:46.840
Wow, really.

23:46.840 --> 23:47.840
Yeah.

23:47.840 --> 23:48.840
Yeah.

23:48.840 --> 23:49.840
Like with my friends.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.840
It's like a good pre-going-out show.

23:51.840 --> 23:52.840
I'm going out.

23:52.840 --> 23:53.840
I'm going out.

23:53.840 --> 23:54.840
And then I also want it, though.

23:54.840 --> 23:55.840
Never been to the box.

23:55.840 --> 23:56.840
Don't even know if...

23:56.840 --> 23:57.840
I don't know what that is.

23:57.840 --> 23:58.840
But...

23:58.840 --> 23:59.840
Okay.

23:59.840 --> 24:00.840
Carmella.

24:00.840 --> 24:01.840
Just like a round town.

24:01.840 --> 24:02.840
Carmella?

24:02.840 --> 24:03.840
I know.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.840
I don't know.

24:05.840 --> 24:06.840
Fucking...

24:06.840 --> 24:07.840
The Johnson's.

24:07.840 --> 24:08.840
I don't...

24:08.840 --> 24:09.840
Are you naming real places?

24:09.840 --> 24:10.840
The Johnson.

24:10.840 --> 24:11.840
These are all places in...

24:11.840 --> 24:12.840
Laced.

24:12.840 --> 24:13.840
Oh.

24:13.840 --> 24:14.840
I only just fully.

24:14.840 --> 24:15.840
Recently.

24:15.840 --> 24:16.840
All of the Johnson's.

24:16.840 --> 24:17.840
And there's the Johnson's.

24:17.840 --> 24:18.840
And I like the Johnson's better.

24:18.840 --> 24:19.840
Are you kidding?

24:19.840 --> 24:20.840
No.

24:20.840 --> 24:21.840
There's two places.

24:21.840 --> 24:22.840
Yeah.

24:22.840 --> 24:23.840
That's crazy.

24:23.840 --> 24:24.840
It sucks.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.840
Doesn't suck as much as the box.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.840
I'd love to see Sage at Dumbo House.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.840
Just railing lines of coke in the bathroom.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.840
Walking out and then doing work.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.840
Editing a social clip for fucking...

24:34.840 --> 24:35.840
Factually.

24:37.840 --> 24:38.840
What...

24:38.840 --> 24:40.840
When do you think they're going to offer your full-time position?

24:40.840 --> 24:41.840
Sage?

24:41.840 --> 24:42.840
Um...

24:42.840 --> 24:43.840
I don't...

24:43.840 --> 24:44.840
Who can say?

24:44.840 --> 24:46.840
You can ask that, obviously.

24:46.840 --> 24:47.840
Really?

24:47.840 --> 24:48.840
But what?

24:48.840 --> 24:50.840
I can say...

24:50.840 --> 24:52.840
How much piles have sold for?

24:52.840 --> 24:53.840
No.

24:53.840 --> 24:54.840
You can.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.840
Marika, when do you think they're going to demo you to intern?

24:57.840 --> 24:58.840
Give Sage your to that.

24:58.840 --> 24:59.840
Sage.

24:59.840 --> 25:00.840
I need time.

25:00.840 --> 25:01.840
I think.

25:01.840 --> 25:04.840
I kind of think like Marika runs the whole company.

25:04.840 --> 25:05.840
She does.

25:05.840 --> 25:06.840
It's on the right.

25:06.840 --> 25:07.840
Yeah.

25:07.840 --> 25:08.840
Here we go.

25:08.840 --> 25:09.840
Just...

25:09.840 --> 25:10.840
Did you nail that?

25:10.840 --> 25:11.840
Just...

25:11.840 --> 25:12.840
I think it should be an athlete.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.840
So maybe...

25:14.840 --> 25:16.840
Someone on the...

25:16.840 --> 25:17.840
What about like...

25:17.840 --> 25:19.840
Sip smoke and piles?

25:19.840 --> 25:21.840
I don't know what it is with...

25:21.840 --> 25:22.840
I mean, I'm not going to be as defensive with you,

25:22.840 --> 25:23.840
but like...

25:23.840 --> 25:24.840
Because you've been on the show and you...

25:24.840 --> 25:25.840
That's fine.

25:25.840 --> 25:26.840
You're so...

25:26.840 --> 25:27.840
That's like...

25:27.840 --> 25:28.840
One against on you.

25:28.840 --> 25:29.840
Why?

25:29.840 --> 25:32.840
The counters at the bottom of the screen are going crazy.

25:32.840 --> 25:33.840
It's so hard to do.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.840
She pointed like she agreed with me.

25:35.840 --> 25:36.840
I do agree with you.

25:36.840 --> 25:37.840
And I didn't think you were interrupting.

25:37.840 --> 25:38.840
No.

25:38.840 --> 25:39.840
And I don't want your tone of voice to go higher,

25:39.840 --> 25:40.840
because in people think that I'm like...

25:40.840 --> 25:41.840
Simone Biles would...

25:41.840 --> 25:44.840
If you did Simone Biles, all of our lives would get better.

25:44.840 --> 25:45.840
Do you think I would apply to emails?

25:45.840 --> 25:46.840
Do you think I would apply to emails?

25:46.840 --> 25:47.840
You would reply to texts.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.840
That spreadsheet that I send you would be all filled out every week.

25:50.840 --> 25:51.840
Yeah.

25:51.840 --> 25:52.840
Because you think that I would...

25:52.840 --> 25:54.840
Like her discipline couldn't help, but it would be yourself onto me.

25:54.840 --> 25:56.840
She would not be up for us.

25:56.840 --> 25:57.840
Yeah. She wouldn't...

25:57.840 --> 25:58.840
She wouldn't put up with anything else.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.840
What I was about to say is that she's so short

26:00.840 --> 26:01.840
that I could carry her around,

26:01.840 --> 26:02.840
but she's stronger than me.

26:02.840 --> 26:03.840
She could carry you around.

26:03.840 --> 26:04.840
Exactly.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.840
Which is kind of all anyone wants, right?

26:06.840 --> 26:08.840
To carry you around.

26:08.840 --> 26:09.840
I don't want to carry you around.

26:10.840 --> 26:11.840
Not me specifically.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.840
Everyone wants to be carried.

26:13.840 --> 26:14.840
I'm very mean.

26:14.840 --> 26:15.840
I'm very mean.

26:15.840 --> 26:16.840
I'm very mean.

26:16.840 --> 26:17.840
I'm very mean.

26:19.840 --> 26:20.840
Fuck you guys, right?

26:20.840 --> 26:22.840
Because I tried to send you a note.

26:22.840 --> 26:23.840
She's never heard of.

26:23.840 --> 26:24.840
What is that?

26:24.840 --> 26:25.840
Oh, I know.

26:25.840 --> 26:26.840
That's my word son.

26:26.840 --> 26:27.840
Yeah.

26:27.840 --> 26:28.840
Yeah.

26:28.840 --> 26:29.840
That's super natural.

26:29.840 --> 26:30.840
Yeah.

26:30.840 --> 26:31.840
All right, here we go.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.840
I'm like, you know, I haven't done this in a while.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.840
I've gotten to the next that is so...

26:36.840 --> 26:37.840
I really need to be quiet.

26:38.840 --> 26:39.840
But they're enjoying it.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.840
So while we're sitting here, could I please?

26:41.840 --> 26:42.840
I'm not enjoying it.

26:42.840 --> 26:44.840
So I'm asking you, can you be quiet?

26:44.840 --> 26:46.840
I'm asking yes or no.

26:46.840 --> 26:47.840
Answer it please.

26:47.840 --> 26:48.840
I'm not going to go to jail.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.840
Can you please answer my question?

26:50.840 --> 26:52.840
Are you willing and able to be quiet right now?

26:52.840 --> 26:53.840
I'm doing what the Lord is saying.

26:53.840 --> 26:54.840
I'm asking you a question.

26:54.840 --> 26:55.840
Yes or no?

26:55.840 --> 26:56.840
I'm your flight leader.

26:56.840 --> 26:57.840
I need you to follow my instruction.

26:57.840 --> 26:58.840
Okay.

26:58.840 --> 26:59.840
My instruction treat.

26:59.840 --> 27:00.840
I answer my question.

27:00.840 --> 27:01.840
Are you able to be quiet?

27:01.840 --> 27:02.840
What are you guys saying?

27:02.840 --> 27:04.840
I'm asking you, man.

27:04.840 --> 27:05.840
No.

27:06.840 --> 27:08.840
This is you emailing me.

27:10.840 --> 27:11.840
I'm which one?

27:11.840 --> 27:13.840
You're the flight leader.

27:13.840 --> 27:14.840
Okay.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.840
You're like, can you record on Tuesday?

27:16.840 --> 27:17.840
Yes or no?

27:17.840 --> 27:19.840
And I'm like, I'm doing what the Lord is telling me to do.

27:19.840 --> 27:20.840
You're like, right.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.840
Can you do what the Lord is telling you to do on Tuesday?

27:22.840 --> 27:23.840
And then like, what do you guys think?

27:23.840 --> 27:25.840
And I turn around to nobody.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.840
No, it's like a community of zero.

27:27.840 --> 27:28.840
Yeah.

27:28.840 --> 27:32.840
As I was saying, I think it's more that yours, yours,

27:32.840 --> 27:34.840
you're the woman and we're saying, can you be quiet?

27:34.840 --> 27:35.840
Yeah.

27:35.840 --> 27:36.840
And I'm looking out to the audience.

27:36.840 --> 27:39.840
Any audience isn't even vouching for me because the ask is,

27:39.840 --> 27:40.840
do you guys want me to be quiet?

27:40.840 --> 27:43.840
And all the comments are like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

27:43.840 --> 27:44.840
Yeah.

27:44.840 --> 27:49.840
I can't tell if people really actually just like playfully love the show and they like to play along or if that be truly what we do.

27:49.840 --> 27:50.840
Oh.

27:50.840 --> 27:54.840
I think they do genuinely like the show.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.840
They're definitely some people we do.

27:56.840 --> 27:57.840
No.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.840
There are some people who hate the show with a passion.

27:59.840 --> 28:00.840
What's they say?

28:00.840 --> 28:01.840
What is it?

28:01.840 --> 28:02.840
Yeah.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.520
listen to it and never liked it.

28:04.520 --> 28:08.320
There's some people that say that they hate it

28:08.320 --> 28:10.360
by ultimately listen every week.

28:10.360 --> 28:12.760
We don't care as long as you want the numbers.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.480
Yeah, the impression.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.560
Maybe it should be more controversial.

28:16.560 --> 28:19.680
No, no, I think you're controversial enough.

28:19.680 --> 28:20.360
How's so?

28:20.360 --> 28:22.760
Name one controversial thing I've said on this episode.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.640
U.S. sage should do an Indian accent.

28:24.640 --> 28:26.080
That's what we're talking about.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.080
That was the name.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.560
That was sage almost.

28:28.560 --> 28:29.560
No, no.

28:29.560 --> 28:32.400
That's what we're talking about.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.760
So, well, I guess my question is like,

28:33.760 --> 28:35.000
what are your guys' notes for this woman?

28:35.000 --> 28:36.720
What should you have done or which of the flight we'd have done

28:36.720 --> 28:37.560
differently?

28:37.560 --> 28:38.880
What were you have done if you were any of those she used

28:38.880 --> 28:39.720
in the service?

28:39.720 --> 28:41.760
I think she said, are you going to submit a jail?

28:41.760 --> 28:44.640
So, would she have stopped if he said, yes?

28:44.640 --> 28:46.760
Because I think you're going to, if she's going to do it,

28:46.760 --> 28:49.640
she needs to commit so hard that she would go to jail for it.

28:49.640 --> 28:52.640
Yeah, that is a good point.

28:52.640 --> 28:53.440
That's a good point.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.040
I will say that that's a, you know,

28:55.040 --> 28:56.880
it's almost an intrusive hypothetical

28:56.880 --> 28:59.080
because it all starts with what if.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.600
Yeah, and he didn't answer.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.440
Right.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.880
That's the go based on what she did

29:02.880 --> 29:05.240
and what you would have done if you were her.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.120
If I was really committed to singing,

29:07.120 --> 29:09.360
I think I would keep singing.

29:09.360 --> 29:11.480
This is interesting because now I feel like sage

29:11.480 --> 29:14.920
is questioning gospel singer Bobby Storm's

29:14.920 --> 29:16.800
dedication to the crowd.

29:16.800 --> 29:21.360
I love the idea that sage specifically,

29:21.360 --> 29:23.080
given what I know of her personality,

29:24.400 --> 29:25.080
would go to jail.

29:25.080 --> 29:25.920
Would be singing.

29:25.920 --> 29:26.760
Would be singing.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.440
I mean, I would never sing on a plane.

29:28.440 --> 29:30.520
I never even opened my mouth to speak.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.360
That's all I can do.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.520
If I hear something next, that row,

29:35.520 --> 29:38.840
are you really enabled to help and get some emergency?

29:38.840 --> 29:42.240
You're just like, silent, doesn't want to happen.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.440
If I was this woman and I really wanted to sing,

29:44.440 --> 29:45.480
and the Lord was telling me to,

29:45.480 --> 29:47.040
I think I would risk it all.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.440
Yeah, because like, who do you,

29:49.440 --> 29:51.320
I guess if you're her, who do you care about more

29:51.320 --> 29:53.840
of the Lord or this flight leader?

29:53.840 --> 29:56.240
I'd turn, but I've never heard about it, right?

29:56.240 --> 29:57.240
Right.

29:57.240 --> 29:59.640
I ultimately, I often feel like people who have

29:59.640 --> 30:01.800
us strongly from God have it easier

30:01.800 --> 30:05.840
because they have like kind of a rule book to follow.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.960
But in this case, her belief in God

30:07.960 --> 30:10.560
is making it a lot harder for her to live on this plane.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.320
I would say that the checklist you made for me

30:12.320 --> 30:13.960
to make sure that I record everything

30:13.960 --> 30:15.840
was sort of its own gospel.

30:15.840 --> 30:23.840
And it's a little star striking slash also divine to be

30:23.840 --> 30:27.800
here with the creator of my word of God.

30:27.840 --> 30:30.440
I thought your gospel was be joy.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.840
Get wise, embellish faith.

30:32.840 --> 30:36.040
And whatever the last one we came up with was,

30:36.040 --> 30:36.880
what's not going to happen?

30:36.880 --> 30:38.040
It's just a new testament.

30:38.040 --> 30:38.840
It's exactly right.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.280
It's a both report and the one I'm not going to have

30:40.280 --> 30:41.600
is someone like, especially like,

30:41.600 --> 30:43.800
Marie, good and I say, putting me in a rock.

30:43.800 --> 30:44.320
Right.

30:44.320 --> 30:45.880
The show isn't just about be joy.

30:45.880 --> 30:46.920
It's not just about getting wise.

30:46.920 --> 30:48.200
It's not just about embellishing faith.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.640
It's not just about conquering fear.

30:49.640 --> 30:51.720
It can expand from there, can contract from there.

30:51.720 --> 30:52.960
Today, it's all about this.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.240
I, here's what I will say.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.920
It doesn't mean a fire across.

30:55.920 --> 31:00.640
Oh, I often feel like being on the show is like,

31:00.640 --> 31:02.640
you're just like forming different alliances based on

31:02.640 --> 31:03.760
who else is in the room.

31:03.760 --> 31:04.280
Sure.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.960
But it's really hard for me.

31:05.960 --> 31:07.440
Like, I don't see Sage and Marie.

31:07.440 --> 31:07.960
Go right now.

31:07.960 --> 31:09.560
You made their screen so small.

31:09.560 --> 31:10.400
Yeah.

31:10.400 --> 31:14.960
And so I can feel my like, I can feel my alliance.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.880
Like going down the chair of this window.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.800
Any word to out.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.800
She's going Joe.

31:20.800 --> 31:24.000
Oh, those are your followers.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.880
Look at the Joe's, the Joe's mouth.

31:25.880 --> 31:27.720
If you're going to be to follow my instructions,

31:27.720 --> 31:30.120
you will not be taking this flight up there.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.400
Are you able to get one?

31:31.400 --> 31:33.240
Like the chair says, oh, yeah.

31:33.240 --> 31:34.280
Oh, okay.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.480
I didn't realize.

31:35.480 --> 31:36.760
Didn't realize what's going on there.

31:36.760 --> 31:37.760
Yeah.

31:37.760 --> 31:42.400
If that's the case, if that's the case, this brave.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.800
If you're the person in charge of it all, then it's all over.

31:45.800 --> 31:46.800
All right.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.440
Thank you.

31:49.440 --> 31:53.120
This is the moment of pure embarrassment.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.120
What was that?

31:54.120 --> 31:55.120
What did you say?

31:55.120 --> 31:57.360
Just like the Lord is telling me to tell you to stop.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.360
Yeah.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.360
Oh, what did she say?

32:00.360 --> 32:01.360
Oh, yeah.

32:01.360 --> 32:02.360
All right.

32:02.360 --> 32:06.360
Some of the songs we can't forgive.

32:06.360 --> 32:07.360
All right.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.360
And you've been down.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.360
Nobody wants it.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.360
I don't know what to do.

32:10.360 --> 32:17.840
No one else has ever had an issue, but it's no one else has ever had an issue.

32:17.840 --> 32:18.840
She's about to sing.

32:18.840 --> 32:19.840
Are we all ready?

32:19.840 --> 32:20.840
Yeah.

32:20.840 --> 32:21.840
So yeah.

32:22.840 --> 32:34.560
I'm going to say this beautiful.

32:34.560 --> 32:35.560
No, she's incredible.

32:35.560 --> 32:36.560
Yeah.

32:36.560 --> 32:37.560
It's great.

32:37.560 --> 32:46.640
Oh, so I just want to say the point out that the angle, that this is filmed at, there was

32:46.640 --> 32:51.800
a moment where the entire angle shifted and it looked like.

32:51.800 --> 32:52.800
Well, it's going down.

32:52.800 --> 32:58.640
I don't know why anybody has a problem with this.

32:58.640 --> 33:01.880
The plane is already going down and I was going to sing itself to sleep.

33:01.880 --> 33:04.040
Oh, she should reach out to God right in that moment.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.040
Yeah.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.040
That's true.

33:06.040 --> 33:07.040
Jesus.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.040
I took the rain.

33:08.040 --> 33:09.040
I did.

33:09.040 --> 33:11.040
Immediately.

33:11.040 --> 33:12.040
Switch sides.

33:12.040 --> 33:18.160
I was on her side after she acted so shocked that it wasn't okay that she was singing.

33:18.160 --> 33:20.920
She was like, oh, you want me to stop?

33:20.920 --> 33:25.000
Oh, well, that's like, you're, oh, okay, then I guess I will and then she doesn't.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.520
And I'm on her team and I think she's right.

33:27.520 --> 33:31.440
I would be so pissed.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.880
I hate people on flights.

33:33.880 --> 33:37.400
I'm a missing throw up on flights, sage style.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.760
And I'm like, here's the thing what Delta started doing.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.440
I don't know if you guys have been on a flight recently.

33:41.440 --> 33:44.040
Would just say the day on Delta.

33:44.040 --> 33:45.440
They've been playing song.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.440
Yeah, they do play song.

33:46.440 --> 33:47.440
Yeah.

33:47.440 --> 33:48.440
It's a full ball.

33:48.440 --> 33:49.440
Like five, 45.

33:49.440 --> 33:50.440
Yeah.

33:50.440 --> 33:52.240
Like before the plane started.

33:52.240 --> 33:53.240
It's insane.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.240
Oh, my.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.240
Who wanted that?

33:55.240 --> 33:57.440
I have no idea, but I am like, shut the fuck up.

33:57.440 --> 34:01.240
Yeah, it's crazy like 20, 23 elevator music.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.240
Yeah.

34:02.240 --> 34:07.080
So in that situation, I would prefer that Bobby storm is on my flight singing to me instead.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.080
That's true.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.080
The first version of it.

34:09.080 --> 34:16.120
Virgin was doing just like songs, just normal radio songs at full volume.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.760
And that was a lot too.

34:17.760 --> 34:19.840
I'm staying in a virgin hotel next week.

34:19.840 --> 34:20.840
What do you guys think about that?

34:20.840 --> 34:21.840
Where are you going?

34:21.840 --> 34:22.840
Where are you going?

34:22.840 --> 34:23.840
Yeah.

34:23.840 --> 34:26.840
I'm going to Las Vegas with my whole family for Thanksgiving.

34:26.840 --> 34:27.840
That's fine.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.840
And I'm meeting Erica there and she's going to take my family clubbing.

34:30.840 --> 34:31.840
That's crazy.

34:31.840 --> 34:32.840
You played that right over at the important moment.

34:32.840 --> 34:34.840
I didn't want to see it auto played because I actually am.

34:34.840 --> 34:35.840
Yeah.

34:35.840 --> 34:36.840
She's taking me clubbing.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.840
She's getting a table and bottle service.

34:38.840 --> 34:42.240
The only thing I know about Erica is that she loves Vegas and she loves the clubs and

34:42.240 --> 34:43.240
Vegas.

34:43.240 --> 34:44.840
And I get to experience that with her.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.840
We should have her on to talk about it after.

34:46.840 --> 34:47.840
Thank you.

34:47.840 --> 34:48.840
That would be a great episode.

34:48.840 --> 34:54.840
I don't think if Erica ever invited me to go clubbing with her in Vegas.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.840
I think we both would have an awful time.

34:56.840 --> 34:57.840
I think I would ruin her night.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.840
I don't like clubbing.

34:59.840 --> 35:00.840
Oh.

35:00.840 --> 35:01.840
And I would be a web link.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.840
I'd be like, why can't we just go back to buffet?

35:03.840 --> 35:07.840
Because there was a Boston cream thing that I wasn't ready for because I ate too much

35:07.840 --> 35:08.840
of the salty shit.

35:08.840 --> 35:09.840
And then now I want the dessert.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.840
And I just want to go back to say, we want to come.

35:11.840 --> 35:12.840
And I'd be like, what do you say?

35:12.840 --> 35:13.840
Can't you hear it?

35:13.840 --> 35:14.840
Because we're in a club.

35:14.840 --> 35:15.840
And I'd be like, that's why I don't like clubs.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.840
And I'd be like, you meet too because they misheard me because of the music.

35:17.840 --> 35:18.840
Right.

35:18.840 --> 35:19.840
And they thought that you were trying to be fun anywhere.

35:19.840 --> 35:20.840
Yeah.

35:20.840 --> 35:21.840
And then they go dancing away.

35:21.840 --> 35:22.840
And then I'm like, wait.

35:22.840 --> 35:23.840
Where'd you guys go?

35:23.840 --> 35:24.840
Because I barely know her friends.

35:24.840 --> 35:25.840
I met them that day.

35:25.840 --> 35:26.840
Right.

35:26.840 --> 35:27.840
And I already decided that I don't like two of them.

35:27.840 --> 35:28.840
One of them we might be friends.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.840
And then one of them I'm like, this guy's just awesome.

35:30.840 --> 35:33.840
And then by the other weekend, I'm like, actually, he's a little problematic.

35:33.840 --> 35:34.840
Sure.

35:34.840 --> 35:35.840
Sage, can I ask you this?

35:35.840 --> 35:36.840
Yeah.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.840
You've never heard the show before.

35:38.840 --> 35:40.840
I want to listen to the show before.

35:40.840 --> 35:41.840
How many times?

35:41.840 --> 35:43.840
Once or twice or like consistently.

35:43.840 --> 35:44.840
At once.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.840
More than a handful of times.

35:46.840 --> 35:47.840
Okay.

35:47.840 --> 35:48.840
Okay.

35:48.840 --> 35:51.840
What I was worried about was that it was going to be a half episode that you turned off.

35:51.840 --> 35:52.840
No.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.840
I think it's never bad to like things.

35:54.840 --> 35:55.840
Like things is good.

35:55.840 --> 35:57.840
What about not like things?

35:57.840 --> 36:00.840
That's less good because then you don't get to like something.

36:00.840 --> 36:01.840
I agree.

36:01.840 --> 36:02.840
But I don't like clubbing in Vegas.

36:02.840 --> 36:03.840
I'm not going to apologize for that.

36:03.840 --> 36:04.840
And I hate our culture.

36:04.840 --> 36:05.840
And yeah.

36:05.840 --> 36:06.840
Sage is right.

36:06.840 --> 36:07.840
Sage is right.

36:07.840 --> 36:10.840
I'll send you photos from the club.

36:10.840 --> 36:12.840
I know what it is.

36:12.840 --> 36:13.840
I know what it has.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.840
I've been inside of clubs.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.840
And others.

36:18.840 --> 36:21.840
Subsequently.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.840
It gets boring after a while.

36:24.840 --> 36:27.840
And others.

36:27.840 --> 36:28.840
Sage.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.840
You've listened to a handful of episodes.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.840
More than a handful I'd say.

36:32.840 --> 36:33.840
Love that.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.840
But I don't know the exact amount.

36:35.840 --> 36:36.840
Yeah.

36:36.840 --> 36:37.840
Having listened to a more than a handful.

36:37.840 --> 36:38.840
Those are your words not mine.

36:38.840 --> 36:39.840
Yeah.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.840
And having been on one episode.

36:41.840 --> 36:43.840
What's wrong with it?

36:44.840 --> 36:47.840
I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

36:47.840 --> 36:48.840
It's just.

36:48.840 --> 36:49.840
Well, I don't know.

36:49.840 --> 36:50.840
Many people.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.840
I wouldn't say it's like flawless.

36:52.840 --> 36:57.840
But I don't think you should change your direction to fit.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.840
What people want.

36:59.840 --> 37:00.840
Wow.

37:00.840 --> 37:01.840
Brave.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.840
I would disagree.

37:03.840 --> 37:04.840
No, but I think.

37:04.840 --> 37:05.840
Sorry.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.840
I would strike one.

37:07.840 --> 37:08.840
I don't disagree with that.

37:08.840 --> 37:10.840
But I think you should change your.

37:10.840 --> 37:14.840
Be heavier to fit specifically what audience and I want.

37:14.840 --> 37:15.840
Work flows.

37:15.840 --> 37:16.840
Yes flows.

37:16.840 --> 37:18.840
Communication is good.

37:18.840 --> 37:20.840
But you're on the show persona.

37:20.840 --> 37:21.840
It's fine.

37:21.840 --> 37:22.840
It's not too great.

37:22.840 --> 37:23.840
It's in fine.

37:23.840 --> 37:26.840
It's the persona non-governed or as a persona oh,

37:26.840 --> 37:27.840
grab.

37:27.840 --> 37:28.840
and not, I can't.

37:28.840 --> 37:29.840
I'm, run.

37:29.840 --> 37:30.840
I'm.

37:30.840 --> 37:33.840
No I appreciate the honest feedback.

37:33.840 --> 37:35.840
I really did feel true to me.

37:35.840 --> 37:36.840
Slash.

37:37.840 --> 37:38.840
Others.

37:38.840 --> 37:48.680
others. This is so fucked up. I appreciate content-wise that you guys can appreciate content-wise

37:48.680 --> 37:54.520
what I put out. I appreciate the word choice, the diction of direction. It is creative direction,

37:54.520 --> 37:59.320
isn't it? It's not just an outline. It's not just what I bring to the show every week, the energy.

37:59.320 --> 38:03.960
It's like, it's a specific creative direction that's leading us down a path. Is it the right path

38:04.040 --> 38:08.040
who can say, but it is leading us down a path, and that is direction, and that is leadership.

38:12.840 --> 38:17.000
Yeah, are you proud of the work you've done? Great question. Well part of the issue, I have a little bit

38:17.000 --> 38:26.520
of Hamilton and me. Alexander. I will never be satisfied. Okay. I'll be satisfied. Yeah. He doesn't sing that one.

38:26.600 --> 38:34.680
No, the only episode that I've been truly satisfied by was the live show at Grammarcy.

38:34.680 --> 38:38.840
And then also the All-Women episode, and then the All. The one you barely participated in.

38:38.840 --> 38:44.840
The post-notcial episode. That one just came out. They're good ones. Yeah, this is also an All-Women episode.

38:44.840 --> 38:50.600
That's true. Yeah, true. All the audits were good, and I like the writing advice things.

38:51.240 --> 38:54.680
But everything else I have notes, and it's not always on me. It's not...

38:54.680 --> 38:59.800
So we should start retaking some of those. Redoing those episodes. Yeah, they'll have you version.

39:01.800 --> 39:08.200
The Audit Jeffs version is really funny. I think they might have just given us our first series

39:08.200 --> 39:12.200
thing of next year, which is the Audit Jeffs version. It's really good. And it's me auditing your

39:12.200 --> 39:19.880
guys' ass. Yeah. Oh, something to say to Audit us, Audit yourself. Yeah, Audit, you're a performance

39:19.880 --> 39:24.760
of those episodes. But you have to do the Audit. I don't know. Maybe you said you know,

39:24.760 --> 39:29.560
they will offline. Yeah, but it would be good for you to get the rights to those episodes.

39:29.560 --> 39:33.560
Finally. And ultimately, you should check in with both of the rare producers,

39:33.560 --> 39:37.720
me and Ania before you really sign off on any specific thing like that.

39:39.880 --> 39:43.160
Marika stands up for an away that I never couldn't. It's really brave.

39:45.400 --> 39:49.800
To get the rights to the Audit episodes, the writing advice episodes, the post-notcial episode,

39:50.280 --> 39:54.360
all producers episode. I would make still pennies on the dollar because it would just be,

39:55.080 --> 39:59.880
how many episodes have they been? A hundred and eighty? It would be. You've relinquished a lot

39:59.880 --> 40:05.720
of rights every time you use copyrighted music. Yeah, an episode. Which we've so many times

40:05.720 --> 40:14.680
we've asked you not to do. So, is he chuckle? But that's kind of like the vibe of the show. Is it like

40:14.680 --> 40:20.040
your rule breaker? Yeah. But yeah, I'm like Danny. You got to learn. You got to learn when

40:21.080 --> 40:29.720
Danny's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit in there. Yeah, so I'm the bad boy of

40:29.720 --> 40:34.920
headgum. Let's go ahead and say it. And the bad thing. That's like haze. I'm not for sale.

40:35.720 --> 40:40.280
Hey, oh yeah, I was like he does not work. I know that you're talking about now. I was going to say it's

40:40.280 --> 40:48.760
sage, but because of the black coffee in price. We got to wear callbacks. We got to end the episode

40:48.760 --> 40:55.560
there and also Uncle Jeffrey has acupuncture. How do you afford this stuff? Do you have a

40:55.560 --> 41:01.160
niece or nephew? I have acupuncture today too. I don't have acupuncture. I just want to get the

41:01.160 --> 41:05.480
fucker. That was embarrassing for me. That was embarrassing for me because I lied and got caught in the

41:06.440 --> 41:10.600
eye. All the times. Yeah. What do you guys do for your mental health? I'm

41:11.800 --> 41:16.760
proud of that. Yeah, I think it's therapy. I see a psychiatrist. I go on a lot of the

41:16.760 --> 41:23.640
acid. I don't go on enough walks. I do do acupuncture. I do physical therapy.

41:24.200 --> 41:29.640
Marie, can I both have treadmill tests at home though? Yeah. Do you actually? Yeah. I want to get a

41:29.640 --> 41:33.480
treadmill. Every time you send us a frustrating text or email, we have to fire that thing up.

41:35.560 --> 41:41.880
You just got it like it is powered like a lawnmower. You're pouring gasoline in it.

41:43.160 --> 41:47.000
You just come with an oil thing. You have to oil it. I don't mind. I've never done that. I

41:47.000 --> 41:51.560
mean that. You don't mind oil. You're someone come with a oil? I don't really know where to put it.

41:51.560 --> 41:56.120
You'll have to swear. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, you're your boyfriend, you're comfortable.

41:56.440 --> 42:02.920
What are you guys having going on? Let's start with Sage and I swear to God,

42:02.920 --> 42:12.120
Marie, go. Yeah. Strike 11 or whatever. Sage. Thank you. Yeah, I don't have a whole lot going on.

42:12.120 --> 42:21.800

42:21.960 --> 42:26.360
act. So go on Marie goes and then like scroll to find me and her following.

42:27.400 --> 42:32.440
You're asking me to do a lot. I don't have to do it. But if they want to, that's how to find me.

42:33.400 --> 42:41.000
And is number one the Scooby-Doo movie live action? Sorry. Then isn't your favorite movie on there?

42:41.000 --> 42:44.600
Well, they've seen that's how long that would see you because we do this. We'll be doing number one.

42:44.600 --> 42:50.600
First one, not the second one. Okay. What about a screening of the live action Scooby-Doo

42:50.600 --> 42:56.760
in Portland, Oregon? So it's Damian and Matt. The two lilyards opening the fucking screening.

42:56.760 --> 43:02.600
Right. Right. That'd be amazing. I wouldn't travel the Portland, too, see it. Damian

43:02.600 --> 43:09.480
lilyard is related to the actor. He's not. He also doesn't live in Portland anymore. Marie, go where do you go?

43:11.640 --> 43:18.120

43:44.360 --> 43:54.680

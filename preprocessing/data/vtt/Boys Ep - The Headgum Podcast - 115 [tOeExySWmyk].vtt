00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
Happy birthday dear Jake.

00:37.000 --> 00:51.000
Happy birthday to Jake.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
It's Friday, August 5th, which is Jake's birthday.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
I'm so excited for it.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
The episode is dropping on the 12th, which I thought you were going to say today is his birthday.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah, but next week is my, are you going to sing it on the next episode for me?

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Or why would, oh, is your birthday soon?

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
My birthday is on the, on the drop date of this episode, August 12th,

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
and I kind of gave you a little bit of forwarding, like, maybe we should, I didn't think maybe we should sing,

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
but I don't know, just thought maybe you would have something for me.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
Oh, um, I don't check Slack often.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
Oh, like I do check Slack actually every day, but if I see an notification like Johnny Villa,

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
I'm like, oh, it's like kind of selective.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Like selective hearing, yeah, but yeah.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah, selective notifications, okay.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Are you 25?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
But Jake's not going to see that.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
No, Jake doesn't care today.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I'm just so excited about his day.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Well, you know, it's for the day.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah, he hasn't been like on Slack. He hasn't messaged anybody. I don't think.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
I think he's out of office today.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Yeah, because it's his birthday.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
It's a big day.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Yeah.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Are you going to get the day off?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Me?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Yeah.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
No, the grind doesn't stop.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Not even on your birthday.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Not even on Christmas.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Not even on New Year's.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Those are, the latter three are all things that, uh,

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
everyone's out of the office for. You don't have to be there.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
I don't have to be there.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
So last, so on December 25th, 2021, what are you doing?

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
I was kind of just on the computer waiting at my inbox.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Waiting for an email to come in, but nothing came in.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Thought that was a little peculiar.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
And did you build that day like does that count?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Or your salary?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
So that doesn't matter whether you worked or not there or not.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Yeah.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
But like, I attempted to build it with Marty.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
He kind of just ignored the Slack.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
But you tried powering forward.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
So you worked on Christmas.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
You're a salary to employ full time.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
And you tried to build them hourly.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah, because for some reason, it wasn't registering that I worked on Christmas

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
in, uh, in the payroll.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Great.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Because it doesn't matter when you work.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
You did that to you.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
And you didn't even work.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You did that to you.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Waiting by the inbox counts as work for me.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Are you 25 today or 26?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
25, quarter life crisis.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Yeah.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Because now are you.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Huge smile.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
So yeah, what are you experiencing in a quarter life crisis?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Are you seeing goals shift?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Are you making any changes?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Uh, no changes.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
I think that I was a perfect person yesterday as I was today.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
So what a boring life if you think you're perfect in humanity.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Like I've nothing to grow towards or for.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
I mean, I guess I like the only things I really change are the toilet paper and my clothes.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I guess like nice.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Yeah.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
So that'll be on the out of context, Twitter, I think.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Uh, yeah.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
We're having fun.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Johnny Villas, uh, smooth vocals on the sacks right now.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
And also, uh, grace and wise,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
bringing up the rear and Brad Hilds on the day.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Um.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
This is sort of a boys episode.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Sort of.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Kind of, man.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Because it's like, we got the young guns of head gun.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Uh.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Uh.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
On young guns.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
The young guns.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
Which isn't even true because Brad, you have deteriorating gingerbread.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Yeah.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Yeah.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
We're kind of raised on how and then came back.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
He said.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Uh-huh.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Yeah.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
My number.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Liquid.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I have mayo gums.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Uh, which I learned about on Mayo Clinic.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Um.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Uh, I did have a, we don't have a Johnny's birthday segment plan,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
but I wanted to wax all things Johnny's birthday,

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
for at least the first 15 minutes.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Um, Johnny, what don't you want for your birthday?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
All right.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Don't want for my birthdays.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Anybody to be frowning for any reason.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Yeah.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
And just in your, like, people you know or the entire world.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Stranger.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
So if I'm walking walking on the street and I hear somebody kind of crying,

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
I better see a smiling face when I come over there.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Right.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
And they're a frown.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Yeah.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Just like the silent creasing of a forehead.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
If that is New York City.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
So there's going to be people frowning on the sidewalk.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Hmm.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Well, we'll have to switch it up for just a day.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Is that all right?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I don't ask me.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
I won't be there.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I promise you.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
I won't frown next Friday.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Okay.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Thank you.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Uh, but we, we were going to talk about hair.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Uh, and Grayson, you have short hair.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Brad, you have short hair.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Johnny, you and I basically have the same face and hair.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Yeah.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
What are you considering a change?

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
Or are you keeping the locks and the stash going forward?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
So I've into the New Year.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Into.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Enough.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Enough.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
I am planning on keeping the stash for sure.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
You know, one time when I was shaving, I accidentally trimmed two short on the little go tea.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
And I think I'll keep it short here and then kind of a little bit longer here.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
But both trimmed.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Like a recently cut his hair.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
So he used to have the long locks.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Now he does knocks.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
And.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
That's so stupid.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
So Mike, it doesn't have the long locks anymore.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
And he told me the next time I saw him in the office.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
Like, Oh, yeah, I was becoming a long hair guy.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
You're slowly becoming a long hair guy, too.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
So what you want.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
It seemed kind of pointed.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Right.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
But I don't know if that's the kind of personality I want to move forward with the long hair.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
But what does that entail?

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Like, what is the long hair guy?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
I don't know.

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
But I understand what he means where it become where the long hair becomes too much of your personality.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
It kind of engulfs you in a way.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Yeah.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I guess I asked because I'm in.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
I'm on the teeter totter again for the first time in months.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I don't think I want to cut it.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
What's that?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Teeter totter as in.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
Oh, just like, I've been going to like, a lesion park and like thinking.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
I don't know the right deal that you're going with.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
I don't know.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
It's been like, I think I'm going to keep it.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
But I feel it becoming like, I don't recognize photos of me.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
You just have fun.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Just more fear, right?

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
Like, I saw a photo of, um, I don't remember who it was, but they had like,

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
short, medium-length hair with the hair with the hat with the sacks.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
And it looked really good.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
You saw a photo of Ferris.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Yeah.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Ferris.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Shout out Ferris.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
We should have Ferris back on.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
He left the show.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
But I want to have him on for like an exit in every.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
That would be a nice little, a little segment.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Good luck getting the hold of him.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
That's true.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
If you're considering a change, don't.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Don't move.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Okay.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Don't break up with people.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Don't start dating anyone.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
You're stifling your life.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Exactly.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
You don't want to grow as a person.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
I think if you get to a place where you feel joy at rest,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
that's your best.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
And you shouldn't change anything.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I did recently hear of a friend of mine,

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
who is dating somebody that he does not want to continue dating.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
And when asked why he won't break up with them, his response was,

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
I just want to skate through life.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
I fear inertia.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
That friend was a polo, oh no.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Famous figures.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Or speed skater.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Right.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
No, it was good.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Hello, oh no.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Nice.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Really?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
No, go a polo.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Oh no.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Grayson has your cock.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Every time.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Well, this is a nice guy's episode.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Yeah.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
It is.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
This is locker room talk.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Yeah.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
locker room.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Cock.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Perfect.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
That's where you experience major shrinkage,

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
because you want to make a good impression.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
That's 24-hour fitness.

09:56.000 --> 10:06.000
Uh-huh.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Because you had a bad day.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
You saved us.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I saw him just to try it out.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
You saved us.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Um.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Fucking, uh.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Grayson's cock.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
And you still work out.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
He probably still works out of gold's Jim and Hollywood.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I used to work out there.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
And uh, yeah.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
He was just one of those old guys who would walk around swinging that thing.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Uh-huh.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Hither than Thither around the locker room.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
And uh, hey, good for him.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
I don't know what else to say.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
I don't know what else to say either.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
I assume it was, uh.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
That was a nice looking one.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
No, it was fine.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
I was like, it was more of the confidence.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Yeah.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
He has a low voice.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Like, that's a lot of tea testosterone.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Right.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
There's veins.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Yeah.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
I think.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
There's no way he wasn't juicing.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
I think it really is funny that when you take antibiotics, steroids, your balls shrink.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Hmm.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Like, that's such a funny funny.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
I didn't really funny.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Hilarity to me.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Like, yeah.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
You might get like super jacked.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
But like, you're also losing it where it counts.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Because people are the balls where it counts.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Yeah.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Yeah.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Yeah.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
If I could wax, uh, fill us off.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
I'll go about my, fill us up.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Fill a cock of gold for a second.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Um.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
There we go.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
There we go.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
This is a little block.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Let's go.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
We can have a little bit of fun.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Uh.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Sexual part is a mine are appalled by my balls.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Hmm.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Have you guys ever seen, like, a nectarine?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Yeah.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Yeah.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Yeah.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
No.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Sure.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
What?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Um.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Let's keep it going with everybody's bond.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
We keep it short because I hate this segment now.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Can I have to do it until the next one is cast.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Otherwise, it's, uh, it's a real bummer.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Uh, I'm going to go with, um,

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I'm, I'll go with.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Very nice.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Time for a small balled bond.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I agree.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Let it be.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Come on.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
We're going to get bonds.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
Hmm.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
There's always a tough question.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
I have to think about, uh, who I've seen recently.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Yeah.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Yeah.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
And I think Dane Cook is kind of a front runner.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
There's no way.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
He's, he's, he's not in shape at all.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
He's faces and handsome.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
I'm sorry.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
It's a great shame.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
And then he's pretty.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Mostly that.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Yeah.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Yeah.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
They're trying to get away from James Bond being a creep too.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Yeah.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I agree that we should be less of a creep.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
But if we want to do a little bit of a remake of, uh,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
let's say, from Russia with love.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Or golden eye.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
But I think that he's the, he's the best guy for us.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Yeah.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Brad.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Who?

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
Uh, I mean, how do I, how do I beat that?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Uh, my pussy.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Nice.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Do we have to call it that now?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Does it become really obvious?

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
So now the new James Bond is Brad's pussy.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Yeah.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
My pussy.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Yeah.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Okay.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
That's what you're doing.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
My pussy.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
My pussy.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Octopussy.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
That's good.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Johnny.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Thank you.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Solid man.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
That's good.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
That's really good.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
All right, Grayson.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Um, this one might have already come up.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
So I don't, like, forgive me if I'm repeating.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
I've been.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
It's been a.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
I'm saying.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Pim.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
I should have even continued.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
I should have even continued.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Uh, yeah.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
How about a minute?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
The bond between father and son.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I'm excited.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Uh.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I'm excited.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Nice.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
That should have been on my soundboard.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
But continued.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
That was because of like,

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
a minute and a half ago, somebody said solid.

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
So a minute and a half ago, you missed your chance.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
You got to let it slide every now and then.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
I don't think so.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
It's hard to run and Gucci slides.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
They just say that.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
They do.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Yeah.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Grayson.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Grayson.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Your bond of the week.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Yeah.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
I said my bond of the week.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
But you were playing a sound.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
You were playing a soundboard.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
But you were playing a soundboard.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
But you were playing a soundboard.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Did you say Larry David?

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Yeah.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
I did.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Not what he said.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
A bond that is just incredulous.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
He fails the mission.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
M. Cosm.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Well, how to go.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
But.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
But.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
But.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Pretty good.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
That's a sketch for a head gum westman.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
Really?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Oh, he froze.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Can't just.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Now he he just was silent like an anger.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
We have to take a break.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Oh.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
Yeah.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
That Friday energy.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
We haven't recorded this show on a Friday in a minute.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
It was so sour just moments ago.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
It was sour.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
There's a difference.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Oh, fuck.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
I had something I was going to say.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Well, we're just talking.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
I don't know.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
It was all the way before the break.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
I was so long ago.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Yeah.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
This is so bad.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
I'm guessing to be like.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I was going to say.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Like the second time that's happened.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Can I ask Brad a question?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Yeah.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Brad.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
What happened to you running this week?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Oh.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Yeah.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
I was a.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
I was attacked.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I was a costed by a mountain biker.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
I.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I slid off the trail.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
I.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
I Tomahawked backflip style.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
And I was.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I got road rash from the slide.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
Um, I hit my knee on a on a tree.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Oh, that's nice.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
That's right.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
That's one.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
No.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
And then the guy like tracked me down and yelled at me and told me I was going the wrong way on the trail.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
And justified physically assaulting me.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
And I told him I'm going to go look and make sure that I was going the right way.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
And if I was, I'm going to come back and find you.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
And he was gone.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Couldn't find him.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
But.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
So my faith in humanity is.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Is at an all time low.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
So I.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I've got to do my best.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
What better way to restore it than to come on the fucking head go.

16:55.000 --> 17:03.000
I said this off air, but like Grayson and Brad both joined and Grayson's face was literally like.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
And then Brad is like.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I don't know what I do.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
That makes.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
It's so.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Joyless to be on the show.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I think we do some pretty fun stuff.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
That's the word you're trying to find.

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
Let's take it into some news of the day.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Actually, sorry.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Can we stop for a second?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Yeah.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I got like a notification on my phone.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I'm seeing a notification has come through.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
It's for be real.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Is it cool if I take a picture for be real?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Sure.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
All right.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Just talking with yourselves for just a quick second.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Okay.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Good.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Good content.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
And he's gone.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I didn't take it yet.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I have my phone right now.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
You guys know what be real is, right?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Right.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Are we going to be in the photo?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
So be real for those who are unaware.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Do you take a picture wherever you are and you post it?

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
And it's like supposed to make social media a lot more transparent and just be like.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Oh, this is my real life.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
It's kind of boring sometimes.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
But sometimes it's fun.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Yeah.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
It's like a real kick in the teeth for.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Instagram and social media.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Zuckerberg.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Yeah.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I don't think it's an either or.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I think it is.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
I think it's both.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
And they're not mutually exclusive.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
All right.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
I'm going to take the picture.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Smiling.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
All right.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Awesome.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Cool.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Is that it?

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Yeah.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
That was it.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Oh, I just got notification.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Apparently Johnny posted a be real.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Yeah.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Oh, I need to take my be real.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Are you guys cool if I take a be real?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Yeah.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
I think it could be real.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Oh, yeah.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Alright.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
All right.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
I'll go back to the next segment.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Go ahead.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Wait, no, no.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Hold on.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Why do we have to wait?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Mike.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
We just do it in during the episode like it.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Because I'm real.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
You're not being real right now, actually.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I deleted the app.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Right.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Sucks.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
We're holding a flip phone.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Okay, Brad.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
If you have.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
If you do have be real.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
I think you're going to want.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Wait for this next segment.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Actually.

19:16.000 --> 19:16.840
and here we go.

19:16.840 --> 19:21.000
I actually got another notification.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.320
Oh, are you kidding me?

19:23.320 --> 19:25.440
Stop, stop, stop the auto drive.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.440
So I can't stop him out of the next segment.

19:27.440 --> 19:31.960
I got an notification for another app, be fake.

19:31.960 --> 19:34.960
So it's to take a picture wherever you are posted about it.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.960
But like, in the picture, do something you normally wouldn't do, you know?

19:37.960 --> 19:38.960
I'm playing.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.960
So what are you going to do?

19:40.960 --> 19:43.040
Yeah, see, like, Grace has got the right idea.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.960
See, silently put on sunglasses.

19:45.960 --> 19:46.960
Yeah.

19:46.960 --> 19:47.960
Good podcasting.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.400
That'll be cool for, like, my B cool app, actually.

19:50.400 --> 19:51.400
All right.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.400
There we go.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.800
Well, now actually, no, maybe it, that, there we go.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.400
All right, now I just like normal.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.400
All right.

19:58.400 --> 19:59.400
Okay.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.400
Can I move on to the next segment?

20:00.400 --> 20:01.400
Yeah.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.400
Go ahead and move on to the next segment.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.400
Okay.

20:03.400 --> 20:04.400
Here we go.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.400
Um, are you kidding me?

20:07.400 --> 20:13.720
Just got another notification for, um, another app I downloaded called, uh,

20:13.720 --> 20:14.720
let it be.

20:14.720 --> 20:19.720
So in this, this app, uh, you're going to find yourself in a time of trouble.

20:19.720 --> 20:20.720
All right.

20:20.720 --> 20:28.720
So, all right, three, two, one.

20:28.720 --> 20:29.720
All right.

20:29.720 --> 20:30.720
Great.

20:30.720 --> 20:31.720
All right.

20:31.720 --> 20:37.720
No more, are there any, and more apps, because I, we could just do it right now.

20:37.720 --> 20:39.720
Do not disturb Johnny.

20:39.720 --> 20:40.720
All right.

20:40.720 --> 20:41.720
Okay.

20:41.720 --> 20:42.720
No more apps.

20:42.720 --> 20:43.720
Okay.

20:43.720 --> 20:49.720
I got another one.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.720
Are you kidding me?

20:51.720 --> 20:52.720
Sorry.

20:52.720 --> 20:53.720
Uh, no.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.720
This is, uh, my period track.

20:55.720 --> 20:56.720
Yeah.

20:56.720 --> 20:57.720
Yeah.

20:57.720 --> 20:58.720
Yeah.

20:58.720 --> 20:59.720
Boys.

20:59.720 --> 21:00.720
Boys.

21:00.720 --> 21:01.720
Boys.

21:01.720 --> 21:02.720
Boys.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.720
You know what the app is?

21:04.720 --> 21:05.720
Breaking privacy laws.

21:05.720 --> 21:06.720
You know that, right?

21:06.720 --> 21:07.720
Yeah.

21:07.720 --> 21:08.720
Yeah.

21:08.720 --> 21:10.720
So what is it down from the inside?

21:10.720 --> 21:11.720
So those are breaking privacy laws.

21:11.720 --> 21:12.720
Yeah.

21:12.720 --> 21:13.720
This is breaking Brad.

21:13.720 --> 21:14.720
Yeah.

21:14.720 --> 21:16.720
This is, uh, a game I like to call breaking Brad.

21:16.720 --> 21:20.720
Basically, I think Brad has been a little too confident recently.

21:20.720 --> 21:25.720
So I thought that we could take 10 minutes to sort of tear him down.

21:25.720 --> 21:29.720
Um, I'll start, uh, Brad.

21:29.720 --> 21:34.720
I liked your hair better when it was bleached a little.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.720
I didn't know you when that.

21:36.720 --> 21:40.720
I know, but I stalked you on Instagram.

21:41.720 --> 21:42.720
Um, okay.

21:42.720 --> 21:45.720
That, I mean, I've actually been thinking about doing it again.

21:45.720 --> 21:46.720
Do you want me to?

21:46.720 --> 21:47.720
Yeah.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.720
But then it would feel like you're trying a lot.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.720
So.

21:52.720 --> 21:55.720
Okay.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.720
Let's fucking input.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.720
People rattling shit off.

21:59.720 --> 22:00.720
Okay.

22:00.720 --> 22:01.720
Yeah.

22:01.720 --> 22:02.720
Yeah.

22:02.720 --> 22:03.720
Yeah.

22:03.720 --> 22:04.720
I'll go next.

22:04.720 --> 22:05.720
Um, Jeff, on your graphic.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.720
Why does BR have two different atomic weights.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.720
Yeah.

22:09.720 --> 22:10.720
Yeah.

22:10.720 --> 22:11.720
Yeah.

22:11.720 --> 22:13.720
Yeah.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.720
Got you.

22:15.720 --> 22:17.720
Um.

22:17.720 --> 22:18.720
Yeah.

22:18.720 --> 22:21.720
It's supposed to be breaking Brad.

22:21.720 --> 22:24.720
Um, accent wall.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.720
That's trying a lot.

22:27.720 --> 22:28.720
Hmm.

22:28.720 --> 22:29.720
I guess.

22:29.720 --> 22:32.720
You're, you're just pointing out shit for my Instagram.

22:32.720 --> 22:33.720
No.

22:33.720 --> 22:34.720
It's in your room right now.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.720
You have a yellow wall and the other one's gray, I think.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.720
Oh, I didn't do this.

22:38.720 --> 22:39.720
My wife did.

22:39.720 --> 22:41.720
Well, your wife is lovely.

22:41.720 --> 22:42.720
Probably.

22:42.720 --> 22:43.720
Yeah.

22:43.720 --> 22:44.720
Yeah.

22:44.720 --> 22:45.720
I got one.

22:45.720 --> 22:46.720
I don't want.

22:46.720 --> 22:47.720
Okay, cool, cool.

22:47.720 --> 22:48.720
Jeff, your shirt is just like ugly.

22:48.720 --> 22:49.720
I don't know what to say.

22:49.720 --> 22:50.720
A lot of them that.

22:50.720 --> 22:51.720
It's good.

22:51.720 --> 22:52.720
Johnny.

22:52.720 --> 22:53.720
Yeah.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.720
It's not called breaking Jeff.

22:57.720 --> 22:58.720
Okay.

22:58.720 --> 22:59.720
We'll just.

23:01.720 --> 23:02.720
I don't know.

23:02.720 --> 23:03.720
Brad, you go.

23:03.720 --> 23:04.720
It seemed like everybody else was having fun.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.720
I don't know what to do.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.720
More like, um,

23:08.720 --> 23:09.720
Brad's.

23:09.720 --> 23:11.720
Not in the room.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.720
Where it happens.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.720
With where it happens.

23:15.720 --> 23:16.720
The room.

23:16.720 --> 23:17.720
The animal reference.

23:17.720 --> 23:18.720
Yeah.

23:18.720 --> 23:19.720
Okay.

23:19.720 --> 23:20.720
Okay.

23:20.720 --> 23:21.720
Did you just see it or something?

23:21.720 --> 23:22.720
Yeah.

23:22.720 --> 23:23.720
Yeah.

23:23.720 --> 23:25.720
I, I didn't.

23:25.720 --> 23:26.720
You haven't even seen it.

23:26.720 --> 23:27.720
You've never seen it.

23:27.720 --> 23:31.720
You don't understand the reference that you made.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.720
No, I feel like we're.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.720
Because, like, almost immediately, you guys turned it off of Brad and on to me.

23:36.720 --> 23:37.720
I don't think that's fair.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.720
I think the segments about breaking down Brad.

23:39.720 --> 23:40.720
I think that's good.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.720
Brad, do you have one for Jeff again?

23:42.720 --> 23:45.720
I've got one for me, actually.

23:45.720 --> 23:46.720
Oh, okay.

23:46.720 --> 23:47.720
Yeah.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.720
I.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.720
MF doom.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.720
More like.

23:55.720 --> 23:57.720
I'm listening.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.720
Brad is an in.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.720
The room.

24:03.720 --> 24:04.720
I like that.

24:04.720 --> 24:05.720
Where it happens.

24:05.720 --> 24:06.720
Yeah.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.720
You know, when you hear a dream of that.

24:08.720 --> 24:09.720
Yeah.

24:09.720 --> 24:10.720
It was like Hamilton.

24:10.720 --> 24:12.720
It's like a very popular joke.

24:12.720 --> 24:13.720
Yeah.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.720
But, like, you know, when you hear something that was, like, super clever.

24:16.720 --> 24:17.720
And you're just taking a back.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.720
You can't laugh at it.

24:19.720 --> 24:20.720
Like, that's just how it was.

24:20.720 --> 24:21.720
No, that's dead.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.720
Most likely what I said.

24:23.720 --> 24:24.720
Yeah.

24:24.720 --> 24:25.720
Exactly.

24:25.720 --> 24:26.720
When I brought it up, you guys, like,

24:26.720 --> 24:28.720
tried to be for not having seen Hamilton.

24:28.720 --> 24:29.720
Brad, have you ever seen Hamilton?

24:29.720 --> 24:30.720
Yeah.

24:30.720 --> 24:31.720
Yeah.

24:32.720 --> 24:33.720
Awesome, dude.

24:33.720 --> 24:34.720
So many people have seen it.

24:34.720 --> 24:35.720
It's not.

24:35.720 --> 24:36.720
Whoa.

24:36.720 --> 24:37.720
Yeah.

24:37.720 --> 24:38.720
I thought you were a fan of F1.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.720
Have you never seen Leonard Hamilton?

24:40.720 --> 24:43.720
Isn't it Lewis Hamilton?

24:43.720 --> 24:45.720
No.

24:45.720 --> 24:47.720
Ha ha ha ha.

24:47.720 --> 24:48.720
No.

24:48.720 --> 24:51.720
So, definitely an almost angry.

24:51.720 --> 24:54.720
Um, keep Portland weird.

24:54.720 --> 24:57.720
Easy when Brad's there.

24:57.720 --> 24:58.720
Hmm.

24:58.720 --> 25:02.720
I've, I've never said that before.

25:02.720 --> 25:06.720
And this, I thought everyone was going to gang up on Brad.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.720
That's why I thought this was fun.

25:08.720 --> 25:10.720
Like, with his six more minutes.

25:10.720 --> 25:11.720
He didn't do anything.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.720
I just think it's fun.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.720
Think it's fun to hurt people.

25:15.720 --> 25:16.720
Not on the bird.

25:16.720 --> 25:18.720
But, like, yeah.

25:18.720 --> 25:21.720
You want to break your breath.

25:21.720 --> 25:24.720
I'm not, like, totally.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.720
Just tonally.

25:27.720 --> 25:28.720
Ugh.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.720
Ruffointing.

25:30.720 --> 25:31.720
Uh.

25:31.720 --> 25:32.720
Re Voice-On-Out.

25:32.720 --> 25:33.720
Yeah.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.720
Here it is.

25:35.720 --> 25:38.720
Five panel hat.

25:38.720 --> 25:42.720
More like, I want my money back.

25:42.720 --> 25:43.720
Ter除.

25:43.720 --> 25:44.720
Ter除.

25:44.720 --> 25:45.720
Ter除.

25:45.720 --> 25:46.720
Ter除.

25:46.720 --> 25:47.720
Ter除.

25:47.720 --> 25:48.720
Ter除.

25:48.720 --> 25:49.720
Ter除.

25:49.720 --> 25:50.720
Ter除.

25:50.720 --> 25:51.720
Ter除.

25:51.720 --> 25:52.720
Ter除.

25:52.720 --> 25:55.720
Ter除.

25:55.720 --> 25:56.760
on Instagram.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.000
Do they hate hats?

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
I assume they do a lot of social justice initiatives too, right?

26:01.000 --> 26:01.720
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.560
He's a wonderful person.

26:04.680 --> 26:06.160
Yeah, so I think,

26:06.160 --> 26:10.840
shitting on his craftsmanship is kind of a low point of the show.

26:10.840 --> 26:11.680
Point.

26:12.960 --> 26:13.800
Shiny.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.600
All right, I completely agree.

26:16.600 --> 26:19.720
Yeah, we still have five more minutes of this shit.

26:19.720 --> 26:21.160
Did you have slides prepared

26:21.160 --> 26:23.280
or you just wanted to put the graphic up?

26:23.280 --> 26:25.520
I've just been trying to put a little more effort

26:25.520 --> 26:27.720
into the show, so I've been making graphics.

26:27.720 --> 26:32.720
And by effort, you mean BR35 and BR56?

26:34.800 --> 26:35.800
Well, yeah.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.880
What elements are those?

26:37.880 --> 26:40.760
Um, I do not care.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.800
So you don't put a lot of effort into this.

26:45.800 --> 26:51.000
And it also looks like the font that you used

26:51.000 --> 26:55.040
in Brad is different than the one that you use in breaking.

26:55.040 --> 26:58.080
Like that A is completely different.

26:58.080 --> 27:00.840
I really didn't want anybody to point out the A.

27:00.840 --> 27:04.240
I was the one thing I didn't want to happen on the show.

27:04.240 --> 27:09.240
Um, Brad, you're, uh, you're married, right?

27:09.240 --> 27:11.640
Yeah, till death do you part?

27:11.640 --> 27:12.960
I don't think so.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.040
Till death does she smile?

27:16.040 --> 27:23.680
I mean, wait, till death, just much of a fine time to let out

27:23.680 --> 27:24.680
it.

27:24.680 --> 27:29.160
So you think God is going to be sad when I die.

27:29.160 --> 27:34.840
And I meant the opposite that she isn't going to be sad when I die.

27:34.840 --> 27:41.520
T shirt on a Friday, try dressing up next time you're having a bad day.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.240
You're why I'm a shirt.

27:44.240 --> 27:47.280
I was having a good day before this.

27:47.280 --> 27:47.800
Yeah.

27:47.800 --> 27:48.520
This.

27:48.520 --> 27:49.520
All right.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.520
I can't be even breaking Brad.

27:51.520 --> 27:56.280
All right, even fucking, uh, you know, what is his name?

27:56.280 --> 27:59.520
Uh, rich Paul Aaron Paul.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.520
Yeah, er, yeah.

28:01.520 --> 28:02.520
Those are two.

28:02.520 --> 28:03.520
Those are two people.

28:03.520 --> 28:04.880
Two different people.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.520
Can you see his house tour?

28:06.520 --> 28:08.520
Yeah, architectural digest.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.160
You know, fucking cab and man.

28:10.280 --> 28:11.800
It's not like the habit.

28:11.800 --> 28:14.080
It's a mansion.

28:14.080 --> 28:21.520
Brad Hild, more like Brad Shield out too much money for his house in Eugene.

28:21.520 --> 28:22.640
I don't live in Eugene.

28:22.640 --> 28:24.760
I live in Northeast Portland.

28:24.760 --> 28:26.960
Fuck.

28:26.960 --> 28:30.680
Grayson, man.

28:30.680 --> 28:31.560
I'm not on your side.

28:31.560 --> 28:33.200
He's episode.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.160
This is a boy.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.560
This is, this is good.

28:35.560 --> 28:36.880
I think I needed this.

28:36.880 --> 28:39.480
I think I think this is exactly the kick in the butt.

28:39.480 --> 28:40.480
I needed.

28:40.480 --> 28:45.480
You know, I've been slacking a little, I, I, I didn't even know that it was black.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.480
So it's actually been really productive.

28:47.480 --> 28:48.480
I've been slacking a lot.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.480
Yeah.

28:49.480 --> 28:51.480
I've been getting a lot of work done.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.480
Johnny's been helping.

28:53.480 --> 28:55.480
He's a pleasure to work with, actually.

28:55.480 --> 28:56.480
Oh, thanks.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.480
And I played, played D and D together.

28:58.480 --> 29:00.480
We had a great time.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.480
Yeah, we did.

29:02.480 --> 29:03.480
And I love you, dude.

29:03.480 --> 29:06.480
I love most of the people on this soon.

29:06.480 --> 29:08.480
How many specifically out of three?

29:09.480 --> 29:12.480
I mean, we don't need to put a number to it.

29:12.480 --> 29:13.480
Yeah.

29:13.480 --> 29:15.480
Out of four, I would imagine that Brad loves himself.

29:15.480 --> 29:16.480
Okay.

29:16.480 --> 29:17.480
So four.

29:17.480 --> 29:18.480
I do now.

29:18.480 --> 29:19.480
I, I feel a lot better after that segment.

29:19.480 --> 29:20.480
Why?

29:20.480 --> 29:24.480
As I mentioned earlier, I, I got in a physical altercation this week with a mountain

29:24.480 --> 29:31.480
biker and yeah, been feeling a little down.

29:31.480 --> 29:32.480
Actually, hold on.

29:32.480 --> 29:36.480
I'm getting a notification.

29:36.480 --> 29:40.480
Welcome to, what are you guys seeing on screen right now?

29:40.480 --> 29:43.480
Jeffrey James has started screen sharing.

29:43.480 --> 29:44.480
Double click.

29:44.480 --> 29:45.480
Does that the name of this segment?

29:45.480 --> 29:46.480
Hang on.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.480
Here we go.

29:51.480 --> 29:52.480
Right.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.480
With baited breath, we will.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.480
Welcome to Chase and Grayson.

29:56.480 --> 29:59.480
What is this?

29:59.480 --> 30:02.480
Oh, this one Johnny's excited about.

30:02.480 --> 30:03.480
Yeah.

30:03.480 --> 30:04.480
I'm excited for this one.

30:04.480 --> 30:05.480
Return of the balldo.

30:05.480 --> 30:10.480
This is a segment I like to call Chase and Grayson.

30:10.480 --> 30:13.480
This is basically, because Grayson, the last time you're on the show,

30:13.480 --> 30:18.480
we were talking about how you got either stood up or turned down for a date.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.480
Both.

30:20.480 --> 30:21.480
Both.

30:21.480 --> 30:22.480
Yeah.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.480
I still went on the date.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.480
And then she went and show.

30:25.480 --> 30:26.480
Right.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.480
Which she had told me beforehand.

30:28.480 --> 30:32.480
We are choice.

30:33.480 --> 30:36.480
But I thought that we could just, we could sort of wax

30:36.480 --> 30:42.480
Chastity in terms of like alternative to sexual intercourse

30:42.480 --> 30:47.480
for Grayson to partake in,

30:47.480 --> 30:50.480
with in Chastity.

30:50.480 --> 30:53.480
Let me just show it here.

30:55.480 --> 30:58.480
This just an open forum.

30:58.480 --> 31:01.480
What are some things that Grayson can do

31:01.480 --> 31:04.480
to stay chasing?

31:04.480 --> 31:07.480
Chast.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.480
What about JP Morgan Chast?

31:09.480 --> 31:11.480
So you can spend as much money as you want.

31:11.480 --> 31:13.480
You don't have a credit limit, but you also can have sex.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.480
Yeah.

31:14.480 --> 31:15.480
Does your RIPR?

31:15.480 --> 31:16.480
What's that?

31:16.480 --> 31:17.480
At a zero APR?

31:17.480 --> 31:18.480
Yeah.

31:18.480 --> 31:19.480
Yeah.

31:19.480 --> 31:20.480
Okay.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.480
Or actually at a 0.1% APR.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.480
So it's the same probability as getting someone pregnant

31:25.480 --> 31:27.480
who has a copper IUD.

31:27.480 --> 31:28.480
Yeah.

31:28.480 --> 31:31.480
That's a APR stands for anal plug retention.

31:31.480 --> 31:32.480
Yeah.

31:32.480 --> 31:33.480
That's great.

31:33.480 --> 31:34.480
That's good.

31:34.480 --> 31:36.480
But I was supposed to keep it chest.

31:36.480 --> 31:40.480
Let's get Grayson into this belt for sure.

31:40.480 --> 31:43.480
And then what can he do while wearing the belt

31:43.480 --> 31:46.480
to have fun without having sex?

31:46.480 --> 31:49.480
I'm going to pitch birding.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.480
Birding as in like bird watching.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.480
Yeah.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.480
I feel like people who get into that don't have sex.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.480
But they're happy.

31:58.480 --> 31:59.480
Oh.

31:59.480 --> 32:00.480
You'd be surprised.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.480
Really.

32:01.480 --> 32:02.480
Yeah.

32:02.480 --> 32:05.480
Birding retreats are just absolute orgies.

32:05.480 --> 32:06.480
Yeah.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.480
I think if he's wearing that belt,

32:08.480 --> 32:12.480
you should go on a really long bike ride through a bumpy road.

32:12.480 --> 32:17.480
And then kind of veer someone off course.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.480
Leading to road.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.480
And then flee the scene.

32:21.480 --> 32:24.480
Look at a woodpecker with your pecker out.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.480
That's good.

32:26.480 --> 32:27.480
Am I right?

32:27.480 --> 32:28.480
Grayson.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.480
I want to take a moment now to just kind of like hear you out any concerns

32:31.480 --> 32:35.480
you have because my concern would be morning wood in that thing.

32:35.480 --> 32:36.480
Hmm.

32:36.480 --> 32:37.480
Yeah.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.480
I'm so glad that you asked.

32:39.480 --> 32:43.480
I feel like when you started the breaking Brad segment,

32:43.480 --> 32:47.480
there was sort of an understanding amongst the other three of us

32:47.480 --> 32:50.480
that we weren't going to partake.

32:50.480 --> 32:51.480
And.

32:52.480 --> 32:55.480
And for some reason.

32:55.480 --> 32:58.480
Everyone gets participate.

32:58.480 --> 32:59.480
Yeah.

32:59.480 --> 33:03.480
I guess my question is what the hell.

33:03.480 --> 33:06.480
I've for me it's the slide.

33:06.480 --> 33:07.480
You know.

33:07.480 --> 33:12.480
Definitely seem like Jeff put a lot more effort into this one with the whole

33:12.480 --> 33:15.480
making sex more than about.

33:15.480 --> 33:17.480
About more than intercourse.

33:17.480 --> 33:18.480
Yeah.

33:18.480 --> 33:22.480
Well, this is like sorry to like trigger you Grayson or like, you know,

33:22.480 --> 33:23.480
tantalize you even.

33:23.480 --> 33:26.480
Uh, this is sort of the climax of the episode.

33:26.480 --> 33:27.480
Right.

33:27.480 --> 33:28.480
So.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.480
Good word choice.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.480
I.

33:32.480 --> 33:36.480
What do you guys think about Grayson having physical contact with a potential sexual

33:36.480 --> 33:38.480
partner, but not having sex or like.

33:38.480 --> 33:41.480
Do you think cuddling would be helpful in his

33:41.480 --> 33:44.480
chastity journey or do you think it would make it worse because he's close,

33:44.480 --> 33:45.480
but no cigar.

33:45.480 --> 33:46.480
Hmm.

33:47.480 --> 33:49.480
What a weird sentence.

33:54.480 --> 33:56.480
I think it could be nice.

33:56.480 --> 34:01.480
I think you can foster intimacy in a way that isn't just focused on the end goal.

34:01.480 --> 34:02.480
Coming.

34:02.480 --> 34:03.480
What what is the.

34:07.480 --> 34:11.480
I think Grayson has a good sense of self control.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.480
So that's true.

34:13.480 --> 34:14.480
That would very much help.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.480
I think Grayson is the most like shredded person I've had.

34:17.480 --> 34:21.480
So that means that you have to have either self control or great genetics.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.480
Or both.

34:23.480 --> 34:24.480
Oh.

34:29.480 --> 34:30.480
Did that.

34:30.480 --> 34:31.480
What?

34:31.480 --> 34:32.480
What?

34:32.480 --> 34:33.480
What?

34:33.480 --> 34:34.480
What?

34:34.480 --> 34:35.480
What?

34:35.480 --> 34:36.480
What?

34:36.480 --> 34:37.480
Oh, that's why.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.480
Nice.

34:42.480 --> 34:43.480
Screen still fucked up.

34:44.480 --> 34:45.480
No, no, no.

34:45.480 --> 34:46.480
We're back.

34:46.480 --> 34:47.480
Um.

34:47.480 --> 34:52.480
This is a great example of why we should never do a boys episode.

34:52.480 --> 34:53.480
Hmm.

34:55.480 --> 34:56.480
I.

34:56.480 --> 34:57.480
I'm.

34:57.480 --> 34:58.480
I'm trying to think.

34:58.480 --> 35:00.480
I guess I should have come with some more ideas.

35:00.480 --> 35:04.480
I thought that Brad would be filming at the mouth trying to come up with ways for Grayson to stay chasing.

35:04.480 --> 35:05.480
I think.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.480
I mean, you're right.

35:07.480 --> 35:08.480
What?

35:08.480 --> 35:11.480
You thought I'd be foaming at the mouth.

35:12.480 --> 35:17.480
It's already weird first to for you to think that someone would be foaming at the mouth for anything.

35:17.480 --> 35:23.480
That alone thinking of ways for Grayson to not fuck Grayson.

35:23.480 --> 35:26.480
You go on long runs in Manhattan.

35:26.480 --> 35:28.480
Uh, yes.

35:28.480 --> 35:33.480
My fear with the belt is the jingle jangle of it all.

35:33.480 --> 35:40.480
That is not in my top five fears with that particular belt.

35:40.480 --> 35:43.480
Hmm.

35:43.480 --> 35:44.480
List.

35:44.480 --> 35:45.480
What are the fears?

35:45.480 --> 35:50.480
Yeah, top five fears with this specific chance to need to rise.

35:50.480 --> 35:51.480
Um, number one.

35:51.480 --> 35:54.480
It doesn't really go with any of my outfits.

35:54.480 --> 35:55.480
That's number one.

35:55.480 --> 35:56.480
That's number one.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.480
I.

35:57.480 --> 35:58.480
I think it does.

35:58.480 --> 36:00.480
It's stainless steel and black.

36:00.480 --> 36:01.480
That goes with everything.

36:01.480 --> 36:05.480
I feel like and that and forgive me because I'm sort of new to this.

36:05.480 --> 36:09.480
Do I wear that on under pants or over?

36:09.480 --> 36:10.480
So let me get this.

36:10.480 --> 36:19.480
So you think there's a possibility that there's a butt plug going through your doctor's into your asshole.

36:19.480 --> 36:29.480
Doct in your doctor's.

36:29.480 --> 36:35.480
That's how you like soft launch it on Instagram is like a slide front front view back view.

36:35.480 --> 36:39.480
I'm all docked in my dockers.

36:39.480 --> 36:45.480
Tagging Rocky Mountain Athletics.

36:45.480 --> 36:48.480
Concern number two.

36:48.480 --> 36:53.480
Um, concern number two is the.

36:53.480 --> 36:54.480
I don't know.

36:54.480 --> 36:59.480
I don't know what terminology to use, but I want to say the slot at the front.

36:59.480 --> 37:00.480
Yeah.

37:00.480 --> 37:01.480
Is it the bench?

37:01.480 --> 37:03.480
Is it the bend?

37:04.480 --> 37:10.480
Um, it's that it's appears to get larger as it goes.

37:10.480 --> 37:14.480
It looks like a, it looks like a deflated balloon.

37:14.480 --> 37:15.480
Yeah.

37:15.480 --> 37:25.480
And I'm, I'm concerned by, yeah, I would say the shape, the bend and the yaw.

37:25.480 --> 37:27.480
Or no.

37:27.480 --> 37:30.480
Yaw, no.

37:31.480 --> 37:32.480
Well, it seems like.

37:32.480 --> 37:33.480
Continue.

37:33.480 --> 37:39.480
Oh, I was just, there's other forms of chastity devices like you could just dress really bad.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.480
Does that kind of.

37:41.480 --> 37:43.480
Wards off any.

37:43.480 --> 37:44.480
Yeah.

37:44.480 --> 37:45.480
Tension awards.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.480
How do you do it, Jeff?

37:48.480 --> 38:04.480
Oh, that's the straw that broke the camel's back.

38:04.480 --> 38:05.480
I don't know.

38:05.480 --> 38:08.480
You can't break me.

38:08.480 --> 38:12.480
You can't break Brad, but you can make Jeff.

38:12.480 --> 38:13.480
Glad.

38:14.480 --> 38:15.480
No.

38:15.480 --> 38:16.480
That's your answer.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.480
Is it block bags?

38:18.480 --> 38:22.480
Um, I have a Tupperware drawer.

38:22.480 --> 38:28.480
That is subbing in for my boxers.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.480
Air tight seal.

38:30.480 --> 38:31.480
Or what?

38:31.480 --> 38:32.480
What?

38:32.480 --> 38:33.480
What?

38:33.480 --> 38:35.480
Veal.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.480
I'm telling you that I wear Tupperware as underwear.

38:38.480 --> 38:41.480
Don't say flasad veal, man.

38:41.480 --> 38:45.480
You said it like a riddle.

38:45.480 --> 38:48.480
The worst super villain of all time.

38:48.480 --> 38:49.480
Yeah.

38:49.480 --> 38:51.480
We have to give this for new Twitter handle for me.

38:51.480 --> 38:53.480
Brown ridler.

38:53.480 --> 38:54.480
Brown ridler.

38:54.480 --> 38:56.480
Or ridler brown.

38:56.480 --> 38:57.480
That's better.

38:57.480 --> 38:58.480
Yeah.

38:58.480 --> 38:59.480
This is ridler your first name.

38:59.480 --> 39:01.480
No, that's just my persona.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.480
Non grata or otherwise.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.480
How would you say that the ridler is like you?

39:05.480 --> 39:07.480
And I'll tell you why he's not like you.

39:07.480 --> 39:10.480
Uh, he's, he always has a plan.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.480
He's way smarter than you.

39:13.480 --> 39:16.480
Uh, he dresses in pinstripes.

39:16.480 --> 39:19.480
You don't dress in pinstripes.

39:19.480 --> 39:22.480
He has a layer.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.480
A layer.

39:24.480 --> 39:28.480
You're the most transparent person we've ever met.

39:28.480 --> 39:30.480
Forget it.

39:30.480 --> 39:31.480
Forget it.

39:31.480 --> 39:32.480
Let's round out.

39:32.480 --> 39:35.480
Grayson's last three concerns with the chassis device.

39:35.480 --> 39:38.480
And then we all lob up one more way for him to stay chased.

39:38.480 --> 39:42.480
And then we'll make haste in the opposite.

39:42.480 --> 39:46.480
Do you guys remember when you were growing up and everyone, all your parents were like,

39:46.480 --> 39:50.480
Just be careful what you put on the internet because it stays there forever.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.480
Yeah.

39:52.480 --> 39:55.480
So I was just thinking about that for some reason.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.480
Uh, kind of like an interesting sidebar.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.480
But I think that you, I unrelated.

40:00.480 --> 40:06.480
I think you should wear this Cassidy belt that goes inside your rectum and

40:06.480 --> 40:10.480
help your palace.

40:10.480 --> 40:14.480
I was in a peer to be a spot for the balls either.

40:14.480 --> 40:15.480
Hmm.

40:15.480 --> 40:16.480
Yeah.

40:16.480 --> 40:20.480
Well, that's fine because I have taken a lot of steroids.

40:20.480 --> 40:24.480
That's the only thing you like about it.

40:24.480 --> 40:26.480
Um, all right.

40:26.480 --> 40:29.480
Last thing for Grayson to stay chasing, um,

40:29.480 --> 40:34.480
I think, because you do own a gym in Denver.

40:34.480 --> 40:35.480
Yeah.

40:35.480 --> 40:38.480
Not exactly how I wanted to plug that on the show.

40:38.480 --> 40:39.480
Yeah.

40:39.480 --> 40:40.480
Denny.

40:40.480 --> 40:44.480
Is there any truth to the idea that the more mile high you go,

40:44.480 --> 40:51.480
the more your little swimmers sort of decay?

40:51.480 --> 40:53.480
Like, where are you here that?

40:53.480 --> 40:55.480
I didn't hear it anywhere.

40:55.480 --> 40:57.480
Is there any truth, too?

40:57.480 --> 41:01.480
Or does framing sexually a mile above sea level sort of

41:01.480 --> 41:05.480
strength in your tadpoles?

41:05.480 --> 41:09.480
Little swimmers?

41:09.480 --> 41:15.480
I think that's also the name of like a swim diaper company.

41:15.480 --> 41:20.480
And if not, my door is always open if you guys want to go into business.

41:20.480 --> 41:22.480
Grayson is already a business man.

41:22.480 --> 41:28.480
Johnny has the creative unlock and Brad's got say hovering from an injury,

41:28.480 --> 41:35.480
which I feel like is a good vulnerable place to start.

41:35.480 --> 41:36.480
Sure.

41:36.480 --> 41:37.480
So we started.

41:37.480 --> 41:38.480
And what are you doing?

41:38.480 --> 41:43.480
It's birthday and we ended up at swim diapers.

41:43.480 --> 41:46.480
Much like how this podcast should always go like that.

41:46.480 --> 41:49.480
Classic app.

41:49.480 --> 41:54.480
Another classic.

41:54.480 --> 41:55.480
Yeah.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.480
I'm thinking Hall of Famer this one.

41:57.480 --> 41:59.480
Boys up.

41:59.480 --> 42:00.480
Boys up.

42:00.480 --> 42:01.480
Shit.

42:01.480 --> 42:03.480
That's a new song.

42:03.480 --> 42:04.480
tadpoles.

42:12.480 --> 42:14.480
Well, what do you guys have going on?

42:14.480 --> 42:16.480
Johnny has the music coming.

42:16.480 --> 42:18.480
Do you have anything dropping soon?

42:18.480 --> 42:19.480
Sadly no.

42:19.480 --> 42:22.480
I just, I had to move.

42:22.480 --> 42:26.480
So that stressed me out for the past two months.

42:26.480 --> 42:29.480
So it took put everything on hold.

42:29.480 --> 42:30.480
Absolutely.

42:30.480 --> 42:31.480
But we're back in it.

42:31.480 --> 42:33.480
The piano is indeed here.

42:33.480 --> 42:35.480
Operator otherwise.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.480
Yes, upright.

42:36.480 --> 42:39.480
Well, spin it if we want to get real technical.

42:39.480 --> 42:42.480
But you can follow me on Instagram at Johnny V.

42:42.480 --> 42:44.480
J.O.H. and NYVI.

42:44.480 --> 42:50.480
And that's all she made.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.480
The episode ends right there.

42:52.480 --> 42:55.480
We don't get to plug Brad.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.480
Uh, follow Johnny on B real.

42:58.480 --> 42:59.480

Wow.

43:01.480 --> 43:03.480
And follow Johnny on let it be.

43:03.480 --> 43:09.480
Which seems to be real.

43:09.480 --> 43:12.480
No, you have to specifically time of trouble.

43:12.480 --> 43:14.480
This is going to go in my heart.

43:14.480 --> 43:15.480
This is going to go in my heart.

43:15.480 --> 43:17.480
This is going to go in my B cool.

43:17.480 --> 43:18.480
B cool.

43:18.480 --> 43:20.480
Having a little too much energy.

43:20.480 --> 43:23.480
Follow me on Instagram, I guess.

43:23.480 --> 43:25.480
Brad the human.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.480
Stocked me like Jeff did.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.480
I had bleach tear at one point.

43:29.480 --> 43:31.480
Grayson.

43:31.480 --> 43:34.480
Jeff, are you still trying to get to 10,000 on Twitter?

43:34.480 --> 43:35.480
I am.

43:35.480 --> 43:36.480
Okay.

43:36.480 --> 43:39.480
Then follow me on Instagram.

43:39.480 --> 43:41.480
Follow Jeff.

43:41.480 --> 43:43.480
Yeah.

43:43.480 --> 43:45.480
At Gray, K-wise.

43:45.480 --> 43:47.480
And follow the gym.

43:47.480 --> 43:49.480
At Rocky Mountain Athletics.

43:49.480 --> 43:51.480
Mountain is spelled MTN.

43:51.480 --> 43:52.480
Oh yeah.

43:53.480 --> 43:55.480
And at Jeff, we already on Twitter.

43:55.480 --> 43:58.480
We're still about 600 away from 10,000.

43:58.480 --> 44:00.480
Let me make a concrete promise.

44:00.480 --> 44:08.480
If we get to 10,000, I will post a photo of my actual ass on B real.

44:08.480 --> 44:16.480
And if not, if you will mass, if a unfollow me and mass, then you'll never see my fat ass.

44:16.480 --> 44:18.480
And we'll see you guys again next week.

44:18.480 --> 44:20.480
This whole thing was does folks.

44:20.480 --> 44:38.480
That was a hit-dum original.

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
Sometimes you need to get the hat before you become that man.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
You don't name me in.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Like, I'm not this yet, but the hat's going to make me it.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Brad, you look exhausted.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
I do.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
It just started and you look absolutely devastated.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
I mean, it's kind of rude, but...

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
All right.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
I was going to try to be nice to you today,

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
but you show up with this hat.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
You look like a golf pylon.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
You have a attitude.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
What is that?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
What was that little bottle?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
It's a non-alcoholic bitter drink.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
It's sort of become...

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Excuse me one second, actually.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
It's actually become sort of my afternoon pick me up.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Pick you up, perfect.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
We've got the guy with a leaf flow out the front door now.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
That's good for audio.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Yeah, I guess.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
What's in the drink?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Bad you ask?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Erbs, spices.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
It's like a tea that isn't really good for you.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
It's bright, Brad.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
What?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
What's needed?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Let's not break it.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Break it in your in-depth show, Brad.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Allie, how the hell are you?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
I'm good.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
I'm stuck between a Kyle Richards joke and a

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Salem witch trial joke for the hat.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Let's go with the Salem one.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
How was the burning?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
That's good.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
What was that, Brad?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I just laughed.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Thank you.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
We've got a lot to get to you today.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I'm here with a little bit late today,

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
so I'm trying not to let that sour.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
My attitude up top and away.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Uh, this whole schedule has been a mess.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
A little schedule has been a mess.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Yeah.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
We're pouring it four, 15.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
In a way.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
On-prem.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
On the day.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Yes, we've never done that on a hump day.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Did you guys have sex this morning or?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
This morning?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Yes.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
It's Wednesday.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Let's move on.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Bond of the week.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm back to Aaron Taylor Johnson.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
He did a back flip for Vanity Fair.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Did you guys see that?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
I didn't see that.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I want to see.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
But he did it.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Let's.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Well, the first one.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
He didn't hurt himself on the first one.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Very close to the knee caps.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
He said, yeah.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Yeah.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
I just think I'd love to see James.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Doing like, I don't know.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Gymnastics at the very least.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
If not a back flip.

02:53.000 --> 03:02.000
Why is that funny?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
I got this thing for $40 at a flea market.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
At a flea market.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Really?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Yeah.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Because some of these.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
I thought some of these go for like $100.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Good ones, too.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
But this one is.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Now.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Staying with come.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Yeah.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
What is that?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
It's a hat.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
What would you even call that hat?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
I mean, it's a forl hat.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
It's what I've been calling it.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
But like.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
But like.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
It looks broken.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
It looks broken in.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
It looks broken in because it's vintage.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
So I don't even have to like make sure that the bend is just so.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
There's a little dent in it.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
It has a little dent in it.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
It's an eight on it.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yes.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
That's fine.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
It's character building like wash it.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
At least like spot clean it when you bite it.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
How the fuck am I supposed to wash it, Brad?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I still spot clean.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Got it.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Damn it.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Uh.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Nature.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Nature turned.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Right?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
In conversation.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
It's important to listen and then respond intelligently and intelligibly.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
Um.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
How is that vintage?

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Like when did people ever wear that style of a hat?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
1612?

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
Like that's not is what vintage to what year is that?

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Yeah.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
Like is that like a 20 style or 80 style?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Like when was that hat made?

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
I would have to assume the 19th century.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Because it's kind of a rancher hat.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
I would say.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
You know, somebody goes to like out west.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Uh, you know.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
It's an Okie.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Let's say.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Trying to find California.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
But instead.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
What's that?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
No.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
No.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Just to the whole place.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Yeah.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Ha ha ha ha.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Uh.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Enough about the hat.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
I wanted you guys to talk amongst yourselves for a bit.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Get all the bullshit out that you guys want to talk about.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Right?

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
And then we can get back to the actual show.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
What is this?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
I forgot.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
We were recording it today.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
So you weren't like prepared.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Wasn't prepared.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Where did you get that?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Where did you get the drink?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
We got just a formal bottle.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
That's why he's like six ounces.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Which is enough.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
I got it at the pharmacy of wine.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
It's right by the office actually.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
The pharmacy of wine.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
It's La Pharmacy Duval.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Right?

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
Meaning it's sort of a pharmacy of wine.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Whoa.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
You guys really aren't bringing anything to the table this week.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Last week was sort of a train wreck of disaster because I didn't bring anything to the table.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
Today not only do we have a ton to get to, but you guys aren't saying anything.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
Well, you just lambasted me for interrupting you when I was just talking normally.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
You started off with such a sour mood.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
I said I was going to try to be nice to you this time because last time a lot of the comments were like,

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Oh, it's cool to see Brad taking Jeff down a peg.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
But you're making it really hard.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
You're making me regret my decision to say yes to coming on the show.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
That's true.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
My bond to the week is Rachel White.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
Say more about that.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
I think it would be fun to do a little husband wife swap.

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
So maybe James Bond and he teams up with Brendan Frazier and the kiss.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Is Rachel White married to Daniel Craig?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Yes.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
That's awesome.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
That's a really good bond.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
That is what I'm saying.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Thank you.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
It's all give Alice some daps.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Brad, say something nice.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
That was a really good bond of the week.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Chicken looks spectacular.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
And the second one is a compliment to the cat.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Not to.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
A compliment to the cat is a compliment to the cat owner.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Okay.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Yeah.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
Yeah, I don't know.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
Fucking Dane cook or something.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Fucking Dave cook.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
It's been like.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
One week.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
A hundred weeks.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Yeah.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I'm not a bad idea.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Doesn't matter.

07:47.000 --> 07:58.000
Well, if you think the wells run dry for this, then why hasn't broccoli come forward with the news of the next James?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Probably.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Barbara.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Barbara broccoli, the producer of James.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Bond.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
That was seven.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I'm just like.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
We only meet here once a week.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I'm sure that Sony pictures.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
Barbara broccoli and everyone behind James Bond is meeting about the next 007 on a daily basis.

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
So I'm just like, there's no way the well is run drier than theirs because we only talk about it once a week.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
They talk about it every day.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Does that make sense?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Yeah.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Yeah.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Yeah.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Even before you said response.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Say it fast.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
That's also how normal conversations work.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Correct.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
I agree.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
I did say that.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Sure.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Maybe they'll pick out of a hat.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Your hat.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Too many names in this hat.

08:47.000 --> 08:55.000
It's pretty much down to Renée Jean Page or whatever the fuck and Aaron Taylor Johnson.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Are you going to wear the hat on a normal day?

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
Or is it just a sort of a bit for today?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Oh, no normal day.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
I really want this to be.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
I want to be known as like for L is kind of synonymous with this hat.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
I don't need to be synonymous with this hat, but I want to be synonymous with hats.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Like, you know, not everybody needs a thing.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
Like for Brad, it's like CLE hats.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
No, you don't need to base your personality on an item of clothing.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Try trying growing as a human.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
How about that?

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
It seems like that hat's taken by for L.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Well, it's like you're just trying to.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
All right.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
All right.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
Now we're getting somewhere with the sort of dynamism of the conversation.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
You guys had some overlapping dialogue there.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
I'm going to ask a view that we're strong and contrary to mine.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
That's where the comedy comes from, right?

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
I disagree about the article of clothing.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
I will say, I think you become the hat and the hat is you.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Does that make sense?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Sure.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Short.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Let's talk about it.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
What's the shirt?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
You guys wear the most often and get compliments.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
Because I got five compliments within 10 minutes of buying the shit at a bull.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
People compliment at your hat.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
When they say, I bought the hat.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I put it on immediately within seconds.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I got two compliments from two different different shop owners.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
It was like, hey, nice hat.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Yes.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
But like, hey, nice hat.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
There was no sarcastic undertone.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
If that's what you're getting at.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
And two people were like, I wish I had bought that hat.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Oh, wow.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
What was that?

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
I said, oh, wow.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
A hat confidence is not easy to gain.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
So I respect that you have it.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
And is that CON fitness?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Or is that K-A-H-A-N fitness?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
CON.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Let's get back on board now.

11:02.000 --> 11:13.000
Let's talk about the state of the network.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
This is not like an official state of the gum.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
But I'd love to talk about some intricacies of the inner workings.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Yeah.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Yeah.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
When does this episode come out?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Come out on Friday.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
All right.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Why don't you let me do two days?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Like in two days.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Yes.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
The 17.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Great.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
We could talk.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Smiling because he doesn't think I can get it done.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
Last week we recorded on Thursday.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Sure.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
So this is sort of a step in the right direction.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
I think at least talk about as if you're listening to this before noon.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
We're doing a live stream for if I were you.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
And I think Jeff's going to be on it too, right?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Yeah.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
I'll be there.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Yeah.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
So that's from 12 to question mark.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
Question mark 30 either 1230 or 130.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
And then you guys can log in and check that out.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Maybe you're listening to this during that period right now.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
You can stop this insanity.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
And move on to the live stream.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
That's a good idea.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
I guess so felt like an organic plug because you're talking about the state of the network.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
And this is happening during that.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
You're also going to be on it.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
So why are you mad that people would leave here to go watch you.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I mean, I'm down to plug it.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
I just, there's this whole section of the show at the end for plug.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
So it's talk about the.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Yeah.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
You just asked about the network.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Yeah.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
So let's talk about the intricacies, the inner workings.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Okay.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Brat.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
No, like don't, don't.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
Anyone on this make yourselves like small because then I look like a monster.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Like Brad and Ali are both like.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Okay.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
What is going on Brad in your neck of the woods of the company?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
And what do you even do?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
I don't know.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
You don't know what I do.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Do you work in like ad sales?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
What do you think I do?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I think you work in ad sales.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
There you go.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Yeah.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
So that's good.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Yeah.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
It's awesome.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
We're.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
We're killing it on a weekly basis.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
How much money?

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
I do want me to give you a specific number.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
I'm not.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
I'll believe it.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Okay.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
No.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
All right.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
But it's going well.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
It's good.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Yeah.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Good.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Yeah.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Or is it like we're.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
We do well.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
You know, when people say that it's like one second.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
It's like where people are like, oh, you know, we do well.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
That kind of thing.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I don't know what you mean.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Like when.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Yeah.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Forget it.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
That's it.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
It's great.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Portland.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Portland.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Did I get a raise?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
No.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Last year.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
You didn't.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
I mean, I haven't been here that long.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Neither's Joel.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
He got a raise.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
He did.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Yeah.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Joel's in Patagonia.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Oh, he's been here.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Since May.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Which, by the way, is when Joel started.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
We started on the same day.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Yeah.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Maybe it's probably performance based.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
I wouldn't be upset about it.

14:13.000 --> 14:34.000
Yeah.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Are you upset?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
No.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
No.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
No.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
No.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
No.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Thanks.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
You know, employees solidarity and communication.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
That way.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
The fat cats like a mirror don't just hoard everything for their more ourselves.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
You're not an employee.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
So.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
I'm trying to help your ass.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
Don't start an uprising if you're like not even part of the class here.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
Like you're not part of the company quite frankly here.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
And I'm a company man.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Yeah.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Yeah.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Sorry to hear that.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
I guess.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
I mean, you guys are shitting yourselves.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
If you don't think I'm the reason why Adam McKay's podcast network hasn't done well.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
You know, it's not that clear slaughter's doing a bad job.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
It's that I have been sort of dipping my toes in the waters over there.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
Sowing seeds of down descent amongst the underlings and the overlings.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
Basically leading to whatever the lack of team building is.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
To ensure the.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Failure or at least downward spiral of that company.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
I don't even know what it's called.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
But that way had come to a slightly better.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Does that make sense?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
No.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Yeah, you're saying you're not helping us out.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
To make up for your actively sabotaging our.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
Competition, which isn't really a competition.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
And whose names you don't even know.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Correct.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Kind of into somebody.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
What's up?

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Did you see my comments on your hat post?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
What's that?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
I did.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
I was driving.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
So next time, just maybe wait till I get home because I almost got an accident.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
But it was the thing of like, I saw your comment.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
And I kind of read it.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
It's like an exasperated.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
What's that?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Where you don't say the tea.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
So it's like.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Fuck you guys.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
Yeah.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Let's talk about dating in Portland.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Brad, what's it like?

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
What's the scene?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
What are the spots?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Where do you?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Where do you go out?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Well, I'm not dating anyone.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
I'm married.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
You're married.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Yeah.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
Maybe go on.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Because you should know exactly.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
I'm not.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Great.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
So you do date.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Sure, man.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Sure, man.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Yeah.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Yes, yeah.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
So there's so many times, but you're never supposed to stop.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
You don't stop dating your wife.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
And I don't.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
And I didn't.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
And we do.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
And I did.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
So where are the.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Yeah.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
So what's dating your wife like in Portland, Oregon?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
It's good and fun.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
And it reigns.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Do you want like specific restaurants?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I don't know how to answer that question.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
I do.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
I don't even remember the name of it.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
We went to a tie place last night that I got a reservation for.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
And it was delicious.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
There's a tattoo shop above it.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
It's on a Hawthorne.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Luxury form.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Absolutely.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
You do.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
House is vintage.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
House is great.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
They have a lot of hats there.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Well, and that sort of set.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
I mean, I always always window shop, but I'm sort of set for now.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
No, you should you should expand the collection.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
You ever go to Revolution Hall?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Yeah.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
All right.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Allie.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Let's talk about dating in Portland.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
What are the spots?

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Where do you go?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
So where have you gone?

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
To sort of get Ziggy with it.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Start us or otherwise.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
In Portland.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Uh, I've only been.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I went once when I was like 18.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
I know that their public transportation is very good there.

18:24.000 --> 18:30.000
I would recommend taking a bus or a trolley in seeing what happens.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Hell yeah.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
I'm here.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Um, I went to a tyrostron with Brad and his wife last night.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Yeah.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
It was nice.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
It was cool that you showed up.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
We split a pad sea.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Ew.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
That was.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Yeah.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
He made that joke last night.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Twice last night.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Yeah.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
That's nice.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
That's nice.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
We didn't really dive into the state of the network like what's going on.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
We have a live stream.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
The day this comes out.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
That's it.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
And ad sales are going fine.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Why is that good?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Yeah.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
That's true.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Okay.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
So ad sales are going good.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
To mid.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
Oh, that'll come back around after the ad break.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Oh, yeah.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Okay.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Okay.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Okay.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
He's my gripe about the show.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Yeah.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Amir says dumbership than me.

19:36.000 --> 19:42.000
There's just this dynamic that's been set up where any can he says turns to gold and everything.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
I say turns to mold.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Like him doing an impression of the hand of Montana transition.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
He's like isn't funny.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
But then like both Brad and Ali were both like that.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Swenny that's cool.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
And then I say something that I think is kind of clever.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
I work with it.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
And nobody does any clever.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
I don't know.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
I would say we've given your hat a lot of attention.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Yeah, but not why you are.

20:04.000 --> 20:18.000
Why would you wear that hat if not to say talk about it.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
Guys, our next partner has a product I use literally every day.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
All right.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
And that's AG1 by athletic greens.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
I used to take a bunch of different pills and vitamins.

20:27.000 --> 20:33.000
I used to take like vitamin E, magnesium, selenium.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
I can't even remember all of them.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
But it was like a fistful of like nine different pills twice a day.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
And at a certain point, it became too much.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
All right.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
And I actually gave up on it.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
And I was taking nothing after that because I was just like I don't like having to look out for all

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
these.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
It's also very expensive.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.800
And that's where AG1 comes in because it is an easy all in one nutritional drink that gives

20:53.800 --> 20:58.400
you all of those things and more in the morning every day.

20:58.400 --> 21:01.640
And it's it's one thing you can do to look out for your health every single day.

21:01.640 --> 21:06.280
I mean, even if I'm not necessarily eating clean or if I didn't get to work out that day,

21:06.280 --> 21:11.680
I'm still knowing that every morning, I'm getting all my nutritional supplements and

21:11.680 --> 21:15.920
vitamins in one drink that tastes great, by the way.

21:15.920 --> 21:21.040
And if you want to take baby steps this year to be a little bit healthier, start here,

21:21.040 --> 21:22.200
start with AG1.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.200
So what is this stuff?

21:23.200 --> 21:27.240
Well, it's the healthiest thing you can do for yourself in a minute.

21:27.240 --> 21:30.840
Why take a bunch of different things when you can just mix one scoop of powder in water

21:30.840 --> 21:32.120
once a day.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.120
And that's what AG1 is.

21:33.120 --> 21:36.160
It was designed with ease and minds so you can live healthier and better without having

21:36.160 --> 21:38.160
to do a lot.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.920
Name of the game for me.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.680
It's powerful because it's so easy that it can fit into your lifestyle.

21:42.680 --> 21:44.960
You just scoop it into water, shake it, take it on the go.

21:44.960 --> 21:48.680
Or if you work from home, just sip it as you work.

21:48.680 --> 21:52.160
AG1 has been part of millions of mornings since 2010.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.520
This company's not new guys.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.920
It's been around for a while.

21:54.920 --> 21:59.880
It gives you increased energy and mood support and it makes you easy to live your best life.

21:59.880 --> 22:05.320
I literally always want to find an easier way to do the things that I need to do as I think

22:05.320 --> 22:06.320
a lot of us do.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.320
Why make things harder on yourself than they need to be.

22:08.320 --> 22:12.480
Just get at AG1 instead of getting a bunch of different vitamins because this one is packed

22:12.480 --> 22:17.280
with 75 vitamins, minerals, and whole foods or superfood ingredients of the highest quality

22:17.280 --> 22:21.280
that give you major benefits like gut and mood support, boosted energy, and even healthier

22:21.280 --> 22:23.520
looking skin hair and nails.

22:23.520 --> 22:24.520
I'm a nail biter.

22:24.520 --> 22:26.480
So I need all the help I can get.

22:26.480 --> 22:29.000
If you're looking for an easier way to take supplements, that agreeing is going to give

22:29.000 --> 22:33.480
you a free one-year supply of vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.640
Just go to athleticgreens.com slash what's that?

22:35.640 --> 22:38.280
Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash what's that?

22:38.520 --> 22:39.280
Check it out.

22:39.280 --> 22:41.280
This show is sponsored by Better Help.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.640
Guys, you always want to be the best version of yourself.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.840
You always want to be on a path to growth, all right?

22:45.840 --> 22:49.120
You don't want to get stagnant because that feels bad and what feels good is knowing that

22:49.120 --> 22:52.960
you're doing things and putting things in action to better yourself and better your life.

22:52.960 --> 22:58.760
And that's where Better Help comes in because therapy can do great things for you.

22:58.760 --> 23:01.520
When life gets you bogged down and you feel overwhelmed or you're not showing up

23:01.520 --> 23:06.920
in the way you want to, therapy can be that first step to a happier, brighter, more fulfilled

23:06.960 --> 23:09.240
life where you are the best version of yourself.

23:09.240 --> 23:12.000
Working with a therapist can get you closer and closer to that best version because when

23:12.000 --> 23:15.480
you feel empowered, you're more prepared to take on everything that life throws at you.

23:15.480 --> 23:18.200
And life will throw shit at you.

23:18.200 --> 23:21.080
Again, I'm in therapy every week.

23:21.080 --> 23:23.200
Sometimes I miss it a week and I notice it.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.320
I notice the difference when I can't make it to an appointment.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.840
I everything feels a little bit harder or a little heavier.

23:27.840 --> 23:32.960
It just always feels better when you can air out your feelings and talk them through

23:32.960 --> 23:34.840
with a licensed professional.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.760
So if you're thinking of giving therapy a try, Better Help is a great option.

23:37.760 --> 23:41.120
It's convenient, flexible, affordable and entirely online, right?

23:41.120 --> 23:42.280
No more waiting rooms, guys.

23:42.280 --> 23:45.400
No more driving, either than thinner.

23:45.400 --> 23:48.000
Just to feel out of brief questionnaire and get matched with the license therapist today.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.760
And switch therapists at any time at no additional charge if it's not a good fit.

23:51.760 --> 23:55.600
So if you want to live a more empowered life therapy, you can get you there visit betterhelp.com

23:55.600 --> 23:58.280

23:58.280 --> 23:59.280
Again, that's better help.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.280
HELP.com slash what's that?

24:01.280 --> 24:02.000
Thanks, Better Help.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.600
Well, awesome.

24:08.600 --> 24:10.740
Oh, it's not really.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.060
What's the name?

24:21.800 --> 24:23.160
Oh, my gosh.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.720
f***ing a jackshow.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.840
I never granting it.

24:31.840 --> 24:32.840
This is so fun.

24:32.840 --> 24:33.840
I don't kick.

24:33.840 --> 24:34.840
No.

24:34.840 --> 24:35.840
And chicken.

24:35.840 --> 24:36.840
That was just corn.

24:36.840 --> 24:37.840
Yeah.

24:37.840 --> 24:38.840
Oh.

24:38.840 --> 24:45.440
See, like, right there, that wasn't funny at all, and Brad can't control himself.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.840
He's having to lean away from the mic.

24:46.840 --> 24:56.840
It's funny to imagine that's how, um, that's how Ali's cat chicken.

24:56.840 --> 24:57.840
Flaps.

24:58.840 --> 25:02.840
I like that chicken's becoming a recurring character on the pot.

25:02.840 --> 25:06.840
Just like how New York is often a character in Sex and the City.

25:06.840 --> 25:07.840
Yeah.

25:07.840 --> 25:12.840
Chicken is like a character on the...

25:12.840 --> 25:17.840
New York.

25:17.840 --> 25:22.840
I agree.

25:22.840 --> 25:24.840
You're mad about it.

25:24.840 --> 25:27.840
Let's stay up the emails and let's stay up the text, or it's more on the bucket.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.840
So I'm not asking for a lot.

25:29.840 --> 25:30.840
You are.

25:30.840 --> 25:31.840
And I will.

25:31.840 --> 25:32.840
Okay.

25:32.840 --> 25:43.840
And if I do, it's like, as you asked me.

25:55.840 --> 26:01.840
Last week of your post, a photo that he took a monitor.

26:01.840 --> 26:04.840
When we were shooting sketches last night.

26:04.840 --> 26:07.840
And then he captured it.

26:07.840 --> 26:08.840
Me.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.840
Uh, has a promise for my script story.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.840
I said that we were diving to one exactly.

26:12.840 --> 26:13.840
Man, don't listen.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.840
Just don't know about this.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.840
Let's do the show.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.840
Let's just break that and appreciate it.

26:19.840 --> 26:20.840
Uh.

26:20.840 --> 26:21.840
Man.

26:21.840 --> 26:22.840
I said, he's a...

26:22.840 --> 26:23.840
F**k.

26:23.840 --> 26:24.840
F**k.

26:24.840 --> 26:25.840
F**k.

26:25.840 --> 26:26.840
F**k.

26:26.840 --> 26:27.840
F**k.

26:27.840 --> 26:28.840
F**k.

26:28.840 --> 26:29.840
F**k.

26:29.840 --> 26:30.840
F**k.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.840
F**k.

26:32.840 --> 26:33.840
F**k.

26:33.840 --> 26:36.840
I said, on my Instagram story, that I would get to the bottom of exactly what

26:36.840 --> 26:38.840
a mirror meant when he posted this.

26:38.840 --> 26:41.840
So, like I said, I didn't appreciate it.

26:41.840 --> 26:42.840
I think I'm more than mad.

26:42.840 --> 26:43.840
I think I'm...

26:43.840 --> 26:47.840
At the very least above average, uh...

26:47.840 --> 26:49.840
Broadway video style.

26:49.840 --> 26:50.840
But, um...

26:50.840 --> 26:52.840
What did you mean, Amir?

26:52.840 --> 26:53.840
Did you mean...

26:53.840 --> 26:54.840
Let's like figure this shit out.

26:54.840 --> 26:55.840
Because I did...

26:55.840 --> 26:56.840
Again, I didn't appreciate it.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.840
The very least we could nip this in the bud.

26:58.840 --> 27:00.840
Uh, and be like, oh, I just was like putting a caption.

27:00.840 --> 27:03.840
It just like is like something that's in the ether, which we feel a lot better.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.840
But if it was that you think I'm mad?

27:05.840 --> 27:08.840
Or if you think the sketch I wrote that we were shooting on this day was mad,

27:08.840 --> 27:10.840
then I...

27:10.840 --> 27:12.840
I'm not gonna just sit idly by.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.840
I'm not gonna sit idly by.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.840
That one's for all my brown fellows.

27:16.840 --> 27:17.840
Uh, it's just...

27:17.840 --> 27:18.840
It's not...

27:18.840 --> 27:19.840
It's not okay with me.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.840
You know, you have to sell a advocate.

27:21.840 --> 27:22.840
And that's what I'm doing here.

27:22.840 --> 27:23.840
So let's get to the bottom of it.

27:23.840 --> 27:24.840
What do you mean?

27:24.840 --> 27:26.840
I meant that you were mad.

27:34.840 --> 27:35.840
Sorry?

27:37.840 --> 27:40.840
Amir, I'm like giving you an out to like not with my feelings.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.840
I'm saying, like you could just say that it was like...

27:42.840 --> 27:44.840
Like, by Brad, and a lot of there.

27:44.840 --> 27:45.840
Yeah.

27:46.840 --> 27:49.840
And that's what I thought he meant when I saw the post.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.840
That's why I smashed that like button.

27:52.840 --> 27:53.840
Yeah.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.840
Did what did you think he meant the hat was made?

27:56.840 --> 27:58.840
And that's why you got a new hat?

27:58.840 --> 27:59.840
Or...

27:59.840 --> 28:01.840
Again, I had no idea what you meant.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.840
I obviously took offense because I assumed the worst.

28:04.840 --> 28:07.840
But I like to think that worst case scenario is don't often happen.

28:07.840 --> 28:11.840
Uh, you know, whether that's an an effort to ease my own anxiety or whatever.

28:11.840 --> 28:12.840
But, you know...

28:13.840 --> 28:15.840
Not in this case.

28:15.840 --> 28:16.840
The question is...

28:16.840 --> 28:18.840
Oh, what's the undertone?

28:18.840 --> 28:20.840
You know, what's the context?

28:20.840 --> 28:24.840
Let's get all that too before you just kind of straight forwardly say that you were saying I was mad.

28:24.840 --> 28:25.840
Because it can't be that.

28:25.840 --> 28:29.840
It has to be that, you know, holistically you were trying to make other people laugh.

28:29.840 --> 28:30.840
You're trying to spread joy.

28:30.840 --> 28:35.840
By playing into this kind of honestly character that I play that you play like in these public spaces.

28:35.840 --> 28:38.840
Because obviously when we hang out just two of us are in the office.

28:38.840 --> 28:39.840
It's like we talk about other stuff.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.840
We like talk about intangetological things.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.840
Things we read, things that we enjoy.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.840
There's a real kinship there.

28:45.840 --> 28:48.840
There's a real like mentor, mentee, style.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.840
Uh, dynamic there.

28:50.840 --> 28:51.840
Uh, but publicly face it.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.840
You got to make people smile, right?

28:53.840 --> 28:54.840
You got to make people that enjoy.

28:54.840 --> 28:57.840
And so I was wondering, is that what you were doing here with this caption?

28:57.840 --> 28:59.840
It's like, oh, he's mad, you know?

28:59.840 --> 29:02.840
And then like, and then as I bring it up on the show you're also playing into that.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.840
Is that what was happening?

29:04.840 --> 29:06.840
Uh...

29:06.840 --> 29:13.840
Now I'm just calling you like average.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.840
Absolutely.

29:15.840 --> 29:20.840
And then just diving into that sentence.

29:20.840 --> 29:26.840
Is it that you hold all of us to a standard that's already subpar and a golf term.

29:26.840 --> 29:30.840
Above average in another term where it's like at-head gum.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.840
We achieve such excellence.

29:32.840 --> 29:36.840
Again, like doing well at the moment is doing fine.

29:36.840 --> 29:38.840
No more other confidence.

29:38.840 --> 29:39.840
Good.

29:39.840 --> 29:42.840
No more do I think you're that bad.

29:42.840 --> 29:46.840
You're right in the mean mean.

29:46.840 --> 29:48.840
And I'd rather be bad.

29:48.840 --> 29:51.840
I'd rather you have a hard opinion about me either way.

29:51.840 --> 29:56.840
To be made in someone's eyes I think is the lowest form of congeniality.

29:56.840 --> 29:57.840
Yeah.

29:57.840 --> 29:59.840
Because it frankly lacks that.

29:59.840 --> 30:00.840
Yeah.

30:00.840 --> 30:01.840
Yeah.

30:01.840 --> 30:02.840
Yeah.

30:02.840 --> 30:06.840
My thing is like, I'm just really trying to give you the benefit of the doubt here.

30:06.840 --> 30:09.840
Because otherwise I might cry.

30:09.840 --> 30:19.840
Did you mean that this photo of a photo of me captured a part of me that you'd consider

30:19.840 --> 30:20.840
mid?

30:20.840 --> 30:22.840
Or is it holistically that me as a person?

30:22.840 --> 30:24.840
Ain't it, ain't him?

30:24.840 --> 30:26.840
You're not that dude.

30:26.840 --> 30:27.840
You're not him.

30:27.840 --> 30:30.840
You're not that guy pal.

30:30.840 --> 30:35.840
You're an average Joe.

30:35.840 --> 30:36.840
Where did you come from?

30:36.840 --> 30:37.840
Where did you go?

30:37.840 --> 30:38.840
Where did you come from?

30:38.840 --> 30:39.840
You're an average Joe.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.840
You're five out of ten.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.840
I'll see man.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.840
So see man.

30:46.840 --> 30:50.840
You're just totally gray.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.840
You're tan your beige.

30:52.840 --> 30:54.840
Right in the middle.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.840
Or mid.

31:01.840 --> 31:09.840
Well, I know a lot of people that love neutral palettes, Jeff.

31:09.840 --> 31:10.840
Yeah.

31:10.840 --> 31:13.840
Mid isn't necessarily a bad thing.

31:13.840 --> 31:15.840
It's specifically not a bad thing.

31:15.840 --> 31:16.840
Yeah.

31:16.840 --> 31:18.840
You're just like unnoticable.

31:18.840 --> 31:23.840
If you get blood tests like results back, you want to be in the middle there.

31:23.840 --> 31:27.840
Don't want to be too higher to low.

31:27.840 --> 31:32.840
Just hard because like, I don't know, strive for excellence.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.840
You know, everybody wants to be great at what they do.

31:35.840 --> 31:40.840
They even if you end up like, you know, reach for the stars you'll end on the clouds, whatever.

31:40.840 --> 31:45.840
It's a good fail safe to be mid, but to be at this point in my career in my life.

31:45.840 --> 31:50.840
I'm 25 like to be considered mid instead of on the rise or like,

31:50.840 --> 31:55.840
at least above par for my age.

31:56.840 --> 31:59.840
You know, leaves me feeling like I did in this photo.

31:59.840 --> 32:01.840
Can you see my face, Brad?

32:01.840 --> 32:04.840
What is the picture is also kind of mid.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.840
It's upside down.

32:06.840 --> 32:10.840
Kind of illegible a little bit, but I didn't take the picture.

32:10.840 --> 32:11.840
Did you think I took the picture?

32:11.840 --> 32:12.840
Because I'm here.

32:12.840 --> 32:13.840
No, no, no, no.

32:13.840 --> 32:16.840
It's just mid pick for a mid guy.

32:16.840 --> 32:22.840
You know, so you're saying the framing, which is kind of fine to that matches the subject.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.840
Yeah, it's almost artistic.

32:24.840 --> 32:27.840
Like that's why I part of the reason why I dropped a like on it.

32:27.840 --> 32:31.840
Like I, it speaks to the subject of the photo.

32:31.840 --> 32:33.840
And let's go on that for a second.

32:33.840 --> 32:35.840
Let me finish though.

32:35.840 --> 32:41.840
Like the framing, the lighting, how like you can't really, like it's a little blurry.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.840
Sure.

32:43.840 --> 32:46.840
Like it, it art imitates.

32:46.840 --> 32:47.840
Me.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.840
Right.

32:48.840 --> 32:51.840
Here's my kind of like, and let's go off that for a second.

32:51.840 --> 32:55.840
Yeah, a lot of great art art that we consider amazing now.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.840
At the time was not received well.

32:57.840 --> 33:00.840
And this was posted what four days ago.

33:00.840 --> 33:04.840
And, you know, not only was the photo, as Brad said, sort of average,

33:04.840 --> 33:08.840
you're saying the subject is also mid, the subject being me, unfortunately.

33:08.840 --> 33:12.840
But I'm wondering if because you're acknowledging that it is art,

33:12.840 --> 33:17.840
that maybe in like 50 years people look back at this post and they say,

33:18.840 --> 33:19.840
man, like he was ahead of it.

33:19.840 --> 33:20.840
Yeah.

33:20.840 --> 33:21.840
Man.

33:21.840 --> 33:24.840
He had something to say that other people just move on.

33:24.840 --> 33:25.840
Yeah.

33:25.840 --> 33:30.840
I would counter that by saying that a lot of art is appreciated in its time.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.840
Probably a lot more art.

33:32.840 --> 33:37.840
It's like pretty rare that like someone 50 years down the line.

33:37.840 --> 33:38.840
Let's just go on.

33:38.840 --> 33:39.840
Yeah.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.840
You got, you didn't get the answer you wanted.

33:41.840 --> 33:44.840
But I feel like I've been loud and clear.

33:45.840 --> 33:48.840
I feel like there's room for negotiation here.

33:48.840 --> 33:49.840
Loud and clear.

33:49.840 --> 33:52.840
I think there's room for negotiation here.

33:52.840 --> 33:56.840
I've wondered if any of you could be swayed in your opinion about me being

33:56.840 --> 33:59.840
par.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.840
You are par for the course.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.840
And I will not be swayed.

34:03.840 --> 34:06.840
Did you see tar?

34:06.840 --> 34:08.840
I didn't.

34:09.840 --> 34:23.840
Oh, this is so fucked up.

34:23.840 --> 34:32.840
Bloods.

34:32.840 --> 34:35.840
Beyond that, it was all wax episode.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.840
Let's get into some of topics.

34:37.840 --> 34:38.840
Y'all want to talk about.

34:38.840 --> 34:42.840
I'll take a back seat and we can figure this shit out as we go.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.840
That was the only segment you had.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.840
I said we had a lot to get to.

34:46.840 --> 34:49.840
You guys aren't exactly contributing in the ways I need you to.

34:49.840 --> 34:50.840
What did you?

34:50.840 --> 34:51.840
What did we have to get to?

34:51.840 --> 34:52.840
Bond of the week.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.840
And then a picture of you that I posted on Instagram.

34:54.840 --> 34:58.840
That was the reparation that we didn't get.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.840
Dive into deep enough.

35:00.840 --> 35:03.840
I just thought that we would have a whole debate.

35:03.840 --> 35:07.840
I thought that maybe it wouldn't be three against one me trying to like, you know,

35:07.840 --> 35:09.840
Sisyphicianly.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.840
Change your guys' opinion.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.840
I'm not not on your side.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.840
But.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.840
But time will tell.

35:18.840 --> 35:19.840
That's what I'm saying.

35:19.840 --> 35:20.840
History.

35:20.840 --> 35:21.840
That's what I'm saying.

35:21.840 --> 35:24.840
And Brad's saying there's not even room for growth in that way.

35:24.840 --> 35:25.840
For public opinion to change.

35:25.840 --> 35:28.840
Ten years ago, everybody was wearing skin tight jeans.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.840
Now that's not cool to have.

35:30.840 --> 35:31.840
I don't know.

35:31.840 --> 35:35.840
I mean, I think I think people thought that Vincent Van Gogh sucked.

35:35.840 --> 35:36.840
And he wore hats too.

35:36.840 --> 35:37.840
And now people like him.

35:37.840 --> 35:39.840
So there's hope.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.840
Yeah, but wasn't he like a little fucker?

35:41.840 --> 35:42.840
Like, wasn't he like a bad guy?

35:42.840 --> 35:43.840
I was like violent.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.840
I thought he like abused his partners.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.840
Maybe that's why people didn't like his ass.

35:49.840 --> 35:50.840
I don't know.

35:50.840 --> 35:51.840
I don't know.

35:51.840 --> 35:52.840
I don't know.

35:52.840 --> 35:53.840
I don't know.

35:53.840 --> 35:54.840
I don't know.

35:54.840 --> 35:55.840
I don't know.

35:55.840 --> 35:56.840
I don't know.

35:56.840 --> 35:57.840
I don't know.

35:57.840 --> 35:58.840
I don't know.

35:58.840 --> 35:59.840
I don't know.

35:59.840 --> 36:00.840
I don't know.

36:00.840 --> 36:01.840
Yeah.

36:01.840 --> 36:02.840
I also kind of mid in my eyes.

36:02.840 --> 36:04.840
He's the midest beetle.

36:04.840 --> 36:05.840
I agree.

36:05.840 --> 36:07.840
Who's your favorite beetle?

36:07.840 --> 36:08.840
Paul McCartney.

36:08.840 --> 36:09.840
Easily.

36:09.840 --> 36:11.840
George Harrison.

36:11.840 --> 36:12.840
Yeah, the hat.

36:12.840 --> 36:14.840
That's a very George hat actually.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.840
That's actually kind of sick.

36:16.840 --> 36:17.840
Abby Rowley.

36:17.840 --> 36:18.840
Yeah.

36:18.840 --> 36:20.840
He didn't wear it on Abby Road.

36:20.840 --> 36:21.840
They all wore suit.

36:21.840 --> 36:25.840
They did a photo shoot around the time of Abby Road.

36:25.840 --> 36:27.840
Where he wore a hat.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.840
Are you talking about the all things must pass?

36:30.840 --> 36:34.840
He was wearing a hat on the cover of all things must pass to you.

36:34.840 --> 36:35.840
Yeah.

36:35.840 --> 36:40.840
I tried to recreate that photo before the hat or.

36:40.840 --> 36:41.840
Yeah.

36:41.840 --> 36:44.840
That was why I didn't work out because I didn't necessarily have to be.

36:44.840 --> 36:52.840
The clothes, the skills, the, you know, the know how to take a photo saw.

36:53.840 --> 36:56.840
Yeah.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.840
This is.

36:58.840 --> 37:00.840
But now.

37:00.840 --> 37:02.840
It's.

37:02.840 --> 37:05.840
A zero burger.

37:05.840 --> 37:08.840
It's not waxing.

37:08.840 --> 37:10.840
It's got to be you say it.

37:10.840 --> 37:11.840
Talking.

37:11.840 --> 37:12.840
Got to help so.

37:12.840 --> 37:13.840
Yeah.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.840
I thought it was banal.

37:15.840 --> 37:16.840
Yeah.

37:17.840 --> 37:18.840
Yeah.

37:24.840 --> 37:25.840
Listen.

37:25.840 --> 37:28.840
Is it my responsibility to come up with shit to keep the show going.

37:28.840 --> 37:29.840
Absolutely.

37:29.840 --> 37:30.840
Yes.

37:30.840 --> 37:31.840
But what?

37:31.840 --> 37:32.840
Did you say no?

37:32.840 --> 37:33.840
Did anybody say no?

37:33.840 --> 37:34.840
No.

37:36.840 --> 37:37.840
100% it is.

37:37.840 --> 37:42.840
But I should also be able to bring things to the table and have them be explored and not shot down.

37:42.840 --> 37:46.840
And people blame me depending on how this episode goes every week.

37:46.840 --> 37:53.840
But when you guys show up without joy in your heart and even a little bit of the benefit of the doubt given unto me by the it's hard.

37:53.840 --> 37:55.840
It's just hard.

37:55.840 --> 38:00.840
And I'm not going to keep sitting idly by that one's for all my brown fellows.

38:00.840 --> 38:01.840
You keep saying that.

38:01.840 --> 38:02.840
What is that?

38:02.840 --> 38:03.840
Idly.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.840
Idly.

38:05.840 --> 38:09.840
It's like these little like rice ball things for.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.840
They're like an it's an Indian food.

38:12.840 --> 38:13.840
You wouldn't.

38:13.840 --> 38:14.840
Yeah.

38:14.840 --> 38:15.840
It's hard.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.840
More like you don't.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.840
It's actually not cool.

38:19.840 --> 38:20.840
Oh yeah.

38:20.840 --> 38:21.840
I don't know.

38:23.840 --> 38:26.840
The next episode of yours wearing a sorry.

38:26.840 --> 38:27.840
I am.

38:27.840 --> 38:28.840
I am.

38:30.840 --> 38:32.840
Because I am.

38:32.840 --> 38:33.840
I'm.

38:33.840 --> 38:34.840
What's the control like?

38:34.840 --> 38:35.840
Yeah.

38:35.840 --> 38:36.840
What the fuck is that?

38:36.840 --> 38:37.840
I'm Brad.

38:37.840 --> 38:38.840
I'm Brad.

38:41.840 --> 38:42.840
Yeah.

38:42.840 --> 38:43.840
I didn't end up working out.

38:46.840 --> 38:48.840
Next time though.

38:48.840 --> 38:49.840
For sure.

38:49.840 --> 38:50.840
Yeah.

38:50.840 --> 38:51.840
Yeah.

38:51.840 --> 38:53.840
I'll make it down there.

38:55.840 --> 38:57.840
I'm much a colleague way.

38:57.840 --> 38:58.840
No LA.

38:58.840 --> 39:00.840
I lost Los Angeles.

39:00.840 --> 39:01.840
Yeah.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.840
Yeah.

39:02.840 --> 39:03.840
Makes a cally.

39:03.840 --> 39:04.840
Yeah.

39:04.840 --> 39:05.840
It's a different place.

39:08.840 --> 39:09.840
You good?

39:09.840 --> 39:10.840
Weird.

39:10.840 --> 39:16.840
You guys don't have anything you want to talk about.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.840
It's like bring some shit.

39:18.840 --> 39:19.840
You know what I mean?

39:19.840 --> 39:20.840
I'm not even.

39:20.840 --> 39:23.840
Everybody's going to jump down my throat again because I didn't have an up

39:23.840 --> 39:24.840
prepared.

39:24.840 --> 39:25.840
But you guys could talk about anything.

39:25.840 --> 39:27.840
You could just let shit flow any time I stop talking.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.840
You guys just kind of settled down and you don't say anything.

39:29.840 --> 39:30.840
Yeah.

39:30.840 --> 39:31.840
Yeah.

39:31.840 --> 39:33.840
You're like the host.

39:33.840 --> 39:34.840
So you're like bring stuff.

39:34.840 --> 39:35.840
And then we discuss.

39:35.840 --> 39:36.840
Yeah.

39:36.840 --> 39:37.840
You're showing up with nothing.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.840
You're removing the thing, you know, on top of the plate.

39:39.840 --> 39:40.840
And then it's just like.

39:40.840 --> 39:41.840
I brought it.

39:41.840 --> 39:42.840
I brought it.

39:42.840 --> 39:43.840
I brought it.

39:43.840 --> 39:46.840
I brought bond to the week, which we all know to expect.

39:46.840 --> 39:48.840
And I've come to expect.

39:48.840 --> 39:53.840
And I brought the debate, which, by the way, is kind of dynamic.

39:53.840 --> 39:56.840
It's like about the Chinese spy balloon.

39:56.840 --> 39:58.840
Who do you think was behind it?

39:58.840 --> 40:00.840
Probably the Chinese.

40:00.840 --> 40:03.840
Cover man or.

40:03.840 --> 40:04.840
Yeah.

40:04.840 --> 40:05.840
Yeah.

40:06.840 --> 40:12.840
I wonder if we send a headgum spy balloon over to your wolf.

40:12.840 --> 40:13.840
Thought about it.

40:13.840 --> 40:14.840
Yeah.

40:14.840 --> 40:15.840
It's a good idea.

40:15.840 --> 40:16.840
Actually.

40:16.840 --> 40:18.840
It was the most obvious building.

40:18.840 --> 40:24.840
And it accidentally goes off course and flies above China and you start world war three.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.840
How big was this thing?

40:26.840 --> 40:27.840
Do we know?

40:27.840 --> 40:30.840
It was 200 feet tall.

40:30.840 --> 40:31.840
Wow.

40:31.840 --> 40:32.840
It wasn't.

40:32.840 --> 40:33.840
It was.

40:33.840 --> 40:34.840
Yeah.

40:35.840 --> 40:37.840
I wonder how it did not go too high or too low.

40:37.840 --> 40:52.840
Like usually balloons are like, you know, lighter than air heavier and they'll drift up or down.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.840
Referred to just stay that height.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.840
Pretty impressive.

40:56.840 --> 40:57.840
All right.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.840
I just open chat GPT.

40:59.840 --> 41:00.840
What do you guys want to see?

41:00.840 --> 41:02.840
Oh, my Lord.

41:02.840 --> 41:03.840
What?

41:03.840 --> 41:04.840
Minute 37.

41:04.840 --> 41:07.840
We already like, filled in the dead air.

41:07.840 --> 41:11.840
Now you want to start a full new segment.

41:11.840 --> 41:14.840
Have it right a segment for the show.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.840
That's a good idea for next week.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.840
That's a good idea.

41:18.840 --> 41:19.840
Hey.

41:19.840 --> 41:24.840
I'm an inept host and I can't come up with a single idea.

41:24.840 --> 41:29.840
Is there anything that you think that four people could discuss in a fun fashion?

41:29.840 --> 41:34.840
And then chat GPT because it's, you know, artificially intelligent.

41:34.840 --> 41:35.840
Damn.

41:35.840 --> 41:36.840
Daniel.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.840
Someone asked me to describe this show the other day.

41:50.840 --> 41:53.840
Because they asked what I did for a living.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.840
And I honestly couldn't.

41:55.840 --> 41:57.840
They were like, what's it about?

41:57.840 --> 41:58.840
What do you do?

41:58.840 --> 42:06.840
You know, I don't think chat GPT will be able to outline this in episode of the show.

42:06.840 --> 42:09.840
Because I just typed the first thing I said.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.840
I said, tell me or he is mid.

42:11.840 --> 42:12.840
I said, I'm sorry.

42:12.840 --> 42:17.840
But as an AI language model, it is not within my programming to insult or belittle individuals.

42:17.840 --> 42:20.840
And that seems to be all in that with on this show.

42:20.840 --> 42:21.840
Yeah.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.840
I don't think you'd gave it the correct prompt.

42:23.840 --> 42:26.840
Then like you have to ask it to come up with second ideas.

42:26.840 --> 42:27.840
And all you did was just sort of type an insult.

42:27.840 --> 42:31.840
Say, what's a segment idea that sounds like dealer no deal.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.840
Because it rhymes with dealer no deal.

42:33.840 --> 42:38.840
And then it would probably fart out something slightly better than squeal or no squeal.

42:38.840 --> 42:42.840
Which is something you actually came up with and we played last week.

42:42.840 --> 42:43.840
All right.

42:43.840 --> 42:44.840
The title is called Cash Vault.

42:44.840 --> 42:48.840
And this game show a contestant is presented with a vault containing a random amount of cash

42:48.840 --> 42:51.840
ranging from a small amount to a large jackpot.

42:54.840 --> 42:55.840
Let's just do plugs.

42:55.840 --> 42:56.840
This is so fucked up.

42:56.840 --> 42:59.840
I was excited for this episode and now I'm sorry about it.

42:59.840 --> 43:00.840
Why are you excited?

43:02.840 --> 43:05.840
I could let energy at the bitters at the hat.

43:05.840 --> 43:07.840
I had a whole thing to get to.

43:07.840 --> 43:11.840
I knew you were expecting us to come to be.

43:11.840 --> 43:14.840
But whether or not you meant to call me mid.

43:14.840 --> 43:15.840
All right.

43:15.840 --> 43:17.840
You didn't even open it up to normal discussion.

43:17.840 --> 43:20.840
You just off the bat said, yeah, I meant to call you that.

43:20.840 --> 43:22.840
What kind of segment is that?

43:24.840 --> 43:25.840
A quick one.

43:26.840 --> 43:29.840
Lastly, yes or no question.

43:29.840 --> 43:30.840
Yes.

43:30.840 --> 43:32.840
Yeah, not a segment.

43:32.840 --> 43:33.840
Yeah.

43:33.840 --> 43:34.840
That really fast.

43:34.840 --> 43:36.840
Question.

43:36.840 --> 43:38.840
At Jeffrey James on Instagram.

43:38.840 --> 43:40.840
At Jeff Boyard on Twitter.

43:40.840 --> 43:43.840
What do you guys want to plug and point the people to?

43:43.840 --> 43:44.840
We have a live stream today.

43:44.840 --> 43:47.840
If you're listening to this on Friday morning at noon Pacific.

43:47.840 --> 43:48.840
Three p.m. Eastern.

43:48.840 --> 43:49.840
Brad, what do you got?

43:49.840 --> 43:51.840
I'm going to plug this show.

43:51.840 --> 43:54.840
My favorite show on the head gum network.

43:54.840 --> 43:55.840
There's no head gum podcast.

43:55.840 --> 43:57.840
Easy to describe.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.840
Easy to figure out.

43:59.840 --> 44:03.840
Easy to know what you're going to get episode to episode.

44:03.840 --> 44:10.840
Whatever the person recently asked me to describe it.

44:10.840 --> 44:13.840
I something came into my head.

44:13.840 --> 44:14.840
I was like, it's kind of like whatever.

44:14.840 --> 44:18.840
You know, like when you're a kid and you like wake up on a Saturday.

44:18.840 --> 44:20.840
And it like some friends from school.

44:20.840 --> 44:23.840
Like invited you to go play basketball or something.

44:23.840 --> 44:25.840
And then you like go into the kitchen.

44:25.840 --> 44:27.840
Your mom's like, oh, your dad's outside.

44:27.840 --> 44:28.840
He's building a deck.

44:28.840 --> 44:31.840
And then you got to spend your weekend like building a deck.

44:31.840 --> 44:34.840
And then you like go to school on Monday.

44:34.840 --> 44:37.840
And like Kurt Wiseman shows up in a cast.

44:37.840 --> 44:40.840
And everyone's like, oh, so what like Kurt tried to dunk.

44:40.840 --> 44:42.840
And he like touched the rim and he fell.

44:42.840 --> 44:45.840
And he like shattered his arm and like you had to be there.

44:45.840 --> 44:47.840
And he like wouldn't let you sign his cast.

44:47.840 --> 44:48.840
Because you weren't there.

44:48.840 --> 44:50.840
And you felt like kind of shunned.

44:50.840 --> 44:52.840
And now you're 31.

44:52.840 --> 44:56.840
And you just bought a house and you need a new deck.

44:56.840 --> 45:00.840
But instead you're here.

45:00.840 --> 45:02.840
On a show.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.840
I guess what I'm trying to do.

45:04.840 --> 45:06.840
None of that had anything to do with what you were trying to do.

45:06.840 --> 45:09.840
I'm you're mad at Kurt Wiseman.

45:09.840 --> 45:13.840
I'm glad to be here to see you break your arm.

45:13.840 --> 45:16.840
I feel you.

45:16.840 --> 45:21.840
You know, and that's what I like about the show is that you feel better about yourself.

45:21.840 --> 45:26.840
We never we we all get to see you.

45:26.840 --> 45:29.840
Try to dunk and hurt yourself.

45:29.840 --> 45:31.840
Or the cast.

45:31.840 --> 45:32.840
Yeah.

45:32.840 --> 45:35.840
Sometimes we dunk.

45:35.840 --> 45:37.840
Dash cab was fun.

45:37.840 --> 45:38.840
That's kind of funny.

45:38.840 --> 45:40.840
That was a year ago.

45:40.840 --> 45:46.840
Allie, what do you got that ever since?

45:47.840 --> 45:49.840
The live stream.

45:49.840 --> 45:55.840
And then you can follow me on Twitter or Instagram or letter box at Ali Khan.

45:55.840 --> 45:58.840
And if you want to Venmo me at Ali Khan.

45:58.840 --> 46:01.840
Nice.

46:01.840 --> 46:02.840
I'm here.

46:02.840 --> 46:04.840
I'm on.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.840
Watch rooms.

46:09.840 --> 46:29.840
That was a hit dumb original.

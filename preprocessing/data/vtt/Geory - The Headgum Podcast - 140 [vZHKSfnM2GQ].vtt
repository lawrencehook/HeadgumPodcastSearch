00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Back in studio, once again, first time in 2023,

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
we've got Emma Silver's former head-gum intern current Hollywood powerhouse and George Sava.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
I'm also sort of a Hollywood-like. I'm at least a house.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
You're at least a woman.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
You're at least a woman.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
I am at that house.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
I'm at that house.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
I'm in trousers from New AD.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
New AD.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
N-E-O-I-T-Y is a little boutique in...

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Did you decide that's how it's pronounced?

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
How would you pronounce it, N-E-O-I-T-Y?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
N-E-O-I-T-Y.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Oh, and yours is cooler.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah, yours is way cooler.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Well, at some point...

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
No, it's N-E-O-I.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Sorry.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
We're just...

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
You just won second.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Sorry.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
At one point, during the show,

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I'm going to ask you to stand up and give us a spin.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
So we can see that that ass.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Yeah, he looks good in them.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Thank you.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
This is the nicest you've been.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Yeah, all of you.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Thank you.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
It's all thanks to N-E-O-I.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
This is sponsored by N-E-O-D.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
With promo code, what's that?

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
You're going to 50% off your pants at N-E-D.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
Well, if anyone's wondering why this doesn't look like it usually does,

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
it's because Casey took the video interface and flew to New York with it.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
I know Jeffrey looks really chill and cool in his glasses,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
but he's been spiraling.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
It's just that we have a studio in New York with the same interface.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Same exact video interface.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Unless it was broken.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Unless the interface in New York was broken.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
And with Casey, I'm so sorry, Casey.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
But if it wasn't, I don't know why they need to.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
I wonder why, because you called about it to find out it was in New York.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
And if I were on the other line of that call,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
I would say, oh, it's because the New York ones broke it.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
And they didn't say that.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
They didn't say that.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Yeah.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
So I would assume that it was all fine and well.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Good.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
You've got a lot to get to today.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Emma, you've never heard the show.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Never.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
So.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
I said, I said, tell me what to expect.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
And you said, come camera ready.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
This is the thing.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
By the way, people don't like when I just have my actual real-life friends on the show,

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
because I'm less interested.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Does it work?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
No one.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
No, it's that.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Well, here's why I'm not.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
I'm not.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
And they like George.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Thanks.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Okay.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Can you believe that?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
They like me.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
No, people don't like it because I'm usually not as mean to y'all.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
So wait, can I get the conceited of the show?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
You're mean to everyone.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Do you want to hear the elevator pitch?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Mm-hmm.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
It's 45 minutes of mean spirited pop culture discussion.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I already fucked it up.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Wait, take it again.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Take it again.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
It's a long elevator.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Take it again.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
It's like a billionaires row at elevator ride.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Yeah.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
It's 45 minutes of pop culture discussion.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Mean spirited games and quizzes and gotcha journalism.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Your information will be doxed.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
And it's basically-

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
I love it.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
It's like between two ferns meets taskmaster.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
I don't know.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
That's like a weapon.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Taskmaster is great.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Do you know taskmaster?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
What is everybody say that?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Because this show is not like taskmaster.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Have you watched taskmaster?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
What taskmaster?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
I love taskmaster.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
I love it.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
It's a British panel show.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Uh, it's where they just make them do tasks.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
And it's so much more endearing than what, like, the American version could ever be.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Which is, by the way, this.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Yeah.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Certainly.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Well, they did an American taskmaster that didn't really stick.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
All right.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Uh, but it's like, I don't know.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
The British comedians are so much more endearing about it because it feels like they're not.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
It's thirsty for attention.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
And it's also hour long.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Sure.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
So they have the taskmaster.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
So what are you talking about?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Is that he loves Europe?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
I do.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
I do.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
I do.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
I do.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
I do.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
I do.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
I do.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I do.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
I do.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
I do.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
I do.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
I do.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
I do.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
I do.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
I do.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Blanch City.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
I have a cousin.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Are they in Paris or London?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah, yeah.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
You're just saying, I have quantum crumpled Neil.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
You said it like Oprah giving away a gift.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
I thought of saying it like Georgia constraints.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Really?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
I want you to be like mean.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Oh, that'll come naturally.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Okay, by the way, you're like, you're, this isn't your house.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
You know what I mean?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
It's not your domain.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
So like don't, like,ion.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.320
Do people ever kick their legs up on this coffee table feel like I never see that?

04:49.040 --> 04:51.280
People haven't you want to be the first to test it out

04:52.160 --> 04:54.160
Day will weeks

04:54.160 --> 05:00.160
Emma, I don't know if I introduced you in the way that you wanted me to I didn't say your credits. I don't need you to say my credit

05:00.160 --> 05:04.400
Okay, I'm just a good. I'm a good vibe. No, I'm a cool person and good person

05:04.400 --> 05:08.720
You're out. Yeah, no, I'm a good person to be around. I'm a good friend. I'm a Leo

05:08.880 --> 05:10.880
No

05:11.680 --> 05:13.680
I didn't even finish my thought about

05:16.480 --> 05:24.800
We're shooting these on two iPhones that are sitting on chairs. So I think it's a lot of gum. It's called the head gum podcast and they don't give me any help or any notice

05:26.640 --> 05:29.360
Casey taught me how to use the studio. So I was like great

05:29.760 --> 05:33.760
Studio is always set up two years straight. It's been set up. I'll come in on a Saturday

05:33.760 --> 05:37.200
So I don't bother anyone and record a podcast with my friends

05:37.920 --> 05:42.400
We walk in and now there's just I walked into a really crazy energy

05:43.120 --> 05:45.760
Crazy energy and I'm energetically sensitive

05:47.760 --> 05:52.240
I was crazy here. It was crazy here. It was crazy here. You should be on senior superlatives

05:52.800 --> 05:55.680
What's that? Sorry, is that another head gum podcast?

05:56.400 --> 05:59.040
Wait, that's I actually've seen I have seen

05:59.040 --> 06:11.840
The week Daniel Craig is out as 007 so every week until the next James is cast

06:11.840 --> 06:14.080
We're loving up our pick for the next bond

06:14.640 --> 06:18.960
What do you guys got who are you guys going with I can also start if you're nervous. I want to go last okay

06:18.960 --> 06:20.960
I'm gonna say Bryce James

06:21.440 --> 06:23.840
Who is that that's Lebron's youngest son?

06:24.560 --> 06:27.840
Not the one that's it conversations around that's what I'm saying is

06:28.800 --> 06:34.400
Bron is the talk of the town. He's the talk of the nation. He's going to play in the NBA probably

06:34.800 --> 06:37.200
Bryce not as good at basketball

06:37.440 --> 06:43.520
Doesn't even have as much of a personality as Bron is so I'm wondering if he kind of sees how he fares over

06:44.720 --> 06:50.800
As James he's already you know how the price James bond. What's that? How old is he? I think he's 12

06:51.920 --> 06:56.560
And I'd a curiosity how the game works is it has had James in the name. It does not okay

06:56.880 --> 07:05.040
Give me anyone okay. Yeah, I'm I'm trying what's gonna like in dear me to people

07:07.040 --> 07:13.680
These yeah you gotta keep those thoughts inside because we're all thinking because it's like our people are gonna like me

07:13.680 --> 07:18.720
If I say like I think Megan from Megan to the bottom. No, no, George

07:21.040 --> 07:23.040
Haven't seen Megan. It's kind of gone love

07:24.000 --> 07:29.520
What's the hot thing infinity pool? I want the goot. I want the chain the collar the leash

07:30.080 --> 07:34.240
What oh, is that I haven't seen anything. Stop right here reference. You don't know

07:36.080 --> 07:41.200
Um, no, you said it. Okay, so wait, which one is it Megan from Megan or is it

07:42.240 --> 07:44.240
The or is it

07:44.240 --> 07:46.240
Make

07:51.920 --> 07:56.160
That was a really good impression though. I got it really good my gosh, like you're being too nice

07:56.720 --> 08:03.200
You're being so nice. I love him and that's a big talk with syndrome people rarely get there in an episode

08:03.760 --> 08:07.520
We were out last week my sister was visiting

08:07.520 --> 08:13.840
Uh, and Emma turned to my sister and said it point to me and said we hate him

08:15.360 --> 08:17.360
When did I say the heart the grand

08:18.560 --> 08:19.840
Don't yeah

08:19.840 --> 08:22.800
Don't not remember the grand wait, but no of course you remember the grand

08:22.800 --> 08:26.720
I did I say that I felt like it was it was Aberbone

08:27.280 --> 08:29.280
That's crazy. I feel

08:30.320 --> 08:32.960
I'm so sorry. No, it's okay. I just been thinking about it

08:34.960 --> 08:36.880
Okay, you're bonded the week wait, and who's his

08:37.440 --> 08:39.440
Megan the doll

08:39.440 --> 08:41.440
Right, right, right, or

08:43.440 --> 08:45.440
Megan

08:45.440 --> 08:47.440
Josh Hacks saying

08:48.240 --> 08:50.240
Yeah

08:50.240 --> 08:52.240
You're getting further and further

08:52.240 --> 08:54.240
Yeah, I'm into my first one

08:54.240 --> 08:56.240
I knew I would you just it like bane

08:57.120 --> 09:01.760
Okay, I wish oh, did I ever show you my uh my character Anthony Borbane

09:02.480 --> 09:05.200
Was it I wish born in a kitchen

09:07.840 --> 09:13.280
That is so stupid and then this is him. This is Anthony Borbane at

09:14.560 --> 09:15.760
squirrel

09:15.760 --> 09:17.760
I was born in a kitchen

09:18.400 --> 09:19.600
MOLLY

09:21.600 --> 09:23.600
That is such a niche

09:23.600 --> 09:25.600
Oh my god

09:25.600 --> 09:27.600
That was so stupid

09:27.600 --> 09:32.880
That was right. That was just for me. That was just for me. I was also kind of for George and he was like it at all

09:32.960 --> 09:36.160
Well, I just know it's from a sketch we did two years ago

09:36.160 --> 09:40.960
That's what I just say there's two camera angles what is just the souls of your feet

09:43.200 --> 09:50.000
In earlier camera angle was just Jeffrey's a knee. Yeah, we should say that the molded by a joke was because

09:50.400 --> 09:53.680
No, y'all these jokes don't explain it. They get it. They get it. They definitely don't get it

09:53.680 --> 09:57.200
Most people who listen to the show do not live here. What view? How many lessons are you getting?

09:58.480 --> 10:00.160
week

10:00.240 --> 10:05.040
That's not true between you get stage right for the rest of five times. I was like about 15 people

10:05.040 --> 10:09.120
Listen to me. Sorry no fans. I know you are successful and good at podcasting

10:09.600 --> 10:14.000
That's how many how many lessons you have to get such that they remember to leave the

10:14.000 --> 10:16.720
important piece of equipment that you're able to record in the studio

10:17.840 --> 10:21.280
That remains to be seen. I think it's more just that people don't like me personally

10:21.280 --> 10:26.880
Like it could be a million lessons a week and they just would not you know rank is your tight-up cream

10:27.520 --> 10:34.720
Yeah, I really like it. I got it from Gimmy Danger more local L.A. This is also why people don't like when I have my friends on because we just talk about our actual lives

10:34.720 --> 10:39.120
Wait, where it's Gimmy Danger? It's a on Sunset in Coronado. It's on the side of a cliff

10:40.160 --> 10:42.160
Oh, thank you

10:42.960 --> 10:47.600
Wait, I'm curious if you rank that all the shows on Hank um it's at a chill

11:29.440 --> 11:31.440
Oh, Hollywood handbook

11:52.560 --> 11:57.120
If I'm an old YouTube video where he's or like old vine I want to say maybe it's TikTok

11:57.120 --> 12:00.640
I don't know what when it was wrong, but he has a high-waisted pants. He's like hunched over

12:00.640 --> 12:06.640
He's really shortly screaming in the park. Oh my god in New York. Yeah, do you know I'm talking about him? That's my bond of the week

12:36.160 --> 12:39.200
Yeah, that's what everyone says because it's not first of all again

12:39.200 --> 12:41.840
I'm trying really hard to be mean to your face. It's really difficult

12:42.560 --> 12:47.120
But I think I'm succeeding and it's hard to I think I'm succeeding. Yeah, I feel like I'm I'm

12:47.600 --> 12:52.800
Being mean on your path. I'm wondering if you would be a guest host. Oh, I would love to

12:53.360 --> 12:59.280
Not now, but like I'm saying if I need one you've kind of captured the tone perfectly and you never heard the show

12:59.280 --> 13:02.000
I feel like I'd also be a really good guest host

13:02.080 --> 13:04.080
You know

13:04.480 --> 13:10.800
Gwen's cultural hilariously admits that she uses her under eye masks during meetings quote

13:11.200 --> 13:13.200
Sorry, not sorry

13:13.200 --> 13:14.400
Queen

13:14.400 --> 13:16.400
That's my god. What's an under eye mask?

13:16.960 --> 13:22.640
We do not I'm so sorry. I'm actually dead as you not know. I can like yes, I think yes like

13:23.600 --> 13:24.800

Okay, I want on it's like it gets rid of like eye bags. Yeah, okay. I get the utility and then

13:30.800 --> 13:33.600
So she uses that in meetings and

13:34.160 --> 13:39.600
She's not she's sorry, but she's not sorry. I like I love her. I love my girl boss

13:39.600 --> 13:41.600
I genuinely love her

13:41.840 --> 13:45.280
I would you like one other person and it just sort of like I didn't ally

13:48.160 --> 13:53.120
I cannot stress to you guys enough people are not gonna like this episode because of me or and or Marieco are not on

13:53.440 --> 13:57.280
You guys are my actual friends. We're talking about LA references. It's shot poorly. It's interesting

13:57.520 --> 14:02.560
They're this is like the recipe. Can I say something though? I wonder if it'll have like a the room

14:02.560 --> 14:07.440
Ask audience that'll find it and have fun with it. Yeah, because it's so bad. It's so

14:07.920 --> 14:14.160
That's left to say Twitter. Oh, yeah, what's the drinking game of the this episode or the show? Okay

14:15.120 --> 14:18.400
Yeah, let's do that, but you know obviously drink responsibly George

14:19.040 --> 14:22.800

Compod guess drinking and you can play with any episode drink when I say what's that?

14:37.360 --> 14:42.160
Drink when there's a damn Daniel sound effect. No drink when there's a bomb drops out of effect

14:42.720 --> 14:44.720
Drink when there's an applause sound effect

14:45.040 --> 14:49.840
Drink when somebody drink when a new guest doesn't understand the show

14:50.800 --> 14:53.520
Drink when I bring up something deeply

14:54.480 --> 14:56.480
Personal about myself or y'all

14:57.120 --> 15:01.520
Drink when I mentioned anything related to kink drink when

15:03.200 --> 15:07.200
I make fun of somebody who's not in the room and drink when a

15:07.840 --> 15:09.600
Theme song goes on way too long

15:10.240 --> 15:16.960
I think those that's a good start. Yeah, but I'd like for somebody who has time on their hands to come up with a better one because those you know

15:17.920 --> 15:21.120
Somebody meaning an audience member that you wouldn't pay

15:22.640 --> 15:28.640
I'm just wondering my assistants are interns. Yeah. Yeah, they got to be quality experience. Yeah

15:31.120 --> 15:35.600
All recipes recently tried every peanut butter to determine the best to determine the best

15:36.400 --> 15:40.320

15:45.120 --> 15:52.320

16:16.400 --> 16:18.400
It's amazing

16:18.400 --> 16:23.760
I don't think it's called Santa Cruz Cruz spelled like a vacation in about

16:23.760 --> 16:26.080

Yeah, married that high school

16:59.600 --> 17:06.640

17:06.720 --> 17:10.400
No, I thought that he married somebody who he dated very young

17:10.400 --> 17:12.720

17:13.280 --> 17:14.720

17:14.720 --> 17:18.960
President of France I've heard of it. I would know because I'm obsessed with Europe. Yeah

17:20.080 --> 17:23.360
I'm pissed because you went from this Italian file Italian file

17:25.600 --> 17:30.560
Persona non-Grotta by the way and now you're shifting into like a francophile thing

17:30.560 --> 17:36.080
I don't know if I'd ever go full francophile the French scare me. I'm visiting my friend

17:36.640 --> 17:43.040
pastry chef who lives in Paris. Okay, this is perfect for the segment that's gonna come later

Because what is that? What is that pastry show your life is crazy like I feel like there's parts you always do have friends where it goes huh

17:52.480 --> 17:54.240

I've known him since high school that I mean and that's the wild card is that it's off in a high school

18:03.840 --> 18:07.200
Friend who's gone on to do something awesome people from Ohio are

18:08.080 --> 18:11.360
End up doing cool things. Well they end up in a meeting the state shout out

18:12.800 --> 18:18.000
According to a recent study and so apparently our masters of detecting breast cancer early

18:18.640 --> 18:20.640
thoughts and so you're

18:21.040 --> 18:23.040
Parents like

18:25.040 --> 18:32.320
That's why we won't get a better joke and that per the Idaho statesman this Idaho restaurant made yelps top 100 places to eat

18:32.640 --> 18:37.440
Can I say one thing about ants this I know you said we're not gonna get a better joke

18:37.440 --> 18:42.480
And this is in a joke. It just sort of feels relevant my my cousins who are in England

18:43.040 --> 18:47.360
Who I mentioned already I'm gonna aunt they the aunt lives there. Also she has

18:47.920 --> 18:49.920
breast cancer so

18:55.120 --> 19:00.240
I pressed the button before you said I saw what that what

19:01.200 --> 19:07.520
I want to say I'm sorry about that

19:09.520 --> 19:16.800
They they think they've gotten most of it removed but last I spoke to her over the like the holiday break

19:17.280 --> 19:20.080
She's like I don't know I think I got to go in for some more stuff

19:20.640 --> 19:26.240
I hope this isn't a joke that you're doing it's not a joke. I just thought it was relevant after the joke about ants and breast cancer

19:26.800 --> 19:33.120
I would be remiss if the the family I talked about in England I didn't mention that I've an aunt who has breast cancer

19:35.760 --> 19:37.760
I think she's doing okay okay

19:39.760 --> 19:41.760
I'll report back

19:41.760 --> 19:42.960
When I go

19:42.960 --> 19:44.960
I think people love

19:45.840 --> 19:47.840
So what was this about the girl being on fire

19:48.240 --> 19:49.520
Um

19:49.520 --> 19:51.280
Play sound

19:51.280 --> 19:52.720
Play the sound again

19:52.720 --> 19:54.960
Per the Idaho states manager

19:54.960 --> 19:59.920
This Idaho restaurant may just top 100 places to eat swallow your pride, boysy

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Is he's comfort kitchen of

20:04.640 --> 20:05.840
Core de la

20:06.880 --> 20:08.160
Idaho

20:08.160 --> 20:11.360
Was named the 43rd best place to eat in America

20:12.240 --> 20:17.120
No boysy restaurant has ever made the list what do you guys think?

20:17.200 --> 20:24.240
Major major major major upset. Yeah, boysy supposed to be cool. I've heard boysy's cool from hell

20:26.480 --> 20:31.520
From Jake and Amira actually hmm. Yeah, uh another high school friend

20:31.520 --> 20:33.200
I don't talk to this one as much anymore

20:33.600 --> 20:37.280
We've to boysy seems to be doing pretty well based on Instagram

20:37.920 --> 20:42.960
We're where have you been in the country that you that you like that's like random that would be like you know

20:42.960 --> 20:45.600
What you know where is actually a cool place to go is this place

20:46.240 --> 20:49.280
It's a really good question and if you guys have answers. I'd love to hear yours first

20:49.280 --> 20:54.400
But my immediate reaction is like and it's not that people don't assume that this area is cool

20:54.400 --> 20:57.360
But I think it's cooler than people even think it is and that's like

20:58.240 --> 21:01.280
Upstate New York like Ulster County Kingston woodstock

21:01.840 --> 21:04.400
I think it's awesome and I want all my friends to move there

21:05.520 --> 21:11.840
But you're gonna you're gonna be on a commune and what stock is that be ideal? I mean there's the bird cliff institute

21:12.480 --> 21:15.440
Where you can like apply for an artist's residency

21:15.440 --> 21:18.480
So I I've considered especially if something bad happens in my life

21:18.480 --> 21:21.680
You know like a tragedy. I lose a friend or like I lose a lover

21:22.080 --> 21:29.120
You know whether that's to like another career that takes the vow of the state or the country or whether that's

21:29.600 --> 21:35.920
You moving to Italy? I don't know. Maybe I'll move to woodstock and do an artist residency for this podcast

21:36.080 --> 21:41.840
I thought you were saying like if you lose someone because then you'll have like a muse of sorts to produce art at

21:41.840 --> 21:43.840
No, I just want to have anyone to hang out

21:44.240 --> 21:50.640
Because I'm not interested by the way in expanding my circle beyond what I have no sure keep your circle small

21:50.800 --> 21:58.240
Because especially when you have all right now. I'm getting excited and angry like when you are ascending to the heights that I aspire to

21:59.040 --> 22:01.040
It's gonna get lonely or lonely

22:01.760 --> 22:05.520
Sure, so let me finish and it's like you have to make sure that you keep

22:06.880 --> 22:08.880
And then you keep your circle small

22:09.280 --> 22:11.280
So your friends are close where you enemies

22:11.920 --> 22:14.480
And it's and it's like it's it's who can you trust you?

22:14.720 --> 22:18.320
Yeah, who's gonna be the one second and it's who's gonna be there for you? Sorry one second

22:18.320 --> 22:22.720
And it's and it's like who's gonna be there for you like you know because you wasn't with me you haven't said a

22:22.720 --> 22:24.720
Great sentence

22:24.720 --> 22:30.320
I was and then you're sort of being just one second, actually so basically it's like the the higher you ascend the you know

22:30.320 --> 22:32.320
You look a certain chance me just one second

22:32.880 --> 22:36.640
Because it's like who do you trust because you wasn't with me shooting in the gym you know what I mean?

22:39.120 --> 22:44.480
You wasn't with you shooting in the gym. That's a drake lyric about how yeah

22:45.200 --> 22:47.200
Like his new friends. Yeah

22:47.680 --> 22:51.680

22:54.960 --> 22:56.960

23:05.840 --> 23:07.840
Sorry I did a lot of blow last night

23:09.600 --> 23:12.960

Oh, my god, he's holding me for auto seemingly taking his cue from Madonna

25:49.120 --> 25:53.840
Normally the city of Boulder open space and mountain parks trail cams

25:53.920 --> 26:01.200
Capture bears scratching or eating or giving viewers a rear view

26:01.840 --> 26:11.440
But sometimes the bears investigate the cameras and out of 580 images captured by one trail cam

26:12.000 --> 26:18.000
About 400 or bear selfies so obviously the bear was looking for you know the right angle

26:18.480 --> 26:25.680
For one photo side profile. This one is giving you a little leader noted one viewers on his game

26:26.960 --> 26:31.200
Oh, so pretty I feel pretty and witty and gay

26:31.760 --> 26:36.240
We don't even know if this bear is a girl or a boy. I can't say for sure

26:37.600 --> 26:41.280
It didn't say well that's exactly yeah and just like with humans

26:41.280 --> 26:44.960
I'll be there will rejects upon instead of a face

26:45.840 --> 26:51.600
Wildlife experts never know which critters will trigger their motion activated cameras

26:52.800 --> 26:55.840
Be at a wild turkey a prairie dog

26:57.200 --> 27:05.040
A leaping fox or a howling coyote and now we're howling over 400 bear selfies

27:05.520 --> 27:11.440
Playing an actress trying to come out of hibernation, but I must admit I'm ready for my close-up

27:11.680 --> 27:13.680
Maybe not that close up

27:15.440 --> 27:17.440
And quit bearing your tongue

27:18.240 --> 27:20.240
Genie moes, see in it

27:21.680 --> 27:23.680
I'll yoke

27:24.960 --> 27:27.680
A minute I could have pulled a minute from that

27:27.680 --> 27:29.680
Clio

27:30.880 --> 27:32.880
They would see an an anchor and

27:34.000 --> 27:39.200
Usually her stuff is pretty tight. Yeah, she she left a lot in there. Yeah, you think it was a slow day

27:39.200 --> 27:41.200
So we're filling the hour

27:41.200 --> 27:46.400
I mean if it was a slow day, I feel like they would have spent more time editing it, right? So like I feel like it was probably a really

27:46.400 --> 27:48.400
So was it a girl or a gay guy

27:48.400 --> 27:50.400
There

27:51.360 --> 27:53.360
Why do you ask?

27:53.920 --> 27:55.920
Yeah

27:57.920 --> 27:59.920
Stray guys don't take selfies

28:02.960 --> 28:04.960
He's don't

28:09.600 --> 28:12.720
Guys this episode of our show is brought to you by better help

28:13.040 --> 28:18.800
I've talked about this for years guys, but the reason I go to therapy is so that I can be the best version of myself

28:19.040 --> 28:27.040
And show up for those people in my life that I love and the things in my life that I love as the best version of myself or the best possible version of myself

28:27.280 --> 28:32.800
That I can be all right and a lot of that is due to therapy and that's where better help can help you

28:33.280 --> 28:35.360

But sometimes life gets you bogged down and you may feel overwhelmed or like you're not showing up in the way that you want to

28:40.960 --> 28:44.800
And working with a therapist can help you get closer to being the best version of you

28:45.520 --> 28:50.480
Because when you feel empowered you're more prepared to take on everything that life throws at you

28:51.520 --> 28:56.400
Again, I'm in therapy every week. I had therapy today. I'm feeling light. I'm feeling limber and feeling alive

28:56.400 --> 28:58.400
I'm feeling wise

28:58.400 --> 29:04.320

This is a segment I like to call breaking story with jory

29:47.520 --> 29:49.520
Is it some of our current segment

29:50.560 --> 29:56.560
We'll see how it goes first time I brought it up got it, but I think it has the potential to be I mean this would go to my

29:57.200 --> 29:59.200
guest hosting campaign

30:00.400 --> 30:04.640
I got asked a guest host. I know, but I think I'd be a pretty good make it pretty good run

30:06.400 --> 30:15.040
Okay, I'm fine. I you're so funny. I thought that was a picture of you and then I just let you mispode your own things all mixed race guys

30:15.040 --> 30:17.040
Look at this

30:18.240 --> 30:20.240
Buck up you're self-cating by

30:21.920 --> 30:23.920
racial

30:24.880 --> 30:26.880
What did you say about me?

30:27.120 --> 30:30.640
Nothing nothing. I know I'm just let's just say I'm glad it's a lease

30:33.520 --> 30:37.840
The the lease of the apartment we live in together. No, that's great

30:39.440 --> 30:41.680
This is breaking story with jory

30:43.040 --> 30:46.640
Jory being like because you know how like you know it's like ramen you know

30:47.600 --> 30:51.200
Sign fell, you know if you had your multi-cam

30:51.680 --> 30:54.480
In theory it would be George because that's my name

30:54.480 --> 31:00.720
But you know American sea George spelled with an S and they instantly think it's you know I caught him George is yeah

31:01.360 --> 31:05.840
Well, who is it is it like to your face and I was being so nice I was like trying to explain

31:06.000 --> 31:10.720
Introducing a bunch of people like kept calling George is who called you gorgeous George is was that's Shelby or

31:11.840 --> 31:13.840
Master

31:14.400 --> 31:16.400
fight

31:17.040 --> 31:20.400
Fight does and then my friend cinnamon frost

31:22.640 --> 31:28.240
Breaking story with jory uh so yes, if you sold a show where you're you know in it

31:28.240 --> 31:33.280
Starting in it. It's a multi-cam is kind of cheesy. Yeah, I think it would be called jory. Kind of a different story

31:34.800 --> 31:39.520
Sort of relates to jory. It's like it's like quick. Yeah. I'll be really quick

31:39.920 --> 31:44.880
And then you can explain what this segment is. Okay, great. Um, I was like buying a suit

31:45.760 --> 31:50.720
And I was like the one that was being pushed to you. It was very it was very me

31:50.960 --> 31:56.320
I had the guy it's looming dales like hold it for me and I was like I'm not gonna come back to get this

31:56.320 --> 31:58.320
But he helped me for so long. I felt bad

31:59.040 --> 32:06.560
And he's like what name should I put it under and I was like George and I spelled out my name G E O R G E S and I watch what he typed and he put in G O R E

32:08.400 --> 32:10.400
Gory

32:10.400 --> 32:12.400
So pretty close

32:13.040 --> 32:15.040
Yeah, he made with the one

32:20.240 --> 32:25.040
You did tell me that story and it is very funny to me, so maybe we'd be boring

32:25.360 --> 32:33.840
But I still think spelled this way. I had a my freshman year in high school by O teacher was named Mr. Gory

32:34.800 --> 32:38.720
Okay, he's before anyone pushes any sounds he did die

32:47.120 --> 32:49.280
Little podcast that Jeffrey's trying to do

32:52.720 --> 32:58.480
Breaking story with Gory. So let so I I brought this up to because a you work in TV writing

32:59.200 --> 33:03.600
You are and then also your personal life in my opinion

33:04.400 --> 33:09.760
It's kind of like a sitcom and it's kind of like that classic sitcom where it's like

33:10.320 --> 33:13.040
There's no way this would happen. What's up right where this is going continue?

33:13.920 --> 33:16.320
I just thought we could break some story for like

33:17.360 --> 33:22.720
Gory like so the show is called Gory right spelled G E O R Y right and so it's

33:23.440 --> 33:30.640
It's very it's very they're right behind me aren't that yeah exactly so let's say this is season this is like episode 318

33:30.640 --> 33:35.520
Right we are we know the show we know the character this is a 24 episode series absolutely wow

33:35.520 --> 33:38.000
We got an order networker. This is gonna be

33:38.720 --> 33:40.720
Networks

33:41.200 --> 33:43.200
Yeah

33:43.200 --> 33:45.520
No, it's a Netflix multi-camp

33:46.240 --> 33:49.600
That is such a specific vibe. Yeah, so it's called Gory

33:50.160 --> 33:53.360
This is episode 318 so we are in the midst of the show

33:53.360 --> 33:56.560
We know what it is who are the characters first of all. Let's get our cast

33:57.360 --> 33:58.560
Okay, there's Gory

33:58.560 --> 34:04.320
There's Gory Gory gets introduced last week. I want to wait. Sorry. Is it how old is he

34:05.200 --> 34:09.760
Are we in high school? Oh, he's we're 27. Okay, this is your little current life. Oh, this is my current life

34:09.760 --> 34:12.560
And it's real so you want me to like this real people my life

34:13.680 --> 34:16.640
It's boss my boss. Yeah, damn damn

34:16.960 --> 34:18.960
Gory

34:18.960 --> 34:25.280
Which we are gonna maybe need to change the name just so people don't get confused because you're Gory right I think it's a drink

34:25.760 --> 34:29.520
My name George has a soft G sure and you're

34:31.520 --> 34:38.560
You've also changed it from Gory to Gory over the course of like this are quite a lot you've changed your own pronunciation

34:42.080 --> 34:44.080
Breaking story with Gory

34:45.440 --> 34:49.200
So there's a Gory and then Gory. Why's it called breaking Gory?

34:49.200 --> 34:55.280
Because I'm sort of breaking at the seams. You're we're the segment

34:55.280 --> 35:01.120
I got it the segment is called breaking story breaking story for the show for the so joy I'm up to speed

35:01.120 --> 35:04.880
Unless you're like leaving the persona again non-grata of

35:04.880 --> 35:10.320
Jory because then it would be like breaking what do you think for son and non-grata? It means you're not well

35:11.120 --> 35:16.720
On the set of your own goddamn show if you shed the identity of Jory because that's what's sold the show

35:16.800 --> 35:22.160
And that's what brings in the listeners and the other I think it's more interesting to me to also think about

35:23.200 --> 35:28.400
What the drama is making Gory right so behind

35:28.400 --> 35:34.960
In like a Larry Sanders way do I run my own room? Yeah, okay

35:36.160 --> 35:40.000
This is like Larry Sanders meets what's the racial blue show that was like so good

35:40.800 --> 35:43.600
I loved it. Hex no the new one on Hulu

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I would really loved it so much. Oh reboot

35:46.960 --> 35:51.040
Best on television best of all time legitimately best of all time. Well you haven't seen Jory

35:51.360 --> 35:55.840
So let's get some story. This is just we are in the writer's room. It's a gig and Michael Kee and Judy Greer

35:55.840 --> 35:59.040
We're like fucking they've no chemistry

35:59.040 --> 36:01.040
I loved it

36:01.600 --> 36:04.240
What's sorry? What arouses

36:06.640 --> 36:08.640
That part of the show

36:09.040 --> 36:11.040
Rachel Bloom

36:12.800 --> 36:14.320
Okay, okay, we're breaking sorry

36:14.960 --> 36:19.120
So do you want to switch? Are you saying you want us to just to just pitch George's real life?

36:19.440 --> 36:22.000
I mean are you guys ready to do this like that? Yeah, I want to do your little show

36:22.000 --> 36:24.720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't talk for a Jeffrey Jeffrey. I want to do the segment

36:24.720 --> 36:29.520
But are you saying that we're pitching George's real life? No, I'm okay, so this is it

36:30.640 --> 36:35.840
It really explain the conceit of this segment. I made a whole graphic to make it clear

36:35.840 --> 36:41.840
I'm just like, is it as wacky boss or it's like real boss Dan Gore?

36:41.840 --> 36:44.840
It's based on true events in your life.

36:44.840 --> 36:48.840
But we're making it a bit wacky, fine, for now we're out for me.

36:48.840 --> 36:49.840
For the comedy.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.840
Because ultimately it's not a documentary.

36:51.840 --> 36:52.840
It's a sitcom.

36:52.840 --> 36:56.840
I think it'd be fun if jewelry is like always slipping.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.840
Am I doing that in real life?

36:58.840 --> 36:59.840
I know.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.840
No, we just said that we're expanding it for network.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.840
Like, we just that we're making it broad.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.840
And I feel like nothing's finding something.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.840
I thought I was doing this segment perfectly.

37:09.840 --> 37:13.840
I thought I just gave up with like a really good picture.

37:13.840 --> 37:17.840
I guess I don't know where the lines of fiction and reality are.

37:17.840 --> 37:18.840
I think it could be anywhere.

37:18.840 --> 37:21.840
There are no where I am.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.840
So I think I'm slipping on this.

37:23.840 --> 37:25.840
What if I'm a family man?

37:25.840 --> 37:27.840
It's really funny.

37:27.840 --> 37:28.840
What do you mean?

37:28.840 --> 37:29.840
You don't have a family.

37:29.840 --> 37:30.840
It's based on your real life.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.840
Yeah, but I'm not always slipping.

37:33.840 --> 37:34.840
You're always getting in trouble.

37:34.840 --> 37:35.840
Yeah.

37:35.840 --> 37:38.840
But like you could be 27 single and out of a family and slip.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.840
And that's like within the bounds of the public.

37:40.840 --> 37:41.840
Right.

37:41.840 --> 37:42.840
You don't have a kid.

37:42.840 --> 37:43.840
So we're not going to give you a kid.

37:43.840 --> 37:44.840
You don't have a wife or a wife.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.840
What if he's always extending it?

37:46.840 --> 37:47.840
That's funny.

37:47.840 --> 37:48.840
I'm not.

37:48.840 --> 37:49.840
All right.

37:49.840 --> 37:50.840
No.

37:50.840 --> 37:51.840
Say your piece.

37:51.840 --> 37:52.840
Stop saying me.

37:52.840 --> 37:53.840
You are the one who has to be on camera.

37:53.840 --> 37:54.840
Like this is jewelry.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.840
And like this is the kind of thing that by the way like

37:57.840 --> 37:59.840
New Yorkers are going to gather in Times Square

37:59.840 --> 38:00.840
with the Cincinnati Aquivalent.

38:00.840 --> 38:07.840
If I have a found square, I would say if I'm if I'm the star of the show,

38:07.840 --> 38:10.840
it's episode 318 and people are loving it.

38:10.840 --> 38:11.840
Yeah.

38:11.840 --> 38:13.840
If we could not speak in hypothetical.

38:13.840 --> 38:14.840
Okay.

38:14.840 --> 38:15.840
So it's episode 318.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.840
So it's episode 318 people have been loving the show.

38:17.840 --> 38:18.840
Loving it by the way.

38:18.840 --> 38:20.840
Like, you know, in today's numbers.

38:20.840 --> 38:21.840
So it's still something.

38:21.840 --> 38:22.840
There's an audience.

38:22.840 --> 38:23.840
Yeah.

38:23.840 --> 38:24.840
It's not at an eight.

38:24.840 --> 38:25.840
You're out of one.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.840
So could I be like in the way that like the rock insist that he can't lose.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.840
Can't lose in any of his things.

38:30.840 --> 38:31.840
Can I?

38:31.840 --> 38:32.840
It's not going to be.

38:32.840 --> 38:33.840
He says he can't lose.

38:33.840 --> 38:35.840
He can't lose and they have to be pro-war.

38:35.840 --> 38:36.840
What?

38:36.840 --> 38:37.840
Wow.

38:37.840 --> 38:38.840
Do you think they're up?

38:38.840 --> 38:39.840
Sorry, pro the army.

38:39.840 --> 38:40.840
I should say.

38:40.840 --> 38:41.840
Which is December.

38:41.840 --> 38:43.840
Well, that means they all have to be pro the army.

38:43.840 --> 38:44.840
Like, you can't have it.

38:44.840 --> 38:45.840
What about the two fairy?

38:45.840 --> 38:47.840
That's funny.

38:47.840 --> 38:50.840
Uh, they just can't say anything bad about the military.

38:50.840 --> 38:53.840
The military has to be like really awesome.

38:53.840 --> 38:55.840
Have you guys heard of it?

38:55.840 --> 38:56.840
Yeah.

38:56.840 --> 38:57.840
Rock.

38:57.840 --> 38:58.840
I think.

38:58.840 --> 38:59.840
Are you supposed to sexualize him?

38:59.840 --> 39:01.840
I think he's utterly sexless.

39:01.840 --> 39:05.840
I think in that movie he did with Gal Gadot, where they're in love.

39:05.840 --> 39:09.840
It's like, I've never seen two just smoother.

39:09.840 --> 39:10.840
Like $10.

39:10.840 --> 39:11.840
People.

39:11.840 --> 39:12.840
Yeah.

39:12.840 --> 39:13.840
Literally.

39:13.840 --> 39:14.840
Like.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.840
And would you say he is an uncut gem?

39:16.840 --> 39:17.840
Yeah.

39:17.840 --> 39:19.840
It's pretty cut.

39:19.840 --> 39:20.840
Okay.

39:20.840 --> 39:24.840
This girl is um.

39:25.840 --> 39:26.840
Because you had a bad.

39:30.840 --> 39:31.840
Broken.

39:31.840 --> 39:32.840
Sweet.

39:32.840 --> 39:34.840
I have pitched two character traits about the military.

39:34.840 --> 39:35.840
She's been doing a good stuff.

39:35.840 --> 39:36.840
I need the cast.

39:36.840 --> 39:37.840
I actually haven't been really active in the room.

39:37.840 --> 39:38.840
Here's what you need to do.

39:38.840 --> 39:40.840
You need to say who our cast is.

39:40.840 --> 39:41.840
Okay.

39:41.840 --> 39:44.840
I would say you two are featured players.

39:44.840 --> 39:45.840
Okay.

39:45.840 --> 39:46.840
But don't say YouTube.

39:46.840 --> 39:47.840
Like be like, okay.

39:47.840 --> 39:48.840
There's blank.

39:48.840 --> 39:49.840
Yeah.

39:49.840 --> 39:50.840
Like there's George Kisses.

39:50.840 --> 39:51.840
Okay.

39:51.840 --> 39:52.840
Yeah.

39:52.840 --> 39:53.840
Okay.

39:54.840 --> 39:55.840
Haha.

39:55.840 --> 39:56.840
Haha.

39:56.840 --> 39:57.840
Haha.

39:57.840 --> 39:58.840
Haha.

39:58.840 --> 39:59.840
Haha.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.840
There's Kramer.

40:01.840 --> 40:02.840
I guess.

40:02.840 --> 40:03.840
Oh yeah.

40:03.840 --> 40:04.840
It's really cool.

40:04.840 --> 40:05.840
If I'm like.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.840
What if I'm like learning?

40:07.840 --> 40:09.840
Who are the characters?

40:09.840 --> 40:10.840
George.

40:10.840 --> 40:11.840
Who are the characters?

40:11.840 --> 40:12.840
Name us.

40:12.840 --> 40:13.840
Just describe us.

40:13.840 --> 40:14.840
Just like George's choice.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.840
You know what I've ever seen a multi-cam shoot.

40:16.840 --> 40:18.840
George, just describe us.

40:18.840 --> 40:19.840
It's like.

40:19.840 --> 40:21.840
And playing this guy is like.

40:21.840 --> 40:22.840
Oh.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.840
And describe us in in multi-cam character.

40:24.840 --> 40:25.840
Lingo.

40:25.840 --> 40:26.840
That's we're asking for.

40:26.840 --> 40:27.840
Okay.

40:27.840 --> 40:28.840
I would say.

40:28.840 --> 40:30.840
You go from the least featured to the same characters.

40:30.840 --> 40:31.840
Okay.

40:31.840 --> 40:32.840
Let's go.

40:32.840 --> 40:33.840
Let's go.

40:33.840 --> 40:34.840
Least featured.

40:34.840 --> 40:35.840
And I'm one of the six.

40:35.840 --> 40:36.840
Yes.

40:36.840 --> 40:37.840
You're your number one on the call sheet.

40:37.840 --> 40:38.840
Okay.

40:38.840 --> 40:39.840
I'm number one on the call sheet.

40:39.840 --> 40:40.840
We'll go.

40:40.840 --> 40:41.840
Oh.

40:41.840 --> 40:42.840
Okay.

40:42.840 --> 40:43.840
George is wacky neighbor.

40:43.840 --> 40:44.840
KELBY.

40:44.840 --> 40:45.840
That's our landlord.

40:45.840 --> 40:46.840
That's our landlord.

40:46.840 --> 40:47.840
That's our landlord.

40:47.840 --> 40:48.840
That's our landlord.

40:48.840 --> 40:50.840
That's our landlord.

40:51.840 --> 40:52.840
That's a really landlord.

40:52.840 --> 40:53.840
Truly is the most normal guy.

40:53.840 --> 40:54.840
Yeah.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.840
He does not look like a Kelpie.

40:56.840 --> 40:57.840
He's like.

40:57.840 --> 40:58.840
You just guarded anywhere.

40:58.840 --> 40:59.840
Short swing.

40:59.840 --> 41:00.840
It's too cold.

41:00.840 --> 41:01.840
Yeah.

41:01.840 --> 41:02.840
What's very filling.

41:02.840 --> 41:03.840
Um.

41:03.840 --> 41:04.840
Okay.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.840
I think structurally.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.840
It's like you have your me character.

41:09.840 --> 41:13.840
You would have a the the will they won't they type.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.840
Which is who.

41:15.840 --> 41:16.840
Uh.

41:16.840 --> 41:17.840
When I'm getting them.

41:17.840 --> 41:18.840
Filling the archetypes first.

41:18.840 --> 41:19.840
And then we're working backwards.

41:19.840 --> 41:20.340
Yeah.

41:20.340 --> 41:25.340
we have our, like, a pair of characters

41:25.380 --> 41:28.900
that is a couple, and then a pair of characters

41:28.900 --> 41:30.060
that are wild cards.

41:30.060 --> 41:32.860
You're Joe and Phoebe, so to speak.

41:32.860 --> 41:36.940
You think that's, I think I'm kind of predictable.

41:36.940 --> 41:38.580
Well, yeah, but in the show,

41:38.580 --> 41:39.620
Jeffrey, like, we're talking more,

41:39.620 --> 41:40.980
making up character.

41:40.980 --> 41:41.900
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.580
I think we could, but like,

41:43.580 --> 41:46.100
I think the sea stories you would get up to

41:46.100 --> 41:47.500
would be very easy to write.

41:47.500 --> 41:50.740
It'd be like, Jeffrey goes to a kink party,

41:50.740 --> 41:52.500
or Jeffrey jerk off so long.

41:52.500 --> 41:53.340
It's a little chilly.

41:53.340 --> 41:54.500
Yeah, to go the opposite.

41:54.500 --> 41:57.580
Wait, you are Joe and I am Phoebe.

41:57.580 --> 41:58.900
I've never seen friends.

41:58.900 --> 41:59.740
Why?

42:01.340 --> 42:02.620
But what about the show?

42:04.540 --> 42:06.780
Stupid, wait, for real?

42:06.780 --> 42:07.620
I've never seen him.

42:07.620 --> 42:08.820
An episode.

42:08.820 --> 42:11.380
You should watch an episode of friends.

42:11.380 --> 42:13.300
I'm not like, oh my God, it's gonna change your life,

42:13.300 --> 42:15.380
but it's crazy, you haven't seen it.

42:15.380 --> 42:16.220
I know.

42:16.220 --> 42:18.980
Just at this point, it's like, I don't want to.

42:18.980 --> 42:20.220
Part of me thinks,

42:20.220 --> 42:21.940
Part of me wants Jeffrey to love it.

42:21.940 --> 42:23.620
Like, I think when people love friends,

42:23.620 --> 42:26.140
I find it like a little saccharin.

42:26.140 --> 42:27.980
But if Jeffrey came in, like,

42:27.980 --> 42:29.340
having really fallen for it,

42:29.340 --> 42:31.140
and I was saying, like, how you do it?

42:31.140 --> 42:31.980
No, that was me.

42:31.980 --> 42:33.500
I watched the Godfather for the first time,

42:33.500 --> 42:35.420
like a month ago, and my personality for four days

42:35.420 --> 42:36.980
was the Godfather is so good.

42:36.980 --> 42:40.860
My friends was a show you introduced me to an ad COVID,

42:40.860 --> 42:43.460
and it's, I don't even remember the name of it.

42:43.460 --> 42:44.460
The unicorn?

42:44.460 --> 42:45.700
The greatest show about time.

42:45.700 --> 42:48.580
And God, the funniest comedy ever to live.

42:48.580 --> 42:51.700
This show wishes it could be the unicorn.

42:51.700 --> 42:53.100
I was bringing, I was bringing the,

42:53.100 --> 42:54.900
yeah, show that gumptia home.

42:54.900 --> 42:58.580
Jury, I was bringing the unicorn up in meetings,

42:58.580 --> 43:00.580
being like, it's the greatest comedy of all time.

43:00.580 --> 43:03.780
I would have loved to be on the fucking unicorn.

43:03.780 --> 43:04.860
Great cast.

43:04.860 --> 43:06.180
Okay, let's get into it.

43:06.180 --> 43:07.180
Let's just bring one.

43:07.180 --> 43:09.380
You're not, who are we?

43:09.380 --> 43:10.260
You've only said archetype.

43:10.260 --> 43:11.380
I, who are the characters?

43:11.380 --> 43:12.060
I said it was you.

43:12.060 --> 43:13.940
I said it's, it's a, Jeffrey is like,

43:13.940 --> 43:15.300
our, our Joey Tribiani.

43:15.300 --> 43:17.780
You are, our tells it like it is.

43:17.780 --> 43:18.620
No, not.

43:18.620 --> 43:19.460
Stay Jewish.

43:19.460 --> 43:20.300
Figuring.

43:20.300 --> 43:21.140
No.

43:21.140 --> 43:23.540
She's coming up with callbacks and catchphrase.

43:23.540 --> 43:24.740
Yes, the show.

43:24.740 --> 43:25.900
I got, had gumpugas.

43:25.900 --> 43:26.740
Yes.

43:26.740 --> 43:27.740
Wow.

43:27.740 --> 43:29.220
We, both of us don't get Jury,

43:29.220 --> 43:32.580
because so far, nothing about Gory is coming up.

43:32.580 --> 43:33.980
We're building from the bottom up.

43:33.980 --> 43:35.700
No, you keep saying that you're not doing anything.

43:35.700 --> 43:37.980
And what I'm not, I don't wanna talk about my personal life,

43:37.980 --> 43:38.820
really on this show.

43:38.820 --> 43:40.940
I'm not liking as I'm number six in the cold.

43:40.940 --> 43:42.980
I'm delaying getting to the will they won't they?

43:42.980 --> 43:45.300
I don't wanna talk about that part of my life.

43:45.300 --> 43:47.460
Okay, then you didn't have to bring up that archetype.

43:47.460 --> 43:48.820
Yeah, you brought up the archetype.

43:48.820 --> 43:49.660
Just, we don't like that.

43:49.660 --> 43:51.620
You gotta, every sitcom has that anchor.

43:51.620 --> 43:53.780
I'm not gonna deny that that has to be part of it.

43:53.780 --> 43:55.620
The unicorn didn't.

43:55.620 --> 43:56.460
Yeah.

43:56.460 --> 43:57.860
The unicorn, it could also be a point.

43:57.860 --> 44:00.300
Is that he's like singing a lot?

44:00.300 --> 44:02.660
Yeah, which is so funny because he's set to make farhead,

44:02.660 --> 44:03.940
but he is really hot.

44:03.940 --> 44:06.340
But there wasn't like a consistent,

44:06.340 --> 44:07.740
will they won't they?

44:07.740 --> 44:10.140
Well, in how long that chill us?

44:10.140 --> 44:11.380
Two seasons.

44:11.380 --> 44:13.460
Let's get rid of the will they won't show us that last a while.

44:13.460 --> 44:15.380
I have like a really good anchor, but will they won't they?

44:15.380 --> 44:16.060
Whatever.

44:16.060 --> 44:17.060
Cast, the other.

44:17.060 --> 44:18.060
The other.

44:18.060 --> 44:19.060
We haven't.

44:19.060 --> 44:20.060
We haven't.

44:20.060 --> 44:21.060
Four minutes.

44:21.060 --> 44:22.060
The whole podcast left?

44:22.060 --> 44:23.060
Yeah.

44:23.060 --> 44:24.060
Wait, what are their segments now?

44:24.060 --> 44:25.660
The show is going very well until this.

44:25.660 --> 44:27.660
Yeah, is it wrong to blame him?

44:27.660 --> 44:28.660
No.

44:28.660 --> 44:32.180
Cast, we said very simply cast the show.

44:32.180 --> 44:35.060
Okay, you didn't say it very simply.

44:35.060 --> 44:36.060
He did.

44:36.060 --> 44:37.060
He did.

44:37.900 --> 44:40.300
Okay, like with real stars.

44:40.300 --> 44:42.620
Uh, who the care of me?

44:42.620 --> 44:44.180
You like the host should pick up on them.

44:44.180 --> 44:45.660
We need to just switch segments.

44:45.660 --> 44:46.660
He's not lighting.

44:46.660 --> 44:47.660
He's not a good job.

44:47.660 --> 44:48.660
Oh, this guy.

44:48.660 --> 44:51.740
I guess like a Jennifer Aniston type.

44:51.740 --> 44:56.700
And then I would just like a map of the long casting friends.

44:56.700 --> 44:58.260
You've got two wild cards.

44:58.260 --> 44:59.260
Okay.

44:59.260 --> 45:00.260
Me and Emma.

45:00.260 --> 45:01.260
Yeah, you guys.

45:01.260 --> 45:02.260
And you have a couple.

45:02.260 --> 45:03.260
Who's that?

45:03.260 --> 45:04.260
A couple.

45:04.260 --> 45:05.260
And I would, okay.

45:05.500 --> 45:09.900
We're like, uh, I would say you guys are three and four on their call sheet.

45:09.900 --> 45:11.340
And then the couple would be like an,

45:11.340 --> 45:15.060
which is like an Angie, those are like friends Eli and

45:15.060 --> 45:16.700
Eli Macvetsky and Andy.

45:16.700 --> 45:19.060
And I want to say her last name is Corbin.

45:19.060 --> 45:20.260
I don't know either, people.

45:20.260 --> 45:23.020
And then the will they won't.

45:23.020 --> 45:26.020
The will they won't, they, I think you should rewrite.

45:26.020 --> 45:27.020
And we should not talk about it.

45:27.020 --> 45:28.460
And we should add a different character.

45:28.460 --> 45:29.300
Yeah, okay.

45:29.300 --> 45:32.060
Well, I think it's like, um,

45:32.060 --> 45:34.940
or like, I maybe then it's just like a family member who's

45:34.940 --> 45:35.900
like invasive.

45:35.900 --> 45:38.300
It's, yeah, it's like your mom.

45:38.300 --> 45:40.140
Yeah, it's my fucking mom.

45:40.140 --> 45:42.540
Oh, I was going to say, uh,

45:42.540 --> 45:43.420
Margo.

45:43.420 --> 45:44.540
Oh, that's fun too.

45:44.540 --> 45:45.660
Like she's visiting.

45:45.660 --> 45:46.700
And it's like, I got to.

45:46.700 --> 45:48.540
Yeah, visit the whole, did she move in?

45:48.540 --> 45:49.500
Oh, yeah, she's moved in.

45:49.500 --> 45:50.540
Oh, where's the whole thing?

45:50.540 --> 45:52.620
That's actually the conceit of Joey,

45:52.620 --> 45:54.220
the spin-off of friends, I think.

45:54.220 --> 45:56.780
Like he moves in with his cousin.

45:56.780 --> 45:57.980
Andrea Anders.

46:01.580 --> 46:03.900
This could have been a fun segment.

46:03.980 --> 46:05.420
He's locked it up.

46:05.420 --> 46:07.980
And my, maybe the pilot, and if we're going to back up,

46:07.980 --> 46:09.740
there's like the pilot is that you were,

46:09.740 --> 46:11.900
yes, we were breaking up as a three team.

46:11.900 --> 46:12.540
I know.

46:12.540 --> 46:14.060
We, that's not what it's doing.

46:14.060 --> 46:15.020
George is credit.

46:15.020 --> 46:15.660
That has not worked.

46:15.660 --> 46:17.020
That was tough, I guess.

46:17.020 --> 46:18.780
That, it just has not worked out.

46:18.780 --> 46:21.260
Uh, the pilot is Margo,

46:22.300 --> 46:24.860
who is at this point, a famous musician

46:24.860 --> 46:25.900
under the name, Go and George.

46:25.900 --> 46:26.780
Oh, it's like cheer.

46:26.780 --> 46:29.580
So you meet Sam and you also have Diane.

46:29.580 --> 46:33.340
And Diane is Margo's coming in and then Diane becomes a part

46:33.420 --> 46:34.300
of the bar.

46:34.300 --> 46:36.060
So Margo becomes a part of this career.

46:36.060 --> 46:36.860
You're right, you're right.

46:36.860 --> 46:38.700
It's telling us exactly.

46:38.700 --> 46:40.220
But it's a thing where, because Margo,

46:40.220 --> 46:42.460
your sister, uh, operating under the name,

46:42.460 --> 46:45.340
girl George, as a musician, that's a little project.

46:45.340 --> 46:47.900
Let's say that she's starting to get some traction this year.

46:47.900 --> 46:48.300
Right?

46:48.300 --> 46:49.900
You're writing the pilot this year.

46:49.900 --> 46:51.500
You're getting traction in Hollywood as a writer.

46:51.500 --> 46:51.740
Right.

46:51.740 --> 46:53.900
You sell the show as a writer actor with her.

46:53.900 --> 46:54.540
Art Hatch.

46:54.540 --> 46:56.220
With her attached, because she's kind of like this,

46:56.220 --> 46:59.260
like King Prince's level, uh, artist, right?

46:59.260 --> 47:01.260
That people do know, but she's also on the rise.

47:01.260 --> 47:04.140
So I think Billie Eilish, when she was what, 16, 15.

47:04.140 --> 47:06.380
And so like there's heat, and you know what's going to go up.

47:06.380 --> 47:07.340
It's almost guaranteed.

47:07.340 --> 47:09.420
Uh, she's attached.

47:09.420 --> 47:12.380
And as you rise as a sign-filled level star,

47:12.380 --> 47:14.220
she rises as a Billie Eilish type.

47:14.220 --> 47:16.780
And like, the show, like, learning from each other.

47:16.780 --> 47:19.340
And the show is her getting famous.

47:19.340 --> 47:20.620
And you guys have to deal with that.

47:20.620 --> 47:22.060
Right, the more famous we got.

47:22.060 --> 47:24.860
And then there was that famous episode, season two.

47:24.860 --> 47:27.260
I think it was episode seven where she gets canceled.

47:27.260 --> 47:29.580
Oh, yeah, she gets canceled and it was a big thing.

47:29.580 --> 47:30.860
Yeah, Margo.

47:30.860 --> 47:31.900
Yeah, and not King.

47:31.900 --> 47:32.060
What did you do?

47:32.060 --> 47:32.860
What did you do?

47:32.860 --> 47:35.100
Margo wearing a Native American head dress?

47:36.540 --> 47:37.340
Yeah.

47:37.340 --> 47:39.900
And then saying a slur of a different race.

47:41.100 --> 47:42.700
Um, so that's the A story.

47:42.700 --> 47:43.740
That's the A story.

47:43.740 --> 47:44.780
It gets canceled.

47:44.780 --> 47:49.980
Yeah, the B story is, uh, you guys think I need to get out there more,

47:50.540 --> 47:52.140
like dating like unicorns.

47:52.140 --> 47:54.940
So you, you guys, and then you guys start computing.

47:54.940 --> 47:58.220
We're in the Kayla lot, Kins and Rob Kourj from the Units.

47:58.460 --> 47:59.820
And also can we cast the red.

47:59.820 --> 48:01.660
So it's you playing you, your sister, Margo,

48:01.660 --> 48:03.500
girl George, playing her.

48:03.500 --> 48:05.340
Yeah, and then us playing each other more.

48:05.340 --> 48:06.860
We really, but I have a question.

48:06.860 --> 48:07.180
Yeah.

48:07.180 --> 48:08.460
Let's cast who plays you.

48:08.460 --> 48:09.580
Let's cast who plays me.

48:09.580 --> 48:09.980
Who plays me?

48:09.980 --> 48:10.780
I'd like to play me.

48:10.780 --> 48:11.260
I'm sorry.

48:11.260 --> 48:12.060
Okay, I don't want to play me.

48:12.060 --> 48:12.780
Then who plays you?

48:13.420 --> 48:14.540
Who do I look like?

48:14.540 --> 48:19.660
Um, do you want us to say people who are Jewish?

48:19.660 --> 48:21.340
Or are you going to point that out?

48:21.340 --> 48:23.740
No, you can, you can do what you want to do.

48:23.740 --> 48:25.340
And I'll decide what I want to say back.

48:26.540 --> 48:27.580
Jenny Slate.

48:28.540 --> 48:29.820
I mean, sure, she's on it.

48:29.820 --> 48:30.780
She's a fun cast.

48:30.780 --> 48:31.500
I think for that.

48:31.500 --> 48:32.460
She's curly hair.

48:32.460 --> 48:33.100
She's curly hair.

48:33.100 --> 48:34.940
Honestly, I would take Jenny Slate.

48:34.940 --> 48:38.540
And then, for me, I can just, they can, she can reunite with Ben Schwartz,

48:38.540 --> 48:39.660
and then Ben can do brown face.

48:40.460 --> 48:41.100
He's allowed.

48:41.820 --> 48:42.220
Yeah.

48:42.220 --> 48:45.100
Yeah, and it really makes that episode about getting canceled.

48:45.100 --> 48:46.060
Super interesting.

48:46.060 --> 48:47.100
Yeah.

48:47.100 --> 48:50.060
Oh, it's self-aware, but missing it by that much.

48:50.060 --> 48:51.660
She never was always any episode.

48:51.660 --> 48:53.340
Rob, I'm not glad he did black face.

48:53.340 --> 48:54.460
To make fun of Trump, I thunder.

48:55.420 --> 48:57.660
I don't, but that's really.

48:57.660 --> 48:59.180
You guys are always any heads.

48:59.180 --> 49:01.340
I am, but I didn't, I haven't seen that episode.

49:01.340 --> 49:02.540
Who plays E-Lan Andy?

49:02.540 --> 49:04.460
Because they cannot play, they're not going to play.

49:04.460 --> 49:05.500
They're not going to play, they're not going to play.

49:05.500 --> 49:11.420
No, I think E-Li's play by, oh my gosh,

49:11.420 --> 49:13.180
who's like a Timbalt's type.

49:14.140 --> 49:15.580
That's bad casting.

49:15.580 --> 49:17.340
You're not, okay.

49:17.340 --> 49:20.540
They're all R-A, and then all of a sudden it's, yeah, with the stuff.

49:20.540 --> 49:22.460
Sorry, no, I actually cast Jenny Slate,

49:23.340 --> 49:24.620
like they can all play younger.

49:24.620 --> 49:28.220
E-Li's going to be Timothy Schallemay doing his first steady TV gig,

49:28.220 --> 49:29.180
and he's kind of selling it.

49:29.180 --> 49:33.660
Okay, and then Andy is going to be Kendall Jenner.

49:33.740 --> 49:36.060
You're giving Timothy Schallemay number five on the call.

49:38.060 --> 49:41.020
Sorry, but like, I'm making 30 in episode.

49:41.020 --> 49:43.500
I'm making $30,000 in episode.

49:43.500 --> 49:44.700
That's pretty low.

49:44.700 --> 49:46.540
Oh, that's really low.

49:46.540 --> 49:47.580
Well, I haven't done much.

49:47.580 --> 49:48.540
It's so low.

49:49.580 --> 49:50.700
It's way more episode.

49:50.700 --> 49:53.420
I'm making half a million dollars a fucking year Emma.

49:53.420 --> 49:55.260
That's still, it's so low.

49:55.260 --> 49:56.060
It's so low.

49:56.060 --> 49:57.740
You've got to drop your reps.

49:59.740 --> 50:01.500
Yeah, you have to fucking wrap this up.

50:01.500 --> 50:02.940
That's what's the, what's the C story?

50:04.540 --> 50:06.380
This is me and Kendall.

50:06.380 --> 50:09.740
Yeah, sorry, it's him and the Schallemay and Kendall Jenner.

50:09.740 --> 50:11.180
They're trying to find a third.

50:11.180 --> 50:14.380
And the third is Walton Goggins.

50:14.380 --> 50:15.020
Yeah.

50:15.020 --> 50:19.260
All right, that feels like more like a new story.

50:19.260 --> 50:21.420
I'm just, feels like it's not a character.

50:21.420 --> 50:24.700
I think they're like, they're going through like some sort of couple issues.

50:24.700 --> 50:27.100
I know, but when I'm at a King Party, I'm in my bag.

50:27.100 --> 50:28.700
Like, I'm in my comfort zone, so it's not funny.

50:28.700 --> 50:30.060
Them do try to find a third.

50:30.060 --> 50:31.020
They're out of their comfort zone.

50:31.020 --> 50:32.860
But you're helping me out of my comfort zone

50:32.860 --> 50:34.860
by bringing me to a King Party anyway.

50:34.860 --> 50:36.300
So that's sort of, that's like,

50:36.300 --> 50:38.700
and how do I bring you out of your comfort zone?

50:38.700 --> 50:41.020
You would offer, what would you real life offer me?

50:41.020 --> 50:43.580
If you were like, oh, Georgie Sam, I fuck you.

50:43.580 --> 50:44.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:44.780 --> 50:47.180
You guys, I, you're not good.

50:47.180 --> 50:48.860
This is maybe not going to make the show.

50:48.860 --> 50:50.220
This is a multi-cam.

50:50.220 --> 50:52.060
There are no wrong ideas.

50:52.060 --> 50:55.100
Wait, are you saying, what would I do to get you out of your comfort zone?

50:55.100 --> 50:55.900
I don't know.

50:55.900 --> 50:58.220
Yeah, if you're like, Georg, you need to put yourself out there

50:58.220 --> 50:58.540
more.

50:58.540 --> 50:59.580
What would you make me do?

50:59.580 --> 51:01.180
Jeffrey would take me to a King Party,

51:01.180 --> 51:03.100
which is like, that would certainly be putting myself

51:03.100 --> 51:04.620
out there what would real life you do?

51:04.620 --> 51:06.460
You help him by these pants.

51:06.460 --> 51:08.060
Yeah, we do a little shopping montage.

51:08.060 --> 51:08.780
We do a shop.

51:08.780 --> 51:09.660
You, you give me a girl.

51:09.660 --> 51:12.620
Because I'm a girl, I'm a girl, and I love to shop.

51:12.620 --> 51:15.500
Girls shop.

51:15.500 --> 51:17.820
And then, you've been anti-Semitic,

51:17.820 --> 51:19.660
and you've been anti-women.

51:19.660 --> 51:20.300
I'm both.

51:20.300 --> 51:21.820
That's what I believe women.

51:21.820 --> 51:24.300
I've been anti-mixed race.

51:24.300 --> 51:25.340
Actually, you have.

51:25.340 --> 51:27.660
I've been clean for the first time ever, honestly.

51:28.620 --> 51:31.100
I think I've been clean.

51:31.100 --> 51:31.900
Plugs.

51:31.900 --> 51:32.860
We got to wrap this shit up.

51:32.860 --> 51:35.260
You have a hard-out, and what's I going to say?

51:35.260 --> 51:36.060
What's that?

51:36.060 --> 51:37.020
What time is it?

51:37.020 --> 51:38.380
12, 24.

51:38.380 --> 51:39.740
Oh, yeah.

51:39.740 --> 51:40.940
Plugs, what do you guys have going on?

51:40.940 --> 51:42.860
When you want to point the people to the floor is yours.

51:42.860 --> 51:44.540
Let's start with them, huh?

51:44.540 --> 51:46.940
OK.

51:46.940 --> 51:48.940
You people just came out of Netflix.

51:48.940 --> 51:51.900
I watched it last night.

51:51.900 --> 51:52.540
It's fine.

51:52.540 --> 51:53.260
It's fine.

51:53.260 --> 51:54.860
I watched an hour of it.

51:54.860 --> 51:55.900
Did you work on that show?

51:55.900 --> 51:56.540
No.

51:56.620 --> 51:57.580
You're just plugging something.

51:57.580 --> 51:58.060
Yeah.

51:58.060 --> 51:59.580
You don't want to plug your social media?

51:59.580 --> 52:00.060
No.

52:00.060 --> 52:00.620
You're private.

52:00.620 --> 52:01.100
No.

52:01.100 --> 52:01.660
I'm not private.

52:01.660 --> 52:02.140
I'm public.

52:02.140 --> 52:03.900
They can find me.

52:03.900 --> 52:05.900
But what else?

52:05.900 --> 52:06.620
What else?

52:06.620 --> 52:07.500
Shook on wedding.

52:07.500 --> 52:08.300
Came out.

52:08.300 --> 52:09.260
I haven't watched it yet.

52:09.260 --> 52:10.860
I didn't mean it in our episode.

52:10.860 --> 52:12.860
Yeah, that is a lot.

52:12.860 --> 52:16.620
It's just like, because I like to have the ground clearance.

52:16.620 --> 52:19.020
So a little bit of ankle.

52:19.020 --> 52:21.900
But then when you sit, it's just, you don't ever want to see the calf.

52:21.980 --> 52:22.940
Mm-hmm.

52:22.940 --> 52:23.940
Mm-hmm.

52:23.940 --> 52:24.940
OK.

52:24.940 --> 52:26.780
Can I plug marinating chickpeas?

52:28.780 --> 52:29.180
You're not.

52:31.420 --> 52:31.980
Dorkies?

52:31.980 --> 52:32.620
I understand.

52:32.620 --> 52:33.580
Did I understand?

52:33.580 --> 52:34.860
Did I understand the segment?

52:35.580 --> 52:37.260
I'm just saying that the thing people should do.

52:37.260 --> 52:38.460
Is marinating chickpeas?

52:38.460 --> 52:40.300
Take two cans of chickpeas.

52:40.780 --> 52:42.620
A half a cup of olive oil.

52:42.620 --> 52:43.900
Some white wine vinegar.

52:43.900 --> 52:45.900
And chop up some garlic, salt pepper.

52:45.900 --> 52:47.100
Let it sit there.

52:47.100 --> 52:49.100
I don't know if I've ever been mad at you.

52:49.100 --> 52:49.900
You're like a friend.

52:49.900 --> 52:51.900
I don't think I've ever had a reason to be mad at you.

52:51.900 --> 52:54.860
I'm pissed right now for this plug.

52:54.860 --> 52:59.340
I just say, I care more about people knowing that that is a possibility.

52:59.340 --> 53:00.380
Damn.

53:00.380 --> 53:02.380
Then saying anything about me.

53:02.380 --> 53:03.580
I'm nothing to plug.

53:03.580 --> 53:09.980
Just a life and be present and feel your feelings and go, you know, smell, smell, fresh air.

53:10.620 --> 53:11.820
Oh, goblop the salad.

53:13.020 --> 53:13.580
What was that?

53:15.820 --> 53:17.020
Oh, goblop the salad.

53:17.980 --> 53:23.180
It's somebody from some Indian media in Hindu being like, please don't go.

53:25.180 --> 53:29.500
Okay, George, I'll promote my food Instagram.

53:29.500 --> 53:32.700
It's food, the word, George Saba.

53:32.700 --> 53:35.260
My name, G.O.R.G.S.S.A.

53:37.260 --> 53:37.900
It's so mad.

53:37.900 --> 53:41.660
If you're watching things on peacock, you should watch killing it.

53:41.660 --> 53:42.380
It's funny show.

53:42.380 --> 53:44.220
We have a second season coming out soon.

53:45.180 --> 53:47.820
And then grand crew, the second season,

53:47.820 --> 53:50.940
available on NBC or peacock premieres in April.

53:54.620 --> 53:55.260
How about you?

53:56.620 --> 53:58.220
At Jeffrey G.O.M. is on Instagram.

53:59.020 --> 54:00.380
At Jeff Boardy on Twitter.

54:01.180 --> 54:07.260
And also, you can take dinosaur kale and rip it off, massage it.

54:07.260 --> 54:08.220
That's for watching stuff.

54:08.220 --> 54:09.180
So the head compartment.

54:09.180 --> 54:12.380
You're like really wanting to win your career with them.

54:13.100 --> 54:15.180
Jeffrey, I have a real question before we wrap.

54:15.180 --> 54:17.100
What do you think of new review review?

54:17.100 --> 54:17.820
Do you think it's better?

54:17.820 --> 54:18.460
I think it's really good.

54:18.460 --> 54:19.340
I think it's better.

54:19.340 --> 54:19.980
You think it's better?

54:19.980 --> 54:21.500
I think it's better than I listen to it.

54:21.500 --> 54:22.620
But I think it's great.

54:22.620 --> 54:24.220
Yeah, also listen to the new review review.

54:24.220 --> 54:24.620
Yeah.

54:24.620 --> 54:26.620
I'd say like you should throw to that more.

54:26.620 --> 54:27.980
Just notice that you were saying.

54:27.980 --> 54:28.780
No, so rude.

54:28.780 --> 54:30.620
Let me put him on that spot.

54:31.580 --> 54:34.140
He put me on this spot this whole time.

54:34.140 --> 54:35.900
You guys have only been rude to me.

54:35.900 --> 54:39.180
I have, we had, really no, for now the last week,

54:39.180 --> 54:40.140
two plugged the show.

54:40.940 --> 54:41.500
Yeah.

54:41.500 --> 54:42.540
How did I want you to?

54:42.540 --> 54:43.820
They're not here right now.

54:43.820 --> 54:44.060
Yeah.

54:44.060 --> 54:45.180
I'm going to listen to the newer review review.

54:45.180 --> 54:47.500
I want you to know their chemistry is great.

54:47.500 --> 54:49.580
I think it's not, maybe not better.

54:49.580 --> 54:51.740
But I think it's different in a new exciting way.

54:51.740 --> 54:54.060
I like the fact that I'm on this show.

54:54.060 --> 54:56.300
Like, what are you saying by my freaking back?

54:56.300 --> 54:58.140
What did you say?

54:58.140 --> 55:01.580
Well, I think you also watch Gory on, what is it?

55:01.580 --> 55:02.860
It's on Netflix.

55:02.860 --> 55:04.060
Oh, Netflix.

55:04.060 --> 55:07.260
Well, Netflix is weirdly enough the production company.

55:07.260 --> 55:09.500
And then the studio is expedient.

55:10.300 --> 55:11.100
Right.

55:11.100 --> 55:14.300
And then the net work is to say, what's the platform?

55:14.300 --> 55:16.220
So would it not just be paramount plus?

55:16.220 --> 55:17.260
Oh, paramount plus.

55:17.260 --> 55:18.060
Yeah.

55:18.060 --> 55:19.740
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

55:19.740 --> 55:21.340
I just thought of a better James Bond.

55:21.340 --> 55:21.820
Okay.

55:21.820 --> 55:23.500
And I know he was in the last one.

55:23.500 --> 55:25.900
But wouldn't it be really fun for Romney Malik?

55:29.900 --> 55:31.260
I saw this morning.

55:31.260 --> 55:33.580
That was like, we got a stop day fiction test.

55:33.580 --> 55:36.860
We got a stop taking pictures of this man of Romney Malik.

55:37.500 --> 55:38.220
That's really fun.

55:38.220 --> 55:42.540
He's like, there's a treat that's like,

55:42.540 --> 55:44.940
robbing Malik's energy is so unsettling.

55:44.940 --> 55:45.900
You scared me now.

55:47.740 --> 55:49.020
I could go for another hour.

55:49.020 --> 55:50.940
I'll move my doctor point on you.

55:50.940 --> 55:53.980
Jeffrey and the break asked if I microdisc because I'm being so giggly.

55:55.180 --> 55:57.420
Is that what you guys talked about by my back?

55:57.420 --> 55:58.860
No, we were going to make fun of your car.

56:00.140 --> 56:02.940
And then we brought him in a coffee, which is really nice of you.

56:02.940 --> 56:03.500
Absolutely.

56:03.580 --> 56:07.340
So we both, because Emma was like, what should we like jointly make fun of George

56:07.340 --> 56:08.620
for as a runner?

56:08.620 --> 56:10.860
That he doesn't know we talked about saying.

56:12.060 --> 56:13.660
And then he was brought in.

56:13.660 --> 56:15.180
He was a coffee, which is really nice.

56:16.780 --> 56:18.780
Anyway, I don't know where I'm going to cut here.

56:18.780 --> 56:19.900
So I'll just say that's does.

56:19.900 --> 56:22.140
Just in case we keep this all in.

56:22.140 --> 56:25.180
But that's, I'm probably going to cut away before this.

56:25.180 --> 56:26.700
No, no, no, I think I was before going.

56:26.700 --> 56:27.500
I think we'll probably.

56:27.500 --> 56:50.620
It's the 27-minute episode.

56:50.620 --> 56:51.980
That was a hit-gum original.

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
This is so strange.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I think you put on camera one.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
It's so sweet.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Do you want to have men?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Oh my god, thank you.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
Daniel Rashid says that baby has no idea it's a part of comedy history.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Yeah.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
We won't be able to hear any of your guys' sounds, I think, but that's fine.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
That's okay.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Well, actually.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I'm just going to sign in real quick.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
This website.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Don't let Goldies see your password.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
She can read only passwords if you want.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah, but she's got a photographic memory.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
So she'll pull it up later when she's like 20.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
20.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Crosswalk.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Alright, let's record this shit.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
This stuff.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Can you say, what's back?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Can you say, in a high school, sir?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
So dirty.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Can you a little laptop?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
No one, right now, yeah, you can't see.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
There she is.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Daniel.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Back at it again with a white baby.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
We fucking made it.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Casey, how long have we been awake?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Uh, this is the,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Oh, what time is it?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
11 a.m.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
11 a.m.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
11 a.m.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
11 a.m.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
We've been alive for, I don't need 23 hours.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
And then what time did you, you've been awake the whole time?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
I have been awake the entire time.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
What time did both of you get up yesterday?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
God, you asked.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
I got up at 9 a.m.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Goldie, what time did you get up?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Goldie, what time did you get up?

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
This is what she does when she's trying to threaten you and be like,

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
you're not that guy.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
She's trying to threaten me.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
I fear if we're just listening to this,

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
uh, there's a baby here.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Yeah.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Can you say, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
She slid over towards Casey,

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah, she did that.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
She, she's burying the lead because I've seen her real estate portfolio

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
and it makes Taylor Swift look like a joke.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
If you're just listening to this, you need what you need to watch it.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
Because there is Jeff has a actual human baby on the couch next to him.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Yeah.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
And if you're just missing this, this is the Hedgen podcast.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
This is in the final hour and a half of Jeff's surprise

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
24 hour live stream where he's been.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Hour.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Hour.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Sorry.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Final hour, final hour.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Final hour.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Um, and the final hour.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
And he's been watching or neglecting a baby doll

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
and on you did just bring in an actual baby because he's

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Oh, wow.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Um, earlier yesterday, Jeff did say,

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
I don't like babies.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
And now she's grabbing his hand.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
He's been, he's been saying it all night long.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Actually, all night long.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Midway.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
All right.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
All right.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
I hate kids.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Well, like she's got her tiny nose.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
She just wants to hold Jeff's hand.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
She's a pretty little grabber all over.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Anky Jeff's.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Now.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
All right.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
We got to get this baby out of here.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
This was not my idea.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
A baby was brought into the studio and plop.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I was also.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Anky.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Anky.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Anky.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Zunkel.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Zunkel.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Godfather.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
You're kind of drunk or an out to, right?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
How do you figure?

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
At least like on drunk on no sleep.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
At least.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
That's just sleep.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
I woke up.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
What time do you go to sleep?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
One.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
A.M.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Yeah.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
What time do you wake up?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Around nine.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Ask me when we went to sleep.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
When did you go to sleep?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Last.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Yeah.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
That would be one A.M.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Two days ago.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
One A.M.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Two days ago.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Yeah.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I was like up at three.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
I was about to five.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
I'm kind of on a.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
So I don't mean interrupt.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Do you guys know if she has had a meal at home?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Do you guys know if she's you feel?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
New York.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
When you guys let's go to sleep.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I'm going to put it like 230.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
About same.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
And I woke up at five.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
And I woke up at six.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Fifty to come back to the studio.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Mm-hmm.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
This kid's really winning me over.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Yeah.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I swear to God.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
I'll give her money.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Oh, yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
And introducing.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Goldie.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Ha.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
And then I'll add the packs of the fix.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
You don't see a lot of bonnets anymore.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Yeah.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
It's nice.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
We should bring back the bonnet.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I also have been thinking about bringing back the passie.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Ooh.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Okay.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
I don't.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Yeah.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Just like I don't have some fire.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Sorry.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Would you say America?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
I just said adult pacifiers.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Or like a binky.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Whatever the difference is.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Sure.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
A little dummy.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
What is it called?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Like.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Yeah.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Those are, I mean, you.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Yeah.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
All the words you said are fine.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Our good.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
And our correct.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Goldie to me has become more than a style icon.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
She's become a fashion inspiration.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Yeah.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
She's like imprinting on Casey right now.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Yeah.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Yeah.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
It's intimidating.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
She's like, yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Look away.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
But it's also in a way where it's like, you know that you're safe with it.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Like I know that no matter what happens, she's got my back.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Does that make sense?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
I think she can't sit up on her own.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Well, that's really why we have babies to fix ourselves.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
I don't want to scare her by laughing too hard.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
But I would have laughed harder than that if it wasn't a baby.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
What?

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Are you getting bored?

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Should we throw to an athletic greens ad?

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Cause it's actually an all-in-one nutritional insurance.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Oh, that's not good.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
That's not good.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
That's not good.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
You were doing so much better for Greene for sure.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
The baby is medicine to me.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Sort of like animal medicine.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Yeah.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
I'm working with the medicine.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Sorry, excuse me and saying.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I'm working with the medicine of the human form.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
What were you going to say?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Oh, I was just kind of agreeing with him verbally.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
I was trying to give like audio support.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Mm-hmm.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Oral joy.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
No.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Gives something to say?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
What do you want to say?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Do you want anything to plug?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
We could start plugs.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
She wants to plug nap time.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
And huge.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Getting on dad's nerves.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Sounds to plug her past.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
She's eight.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Oh.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
She's eight years old.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Yeah.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
I'll buy eight months.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
But even that.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
She looks like a wonder.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
How old is she?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Oh, but okay.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
That's about when the old twins started to work.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
I think.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Yeah.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
But Ali was ready more so than AJ.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Yeah.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
So those are the very different twins.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
The most.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
The most interesting.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Are you interested?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
So this is called a podcast, right?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
It's basically, it's like,

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
When you say recorded radio,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
it's such a weird way to put it.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
I don't understand.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Yeah.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Especially a baby.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Push it well.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
How'd you explain it to her?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
It's sort of like an hour of pop culture discussion.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Mean spirited games and quizzes.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
And got you journalism.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
So where does she live?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
What?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Like neighborhood.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Don't talk to speak.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
I'm sorry.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
I'm also not trying to put her in a box.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
All right.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
She can do anything she wants.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
She looks over at this point.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
She was interested.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
And now she's laying on your knife.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
All right.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
She's like, yeah.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
It's not Disneyland.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I'll tell you that for sure.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
What's up?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
What's up?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
What's up?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Do you need?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Do you want to check out the Jordan's?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Just call her face.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
I don't even know.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Someone in the chat.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Yeah.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Someone in the chat.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
She's joining Team Coco.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
That's really buddy for two million a year.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
On you.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
All right.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Bye.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Bye.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Go.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Bye.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Who's dog was that?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
I mean, baby.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
I don't.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
I don't.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
I'm not around babies often.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Who's baby was that?

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
I think on your friends.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
On your friend credible.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
That's why we didn't want you to surprise.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
It's yours.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
To please.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Set on baby.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
I'm going to Paris this year.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Yeah.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
You said next month.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Yes.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Why?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
That's fine.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Japan's.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I could be.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Paris again.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
You think you.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
You think you could be.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
You.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Yeah.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Yeah.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Paul.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Just.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
I name.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
For just a year.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Year.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Ooh.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
In.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Epock.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
I don't know.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
An entire era.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Remember when she'll be just like,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
really bust it out this banish?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Yeah.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I remember that.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Emma.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
How the heck are you?

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I'm doing all right.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
I'm tired.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
But I know you're not the audience for that kind of talk.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
That kind of talk.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
I do like how everyone who has kind of

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
Strolled in to either their New York office or their L.A. office.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Yeah.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Checks in with us and goes like, well, I didn't get a lot of sleep myself.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Okay.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
See because I've only got two hours or three hours.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
I got eight.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
And I'm just like, whoa.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Yeah.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
How about not?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Honestly.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
I'm so sleepy.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
And so to get really appreciate you being like a little bit more considerate.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Yeah.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
I understand.

10:02.000 --> 10:09.000
I have to go record a friend's podcast after that, which was an interesting thing that I agreed to.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Yeah.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Today.

10:11.000 --> 10:19.000
I will also say that for us, we were awake earlier in the start of the day yesterday.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
It came into the office.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Stayed up pretty late.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Only got minimum.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Three, four hours of sleep came back to the office.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Can you imagine Jeff?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Four hours.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
I can't imagine four hours of food.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
That's crazy.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Have these been going on?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Imagine not being on campus.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Yeah.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
That's crazy.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
That these party lights have been going on since the music.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Yeah.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Yeah.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Yeah.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
I've got a lot of changing it.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
But then we're like, it's a vibe.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
It is a vibe.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
I have a question for you both since you have been through this kind of journey together.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
What have you learned about each other that describes you?

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
I'm really, I'm putting on my best journey for a lack of a better girl.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Like have you learned anything about each other that's like been surprising or good question.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
We've been talking about this.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
I mean, a lot of people who listen to this episode probably didn't watch the stream.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
But like, it's a thing of like, yeah, we've been up for 24 hours almost, which, you know,

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
we've all done that.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
But we've pulled all nighters.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
It's tough.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
But it's fine.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
You go to sleep.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
It's whatever.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
It's the being watched.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Yeah.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
They're having to perform for that many hours.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
We're working that back to back to back top of the hour.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Someone leaves.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Somebody else comes in.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Holy shit.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
We have to do another hour.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
And I don't even know what this is going to be.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Yeah.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
And I hit a breaking point.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
I didn't think I was going to hit a breaking point.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
So I guess I learned that my breaking point happens around what 20 hours, 21 hours.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
I just got to know.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.960
That was something that Jeff, we've talked about it a lot over the course of the

11:45.960 --> 11:46.960
night.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.960
But he has constantly felt like I got to be on.

11:48.960 --> 11:49.960
There's people coming in there.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.960
They are coming on to talk to him.

11:51.960 --> 11:57.960
No one's like really coming on to expecting to talk to me.

11:57.960 --> 11:58.960
But.

11:58.960 --> 11:59.960
Rice.

11:59.960 --> 12:00.960
Sure.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.960
The rhythm of the rice is how you, it's about how you move your hips.

12:02.960 --> 12:03.960
Yeah.

12:03.960 --> 12:04.960
I know.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.960
I'm taking a bite into rice.

12:06.960 --> 12:07.960
I do.

12:07.960 --> 12:08.960
I do.

12:08.960 --> 12:12.960
But the point I wanted to make was I didn't have any sort of pressure of like,

12:12.960 --> 12:13.960
a little bit more pressure.

12:13.960 --> 12:17.960
I have much pressure for people who are watching, like I kind of zone out on the fact

12:17.960 --> 12:21.960
that hundreds of people were watching us all night long.

12:21.960 --> 12:25.960
But even just like pared down to just like an experience level, this had to

12:25.960 --> 12:28.960
have been a bonding experience for your friendship.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.960
No, it felt like military hazing.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.960
I feel like you and I are like going to.

12:32.960 --> 12:33.960
I was going to say, cubal.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.960
That's the wrong word.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.960
I did have a lot to leave.

12:37.960 --> 12:38.960
Yeah.

12:38.960 --> 12:39.960
Yeah.

12:39.960 --> 12:40.960
And you were probably going to leave us, like, two.

12:40.960 --> 12:41.960
Yeah.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.440
Yeah, at least you said friend.

12:43.440 --> 12:44.160
But I saw it.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.520
I saw it in Jess eyes.

12:46.520 --> 12:46.880
Yeah.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.440
I couldn't leave him here with people.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.560
He didn't know talking to people.

12:50.560 --> 12:51.560
He didn't know.

12:51.560 --> 12:52.560
She cried.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.560
What?

12:53.560 --> 12:54.560
Huh?

12:54.560 --> 12:56.560
If what?

12:56.560 --> 12:59.200
It was me and Jake Robinson.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.200
How can they done it?

13:01.200 --> 13:02.200
What?

13:02.200 --> 13:03.200
What?

13:03.200 --> 13:05.200
That's fair to say.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.200
I just held a baby.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.800
You know I did just hold a baby.

13:07.800 --> 13:08.800
No, Jake was great.

13:08.800 --> 13:09.800
I'm kidding.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.760
But yeah, it was helpful to have someone you know in the room.

13:11.760 --> 13:12.760
It like four or 30.

13:12.760 --> 13:13.760
Yeah.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.000
I think it would have just been slightly creepy.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
What?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.800
Um, because obviously I was sleeping, what?

13:19.800 --> 13:22.880
What led to the breaking point and like, what did that feel like in your body?

13:22.880 --> 13:25.040
Because I remember you, I have tuned in for a bit when you were like, I'm hitting

13:25.040 --> 13:26.040
my third wall.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.040
I think I did it.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.040
What was it breaking?

13:28.040 --> 13:29.040
What was it breaking?

13:29.040 --> 13:30.040
It came in way.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.040
It came in way.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.040
The walls were fine.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.920
It just was this thing of like, I felt like everything was caving in and I can't do this.

13:33.920 --> 13:40.400
I can't be on display this tired with new people that have never met asking, like,

13:40.400 --> 13:43.360
that, well, some people came in and were like, taking me exactly where I was.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.640
Other people came in like asking a lot of me and I was like, I can't give you that.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.920
Yeah, you named names of who was asking a lot of you?

13:48.920 --> 13:49.920
No.

13:49.920 --> 13:50.920
Okay.

13:50.920 --> 13:51.920
Was it Marika?

13:51.920 --> 13:52.920
Yes.

13:52.920 --> 13:53.920
Okay.

13:53.920 --> 13:54.920
Yeah.

13:54.920 --> 14:00.400
But that's our, that's our general like friendship rapport, working relationship.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.320
Me asking a lot of you.

14:02.320 --> 14:05.920
And then you'd probably not responding to my text, but we covered that and miles the same.

14:05.920 --> 14:06.920
They're trotters.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.200
Which by the way, I'm going to plead Miss Trial, but yeah.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.200
No.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.200
Wow.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.200
No.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.200
I wasn't going to say.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.200
Be brought so much evidence.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.200
So much evidence.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.200
No.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.200
But I also would like to, I mean, I've been complaining.

14:18.200 --> 14:22.200
I'll have more gratitude tomorrow, but, uh, uh, sorry.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.200
I just got distracted by the.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.200
I think I was gold.

14:24.200 --> 14:25.200
I goldy.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.200
Goldy.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.200
Just how much work went into this.

14:28.200 --> 14:32.200
Like, I really do appreciate it from the New York team from the, well, yeah.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.200
I don't know if it's Stockholm syndrome or not, but I, you know, it was a cool thing

14:35.200 --> 14:37.200
to be a part of.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.200
I wanted to be over soon.

14:39.200 --> 14:43.200
But, uh, it was a once in a lifetime opportunity and clearly so much thought and planning

14:43.200 --> 14:45.200
went into each and every aspect of it.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.200
So shout out to the whole headgum team.

14:47.200 --> 14:50.200
I'm not going to say thank you, but I will say shout out.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.200
Yeah.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.200
Feels fair.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.200
Yeah.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.200
Gabers made a good point yesterday.

14:54.200 --> 14:57.200
I was trying with him between segments.

14:57.200 --> 15:02.200
And, um, we were talking about like how, you know, like you said earlier, that it's like

15:02.200 --> 15:08.200
we, that it's so much love that it's like we do it because we love you and, and also that it's

15:08.200 --> 15:12.200
like, that it's like every one has thought that it's like you can handle something like

15:12.200 --> 15:16.200
this that you can be on for 24 hours and Gabers now are like, and that's so cool.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.200
Such an honor.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.200
I never want a fucking do it.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.200
But, um, happy to have it in and out.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.200
Like I was thinking like, oh, that's so cool.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.200
And I was like, both of us were like, man, that'd be so awesome.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.200
They's bringing on me and like, no, I would hate this.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.200
I would never want to do this.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.200
Well, I've talked to you about how I hate surprise parties.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.200
Yeah.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.200
So this is kind of like the ultimate surprise.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.200
Because probably over the course of hours, thousands of people watching you.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.200
Yeah.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.200
How much money has been raised by the way?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.200
Well, it was 10,000.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.200
But there was like, it was again, we were only doing proceeds.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.200
So I think it's only going to be.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.200
Yeah.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.200
We were 500.

15:46.200 --> 15:51.200
We were raising money, uh, over the past 24 hours for, uh, stand-up girls.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.200
Uh, and they came in the watch.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.200
Yeah.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.200
And the watch.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.200
Yeah.

15:57.200 --> 16:02.200
They came and watched some of Jeff's stand-up, which was just his, uh, shark tank puns.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.200
Um, they were very funny.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.200
Yeah.

16:05.200 --> 16:08.200
I thought that was really, no, I thought that's like my was really fun.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.200
I was, I was worried, but I thought.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.200
And did they like it?

16:12.200 --> 16:13.200
Did they think it was funny?

16:13.200 --> 16:14.200
They were on fun.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.200
Yeah.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.200
They were laughing at it.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.200
Well, because what I know that means is that once you guys have to

16:18.200 --> 16:21.200
off Zoom, you were in the lobby of the office and kind of were like,

16:21.200 --> 16:22.200
thanks so much for doing it.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.200
They were like, yeah.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.200
Yeah.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.200
They loved, they were so happy.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.200
They've been posting on social media.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.200
Like, we had to keep it a surprise, obviously.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.200
And they were so excited to do it.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.200
They were posting on social media like tune in.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.200
There's a huge, like we got a huge announcement.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.200
They, they're like thrilled.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.200
They took whatever taking photos of the studio.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.200
Like, that's awesome.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.200
That's cool.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.200
I mean, they were quick.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.200
They were smart.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.200
They were funny.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.200
Um, I think that's a cool program.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.200
Yeah.

16:46.200 --> 16:51.200
Um, I don't remember what we were talking about before.

16:51.200 --> 16:57.200
Um, would, would, I mean, not talk, Jeff, because Jeff's already done this.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.200
Um, if for everyone in this,

17:01.200 --> 17:03.200
zoom.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.200
Um, would.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.200
How would you guys react?

17:06.200 --> 17:08.200
Like, would you guys, would you guys be down to do something like this?

17:08.200 --> 17:11.200
Or would it be like hell, no, absolutely not.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.200
If it was surprised upon me, I would tell you.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.200
I wouldn't leave.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.200
I would, I would, I would I would.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.200
Yeah, I think I would.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.200
But what if it was pitched to you in a meeting for weeks in advance?

17:21.200 --> 17:22.200
I could be like me.

17:22.200 --> 17:27.220
That's not what I thought you were kind of sad,

17:27.220 --> 17:29.380
You're gonna say it's a really fun example.

17:29.380 --> 17:31.540
And what would you do it?

17:31.540 --> 17:34.940
I think I would stay if it was sprung on me,

17:34.940 --> 17:37.460
but if it was an advance, I probably wouldn't agree to it.

17:37.460 --> 17:39.660
I think it's the opposite for me.

17:39.660 --> 17:42.180
But you were around for a lot of it.

17:42.180 --> 17:44.940
Not always on camera, sometimes on camera, like...

17:44.940 --> 17:46.140
Yeah, but that's different.

17:46.140 --> 17:48.420
But I'm also not a performer.

17:48.420 --> 17:50.260
I don't even want to stick to the plans

17:50.260 --> 17:51.860
that I make for myself.

17:51.860 --> 17:54.620
The idea of someone else.

17:54.620 --> 17:56.860
Yeah, but I think you're good on Mike,

17:56.860 --> 17:59.900
I would say, like, you're confident.

17:59.900 --> 18:01.060
Thank you for those fishing.

18:01.060 --> 18:01.900
But...

18:01.900 --> 18:08.220
Yeah, I would stay if I was in your position.

18:08.220 --> 18:08.780
Yeah.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.420
Riga?

18:10.420 --> 18:11.260
I would stay.

18:11.260 --> 18:17.060
I also, well, I think that I could handle it,

18:17.060 --> 18:19.980
but not in the sense of being a performer.

18:19.980 --> 18:23.540
I think it would be really boring if I was sitting

18:23.540 --> 18:24.980
in front of the camera for 24 hours,

18:24.980 --> 18:26.660
but I would do it.

18:26.740 --> 18:29.060
Because I also feel like growing up

18:29.060 --> 18:30.580
I did dumb things.

18:30.580 --> 18:33.620
Let's try to stay up for 24 hours

18:33.620 --> 18:38.100
and stay on Skype and watch stuff on TV

18:38.100 --> 18:38.940
and all the kind of stuff.

18:38.940 --> 18:41.060
So like, feel...

18:41.060 --> 18:42.860
I feel like I could handle it.

18:42.860 --> 18:44.580
I definitely like...

18:44.580 --> 18:46.500
You also said that you used to hang around

18:46.500 --> 18:48.300
with a rag tag group of rascals

18:48.300 --> 18:50.580
who would like bail white-collar criminals

18:50.580 --> 18:51.900
out of federal prison.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.060
Yeah.

18:53.060 --> 18:55.420
That's not the people we need to be bailed out.

18:55.420 --> 18:57.580
Yeah, no, well, we were hackers

18:57.580 --> 18:59.700
and we had a little chat.

18:59.700 --> 19:00.980
I don't know.

19:00.980 --> 19:03.020
And that's kind of how we did most of our work,

19:03.020 --> 19:03.860
but yeah.

19:03.860 --> 19:05.220
Most of your work?

19:05.220 --> 19:06.060
Yeah.

19:06.060 --> 19:06.900
Our work.

19:06.900 --> 19:08.020
We called it work.

19:08.020 --> 19:09.260
Because we could go to school,

19:09.260 --> 19:10.700
we would go to school and then we'd come home

19:10.700 --> 19:11.820
and then we'd do a bit of that.

19:11.820 --> 19:14.660
And it was like our job after school.

19:14.660 --> 19:15.500
Yeah.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.820
By the way, I promised goal the I wouldn't do this,

19:16.820 --> 19:18.660
but you've been nursing that drink all day

19:18.660 --> 19:21.180
and it's pretty much just Boba bubbles, right?

19:21.180 --> 19:22.900
There's no liquid in the entire time.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.820
You were just sucking down tapioca.

19:24.820 --> 19:25.660
Yeah.

19:25.660 --> 19:29.580
It was a moochomango, but heavy on tapioca pearls.

19:29.580 --> 19:30.100
Yeah.

19:30.100 --> 19:31.260
Ha ha ha ha.

19:33.660 --> 19:34.340
I've only stayed.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.180
I've only done one.

19:35.180 --> 19:36.020
What'd you do this?

19:36.020 --> 19:36.860
One nighter.

19:36.860 --> 19:38.540
I mean, if I, if I, if I was in here,

19:38.540 --> 19:39.380
I would do it.

19:39.380 --> 19:40.980
I would be not thrilled.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.420
I would be excited for like the first two hours.

19:43.420 --> 19:43.620
Yeah.

19:43.620 --> 19:45.300
And then I would hit me and be like, oh shit.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.900
I've only pulled one all nighter

19:46.900 --> 19:49.940
before like one like 24 hours step.

19:49.940 --> 19:54.780
And I felt like absolute shit the next day.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.820
Because it's like the adrenaline that keeps you going

19:56.820 --> 19:58.540
for a bit of like, oh, I'm going to do it.

19:58.540 --> 19:59.660
We're going to do it all nighter.

19:59.660 --> 20:00.540
And like it keeps you.

20:00.540 --> 20:04.820
And then it's like, then the wee hours of the morning hit.

20:04.820 --> 20:06.420
And then I want to kill myself.

20:06.420 --> 20:08.140
It looks like it's so.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.580
And the next day feels like the worst hangover

20:10.580 --> 20:12.860
of your entire life.

20:12.860 --> 20:14.340
Because what's going to happen is I'm going to go home.

20:14.340 --> 20:16.460
And I'm going to just go to sleep at 12 30.

20:16.460 --> 20:17.060
Yeah.

20:17.060 --> 20:17.860
Wake up at what?

20:17.860 --> 20:18.380
Nine.

20:18.380 --> 20:19.060
Yeah.

20:19.060 --> 20:19.860
Then what?

20:19.860 --> 20:21.340
Now you're then you're going to be not turned off.

20:21.340 --> 20:22.340
Now I'm fucked.

20:22.380 --> 20:26.180
You might sleep through the whole night.

20:26.180 --> 20:28.020
God willing.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.220
I hope I try to go.

20:29.220 --> 20:31.420
Kind of what Connor was saying.

20:31.420 --> 20:32.940
Is that?

20:32.940 --> 20:35.500
That's kind of what Connor was saying.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.020
Yeah.

20:37.020 --> 20:39.220
Uh.

20:39.220 --> 20:40.220
Well, we were talking about it.

20:40.220 --> 20:42.300
We were saying to go with God.

20:42.300 --> 20:43.300
Yeah.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.140
Oh.

20:45.140 --> 20:45.940
Hi, Monica.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.300
Hi, I'm a, I'm a, I put headphones on.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.220
So I see here your voices.

20:50.220 --> 20:51.300
Hi, I'm on.

20:51.300 --> 20:52.300
Yeah.

20:52.300 --> 20:53.300
You guys sound in looking.

20:53.300 --> 20:54.300
Right, too.

20:54.300 --> 20:55.300
Oh, thank you so much.

20:55.300 --> 20:56.300
Yeah.

20:56.300 --> 20:57.300
It's no problem.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.300
Oh, this is a great hairstyle dress.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.900
I'm just going to put you in it.

21:01.900 --> 21:03.900
Okay.

21:03.900 --> 21:06.940
Guys, our next partners, I've let a greens.

21:06.940 --> 21:07.940
I don't know what else to say.

21:07.940 --> 21:10.060
I take AG1 every morning.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.060
All right.

21:11.060 --> 21:12.060
Wake up.

21:12.060 --> 21:13.060
Water.

21:13.060 --> 21:14.060
AG1.

21:14.060 --> 21:15.060
Cold brew.

21:15.060 --> 21:16.060
I'm soren.

21:16.060 --> 21:17.060
All right.

21:17.060 --> 21:18.060
I'm off.

21:18.060 --> 21:19.060
I have mental clarity.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.060
I have increased alertness.

21:20.060 --> 21:21.780
And I have increased energy.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.620
And stamina.

21:23.620 --> 21:26.220
I wanted to try this stuff because I have sleep issues.

21:26.220 --> 21:27.220
All right.

21:27.220 --> 21:30.780
Even if I get like nine hours of sleep, I don't feel good.

21:30.780 --> 21:34.860
But honestly, since I've started taking that that a greens and it's been over a year now,

21:34.860 --> 21:36.020
everything has improved.

21:36.020 --> 21:37.660
My sleep quality has improved.

21:37.660 --> 21:41.340
How I feel during the day has improved, especially the morning because I am not a

21:41.340 --> 21:42.340
morning person.

21:42.340 --> 21:43.900
I cannot recognize this enough.

21:43.900 --> 21:46.100
I cannot recommend this enough, all right.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.100
AG1.

21:47.100 --> 21:50.700
It's hard for me to keep up with a supplement routine that comes with a bunch of different

21:50.700 --> 21:51.700
products.

21:52.140 --> 21:54.020
I literally had like eight different vitamins.

21:54.020 --> 22:01.620
I was taking what was a magnesium glycine, vitamin E, vitamin D, vitamin B, 12.

22:01.620 --> 22:02.620
And a couple of other things.

22:02.620 --> 22:03.620
B, delivery.

22:03.620 --> 22:04.620
It was too much.

22:04.620 --> 22:05.620
There was too many pills.

22:05.620 --> 22:06.620
It was expensive.

22:06.620 --> 22:07.620
It was inconvenient.

22:07.620 --> 22:13.020
And now I get literally all of those things and more for cheaper and easier.

22:13.020 --> 22:15.700
It's just easier to stay consistent with it.

22:15.700 --> 22:20.020
I noticed that it helped me again with improved clarity and alertness, especially in the

22:20.020 --> 22:24.540
morning as someone who needs all the extra energy I can get coffee wasn't even cutting

22:24.540 --> 22:25.540
it anymore.

22:25.540 --> 22:29.340
I needed these supplements to really feel at my best mentally.

22:29.340 --> 22:33.340
And AG1 has filled that in for me, made it easy, made it consistent and it's easy because

22:33.340 --> 22:35.140
it's so easy to fit into your lifestyle.

22:35.140 --> 22:39.140
It's just one scoop of powder mixed with water once a day.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.900
Everyone can do that and it tastes great.

22:40.900 --> 22:43.660
So after a certain point, you're just looking forward to it.

22:43.660 --> 22:47.340
It becomes a staple in your day and it becomes something that your day doesn't feel

22:47.340 --> 22:49.500
right when you don't have it.

22:49.500 --> 22:54.780
It gives you increased energy and mood support making it easy to live your best life.

22:54.780 --> 22:58.940
And I'm always looking for life hacks, which is why I've come to trust and love AG1 by

22:58.940 --> 22:59.940
athletic greens.

22:59.940 --> 23:03.020
It just is a life hack to get you these things.

23:03.020 --> 23:06.380
That oftentimes we aren't getting from the nutrition from our normal food on any given

23:06.380 --> 23:07.380
day.

23:07.380 --> 23:10.380
So, very important, very convenient, I love AG1.

23:10.380 --> 23:13.100
So if you're looking for an easier way to take supplements, athletic greens is giving you

23:13.100 --> 23:18.380

23:21.140 --> 23:24.220
Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash what's that?

23:24.220 --> 23:27.860
Check it out guys, it's ideal to have, it's ideal to sit in.

23:27.860 --> 23:30.460
This show is sponsored by Better Help, guys.

23:30.460 --> 23:32.700
Getting to know yourself can be a lifelong process, right?

23:32.700 --> 23:38.340
It's a long road ahead, the long and winding you.

23:38.340 --> 23:41.820
No, but in all seriousness, we're always learning and changing and growing and becoming

23:41.820 --> 23:43.460
different version of ourselves, right?

23:43.460 --> 23:45.700
We all talk about, you know, I'm in my flop era.

23:45.740 --> 23:49.860
Oh, I'm in my this era, I'm in my like long hair era.

23:49.860 --> 23:51.620
You're changing all the time, right?

23:51.620 --> 23:56.740
And you have to be able to be clocking these changes and adapting to and with yourself.

23:56.740 --> 23:58.180
And that's where therapy can come in.

23:58.180 --> 24:01.020
It's all about deepening yourself awareness and understanding.

24:01.020 --> 24:05.420
Because sometimes we don't know what we want or why we react the way we do until we talk

24:05.420 --> 24:08.500
things through with an objective third-party source, right?

24:08.500 --> 24:14.060
That's why I'm in therapy every week is to become the better version of myself, to be

24:14.060 --> 24:18.540
more self aware, more understanding of how I react to things and why.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.660
So that I can show up for the people around me as the best version of myself, right?

24:21.660 --> 24:27.100
I think that if you have the access to therapy, you owe it to yourself.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.100
And there's no shame.

24:28.100 --> 24:31.140
You don't have to be going through something to be in therapy.

24:31.140 --> 24:34.260
You can just be going once a week and, you know, there might be some weeks where you're

24:34.260 --> 24:36.060
like, I don't even know anything to talk about.

24:36.060 --> 24:37.060
You get to therapy.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.060
You think it's going to be a waste of time.

24:38.060 --> 24:42.260
Suddenly you're talking for an hour, things you didn't even realize were present in your

24:42.260 --> 24:43.260
life.

24:43.260 --> 24:45.260
Down beneath the surface.

24:45.260 --> 24:48.500
And that's just, I think, an incredible tool to have.

24:48.500 --> 24:53.100
And if you have it at your disposal, and with things like better help coming in, expanding

24:53.100 --> 24:58.740
access, making it easier, cheaper, more affordable, and more convenient, you can't go wrong.

24:58.740 --> 25:01.780

Thanks, better help.

25:23.460 --> 25:24.460
Did you ever make rice?

25:24.460 --> 25:26.460
Doesn't look like it.

25:26.460 --> 25:27.460
No.

25:27.460 --> 25:30.460
I can't do anything else.

25:30.460 --> 25:31.460
I can't.

25:31.460 --> 25:32.460
Should we?

25:32.460 --> 25:37.460
There was the first thing that he got was the rice after Jeff Probes announced this.

25:37.460 --> 25:40.460
And then we'd be like wholesale.

25:40.460 --> 25:41.460
Yeah.

25:41.460 --> 25:46.460
You should have made him make fire in the stock.

25:46.460 --> 25:53.460
And then you get to go out, but in case you win, I could easily be Jeff Probes.

25:53.460 --> 25:59.460
Well, the whole thing was like, well, it's like 24 hours, right?

25:59.460 --> 26:03.460
We kind of got to the bottom of that.

26:03.460 --> 26:09.460
You mean a mirror had talked about doing an all night or something, and that was last summer,

26:09.460 --> 26:13.460
and then apparently a mirror pitched this in a content meeting last summer.

26:13.460 --> 26:16.460
So it might have been tracked back to me.

26:16.460 --> 26:17.460
Right.

26:17.460 --> 26:18.460
A prison of my own making.

26:18.460 --> 26:21.460
We wanted to be all night or in the style of like the college humor.

26:21.460 --> 26:22.460
Yeah.

26:22.460 --> 26:23.460
Of like doing sketchy.

26:23.460 --> 26:24.460
Which is not.

26:24.460 --> 26:25.460
24 hours.

26:25.460 --> 26:26.460
I remembered this morning.

26:26.460 --> 26:27.460
We were talking about it.

26:27.460 --> 26:28.460
It was 12 hours.

26:28.460 --> 26:29.460
It was 8 PM to 8 AM.

26:29.460 --> 26:32.460
And it was a group of people doing it.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.460
It wasn't live streamed.

26:34.460 --> 26:38.460
So the all night or should be a bunch of had gun podcasts was dropping it out.

26:38.460 --> 26:40.460
We should do that as a separate thing.

26:40.460 --> 26:41.460
It's not live streamed.

26:41.460 --> 26:42.460
And it should just be 12 hours.

26:42.460 --> 26:45.460
And episode every hour in the studio.

26:45.460 --> 26:47.460
And it's not live streamed.

26:47.460 --> 26:48.460
Why would it be live streamed?

26:48.460 --> 26:49.460
Well, then what's the point?

26:49.460 --> 26:50.460
Looking up.

26:50.460 --> 26:52.460
We should look at the live stream.

26:52.460 --> 26:54.460
Well, then it's just like us a private thing.

26:54.460 --> 26:56.460
It's supposed to be delirious episode records.

26:56.460 --> 26:57.460
Uh, episodes.

26:57.460 --> 27:00.460
And then we could also throw in like two or three sketches that we have to write.

27:00.460 --> 27:02.460
And film the sketches in the same night.

27:02.460 --> 27:06.460
And it would be like, uh, you remember that so sweet life of Zach and Cody.

27:06.460 --> 27:07.460
Of course.

27:07.460 --> 27:08.460
Yeah.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.460
Yeah.

27:09.460 --> 27:12.460
So nothing like a Disney channel cross over.

27:12.460 --> 27:13.460
Yeah.

27:13.460 --> 27:14.460
Yeah.

27:14.460 --> 27:17.460
How long have we been recording?

27:17.460 --> 27:21.460
We have we have about a half an hour to go.

27:21.460 --> 27:23.460
Are you just going to go home and pass out?

27:23.460 --> 27:25.460
Are you going to eat what's what's the vibe?

27:25.460 --> 27:26.460
I'm going to get some pancakes.

27:26.460 --> 27:28.460
And then I'm going to go to the park to sleep.

27:28.460 --> 27:30.460
I'm going to enjoy every second of it.

27:30.460 --> 27:31.460
Isaac.

27:31.460 --> 27:35.460
Do you want to take your pajamas with you?

27:35.460 --> 27:36.460
No.

27:36.460 --> 27:37.460
No, we gave food.

27:37.460 --> 27:38.460
I got those for you.

27:38.460 --> 27:39.460
You bought those for me?

27:39.460 --> 27:40.460
Yeah.

27:40.460 --> 27:41.460
There were pajamas here.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.460
They're right at your feet, case.

27:42.460 --> 27:43.460
Uh, thank you.

27:43.460 --> 27:44.460
Yeah.

27:44.460 --> 27:45.460
I'll take them like yeah.

27:45.460 --> 27:46.460
I'm checking on the chair right now.

27:46.460 --> 27:47.460
It's a blue.

27:47.460 --> 27:48.460
It's like blue.

27:48.460 --> 27:49.460
I forgot that this is live street.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.460
I thought I'd tell you if you were releasing this.

27:51.460 --> 27:55.460
You thought she'll be brought the stuff that I've been planning.

27:55.460 --> 27:59.460
Well, when it was just me and Jeff in here and I said, what's this?

27:59.460 --> 28:00.460
He said, she'll be brought it.

28:00.460 --> 28:02.460
She did bring it in and say, I brought you this.

28:02.460 --> 28:03.460
That was the, that was the bed.

28:03.460 --> 28:04.460
There you go.

28:05.460 --> 28:06.460
Oh, are these ear?

28:06.460 --> 28:07.460
Is this ear?

28:07.460 --> 28:08.460
Mm-hmm.

28:08.460 --> 28:09.460
Oh, my goodness.

28:09.460 --> 28:11.460
Was that ever unfolded?

28:11.460 --> 28:12.460
Did we get them?

28:12.460 --> 28:13.460
See what the bed is?

28:13.460 --> 28:15.460
That was the real apps.

28:15.460 --> 28:16.460
The baby's gone.

28:16.460 --> 28:17.460
We saw the baby.

28:17.460 --> 28:19.460
Um, cries and waves.

28:19.460 --> 28:21.460
And you guys should do the headgum podcasts.

28:21.460 --> 28:22.460
No, no, no.

28:22.460 --> 28:23.460
Children's babies.

28:23.460 --> 28:24.460
Like have a bunch of shows.

28:24.460 --> 28:30.460
But we all round Robin of sorts have to switch hosts for different shows for a stream.

28:30.460 --> 28:31.460
That would be great.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.460
What do I want to host?

28:32.460 --> 28:33.460
Yeah.

28:33.460 --> 28:35.460
Just be honest about all of them on the network.

28:35.460 --> 28:37.460
Buckits.

28:37.460 --> 28:42.460
That's really fucking funny.

28:42.460 --> 28:44.460
Spitting the fombazze football.

28:44.460 --> 28:45.460
I don't know either.

28:45.460 --> 28:46.460
Thehing out.

28:46.460 --> 28:48.460
Daryl and I hosting buckbox as my god.

28:48.460 --> 28:52.460
I sat next to a mirror during our like headgum holiday company and dinner.

28:52.460 --> 28:56.460
And though I, I was like, come up with conversation alley.

28:56.460 --> 28:57.460
Like let's talk about sports.

28:57.460 --> 28:58.460
He loves basketball.

28:58.460 --> 29:00.460
And I was like so, what are you supposed to eat?

29:00.460 --> 29:02.460
And I was like, so, what do you think about Devon Booker?

29:02.460 --> 29:04.640
And he was like, uh, why?

29:04.640 --> 29:06.560
And I was like, well, I heard King and kind of John

29:06.560 --> 29:07.720
are just for a prom.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.100
Yeah, that's your game.

29:09.100 --> 29:11.300
Yeah, that's why I was like, do you think he's been

29:11.300 --> 29:12.180
good lately?

29:12.180 --> 29:13.600
And he's like, no, and I'm like, because he's

29:13.600 --> 29:14.820
probably hurting.

29:14.820 --> 29:19.140
He's probably hurting inside.

29:19.140 --> 29:19.980
And emotionally.

29:19.980 --> 29:21.100
Oh, I don't know what that is.

29:21.100 --> 29:22.340
Party.

29:22.340 --> 29:25.300
What what what shows would you guys all want to host?

29:25.300 --> 29:25.580
Try to.

29:25.580 --> 29:28.100
I want I just want to hear you host buckets.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.220
It's like, you guys, uh, what was.

29:33.460 --> 29:35.740
Oh, uh, being like,

29:35.740 --> 29:37.500
Devon Booker's a problem.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.020
I don't know.

29:38.020 --> 29:39.620
If you just give me a list of names because I

29:39.620 --> 29:42.020
don't know any, I can only talk about that

29:42.020 --> 29:43.020
on the personal level.

29:43.020 --> 29:45.300
I mean, that's all sports is as memorizing names.

29:45.300 --> 29:47.700
And I'd be like, oh my god, don't even ask him.

29:47.700 --> 29:48.700
Not this season.

29:48.700 --> 29:49.500
Not this season.

29:49.500 --> 29:52.060
And then the crowd, because it's a live show is going, oh, yeah.

29:52.060 --> 29:52.700
Yeah.

29:52.700 --> 29:53.700
Yeah.

29:54.260 --> 29:57.940
All right, you're like, why do you remember the bulls in

29:57.940 --> 29:58.780
the 90s?

29:58.780 --> 29:59.780
Pretty good.

29:59.780 --> 30:01.100
Do you hear that?

30:02.300 --> 30:03.140
Oh, it's good.

30:03.140 --> 30:03.780
90.

30:05.780 --> 30:07.340
Is that what I'm here so much to you?

30:07.340 --> 30:10.460
That's just, I guess, just any man to me, including

30:10.460 --> 30:11.060
myself.

30:12.300 --> 30:12.780
Great.

30:13.780 --> 30:16.260
We're just, you're just killing the Tim Allen.

30:16.260 --> 30:18.700
Oh, all right, you.

30:18.700 --> 30:19.580
You're a doctor.

30:19.580 --> 30:21.180
I didn't get you yesterday.

30:21.180 --> 30:21.940
That was cool.

30:21.940 --> 30:23.180
And a pregnancy.

30:23.260 --> 30:25.820
Well, honestly, okay, the pregnancy was my fault.

30:25.820 --> 30:28.220
I've come to realize that a mere doc's to himself.

30:28.220 --> 30:30.220
I said, I made a joke about how he doesn't have the

30:30.220 --> 30:31.980
gall to propose.

30:31.980 --> 30:34.620
And then he offered up the information that actually I did

30:34.620 --> 30:35.780
and we're engaged to be with.

30:35.780 --> 30:37.420
And it could have lived on the stream

30:37.420 --> 30:39.460
where only a couple hundred people were listening.

30:39.460 --> 30:41.780
But now we're saying it on the headgun podcast.

30:41.780 --> 30:43.700
Oh, I don't know what to do.

30:43.700 --> 30:44.820
Let's add five for you.

30:44.820 --> 30:45.700
I got it.

30:45.700 --> 30:46.780
Who was say?

30:49.340 --> 30:50.020
What do I say?

30:50.020 --> 30:50.540
Ohms.

30:50.540 --> 30:51.580
You say B.

30:51.580 --> 30:52.420
Ohms.

30:52.420 --> 30:52.780
B.

30:52.780 --> 30:53.620
Ohms.

30:54.620 --> 30:55.460
That's it.

30:55.460 --> 30:56.140
What do I say?

30:56.140 --> 30:56.620
Bite.

30:56.620 --> 30:57.660
You say rice.

30:57.660 --> 30:58.140
Bite.

30:58.140 --> 30:58.780
Rice.

30:58.780 --> 30:59.300
Bite.

30:59.300 --> 30:59.780
Rice.

31:00.820 --> 31:01.620
Fuck you guys.

31:01.620 --> 31:02.820
Yes.

31:02.820 --> 31:04.660
What do I feel like to be you?

31:04.660 --> 31:05.220
Yeah.

31:05.220 --> 31:06.140
Why did that?

31:06.140 --> 31:07.620
Several times throughout the night.

31:07.620 --> 31:14.500
Lots of things energy going here than feather.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.500
Is it?

31:15.500 --> 31:16.500
Could you give us a minute?

31:16.500 --> 31:17.940
So I've never done this with a producer.

31:17.940 --> 31:18.940
Could you just give us a minute?

31:18.940 --> 31:20.940
Could we have the room?

31:20.940 --> 31:21.940
We just have the room for a second.

31:21.940 --> 31:22.940
Well, he was here.

31:22.940 --> 31:23.940
Oh, no.

31:23.940 --> 31:24.940
You know what?

31:24.940 --> 31:25.940
I have felt though.

31:25.940 --> 31:28.020
You are looking over at me a lot more like familiar.

31:28.020 --> 31:31.940
Now that Ania is sitting next to me, I don't seem to, you're not as annoyed when you

31:31.940 --> 31:32.940
look in this direction.

31:32.940 --> 31:34.380
I've never been annoyed by you.

31:34.380 --> 31:35.820
I only make jokes like that to people.

31:35.820 --> 31:36.820
I feel comfortable with.

31:37.060 --> 31:38.300
I was going to say this is a bond.

31:38.300 --> 31:39.300
This is a bond.

31:39.300 --> 31:40.300
Yeah.

31:40.300 --> 31:41.540
Because you've been with us through some of the thick of it.

31:41.540 --> 31:42.540
Trauma bonding.

31:42.540 --> 31:49.180
So once a let's bring out back, we'll do another episode of review before we head out.

31:49.180 --> 31:50.780
You guys enjoy.

31:50.780 --> 31:54.340
How would you feel if you had to do an hour of improv right now after that?

31:54.340 --> 31:55.340
I would.

31:55.340 --> 31:56.340
That's where I draw the line.

31:56.340 --> 31:57.340
I'm done.

31:57.340 --> 31:59.340
I'm fucking done.

31:59.340 --> 32:01.980
Are you going to do improv two hours now?

32:01.980 --> 32:02.980
Oh my god.

32:02.980 --> 32:03.980
Not doing that.

32:03.980 --> 32:04.980
Okay.

32:04.980 --> 32:05.980
I don't know.

32:06.140 --> 32:07.340
No, I think you met the Harold.

32:07.340 --> 32:08.940
No, I met the Harold audition.

32:08.940 --> 32:11.940
I thought we were saying when you'd be back in improv shape.

32:11.940 --> 32:15.940
I need a 92 nights of solid sleep after this.

32:15.940 --> 32:16.580
Okay.

32:16.580 --> 32:17.580
So Monday morning.

32:17.580 --> 32:18.580
It sounds like Monday.

32:18.580 --> 32:19.580
It's a four months holiday.

32:19.580 --> 32:20.580
It's really important to Jeff.

32:20.580 --> 32:21.940
Do you pick it up Tuesday?

32:21.940 --> 32:23.060
I'll finish recording on Monday.

32:23.060 --> 32:24.700
We can, we can slot you in.

32:24.700 --> 32:25.420
I'm not working on my makeup.

32:25.420 --> 32:26.700
Let me look at the calendar real quick.

32:26.700 --> 32:28.060
No, it's not about the calendar.

32:28.060 --> 32:29.060
I'm not doing it.

32:29.060 --> 32:30.700
It is, it is open.

32:30.700 --> 32:31.700
Kind of like, it is open.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.060
Yeah, whatever time we want.

32:34.300 --> 32:38.900
Do you want us to call you CB in try to reschedule your audition?

32:38.900 --> 32:39.900
For you.

32:39.900 --> 32:40.900
Let's do it right now.

32:40.900 --> 32:47.500
Uh, no, because I think this is the last weekend and I can't do it tomorrow.

32:47.500 --> 32:48.500
I don't want to do tomorrow.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.900
I don't want, I can't do it Monday.

32:49.900 --> 32:52.180
So, you know who used to be wants is parsley.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.780
They want to see parsley is holding on.

32:53.780 --> 32:54.780
Yeah, Marie, go.

32:54.780 --> 32:56.780
I don't want you to call to get the reception.

32:56.780 --> 32:57.780
The whole deal.

32:57.780 --> 32:58.780
parsley is going to change parsley.

32:58.780 --> 32:59.780
It's going to be funny.

32:59.780 --> 33:00.780
It's shit.

33:00.780 --> 33:01.780
I'm being funny.

33:01.780 --> 33:02.780
It's fall.

33:02.900 --> 33:05.620
That's my favorite bit ever.

33:05.620 --> 33:07.540
parsley is going to come in and change the scene.

33:07.540 --> 33:08.820
Marie, can you gotta be funny as shit?

33:08.820 --> 33:10.780
And you gotta tell us your whole deal.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.980
You're going to change the scene entirely with your entrance.

33:13.980 --> 33:15.340
I think all the time.

33:15.340 --> 33:16.340
I know.

33:16.340 --> 33:19.460
I'm, now I'm, because I thought this was my house.

33:19.460 --> 33:24.460
parsley parsley parsley parsley on the side.

33:27.460 --> 33:31.460
Yeah, that's my new, um, maybe I'll change my new parsley.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.820
That's really like middle name.

33:34.820 --> 33:39.060
And for those listeners who don't know, what, who's parsley?

33:39.060 --> 33:40.700
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

33:40.700 --> 33:45.620
parsley is, um, an ingenious character, uh,

33:45.620 --> 33:47.820
lived by Marie K. Brownley.

33:47.820 --> 33:50.300
We did, when Alfa and I came on, it was me, Alf,

33:50.300 --> 33:52.780
Jeff Marie K. for an episode of the pagan podcast.

33:52.780 --> 33:57.140
And, um, Jeff had a segment of review review review,

33:57.140 --> 34:01.420
where we did a bit of improv based on reviews of review.

34:01.420 --> 34:04.100
And Jeff promised Marie K.

34:04.100 --> 34:06.500
That she wouldn't have to do a scene.

34:06.500 --> 34:11.340
And it's like, not that two minutes in, like,

34:11.340 --> 34:13.980
we were doing a bit worse, like Alfa's my son.

34:13.980 --> 34:15.460
And Jeff's my new husband.

34:15.460 --> 34:16.860
He's going to mean his stepdad.

34:16.860 --> 34:19.420
Oh, I'd also preface to by being like, yeah, Marie could do not

34:19.420 --> 34:20.420
and do not.

34:20.420 --> 34:24.380
And then two minutes and he's like, you know who I brought with me.

34:24.380 --> 34:28.380
My friend, Parson, who's going to tell you his whole deal

34:28.380 --> 34:31.380
and change the scene entirely and be funny as shit.

34:31.660 --> 34:35.140
Here's the thing.

34:35.140 --> 34:38.500
I love that we're telling us at the end of this 24 hour stream,

34:38.500 --> 34:42.180
because isn't that the spirit with which we thought of this very idea?

34:42.180 --> 34:43.900
The Hedgen podcast spirit.

34:43.900 --> 34:47.180
No, you telling Marie, you telling Marie,

34:47.180 --> 34:49.300
because she's not going to be in it.

34:49.300 --> 34:51.540
And then putting her on this pot, making her be in it.

34:51.540 --> 34:53.620
Yeah, no, this is karma for sure.

34:53.620 --> 34:54.580
I get it.

34:54.580 --> 34:55.740
I'm going to go to an emergency.

34:55.740 --> 34:57.420
This is her first.

34:57.420 --> 34:59.380
Yeah, I think Parson's curse.

34:59.420 --> 35:03.180
I think they called this a Parson's allegory title of that.

35:03.180 --> 35:04.580
Yeah, Parson's allegory.

35:04.580 --> 35:06.620
It was Parson's allegory.

35:06.620 --> 35:08.420
It was my only note.

35:08.420 --> 35:12.780
I do wish it was more of people that I knew that was tough.

35:12.780 --> 35:14.460
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.060
It was just, especially in the morning.

35:16.060 --> 35:17.620
Everyone you know is like, yeah, it's room.

35:17.620 --> 35:18.620
Yeah, that's true.

35:18.620 --> 35:19.220
Yeah, yeah.

35:19.220 --> 35:20.820
More Jake would have been nice.

35:20.820 --> 35:22.620
Oh, is it his fruit?

35:22.620 --> 35:27.980
If I felt like the hardest stretch of it all was the zooms this morning.

35:27.980 --> 35:33.060
Being on Zoom for like four hours straight, but it was all a great.

35:33.060 --> 35:34.060
Sure.

35:34.060 --> 35:35.060
Thank you, Chuck.

35:35.060 --> 35:36.300
I think it was all great content.

35:36.300 --> 35:40.260
And it was clearly, it was, you guys pulled it off without a hitch.

35:40.260 --> 35:45.860
Yeah, I feel like we can like do a debrief kind of download lessons learned like on Tuesday

35:45.860 --> 35:47.660
kind of like not on a stream.

35:47.660 --> 35:48.660
That's true.

35:48.660 --> 35:49.660
Yeah.

35:49.660 --> 35:50.660
I thought.

35:50.660 --> 35:51.660
Now.

35:51.660 --> 35:55.140
Yeah, what a great time to, I mean, I appreciate the initiative.

35:55.140 --> 35:57.180
I love a debrief, but yeah.

35:57.180 --> 35:58.180
My vote would be for Tuesday.

35:58.180 --> 36:00.380
Twenty minutes, twenty two minutes.

36:00.380 --> 36:01.380
Home stretch.

36:01.380 --> 36:02.380
You got it, baby.

36:02.380 --> 36:03.380
Are you going to drive home?

36:03.380 --> 36:04.740
No, I'm getting a ride.

36:04.740 --> 36:05.740
Okay.

36:05.740 --> 36:06.740
I'm going to drive home.

36:06.740 --> 36:07.740
Okay.

36:07.740 --> 36:09.380
Casey, why don't we get you an Uber?

36:09.380 --> 36:11.980
I don't want to drive my car.

36:11.980 --> 36:12.980
I would like to drive my car.

36:12.980 --> 36:13.980
You're driving my car.

36:13.980 --> 36:14.740
I'm trying to get him a new car.

36:14.740 --> 36:17.260
I want to drive my car.

36:17.260 --> 36:21.740
Keep going on the road with the other drivers.

36:21.740 --> 36:22.740
So it's not a song.

36:23.300 --> 36:36.980
I want to drive my car on the road now, I'm a you look really upset.

36:36.980 --> 36:40.180
I'm, I'm not upset.

36:40.180 --> 36:41.180
I'm in a great mood.

36:41.180 --> 36:42.180
Oh, yeah.

36:42.180 --> 36:43.180
It's really comfortable.

36:43.180 --> 36:44.180
It's really comfortable.

36:44.180 --> 36:45.180
It's really hot here.

36:45.180 --> 36:46.180
I'm sorry.

36:46.180 --> 36:51.660
We got two different fans running.

36:51.660 --> 36:52.660
Is your door open?

36:53.100 --> 36:54.100
No.

36:54.100 --> 36:56.340
Oh, you got to look at that door.

36:56.340 --> 36:57.180
It was open.

36:57.180 --> 36:58.580
We thought it was very, very worse.

36:58.580 --> 36:59.580
Yeah.

36:59.580 --> 37:00.940
Oh, wow.

37:00.940 --> 37:01.300
Yeah.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.220
How's that possible?

37:03.220 --> 37:06.460
Because the heater is on blast outside of the office

37:06.460 --> 37:07.780
and we can't turn it off.

37:07.780 --> 37:08.620
Oh, no.

37:08.620 --> 37:09.420
Oh, no.

37:09.420 --> 37:11.020
Oh, it's winter.

37:11.020 --> 37:11.620
Yeah, sure.

37:11.620 --> 37:14.420
Yeah, she does not the only thing on blast today.

37:14.420 --> 37:15.780
Speak on it.

37:15.780 --> 37:16.260
Yeah.

37:16.260 --> 37:18.820
Danny tore me a new one.

37:18.820 --> 37:20.220
Didn't he give you a run?

37:20.220 --> 37:20.860
That's true.

37:20.860 --> 37:21.700
Would you eat?

37:21.780 --> 37:22.700
Well, we had my most.

37:22.700 --> 37:26.140
Also, KC is sack of white rice.

37:26.140 --> 37:28.740
So I think you go to the sand on the stove.

37:28.740 --> 37:32.220
Champagne and kidding, call me a sack of white rice.

37:32.220 --> 37:33.820
Oh, yeah, just did.

37:33.820 --> 37:37.180
And honestly, it killed.

37:37.180 --> 37:38.180
Great.

37:38.180 --> 37:39.180
Oh, yeah.

37:39.180 --> 37:41.860
It was just smiling because it's over.

37:41.860 --> 37:42.860
Not that it happened.

37:42.860 --> 37:43.860
I also got it.

37:43.860 --> 37:45.580
Damn it.

37:45.580 --> 37:47.700
That was body for sure.

37:47.700 --> 37:48.700
You were body.

37:48.700 --> 37:49.700
Yeah.

37:50.700 --> 37:52.140
We're all him.

37:52.140 --> 37:55.340
He's on the day.

37:55.340 --> 37:56.740
But goldies hurt.

37:56.740 --> 37:58.900
We're all the wheels different.

38:03.900 --> 38:05.180
Yeah.

38:05.180 --> 38:09.940
Jeff, best and worst parts of the stream for you.

38:09.940 --> 38:11.940
Didn't we did that?

38:11.940 --> 38:13.060
Well, we did this episode.

38:13.060 --> 38:14.060
Yeah.

38:14.060 --> 38:15.060
Yeah, yeah.

38:15.060 --> 38:18.340
The lowest was this morning when it was just a lot.

38:18.340 --> 38:19.060
Yeah.

38:19.060 --> 38:20.060
That is a lot of energy.

38:20.060 --> 38:23.500
Let's do the bond of the week.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.500
Oh, yeah.

38:24.500 --> 38:29.300
The bond has to be someone that was on the stream at any point.

38:29.300 --> 38:30.940
Bond, though, we got it.

38:30.940 --> 38:31.940
Yeah.

38:31.940 --> 38:32.940
Ben Katzman.

38:32.940 --> 38:33.940
Love.

38:33.940 --> 38:34.940
Yeah.

38:34.940 --> 38:35.940
The shirtsman.

38:35.940 --> 38:36.940
Beautiful.

38:36.940 --> 38:37.940
For sure.

38:37.940 --> 38:38.940
For sure.

38:38.940 --> 38:39.940
For sure.

38:39.940 --> 38:44.060
I like to pitch Miles Bonson Yorday for Bond because it disguises

38:44.060 --> 38:45.060
though.

38:45.060 --> 38:46.060
The first Italian bond.

38:46.060 --> 38:47.060
Bond.

38:47.060 --> 38:48.060
Bond.

38:48.060 --> 38:49.060
Bond.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.060
Bond.

38:50.060 --> 38:51.060
Bond.

38:51.060 --> 38:52.060
Bond.

38:52.060 --> 38:53.060
Bond.

38:53.060 --> 38:54.060
Bond.

38:54.060 --> 38:55.060
Bond.

38:55.060 --> 38:56.060
Bond.

38:56.060 --> 38:57.060
Bond.

38:57.060 --> 38:58.060
Bond.

38:58.060 --> 38:59.060
Bond.

38:59.060 --> 39:00.060
Bond.

39:00.060 --> 39:01.060
Bond.

39:01.060 --> 39:02.060
Bond.

39:02.060 --> 39:03.060
Bond.

39:03.060 --> 39:04.060
Bond.

39:04.060 --> 39:06.060
We've done that before, but yeah.

39:06.060 --> 39:07.060
I'm so sorry.

39:07.060 --> 39:09.060
I'm so sorry.

39:09.060 --> 39:10.060
I'm so sorry.

39:10.060 --> 39:11.060
Jeff, come here.

39:11.060 --> 39:14.060
What the fuck is that?

39:15.060 --> 39:18.060
Why would you think that?

39:18.060 --> 39:20.060
Well, my bottom of it was going to be you.

39:20.060 --> 39:21.060
Why?

39:21.060 --> 39:22.060
I don't know.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.060
You're the only actor on the show.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.060
That's not true.

39:24.060 --> 39:25.060
Who else acts?

39:25.060 --> 39:26.060
Okay.

39:26.060 --> 39:27.060
I don't know.

39:27.060 --> 39:28.060
I'm the guest.

39:28.060 --> 39:29.060
We all sing.

39:29.060 --> 39:30.060
We all sing.

39:30.060 --> 39:32.060
Actually, we all sing.

39:32.060 --> 39:35.060
Actually, we all sing.

39:35.060 --> 39:36.060
No one else acts.

39:36.060 --> 39:38.060
That's literally not true.

39:38.060 --> 39:39.060
On the stream.

39:39.060 --> 39:40.060
You.

39:40.060 --> 39:41.060
Gables.

39:41.060 --> 39:42.060
Yeah.

39:42.060 --> 39:43.060
You're going to be my pick.

39:43.060 --> 39:44.060
Yeah.

39:44.060 --> 39:45.060
I want to be Bond.

39:45.060 --> 39:46.060
I want to be Bond.

39:46.060 --> 39:47.060
I'm so sorry.

39:47.060 --> 39:48.060
Yeah.

39:48.060 --> 39:49.060
Gables.

39:49.060 --> 39:50.060
No.

39:50.060 --> 39:51.060
Bond villain.

39:51.060 --> 39:52.060
Yeah.

39:52.060 --> 39:53.060
I got a.

39:53.060 --> 39:54.060
I got a.

39:54.060 --> 39:55.060
I got a.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.060
I got a.

39:57.060 --> 39:58.060
We just.

39:58.060 --> 39:59.060
Bond villain.

39:59.060 --> 40:00.060
I'd see it.

40:00.060 --> 40:01.060
Wait.

40:01.060 --> 40:02.060
The.

40:02.060 --> 40:03.060
Bond villain was Billy.

40:03.060 --> 40:04.060
Yes, you.

40:04.060 --> 40:05.060
I know.

40:05.060 --> 40:06.060
That was really sad.

40:06.060 --> 40:08.060
Billy, if you're watching this.

40:08.060 --> 40:10.060
You got me, brother.

40:10.060 --> 40:12.060
I felt like the chat was turning on this whole thing.

40:12.060 --> 40:18.060
I don't know if the chat was like if this is real let him go, there was a whole campaign to set you free.

40:18.060 --> 40:24.060
And they were appreciated because I was straight up ignoring them because I was worried that Billy was mad at me.

40:24.060 --> 40:32.060
They were just trying to like get you settled in the moment to be like, let's take a part what just happened.

40:32.060 --> 40:36.060
You see, see if this is real.

40:36.060 --> 40:38.060
What you also asked, what did I learn?

40:38.060 --> 40:40.060
I don't know.

40:40.060 --> 40:42.060
I thought the Billy thing was real.

40:42.060 --> 40:48.060
Well, I thought it was real until I ran out of the studio and spotted a mirror and go, and what the fuck is Billy doing?

40:48.060 --> 40:50.060
Is it a bit?

40:50.060 --> 40:52.060
And then not a mirror was like, yeah, it's a bit.

40:52.060 --> 40:54.060
I was like, thank God.

40:54.060 --> 40:56.060
When I was watching, I didn't catch that it was Billy.

40:56.060 --> 41:00.060
All I tuned in for was just like, I have a self tape for a commercial do it five.

41:00.060 --> 41:02.060
That didn't end up happening.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.060
And that was real.

41:04.060 --> 41:06.060
That was real.

41:06.060 --> 41:08.060
That sucks.

41:08.060 --> 41:09.060
I never the same time.

41:09.060 --> 41:10.060
You thought it was the same thing.

41:10.060 --> 41:14.060
And I was like, oh, everything's rolling in for some reason right now and we're ruining Jeff's life.

41:14.060 --> 41:18.060
That would have been really funny to get on the stream though, like to do a self tape.

41:18.060 --> 41:19.060
To do a self tape.

41:19.060 --> 41:20.060
I thought you would.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.060
That would have been real.

41:21.060 --> 41:22.060
I would have done it.

41:22.060 --> 41:23.060
We didn't have done it.

41:23.060 --> 41:24.060
Yeah.

41:24.060 --> 41:25.060
You didn't have time.

41:25.060 --> 41:26.060
I don't want to know.

41:26.060 --> 41:27.060
Well, we had to.

41:27.060 --> 41:28.060
There was no downtime.

41:28.060 --> 41:29.060
That's the thing.

41:29.060 --> 41:33.060
Well, we're not the only downtime was like between like one and two a.m.

41:33.060 --> 41:37.060
Yeah, but prime British hour in the British hour.

41:38.060 --> 41:39.060
Yeah.

41:39.060 --> 41:40.060
Yeah.

41:40.060 --> 41:41.060
I don't know.

41:41.060 --> 41:42.060
What are you guys doing tonight?

41:42.060 --> 41:44.060
I'm hanging out with my mom.

41:44.060 --> 41:45.060
Please tell her I say hello.

41:45.060 --> 41:46.060
I will.

41:46.060 --> 41:47.060
A lot of moms in town.

41:47.060 --> 41:48.060
Yeah.

41:48.060 --> 41:49.060
A big mom.

41:49.060 --> 41:50.060
Yeah.

41:50.060 --> 41:51.060
You go and I can dinner.

41:51.060 --> 41:52.060
What else?

41:52.060 --> 41:55.060
I think tonight she wants to go out on the town.

41:55.060 --> 41:56.060
What else?

41:56.060 --> 41:57.060
Yeah.

41:57.060 --> 41:58.060
It's going to pop.

41:58.060 --> 41:59.060
Yeah.

41:59.060 --> 42:00.060
Maybe too bungalow.

42:00.060 --> 42:02.060
Your buddies invited you to go to poppy tonight.

42:02.060 --> 42:03.060
Right.

42:03.060 --> 42:04.060
You met him in.

42:04.060 --> 42:05.060
What was it?

42:05.060 --> 42:06.060
Milan.

42:07.060 --> 42:08.060
I learned my lesson.

42:08.060 --> 42:09.060
I learned.

42:09.060 --> 42:10.060
Oh, it's not going to be like last time.

42:10.060 --> 42:12.060
She was invited out by who is a Carla.

42:12.060 --> 42:13.060
Carla Claus.

42:13.060 --> 42:14.060
Yeah.

42:14.060 --> 42:15.060
Who else?

42:15.060 --> 42:17.060
But we'll tell them what she did.

42:17.060 --> 42:20.060
Our favorite model slash coder.

42:20.060 --> 42:21.060
Yeah.

42:21.060 --> 42:22.060
So she.

42:22.060 --> 42:23.060
That's the thing.

42:23.060 --> 42:25.060
She should have enough going on to not do what she did to rally,

42:25.060 --> 42:26.060
which was that she poured.

42:26.060 --> 42:28.060
The bottles of champagne into a bowl and then onto you.

42:28.060 --> 42:29.060
Yeah.

42:29.060 --> 42:30.060
Yeah.

42:30.060 --> 42:31.060
And all of you are pretty.

42:31.060 --> 42:32.060
I actually don't want.

42:32.060 --> 42:33.060
Sorry.

42:33.060 --> 42:34.060
You don't want to be pretty.

42:34.060 --> 42:35.060
I wasn't there.

42:36.060 --> 42:37.060
Yeah.

42:37.060 --> 42:38.060
Tonight or today.

42:38.060 --> 42:39.060
I'm just doing work.

42:39.060 --> 42:41.060
I rescheduled an oil change to come be here.

42:41.060 --> 42:43.060
You can do that anytime.

42:43.060 --> 42:44.060
I know.

42:44.060 --> 42:45.060
I was on the boat Daniel.

42:45.060 --> 42:47.060
I was on Daniel call me this morning.

42:47.060 --> 42:49.060
And he's like, are you going to do the headgon podcast?

42:49.060 --> 42:51.060
Like, well, I left my hydroflask at the studio last night.

42:51.060 --> 42:53.060
So I actually have to go back and get it.

42:53.060 --> 42:54.060
And last night,

42:54.060 --> 42:55.060
I was like, oh, do you want to have on the headgon podcast?

42:55.060 --> 42:58.060
And I'm like, ah, an oil change at noon.

42:58.060 --> 43:01.060
And Daniel's like, that is such a stupid fucking excuse.

43:01.060 --> 43:03.060
He's like, I'm like, I've rescheduled it three times.

43:03.060 --> 43:04.060
He's like, you don't know them.

43:05.060 --> 43:06.060
Yeah.

43:06.060 --> 43:07.060
And I was like, jiffy.

43:07.060 --> 43:11.060
I'm like, but honestly, I know I'm like, I'm really tired.

43:11.060 --> 43:12.060
And he was dying.

43:12.060 --> 43:14.060
You have to go tell him that.

43:14.060 --> 43:17.060
That can you really make me mad?

43:17.060 --> 43:19.060
You have to go tell him.

43:19.060 --> 43:21.060
He's like, how much sleep do you get?

43:21.060 --> 43:22.060
Like, eight hours.

43:22.060 --> 43:24.060
Just like, you have to go tell him that you didn't want to go up.

43:24.060 --> 43:25.060
Because you're too sleepy.

43:25.060 --> 43:27.060
You're crazy for that one.

43:27.060 --> 43:32.060
Oh, my god.

43:32.060 --> 43:33.060
Isaac, what do you learn during this?

43:33.060 --> 43:37.060
What do you learn during this whole thing?

43:37.060 --> 43:39.060
You know, I had never rocked.

43:39.060 --> 43:44.060
I did have the thought, because this is like the first thing I've done.

43:44.060 --> 43:46.060
Like, here in the offices and stuff like that.

43:46.060 --> 43:47.060
Yeah.

43:47.060 --> 43:51.060
And it's, I got, I had to came in for like a little bit of a training like a month or so ago.

43:51.060 --> 43:55.060
And I, part of me was thinking, oh, yeah, you know, maybe do this.

43:55.060 --> 43:57.060
Maybe they'll want to like hire you or something like that.

43:57.060 --> 44:02.060
And then my first thing I hear from you is that you want to be an employee as well.

44:03.060 --> 44:06.060
So I don't think either that's going to happen for us.

44:06.060 --> 44:07.060
It is.

44:07.060 --> 44:09.060
I'm not getting benefits.

44:09.060 --> 44:13.060
And it's always fun to, you know, you trap a 25 year old in a room after 13 hours.

44:13.060 --> 44:17.060
They're going to just start trashing everybody around them and.

44:17.060 --> 44:19.060
Wait, what did I say?

44:19.060 --> 44:22.060
Oh, just just seemed like you were like, you were just going after.

44:22.060 --> 44:25.060
You just, you hit a point where you were going after people.

44:25.060 --> 44:29.060
When, when Isaac first got here and got into the room,

44:29.060 --> 44:31.060
you did kind of snap at him.

44:31.060 --> 44:34.060
And be like, I don't even want to look at you.

44:34.060 --> 44:35.060
And that's the joke.

44:35.060 --> 44:40.060
Yeah, I shouldn't have done that because you didn't know you really know why I'm in the tone of the show.

44:40.060 --> 44:41.060
He's a comedian.

44:41.060 --> 44:43.060
He works with comedian.

44:43.060 --> 44:45.060
I know, but I was still rude to your face.

44:45.060 --> 44:48.060
That like four a five a.m.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.060
I'm sorry.

44:49.060 --> 44:50.060
Six a.m.

44:50.060 --> 44:52.060
It was truly nothing personal could have been anyone.

44:52.060 --> 44:55.060
I like to, I liked it too in the morning when you were breaking down.

44:55.060 --> 44:56.060
What's wrong with Hollywood?

44:56.060 --> 44:58.060
What did I say?

44:58.060 --> 45:01.060
I don't just, a lot of, a lot of reboot culture stuff.

45:01.060 --> 45:04.060
A lot of, I don't get enough respect.

45:04.060 --> 45:06.060
I don't even remember this.

45:06.060 --> 45:08.060
I don't remember that.

45:08.060 --> 45:09.060
That's really funny.

45:09.060 --> 45:11.060
Get enough of this.

45:11.060 --> 45:13.060
Hearing it like that is so funny.

45:13.060 --> 45:16.060
After this whole thing was put together.

45:16.060 --> 45:19.060
Ali, what did you learn during this?

45:19.060 --> 45:26.060
Um, I guess I learned that you and I look a lot more alike than I thought.

45:27.060 --> 45:29.060
I don't think it's much else.

45:29.060 --> 45:30.060
Yeah.

45:30.060 --> 45:31.060
It's really more of an essence.

45:31.060 --> 45:32.060
Yeah.

45:32.060 --> 45:34.060
It's a Midwestern sensibility.

45:34.060 --> 45:35.060
I think so.

45:35.060 --> 45:36.060
Yeah.

45:36.060 --> 45:39.060
And anybody wears overalls they could look like.

45:39.060 --> 45:40.060
But it was fun.

45:40.060 --> 45:44.060
I mean, we really like, we had meetings about this for months.

45:44.060 --> 45:45.060
Talking about it.

45:45.060 --> 45:46.060
Talking about it.

45:46.060 --> 45:47.060
I think it together.

45:47.060 --> 45:49.060
I don't understand anyone in my life.

45:49.060 --> 45:50.060
You guys all kept it.

45:50.060 --> 45:52.060
I mean, it wasn't like we picked this date.

45:52.060 --> 45:55.060
And then we were like, okay, eight months from now.

45:56.060 --> 45:57.060
Yeah.

45:57.060 --> 45:58.060
The date was moving.

45:58.060 --> 46:01.060
Well, you picked a live stream where you sort of.

46:01.060 --> 46:03.060
Yeah.

46:03.060 --> 46:04.060
What?

46:04.060 --> 46:06.060
The end of playing.

46:06.060 --> 46:11.060
I meant it truly is like a bullying thing, but it was going to come out of different.

46:11.060 --> 46:13.060
Well, we spent my ass.

46:13.060 --> 46:14.060
Got it.

46:14.060 --> 46:15.060
Okay.

46:15.060 --> 46:16.060
It was for 24 hours.

46:16.060 --> 46:17.060
Yes.

46:17.060 --> 46:18.060
Oh.

46:18.060 --> 46:19.060
Oh.

46:20.060 --> 46:24.060
And with like a vengeance to like not machine that just like that.

46:24.060 --> 46:25.060
I got to go sleep.

46:25.060 --> 46:27.060
So it's just going to keep going.

46:27.060 --> 46:28.060
All right.

46:28.060 --> 46:29.060
Yeah.

46:29.060 --> 46:30.060
You get some shut eye.

46:30.060 --> 46:32.060
Well, this thing spanked my shit.

46:32.060 --> 46:33.060
Oh.

46:33.060 --> 46:34.060
I'm here.

46:34.060 --> 46:35.060
It's not here.

46:35.060 --> 46:37.060
Now I don't feel bad anymore.

46:37.060 --> 46:38.060
Yeah.

46:38.060 --> 46:39.060
I remember.

46:39.060 --> 46:41.060
I think it was on your America.

46:41.060 --> 46:42.060
Or Ali.

46:42.060 --> 46:44.060
It's been so long ago.

46:44.060 --> 46:46.060
Who reached out and was like, hey,

46:46.060 --> 46:49.060
can you hop on a zoom with us to talk?

46:49.060 --> 46:51.060
Like some headgum, creative thing.

46:51.060 --> 46:52.060
Yeah.

46:52.060 --> 46:54.060
I was like, it is at 1099.

46:54.060 --> 46:56.060
I'm like, I'm being included in a work meeting.

46:56.060 --> 46:57.060
Okay.

46:57.060 --> 46:58.060
I'm in play.

46:58.060 --> 46:59.060
Big day.

46:59.060 --> 47:00.060
Big day.

47:00.060 --> 47:05.060
And I was really confused to see you not there.

47:05.060 --> 47:06.060
Yeah.

47:06.060 --> 47:08.060
Because I'm like, oh, it wasn't that meeting.

47:08.060 --> 47:09.060
Yeah.

47:09.060 --> 47:11.060
I was like, I was like, wait.

47:11.060 --> 47:14.060
And my head goes, oh, well, if they're inviting me to a creative meeting,

47:14.060 --> 47:17.060
then it's like, Jeff's going to be there, too.

47:17.060 --> 47:18.060
Yeah.

47:18.060 --> 47:19.060
And you weren't there.

47:19.060 --> 47:20.060
And so that was like, what the fuck?

47:20.060 --> 47:22.060
And then that's my memory.

47:22.060 --> 47:24.060
I remember your face like very scared.

47:24.060 --> 47:25.060
I was nervous.

47:25.060 --> 47:27.060
Because we should have had a screenshot of that.

47:27.060 --> 47:29.060
We put that on the wall as well.

47:29.060 --> 47:30.060
The energy was very much.

47:30.060 --> 47:31.060
Something's going on.

47:31.060 --> 47:33.060
And there's a reason Jeff's not here.

47:33.060 --> 47:34.060
Yeah.

47:34.060 --> 47:36.060
And you didn't know why.

47:36.060 --> 47:38.060
I was really going to be there.

47:38.060 --> 47:39.060
She happened.

47:39.060 --> 47:40.060
Yes.

47:40.060 --> 47:41.060
Yeah.

47:41.060 --> 47:42.060
I thought you were like leaving or something.

47:42.060 --> 47:44.060
Or they were going to tell me that something had happened.

47:44.060 --> 47:46.060
And I think that's the final term.

47:46.060 --> 47:47.060
The final term.

47:47.060 --> 47:50.060
I mean, that's like backlog till forever.

47:50.060 --> 47:51.060
Right.

47:51.060 --> 47:54.060
But that it was as I'm like, oh, amazing.

47:54.060 --> 47:57.060
Sean Spencer said 10 minutes until Riley is 24 hours.

47:57.060 --> 47:59.060
Dream starts.

47:59.060 --> 48:00.060
What'd you do it?

48:00.060 --> 48:01.060
Right now?

48:01.060 --> 48:02.060
No.

48:02.060 --> 48:03.060
I'm too sleepy.

48:03.060 --> 48:05.060
That's kind of where I was yesterday.

48:05.060 --> 48:08.060
And I fucking made it a big thing.

48:08.060 --> 48:10.060
If we sprung us surprise 24 hours,

48:10.060 --> 48:11.060
she went on you.

48:11.060 --> 48:12.060
How would it be?

48:12.060 --> 48:13.060
Very careful.

48:13.060 --> 48:15.060
Be very careful here because he's doing research.

48:15.060 --> 48:16.060
I'd love it.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.060
It would be so fun.

48:17.060 --> 48:18.060
And I'd be happy.

48:18.060 --> 48:19.060
No, I would.

48:19.060 --> 48:21.060
I said before that it's like, I would be.

48:21.060 --> 48:23.060
It'd be like, oh, that's nice for like two hours.

48:23.060 --> 48:26.060
And then I would slowly sink.

48:26.060 --> 48:29.060
I think it should be Riley's all nighter.

48:29.060 --> 48:30.060
And it's just 12 hours.

48:30.060 --> 48:32.060
So you don't have to go through what I just did.

48:32.060 --> 48:35.060
Which is worse than people think it was.

48:35.060 --> 48:37.060
What if this was just a rolling thing.

48:38.060 --> 48:40.060
That it's like every single person.

48:40.060 --> 48:42.060
It's 24 hours a day.

48:42.060 --> 48:45.060
And then you don't know when it's going to be you.

48:45.060 --> 48:46.060
So it's Jeff.

48:46.060 --> 48:49.060
And then, but probes has like 20 plus videos ready to go.

48:49.060 --> 48:50.060
Like Casey.

48:50.060 --> 48:51.060
Damn it.

48:51.060 --> 48:53.060
By the way, only like around 30 employees.

48:53.060 --> 48:56.060
So that means that you would have to do this once a month.

48:56.060 --> 48:58.060
Ha ha ha.

48:58.060 --> 48:59.060
That's not going to work for me.

48:59.060 --> 49:03.060
Marika thoughts on that idea.

49:04.060 --> 49:07.060
Well, you know, how maybe you're an eye friend ship is grown.

49:07.060 --> 49:08.060
You're my friend.

49:08.060 --> 49:11.060
Uh, we can talk about that in a second.

49:11.060 --> 49:19.060
Uh, I do think at one point we had an idea of just having a joint stream cross coast.

49:19.060 --> 49:22.060
So like we could see each other in the offices.

49:22.060 --> 49:24.060
And be able to like wait for that time and talk and stuff.

49:24.060 --> 49:25.060
So it kind of be like that.

49:25.060 --> 49:27.060
Or we just like publicize that.

49:27.060 --> 49:29.060
Our friendship.

49:29.060 --> 49:31.060
I think is great.

49:32.060 --> 49:36.060
I hit a block this morning where I was like Jeff hates us.

49:36.060 --> 49:38.060
And is never going to talk to any of us again.

49:38.060 --> 49:39.060
Which really stressed.

49:39.060 --> 49:40.060
There was like an hour.

49:40.060 --> 49:41.060
I was mad at everybody.

49:41.060 --> 49:42.060
Yeah, of course.

49:42.060 --> 49:45.060
And that's totally within your right.

49:45.060 --> 49:48.060
Not only is that, but it's it feels like it's what this was supposed to be.

49:48.060 --> 49:50.060
Like I needed to have a breaking point.

49:50.060 --> 49:51.060
I had it.

49:51.060 --> 49:53.060
People have already pointed out when it was.

49:53.060 --> 49:55.060
And that's what people wanted.

49:55.060 --> 49:58.060
I don't think that's what I wanted.

49:58.060 --> 50:00.060
None of us wanted.

50:01.060 --> 50:03.060
I don't want the viewers.

50:03.060 --> 50:04.060
Oh, yeah.

50:04.060 --> 50:05.060
Yeah.

50:05.060 --> 50:06.060
That's fair.

50:06.060 --> 50:08.060
But no, but genuinely.

50:08.060 --> 50:09.060
I think we can all agree that we all.

50:09.060 --> 50:11.060
Anybody who is here past midnight.

50:11.060 --> 50:13.060
Well, I guess that's just you.

50:13.060 --> 50:14.060
No, run.

50:14.060 --> 50:15.060
That's your past midnight.

50:15.060 --> 50:16.060
Yeah.

50:16.060 --> 50:17.060
Yeah.

50:17.060 --> 50:18.060
That's Joe fell flat.

50:18.060 --> 50:19.060
Where you can, sorry.

50:19.060 --> 50:20.060
Please continue.

50:20.060 --> 50:21.060
I'm sorry.

50:21.060 --> 50:24.060
No, I was going to say there was a period of time where I was like.

50:24.060 --> 50:29.060
Should we just tell Jeff and he could be in on it.

50:30.060 --> 50:33.060
And then we decided ultimately.

50:33.060 --> 50:34.060
But I believe.

50:34.060 --> 50:35.060
Yeah.

50:35.060 --> 50:36.060
I'm glad we didn't say.

50:36.060 --> 50:38.060
If you had known, would you have done it?

50:38.060 --> 50:39.060
Oh, yeah.

50:39.060 --> 50:40.060
I still would have done it.

50:40.060 --> 50:41.060
He talked about that all night.

50:41.060 --> 50:43.060
He's like, just a week notice.

50:43.060 --> 50:44.060
Right.

50:44.060 --> 50:46.060
Would have helped him.

50:46.060 --> 50:47.060
And then we didn't want that.

50:47.060 --> 50:48.060
I know.

50:48.060 --> 50:50.060
This is good content.

50:50.060 --> 50:51.060
And now that we're.

50:51.060 --> 50:52.060
So really.

50:52.060 --> 50:53.060
10 minutes.

50:53.060 --> 50:54.060
Oh my god.

50:54.060 --> 50:55.060
13.

50:55.060 --> 50:56.060
13.

50:56.060 --> 50:57.060
Okay.

50:57.060 --> 50:58.060
Now there were 13 minutes away.

50:58.060 --> 50:59.060
But like great about it.

50:59.060 --> 51:00.060
Because it's fucking over.

51:00.060 --> 51:01.060
Yeah.

51:01.060 --> 51:02.060
Yeah.

51:02.060 --> 51:03.060
I was worried.

51:03.060 --> 51:06.060
I think Hedgum should buy me a Rolex.

51:06.060 --> 51:08.060
You got it, babe.

51:08.060 --> 51:09.060
No.

51:09.060 --> 51:10.060
You're saying no.

51:10.060 --> 51:12.060
I'm going to go do it.

51:12.060 --> 51:13.060
No, no, no.

51:13.060 --> 51:15.060
Sure cocktail.

51:15.060 --> 51:17.060
That's what you want for me.

51:17.060 --> 51:18.060
Another one.

51:18.060 --> 51:19.060
No.

51:19.060 --> 51:20.060
Just saying.

51:20.060 --> 51:21.060
Whatever.

51:21.060 --> 51:22.060
You could tell.

51:22.060 --> 51:24.060
I was worried that you were not going to.

51:24.060 --> 51:26.060
Like you were going to say no.

51:26.060 --> 51:33.060
And like the plan was to still have like all these segments going and like either way,

51:33.060 --> 51:36.060
even if I said either way, we would have made something work.

51:36.060 --> 51:41.060
But but what I wanted to do was if you said no, we just.

51:41.060 --> 51:42.060
You can't.

51:42.060 --> 51:43.060
You can't make my ass.

51:43.060 --> 51:44.060
Yeah.

51:44.060 --> 51:45.060
For 24 hours.

51:45.060 --> 51:48.060
Uh, then we just leave the cameras running in the empty room.

51:48.060 --> 51:49.060
With this.

51:49.060 --> 51:50.060
I agree.

51:50.060 --> 51:51.060
For 24 hours.

51:51.060 --> 51:52.060
For 24 hours.

51:52.060 --> 51:53.060
To the comments.

51:53.060 --> 51:54.060
All throughout the day.

51:54.060 --> 51:55.060
My god.

51:55.060 --> 51:58.060
Oh.

51:58.060 --> 52:00.060
Ali, how has it been being Jeff?

52:00.060 --> 52:01.060
It's felt good.

52:01.060 --> 52:02.060
Yeah.

52:02.060 --> 52:03.060
It's like you'll write.

52:03.060 --> 52:04.060
Yeah.

52:04.060 --> 52:05.060
Yeah.

52:05.060 --> 52:06.060
You know, I've.

52:06.060 --> 52:07.060
Oh, yeah.

52:07.060 --> 52:08.060
It's been a new perspective.

52:08.060 --> 52:09.060
And it has been fun.

52:09.060 --> 52:10.060
Being.

52:10.060 --> 52:12.060
I've never been a stand-in or a body double before.

52:12.060 --> 52:13.060
Mm-hmm.

52:13.060 --> 52:15.060
And I do feel like speaking of acting.

52:15.060 --> 52:17.060
That is step one to getting in the biz.

52:17.060 --> 52:18.060
A hundred percent.

52:18.060 --> 52:20.060
And like putting yourself in his shoes.

52:20.060 --> 52:21.060
So it's like, what is it like?

52:21.060 --> 52:22.060
I guess like stepping into the mind.

52:22.060 --> 52:23.060
The mind.

52:23.060 --> 52:24.060
And I follow up to that.

52:24.060 --> 52:25.060
Uh-huh.

52:25.060 --> 52:26.060
I think it first.

52:26.060 --> 52:27.060
I was worried.

52:27.060 --> 52:28.060
Fine of questioning.

52:28.060 --> 52:30.060
My point of view is it.

52:30.060 --> 52:31.060
Like I was worried about.

52:31.060 --> 52:34.060
If I do I have to come up with like.

52:34.060 --> 52:35.060
Mean.

52:35.060 --> 52:36.060
Mean spirited.

52:36.060 --> 52:37.060
Just.

52:37.060 --> 52:38.060
As Jeff.

52:38.060 --> 52:39.060
It was almost too meta.

52:39.060 --> 52:40.060
Like Jeff.

52:40.060 --> 52:41.060
Jeff.

52:41.060 --> 52:42.060
Jeff.

52:42.060 --> 52:43.060
Jeff.

52:43.060 --> 52:44.060
Jeff.

52:44.060 --> 52:45.060
Jeff.

52:45.060 --> 52:46.060
Jeff.

52:46.060 --> 52:47.060
Jeff.

52:47.060 --> 52:48.060
Jeff.

52:48.060 --> 52:49.060
Jeff.

52:49.060 --> 52:50.060
Jeff.

52:50.060 --> 52:51.060
Jeff.

52:51.060 --> 52:52.060
Jeff.

52:52.060 --> 52:53.060
Jeff.

52:53.060 --> 52:54.060
And then my own mind.

52:54.060 --> 52:55.060
Yeah.

52:55.060 --> 52:57.060
And it becomes the mindset blurred.

52:57.060 --> 52:58.060
Yeah.

52:58.060 --> 53:03.060
You could actually become Jeff or like become the Jeff presence.

53:03.060 --> 53:06.060
Well, and going home was hard because I'm still in the overall.

53:06.060 --> 53:07.060
Well, it's a no.

53:07.060 --> 53:09.060
When you left the studio.

53:09.060 --> 53:12.060
I did the you took the character of Jeff with you.

53:12.060 --> 53:13.060
No.

53:13.060 --> 53:15.060
You can't take it with you, but I took Jeff with me.

53:15.060 --> 53:16.060
Mm-hmm.

53:16.060 --> 53:17.060
Interesting.

53:17.060 --> 53:20.060
And I was just like, it was hard to shake off.

53:20.060 --> 53:21.060
The.

53:21.060 --> 53:22.060
The.

53:22.060 --> 53:23.060
Who will talk about looking at with you for there.

53:23.060 --> 53:25.060
You can't just get teate it with me.

53:25.060 --> 53:26.060
The.

53:26.060 --> 53:28.060
But, what do you go to.

53:28.060 --> 53:29.060
Jeff, with me.

53:29.060 --> 53:31.060
Oh, she said you can't take it with you, Casey.

53:31.060 --> 53:34.060
I can't take it with you.

53:34.060 --> 53:35.060
Lisa.

53:35.060 --> 53:37.060
You can't take it with you.

53:37.060 --> 53:38.060
You can't take it with you.

53:38.060 --> 53:40.060
But you you can't, Jeff.

53:40.060 --> 53:41.060
Jeff with me.

53:41.060 --> 53:42.060
With to see.

53:42.060 --> 53:44.060
You can't take it with you.

53:44.060 --> 53:46.060
Put her in the circle really like it.

53:46.060 --> 53:50.060
She's saying you can't take it with you, Casey.

53:50.060 --> 53:57.660
You can't take it with you, but I can take it with me.

53:57.660 --> 54:01.660
It was three in the morning and I met my own house and I go to the bathroom and I look

54:01.660 --> 54:04.300
in the mirror and I'm like, you're not jet.

54:04.300 --> 54:06.300
I also like, sorry, now we're just like taking it.

54:06.300 --> 54:08.460
It's like one like horror right now.

54:08.460 --> 54:10.460
I'm like horror.

54:10.460 --> 54:17.500
This is such a small thing, but referring to being at home is I was at my own house.

54:18.460 --> 54:20.860
It's like the darn best thing.

54:20.860 --> 54:23.020
I was like, my own house, we can believe it.

54:23.020 --> 54:26.780
And you're at home, you're at home, you're at home.

54:26.780 --> 54:28.220
Yeah, I was at my own house.

54:28.220 --> 54:31.100
Is it my own goddamn bedroom to go fucking with you?

54:31.100 --> 54:34.700
Yeah, I'm like, yeah, I just want to, I want the viewers to know I'm not crashing somewhere.

54:34.700 --> 54:37.740
I have, I have a place that it's, and I pay rent.

54:37.740 --> 54:39.180
That's cool.

54:39.180 --> 54:41.180
It's nice.

54:41.180 --> 54:45.420
Charlie Ashbees says, do you now understand the plight of the jet?

54:45.500 --> 54:49.020
You know, yeah, well, I think I've understood the reality of man.

54:49.020 --> 54:51.660
Yeah, I mean, Jeff and I have known each other for a long time.

54:51.660 --> 54:53.500
Now, we've been working together for years.

54:53.500 --> 54:53.820
Yeah.

54:53.820 --> 54:57.660
We've always, I've, we've been making your life harder.

54:57.660 --> 54:58.940
Not really.

54:58.940 --> 55:01.340
Maybe just chasing, but it doesn't bother me.

55:01.340 --> 55:08.620
If anything, I have to, I, I, me as an ally, I have to work through just general day-to-day

55:08.620 --> 55:11.500
as my job is not feeling like I'm a narc.

55:11.580 --> 55:15.740
I don't want it. My biggest fear is being annoying, and so when I do follow up or

55:15.740 --> 55:17.820
whatever, I like, you know, you two chime in to be annoying.

55:17.820 --> 55:18.460
OK.

55:18.460 --> 55:22.300
I'm annoying because uh, Alf and I don't respond to alleys emails.

55:22.300 --> 55:23.820
Nearly fast enough as we should.

55:23.820 --> 55:25.100
No, no, no, no, no, you guys aren't.

55:25.100 --> 55:28.300
You don't know where I go, Matt, you, I never know which is which.

55:28.300 --> 55:32.700
What do you think is my hard to respond is the server?

55:33.500 --> 55:35.020
Big laugh from Emma.

55:37.740 --> 55:41.020
We, we, we at least, we have to like, plan scheduling like a day's, but you,

55:41.020 --> 55:45.020
So that's why it takes us a little bit of time, but you think it's hard because you're like, it's at head gum or at Gmail.

55:45.020 --> 55:48.460
I don't think it's like, oh wait, G, H.

55:48.460 --> 55:50.220
That's hard for Jeff, for sure.

55:50.220 --> 55:53.020
Right. I mean, Miles gave proof.

55:53.020 --> 55:55.660
Yeah. How much longer?

55:56.780 --> 55:57.580
Eight minutes.

55:57.580 --> 55:58.380
Beautiful.

55:59.740 --> 56:01.500
If you want to be true, do the time.

56:02.220 --> 56:02.780
Yeah.

56:02.780 --> 56:06.060
Yeah, yeah, I want to be true to the time.

56:06.060 --> 56:06.860
I'm not calling.

56:06.860 --> 56:09.260
We got to be true. We got to be true the time.

56:09.260 --> 56:11.020
You're called Jeff's call and Jeff's.

56:11.020 --> 56:12.380
We are true to the time.

56:12.380 --> 56:13.340
We're true to the time.

56:13.340 --> 56:13.980
True the time.

56:17.580 --> 56:19.580
Do we want to do another rhythm of the rice?

56:20.140 --> 56:23.660
Yeah, I think I think we should close it out maybe with a group that's a bit of the rice.

56:24.220 --> 56:24.620
Okay.

56:24.620 --> 56:25.980
Which of course.

56:26.780 --> 56:27.500
For eight minutes.

56:27.500 --> 56:28.540
Is it actually eight?

56:28.540 --> 56:32.140
No, I'll give us a, I'll let us know when we're ready.

56:32.140 --> 56:32.540
Okay.

56:34.540 --> 56:38.540
Yeah, wait, so what if the minute we hit 24 hours,

56:38.540 --> 56:41.500
even you start the song and then we just go out with that.

56:42.300 --> 56:43.500
Yeah, let's do that.

56:43.500 --> 56:44.060
Great.

56:44.060 --> 56:46.060
I saw when I got home last time.

56:46.060 --> 56:47.100
When I got to my own house, let's say.

56:49.100 --> 56:53.500
I was pounding some chocolate chips from a bag.

56:53.500 --> 56:55.900
And I love doing a lot of the best thing ever.

56:55.900 --> 56:57.340
And I put our lemon cream for a bit.

56:57.340 --> 56:59.420
And it was, it was another rhythm of the rice.

56:59.420 --> 57:01.100
And so I forget it was something that comes with like,

57:01.100 --> 57:02.140
this is a reward.

57:03.740 --> 57:04.780
This is a reward.

57:04.780 --> 57:06.380
That's so funny.

57:07.100 --> 57:08.140
It was so funny.

57:08.140 --> 57:11.900
I was like, I went to my own home and

57:14.140 --> 57:15.020
I was on the computer.

57:15.020 --> 57:17.500
Like, one AM, one of the rhythm of the rice.

57:17.500 --> 57:18.380
This was happening.

57:18.380 --> 57:22.300
And it was just everyone in the chat, spamming rice.

57:22.300 --> 57:24.380
And I could not stop laughing.

57:24.380 --> 57:25.580
It was so funny.

57:25.580 --> 57:27.020
So fucking funny.

57:27.020 --> 57:28.860
The hive mind of nonsense.

57:28.860 --> 57:30.860
We're getting a lot of rice spamming the chat right now.

57:30.860 --> 57:34.460
Yeah, the people are, the people can't wait for the rice.

57:34.460 --> 57:35.020
I love rice.

57:35.820 --> 57:37.260
We should do an Indian hour.

57:38.540 --> 57:39.020
A what?

57:40.620 --> 57:41.500
Exactly.

57:41.500 --> 57:42.460
An Indian hour.

57:42.460 --> 57:45.660
I need to be with my brothers and sisters.

57:45.660 --> 57:46.620
I don't know what you're saying.

57:46.620 --> 57:48.140
I think he said Indian hour.

57:48.140 --> 57:48.940
Oh.

57:48.940 --> 57:50.540
I advise that an Indian, I'm like,

57:50.540 --> 57:52.620
watch an Indian film every hour.

57:54.620 --> 57:57.820
Indian, Indian hour, an Indian Indian hour.

57:57.820 --> 57:59.340
An Indian Indian hour.

57:59.340 --> 58:01.580
And we'll segregate the room, whites and browns.

58:02.380 --> 58:03.580
Just like my lawn.

58:04.620 --> 58:05.500
Nice.

58:05.500 --> 58:06.620
The fuck is wrong with you.

58:06.620 --> 58:07.660
We're getting it right.

58:07.660 --> 58:09.340
It's spamming chat with rice.

58:09.340 --> 58:10.940
It's spamming chat with rice.

58:10.940 --> 58:12.140
We're getting a lot of rice.

58:12.940 --> 58:14.140
Yeah, she'll take the rice.

58:14.860 --> 58:16.300
It's spamming the chat with rice.

58:16.940 --> 58:17.900
You earned it.

58:17.900 --> 58:18.300
Yeah.

58:18.300 --> 58:18.940
What's that?

58:19.660 --> 58:20.700
You earned it.

58:20.700 --> 58:21.900
The rice spam.

58:21.900 --> 58:22.700
Ha ha ha.

58:22.700 --> 58:23.900
You're the right person.

58:23.900 --> 58:25.900
You heard it.

58:25.900 --> 58:26.300
Yeah.

58:26.300 --> 58:28.540
I was really, it was more normal than that.

58:28.540 --> 58:30.060
I just want to tie it to nail it.

58:30.060 --> 58:31.100
No, you should take it.

58:32.060 --> 58:33.020
Jeff, I would.

58:33.020 --> 58:36.860
I would like now that we are closing in on the final minutes.

58:36.860 --> 58:37.340
Yeah.

58:37.340 --> 58:42.220
I would love to hear your, your final thoughts on this whole ordeal.

58:42.220 --> 58:44.220
I think Jake and I are cowards.

58:44.220 --> 58:46.460
Marty, I didn't expect to be a part of this really at all.

58:46.460 --> 58:49.100
So he actually over delivered by being in it at all.

58:49.100 --> 58:51.900
I think Jake and I are cowards for starting it and then never returning.

58:51.900 --> 58:54.060
I mean, returned like what 15 minutes afterwards.

58:54.060 --> 58:55.020
It was kind of stupid.

58:55.020 --> 58:56.940
And honestly, that was supposed to be Jake.

58:56.940 --> 58:57.660
Exactly.

58:57.660 --> 59:00.540
So shout out everyone else other than Jake and I was.

59:00.860 --> 59:03.740
Okay, in Jake's defense, he had to go rescue a cat.

59:03.740 --> 59:04.620
What does that mean?

59:04.620 --> 59:07.900
It means that there was a cat that needed help and he went to go help it.

59:07.900 --> 59:09.580
What does that, that takes one ten minutes?

59:09.580 --> 59:11.180
The person to go rescue the cat.

59:11.180 --> 59:13.020
Because someone said, someone asked him to.

59:13.020 --> 59:14.780
They said, hey, there's a tree.

59:14.780 --> 59:18.940
No, there was a Emily and Murph from NAPOD.

59:19.580 --> 59:25.020
Rescue like stray cats and like help, you know, like take them off the street and

59:25.020 --> 59:26.140
and they know it.

59:26.140 --> 59:28.380
They tapped Jake for somehow.

59:28.380 --> 59:29.180
That's right.

59:29.180 --> 59:30.140
I don't know.

59:30.220 --> 59:31.020
Because he's in town.

59:31.740 --> 59:32.860
Because he's in town.

59:32.860 --> 59:34.220
I see some funny houses.

59:34.220 --> 59:35.500
Why Jake couldn't be here for your people?

59:35.500 --> 59:37.340
No, he was like, I got to go help a cat.

59:37.340 --> 59:39.100
I really thought that they would be at the end.

59:40.140 --> 59:41.900
That hurts my feelings.

59:41.900 --> 59:44.540
Yeah, it did seem like you were playing.

59:44.540 --> 59:47.100
When you were calling a mirror like an hour ago,

59:47.100 --> 59:49.580
was you're not showing up for the end of this?

59:49.580 --> 59:50.780
You want to call him again?

59:50.780 --> 59:52.300
No, I'm mad at him.

59:52.300 --> 59:56.700
Well, I think because what I heard was that a mirror pitch this in a content meeting.

59:56.700 --> 59:57.820
So this was his shit.

59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.300
So that's fucked up.

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.860
Yeah, he did pitch surprising.

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:03.580
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.180
So I think that's fucked up.

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:09.180
Ultimately, this is good because it just gets us in your favor.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:11.180
Because we're here.

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:14.780
That's what I was going to say is we need a head gun podcast tour

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:17.340
because this.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:18.300
Yeah, I agree.

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:18.780
Yeah.

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:20.060
And what we can talk about the road.

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:23.500
Tell us in the chat where the head gun podcast tour should go.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.300
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:28.140
Tell us, no, also Jeff, uh, raise your rate.

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:30.380
I don't know how to do this.

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:31.900
Just you can.

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:33.580
I can't just do that.

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:34.700
I need to ask for a raise.

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:40.460
I think you can, I think you can, you can raise your rate.

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:42.060
You can say that you want to feel fair.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:44.860
That's how I was off here right now.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.100
Yeah, and just no, definitely.

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:52.220
If you could do 50 an hour for the sketches for, okay.

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:55.900
Well, maybe 75 because you kind of took to it pretty easily.

01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:00.060
We're getting a lot of locations for the head gun podcast tour.

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:00.940
Jeff, can I say something?

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:02.780
I forgot we were like, okay, do something.

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:04.540
Uh, yeah.

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:06.220
Also none of that was real.

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:10.620
Well, um, I had to get to believe you're, you did it.

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:11.420
You did it, buddy.

01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:12.540
Yeah, yeah, I'm really glad.

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:13.740
None of us, but we didn't.

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:14.780
No, thank you.

01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:16.060
You didn't want out of any moment.

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:16.780
You did it.

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.300
And we raised over $1,000.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.100
That's your career.

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:19.500
Rattable.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:19.980
We did.

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:20.860
That was awesome.

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:22.140
Double.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:22.780
We doubled it.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:24.380
That's a pretty amazing.

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.700
I will, I will say, Jay Australia was me.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.060
And I don't knock it for the money.

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:31.580
Jay Australia didn't donated like $700.

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:32.380
That's insane.

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.980
That's your Derbert treatment.

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:34.620
Yeah, shoot man.

01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:36.780
Delbert Delbert, Delbert, shoot man.

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:39.660
Good friend of mine.

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:40.460
Yeah.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.100
Um, yeah.

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:42.940
Oh, some people are saying come to Brazil.

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:43.100
Come to Brazil.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.220
Come to Brazil.

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.100
Come to Brazil.

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:45.740
Jesus.

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.140
I've always wanted to be told to come to Brazil.

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.540
So this is, I love that we've done that before.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.540
On your years ago, come to Brazil.

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:56.140
Like, really earnest and soft, and they don't actually go.

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:00.300
Do you want me to go to all of our hometowns?

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.100
Home town, head go.

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:03.340
Chicago, LA.

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:03.980
That one's easy.

01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:05.260
Cleveland, Cleveland.

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:05.820
Santa Vanna.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:07.180
Old Springs, Florida.

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:10.220
Yeah, let's just do Boston to want to go.

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:10.620
Where?

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:11.260
Moscow.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.420
Oh, my god.

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:14.140
My god.

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:17.820
I think now's a good time to go there.

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:18.300
So what is it?

01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:18.860
Tampa Bay?

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:19.500
It's good.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:19.980
Miami.

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:20.940
Miami.

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:21.260
Miami.

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:22.220
Crossbrings, Florida.

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.660
Poppy could be a Miami real quick.

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:26.780
That's a great run.

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:29.340
Where'd you run?

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:29.900
Wisconsin.

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:30.700
Really?

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:31.340
Green Bay?

01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:32.060
Uh, no.

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:32.380
Buck.

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:33.980
Who clear?

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:34.380
No.

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:35.180
Buck.

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:35.580
Appleton.

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:38.380
Those are like, through all three of those places.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:39.660
Like, the same exact location.

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:42.860
That's so funny.

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:44.220
Where is this Monday?

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.100
Killing me.

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:45.820
Where?

01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:47.100
Racine, Wisconsin.

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:47.660
Oh, yeah.

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:48.460
Home of Anacar.

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:49.660
What?

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:51.020
The Watch Company, Anacar.

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:52.620
Oh, I see John, a lot of come.

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:53.180
S.E. John says.

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:56.540
I think Anacar is racing, spelled backwards.

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.220
And it's a really good watch company.

01:02:58.220 --> 01:02:58.780
Really?

01:02:58.780 --> 01:02:59.020
Yeah.

01:02:59.020 --> 01:02:59.420
Yeah.

01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:00.540
Head gum.

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:01.420
A family company.

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:02.380
There's no way.

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.580
That's a red flag.

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:06.220
After referencing all of each other's

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:07.420
spanking each other's ass?

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:09.260
You were the only one who was ever known.

01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:09.740
That was the year.

01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:11.260
We were all.

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:12.060
That was the power stream.

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.260
Well, you're spanking my heart.

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.060
No.

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:16.380
I already know I'm not going to win it here, folks.

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:21.740
Uh, this is it.

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.340
I'm not going to let the lyrics go.

01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:24.940
After this, I need to call my parents and say,

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.300
I'm not going to meet up with them tonight.

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:29.340
Like I said, I would because I am dead inside.

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:33.820
I can't believe that I can look up the rhythm of the rice.

01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:34.460
And it's been.

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:37.580
I mean, you don't need as people to add meaning.

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:39.020
You know, you can't.

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:39.660
Yeah.

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:40.380
I can't attend.

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:41.420
What do you use?

01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:44.300
What do you mean by big rice to burn to me?

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.380
I'm biating into rice.

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.100
This is the rhythm of the rice.

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:52.140
This is the rice.

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:53.340
Oh, the rice.

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:54.140
The consistency.

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:54.860
Oh, yeah.

01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:55.980
I can't see that.

01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:58.220
The rhythm of the rice.

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:00.220
This is the rhythm of my five.

01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:01.100
My five.

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:01.820
My five.

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:02.220
My five.

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:02.860
My five.

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:04.060
Oh, yeah.

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.020
I'm not going to eat the rice.

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:07.820
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:15.260
Sing along if you know the words you should buy now.

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:17.820
How many times did it happen?

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:20.620
20 pounds.

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:22.060
Every year, every 500.

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:26.220
Oh, you've got to put some sort of on my plate.

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:30.220
Oh, sushi and trendy ways.

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:32.220
Thank you.

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:35.900
My three words, two, and they've all eaten rice today.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:36.460
It's amazing.

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:37.100
It's amazing.

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:37.420
It's amazing.

01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:38.220
It's amazing.

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.100
It's amazing.

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.260
Oh, I can't eat all of your grains.

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:45.100
Feel you give me rice again.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.140
Round it round right.

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:49.340
Go, eat the rice.

01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:49.820
My five.

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:50.540
He's right.

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.340
Wait.

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.940
This is the rhythm of the rice.

01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:56.940
Oh, rice.

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:58.380
Oh, yeah.

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:01.180
The rhythm of the rice.

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:01.980
Oh, yeah.

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:04.220
This is the rhythm of my five.

01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:05.420
My five.

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:06.220
My five.

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:07.020
My five.

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:07.820
Oh, yeah.

01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:11.020
I'm here at times the rice.

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:12.620
So long if you know the words.

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.500
You're moving the phone so much.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.460
It's amazing.

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:20.060
I'm eating wrong rice taste.

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.300
My favorite lines coming up.

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:27.580
Oh, yeah, let's say.

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:29.900
How would you teach me to eat some rice?

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:34.460
I promise you would love to find some rice.

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:35.500
Oh, here it is.

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.500
Taste better than ice.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:40.140
It's consistency of sand.

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:44.940
I don't want to be with that rice.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.940
But you'll be rice that be nice.

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:52.700
Take me out and die.

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.860
There's only one in a place.

01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:55.660
Where's the coffee?

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:56.860
It's called on coffee.

01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.620
The rhythm of the rice.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.620
Oh, rice.

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:02.140
Oh, yeah.

01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.940
The rhythm of rice.

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:07.740
This is the rhythm of my five.

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:09.740
My five.

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:11.500
Oh, yeah.

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:14.380
I learned to play the five.

01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:17.340
The rhythm of the rice.

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.340
The rice.

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:20.940
Oh, yeah.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.980
The rhythm of the rice.

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.860
This is the rhythm of my strength.

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.780
My strength.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.220
Oh, yeah.

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:33.340
I don't like my life.

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.820
Then it's supposed to cut out, right?

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:39.980
Let me look fuck out of here.

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:45.660
Three.

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.300
Thanks for watching everybody.

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:06.860
That was a hit-dum original.

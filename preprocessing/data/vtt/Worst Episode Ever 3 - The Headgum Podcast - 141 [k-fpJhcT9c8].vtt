WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
What are you guys' greatest strengths?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Couldn't hear the theme song.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
I know we started playing.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Yeah.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
What are you guys' greatest strengths?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm good at reading people.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
That's not true.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Really?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
I think Marieka sounds.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
And then you did.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
So not I was gonna.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I just think that in addition to Marieka and Ali,

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
I'm pretty fine at assessing social situations.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
I was the first one to note that.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Yeah, I do.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Yeah.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
That's not reading people. That's hearing a sound or not.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Then fucking algebra.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
And are you good at seventh grade math?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Can you solve for C?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
I think so.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Damn, Daniel!

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
What energy are you bringing to this today, Jeffrey?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
I'm scattered.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
I'm spread across too many items.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Then just like, yeah.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
What do you have for the rest of the day?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I don't want to talk about it.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
What did you do yesterday?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Glad you asked.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Why, we don't have to talk about me.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
All right, I'm just the host. Why don't we talk about you?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
What do you guys have going on?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
What's that?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
I think we're just concerned.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
I'm fine.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
It's like the image of me is that I'm always falling apart at the scenes.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Like it's all fine.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Like this is on the books.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
We're recording the episode.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
I have some shit planned.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Let's just do that.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Let's get through that.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Let's make it through the day in one piece.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Okay.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Okay.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Okay.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Okay.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Ali, can I ask what the calendar is behind you?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Oh, my God.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
It's her beefly loaded.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
That's what my thought was going to be.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Yes.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Wow.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
I truly just from the bottom half.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
I was like, I think this is from her beefly loaded.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
It isn't too bad.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
It's a 2006 calendar.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
It's the price.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
It's the best thing I've ever bought on eBay.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
I love that.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
Also, we're same director as the director of depths.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Continue, Jeff.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
So, guys.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
What's the worst thing you've ever bought on eBay?

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Oh, you know, the saddest thing I ever bought on eBay.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
And it's sad because I bought Titanic the board game.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
And is there any way you can win that board game without like drowning?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
If you're first class.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Okay.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
So it's just about how much money you have.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
It's basically the game of life.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Well, I never got to play it.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
It got delivered to the wrong address.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
And it was like sincerely of bummer.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
I was really excited about all the intricate pieces.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
I would be too.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I'm here to pay attention.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I remember I used to play board games with my buddy growing up.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
But we were like nine.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
So his older sister would have to read the rules and explain it to us.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Like at age nine, you don't know how the board games work.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
That was actually kind of a...

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Yeah.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yeah.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
It's like full and authentic.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
But treasently.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
One time.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
We're paying attention.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
She was reading the instruction.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Almost herself.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Almost herself.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yeah.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
And then I'm like, okay.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
So what are the rules?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
30 year old girls?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
That's the thing when you're 30 months.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
It doesn't really matter.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
It doesn't really matter.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Can we just fight?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
What other people's adding?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
He's sort of had that angst.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
But like I was working.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
I was working.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
About to understand the rules of a board game at age nine.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Yeah.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
I'd be like, okay.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Now it's hard.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
It's hard to like, yeah.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Right.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
You need an adult.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
I'm just like, to hurt.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
To me, like, this 13 year old girl was the adult.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
But I was hoping she was reading it to herself and would now

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
like, like, like, synthesize the information and explain it to me.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I was just like, no, that was it.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I have fun playing the game.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Well, I didn't really understand the game because you were sort of muttering to yourself,

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
reading it to yourself.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Right.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
And the hard part is that, like, when you're nine and a 13 year old,

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
like you said, is an adult.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
But like, because, like, a 13 year old can babysit a nine year old, right?

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
But ultimately, like, if they didn't care enough to explain the rules to you,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
it is all mute, right?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Yeah.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Yeah.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
You're.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
I don't know.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
You're like a dating, I think.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
How do you figure?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
What do you mean?

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
You're just sort of replaying what I told you without actually,

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
actually adding anything to the conversation.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
You're just, and also barely even synchronizing what you're saying.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Yeah.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Exactly.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
It's very, like, shallow.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
And then it's like right back at me.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
And then the one question you had, the follow-up,

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
was just right question mark, which is not really a question.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
You're just asking me if I was telling the truth.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Fuck.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Let's.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
So no second data mirror.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
I mean, I'm down to hang out at, as friends,

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
going forward.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Up.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Up.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Up.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
This is the core for it.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Don't fucking blow it.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
The bottom of the week is George Santos.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Okay.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Because he, he's an Ivy League.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Which iteration?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Current.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Like today's George Santos.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
He's a master of duplicity.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
So I think he'd be a good spy.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
And he could get the physical training.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
That's the easy part.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
All you have to do is what?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Do a couple of setups.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
He's a jack of all trades and a master of duplicity.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
He's a jack of all trades and a master of duplicity.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Give me Adrian Wojdorowski in a fedora.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
He's looking slow.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
He's looking tan.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
He's looking right.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
It's got inside information.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
What is the NBA tread deadline.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
But spying on one another.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
He's already an international super spy of sorts.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Hmm.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Marika.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Adrian Brody.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Oh, two agents.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Yeah.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Yeah.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
What about this for James Bond?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Adrian.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
Sylvester Stallone, or just you doing an impression of Rocky as James Bond?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Okay.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
I'm going to do Adrian Maloof from Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 1.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Triple Adrian.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
What?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Shut up.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
What are you talking to?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
You.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I want more from Ali and Marika.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
They barely said anything.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
You've barely let us.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
I've barely.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I barely said anything.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
That's part of why this episode sucks.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Amir has been taking up the most space.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
And he's not letting any of us get a word in edge wise.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
You guys talk.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
I don't want to talk today.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
You guys fucking talk.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
The space is there.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Take it.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
I can offer this space.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
But if you don't take it, then no one says anything.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
And then it's about episode.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
I'm tired of everybody saying that I'm the reason why this is such a hard show to guest on.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
It's actually pretty fucking easy if you have the goal.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Ryan?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Who?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Nevermind.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
She's like right there.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Why didn't anybody say anything?

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
I think we're just digesting too much.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
So I'm not.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
I don't feel comfortable in this space.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
I don't feel comfortable in this space.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
I don't feel like you weren't welcome in this space.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
You also didn't sort of like present any content.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Present any content.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Yeah.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
There's nothing to talk about.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Yeah.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
And then it's like people get worried because depending on what they bring up, I might jump down the throat.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Correct.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Right.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Per popular mechanic, scientists just discovered a literal hell.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Located at.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Los Angeles, California.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Can't save my address.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
I'll be asleep.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Everybody.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
No, but they did detect a new molten layer of earth.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
About a hundred miles beneath the surface.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Ali, what do you think?

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
Sounds like you got to get a guy to come and check out and check it out.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Nice.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
That made me think of.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I yourself.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
That's really good.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Yeah.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
I feel like that.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Or not.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Not for some reason.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
I didn't.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
That just wasn't.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
That wasn't something I wanted to hear.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Okay.

10:09.000 --> 10:16.000
Do you guys remember when someone in New York fell into a pit full of rats?

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
It was like they fell into one of those.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Like, I don't know.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Like, basement opening things that's on the street.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
And it was full of rats.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Oh my god.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
To me, that's the new layer of hell.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
Remember when they put Ben Marger and a truck full of snakes?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Who?

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
I honestly don't care.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Do you?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
No.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Nice.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
What?

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
You know, the Milania reference, right?

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
I don't know.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I like that joke.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
I remember that coat.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
That's a kind of thing.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
It looked like that.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
It was last step.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Last steps, everyone.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
I've got about half left.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
What is that?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
A Budweiser heavy?

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Polar, cranberry lime.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
How's the office today?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Good.

11:23.000 --> 11:30.000
Got in, Mike, and I did some light construction work on our desks.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Immediately.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Oh yeah.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
You took down a little divider.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
It was way harder than it should have been.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
But we both had to crawl on the floor.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
It was a whole thing.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Never hear.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
It's good.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
It was nice to see the space a couple weeks ago.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Shot some videos, had some meetings.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
A lot of podcasts and going on and there.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Yeah, lots going on.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
It was fun having a lot of people in the office.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
This is like a fun topic of conversation.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
We sort of, oh, we can't hear you Jeff.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
We brought together.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
It's your own company.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
It took you a year to get to the New York office after moving in.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
So let's just, that says a lot about your leadership style.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
You're not willing to go cross country because what you think New York is like hard to exist in

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
because you've been spoiled by, by the way, living at,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
there's can't say that.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Sorry.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Yeah.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
I just, I'm just saying I would, I would have a different leadership style.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Yeah.

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
And I'm just saying you would never be a leader because you can't even host a podcast.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
An expensive invasive new cosmetic surgery can help you grow on three to six inches taller.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
However, it requires breaking both females.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
We talked about this before.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
I saw a Ripley's believe it or not segment about this years ago.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
It's so, it's crazy.

12:58.000 --> 13:06.000
It's a, it's also I recently found out a medical procedure to help people even out their legs.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
Like, I guess Rivers Cuomo, the lead singer of Wieser, had this done because he had one leg.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
That was like one to two inches shorter than the other.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
So they had to break his bone insert a pole and then like it would stretch a little bit.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Then the bone would grow stretch a little bit.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
But it's like incredibly time consuming and painful.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
So to do it, just to add height is kind of crazy.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
Yeah, but don't you think that that was him trying to like do like the deviated, deviated septum excuse?

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Like, I'm pretty sure he's like out of nowhere.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Four or six five.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Like, he did that for the height.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
But then he blamed it on like mismatched legs.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
No, he was getting pretty bad arthritis in his hip because of his uneven legs.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Nah, I mean even regrets doing his 5 foot 9.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Sorry, attic arthritis, sir.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Yeah.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
I didn't know that.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
Discuss.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
America's don't want to...

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Discuss!

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
Americans don't want to work anymore.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
Just want to flag my address, came up twice.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Yeah.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
So you want me to, when I'm editing it, no to believe it up both times.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
Yeah, are you the editor still or have we got that responsibility off to somebody?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
No, it's me.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Video.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
It's also grace.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Edits the audio.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
That's true.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Hard so.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
What's the work flow there?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
It's so unclear.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Well, not really.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
It's that I do the assembly cut and then I send her the tracks and she mixes them.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
And then whatever she's the mixer, what's that?

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
So you edit the audio and she lines up the video to that or you cut the audio

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
and the video at the same time.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Okay, picture lock everything.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Right.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
And then she mixes it.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
So she makes it sound good.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
A little bit easier.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
You asked a question.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
I was answering it.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
You cut me off.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Right.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Everything's locked to the picture.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Everything is assembled the way it is.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
So it's not going to change.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Once I send it to her.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
She just mixes the little beeping.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
I don't even get to the mute of it.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I'm responsible for the beeping.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
I'm responsible for the sound effects.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I'm responsible for everything you hear.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
She's responsible for how you hear it.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
You know what I mean?

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
It's so it's Thursday, February 9th.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Is this episode going up tomorrow?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Sure.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
The first two times we tried to do this.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
You interrupted me.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Just then.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
I prompted you to respond.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
You took a little bit too long to respond.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Yeah.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
What you don't understand is the flow of conversation.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
So when I'm doing the assembly later, I'm going to have to fix that.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
So the timing will take you to it.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
So I'm just going to put straight to it.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Cut it.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Get her nine hours.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Cut it.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
Just go straight into it after the eight or nine hours is mostly

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Jeff putting his current computer in the freezer.

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
So that he can upload a YouTube video.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Yeah.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
How's the fan?

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
It's so much worse than it was even a week ago.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
Like literally last night I was editing a video.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
It was like a 30 second clip.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Computers crashing.

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
It's getting so hot that it's scalding my lap.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Top.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Have you asked Marty for a new computer?

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
No.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Are you going to get a new computer though?

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
I'm going to get a new computer though.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
Guys, Americans don't want to work.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
Like I don't know what that's coming from.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
If it's a product of like unemployment like from the pandemic.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Like people getting $2,000 a month.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Like we neither need.

16:43.000 --> 16:51.000
I'm sorry to like to bring that back or start executing fuckers.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
To bring what back.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Bring.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
Either we get $2,000 from the government or you want to.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
You mask execute.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Just people.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Yeah.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Whether they're working or not.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Right.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
It's like how when you fuck up on a sports team.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
And then everyone has to work out because of you.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
You feel way worse than the punishment.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Sure.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Yeah.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Yeah.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
People want to.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
My teacher made us all run over a mile.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Tiny little children run over a mile.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Because one kid misbehaved in class.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
I was pulled out.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
I was pulled out of that class mid year.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Well that's because you got up to the higher academic track.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Let's be honest.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
I mean, you went to an Ivy League.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Not really.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Well it was covered in Ivy.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Yeah.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
It's true.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
You went to an Ivy League.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
No.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
But the school was covered in Ivy.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Correct.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
He's not around.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
loser.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
A millionaire dentist took his wife on Safari.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Only one of them returned alive.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
Which one do you guys think came back?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
The wife.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Really?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Yeah.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Why?

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
Because he was sort of like trying to fix a lion's mullers.

18:22.000 --> 18:31.000
Uh, I'm assuming it was all a very smart toy from her to get his money.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Yeah.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Yeah.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Um.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Ali, what do you think?

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
I wanted to be her, but I feel like it was him.

18:40.000 --> 18:46.000
I feel like he probably let her have the window seat of the Safari car and something got too close.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Hmm.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
It's a good point.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
Do you think it was like the movie Beast with Eater's Alba?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
No.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
Like a crazy lion on the loose could have been.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Some movie where it just elbow was a genie.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
And I swear like in a few years time, I will even remember.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
Probably a land like swearing can help you get a head in fever dream.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Yeah.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
That told us one time.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Yeah.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
What else?

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Weird.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
What else?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
That was a crazy film.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
It was good.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Why did they make that?

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Yeah.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
It will be weird.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
It'll be weird to think about it in a decade.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Yeah.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
You were told to sell the Swintbell and love with Alba.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
That's a genie.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
That's a genie.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
What's that?

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Nothing.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
There's something hundred years of longing.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Yeah.

19:43.000 --> 19:49.000
I really hope that director or something was famous because there's no other reason to make that film.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Sometimes you have a passion project.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Do you know?

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Perthia Atlantic swearing can help you get ahead in life.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
Let's start there.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Swearing?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Four letter words.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Yeah.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Yeah.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
How?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I didn't read the article.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Yeah.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Mm-hmm.

20:10.000 --> 20:15.000
Marika, let's hear some of your favorite four letter words.

20:15.000 --> 20:25.000
Um, I mean, I'm honestly a huge fan of, uh, using the word,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Kant as a curse word.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I think it's really funny.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
Like calling somebody that or just saying it like when you stub your toe.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Either one.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Probably more of the latter.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Yeah.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
The latter is really funny.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Let's see that.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Amir.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
See what?

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
I'm here.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Can you reenact that?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Yeah.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Me stubbing a toe and yelling Kant.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Yeah.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Ah Kant.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Nice.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Or like Kantee.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
But even for that situation too, that's kind of funny.

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
Well, you know, who in the office do you guys think is like,

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
Nevermind.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
Oh my god.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Computer heating up.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Yes.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
When do you get that new one?

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Uh, next week.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Like you already ordered it.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Yeah.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Is it one of the new ones that just came out?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I don't know.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
Please don't let me know if you just bought it.

21:33.000 --> 21:39.000
Also why is it taking so long to arrive?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Yeah.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
You can order them.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Oh.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
Uh, because you can order them and then they are, uh, take a while to ship.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Yeah.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Just take a break.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Yeah.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Ah.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
So soft.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Nothing was clean.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Everybody was moving and talking at the same time.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
About something else entirely.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Yeah.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
I look forward to hearing how that will cut together.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Well, come to squeal.

22:23.000 --> 22:42.920
are you playing music or yeah yeah I don't know what having me that's really good

22:42.920 --> 22:50.360
uh this the name of the game is squeal or no squeal so I'm gonna play a sound and you're

22:50.360 --> 22:58.840
gonna tell me if it's a squeal or not does that make sense yeah

23:03.080 --> 23:14.400
no that's only real that's a squeal that's a squeal no yeah yes it is that was

23:14.400 --> 23:19.280
squeal for sure I'd love the dictionary that's not a squeal that's not a squeal

23:22.720 --> 23:25.280
that was not a squeal

23:31.200 --> 23:36.800
fucking horse you fucking horse that was you

23:36.880 --> 23:46.720
all right where did you record that uh that was ultimately it

23:47.360 --> 23:55.120
oh sorry squeal or no squeal come on we got a lot of these to get to no correct

23:55.120 --> 24:03.480
no wide cream no squeal no

24:11.740 --> 24:13.600
that's a squeal

24:13.600 --> 24:15.800
I'll go to school.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.560
That was no squeal.

24:17.560 --> 24:18.600
So they're following me.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.520
There's only one squeal.

24:22.520 --> 24:23.360
So far.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.440
Correct, that's not a squeal.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.720
What is that?

24:32.720 --> 24:33.960
I might go to a squeal.

24:37.320 --> 24:38.160
No squeal.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.000
I'm so sorry.

24:39.000 --> 24:39.840
I'm so sorry.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.560
Genuinely one of the worst games you've ever come up with.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.600
No squeal.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.600
No squeal.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.600
Absolutely correct.

24:54.600 --> 24:55.600
squeal.

24:55.600 --> 24:56.600
That's a squeal.

24:56.600 --> 24:57.600
That's a squeal.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.600
That's a squeal.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.600
That's a squeal.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.600
How is that?

25:00.600 --> 25:01.600
Not a squeal.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.600
Correct.

25:02.600 --> 25:03.600
What?

25:09.600 --> 25:11.600
Was the last one a squeal or not?

25:11.600 --> 25:13.600
I said that.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.600
But we had multiple guesses.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.600
Oh, it was a squeal.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.600
That's applause.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.600
That's like a bird.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.600
That's a squeal.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.600
A squeal.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.600
That's really good.

25:34.600 --> 25:35.600
No squeal.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.600
Oh my God.

25:42.600 --> 25:56.600
I think this is the episode that convinces people to stop listening to this show.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.600
This is the worst episode we've ever done.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.600
I disagree.

26:01.600 --> 26:07.600
Yeah, I disagreeed up until this game.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.600
You thought it was going well before this?

26:10.600 --> 26:12.600
I thought it was going fine.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.600
It took too much time.

26:21.600 --> 26:22.600
squeal.

26:23.600 --> 26:25.600
That's going to be no squeal.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.600
Oh, here we go.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.600
Oh, that's like a pig.

26:34.600 --> 26:36.600
So squeal.

26:37.600 --> 26:38.600
No squeal.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.600
No squeal.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.600
How is the squeal?

26:53.600 --> 26:54.600
Squeal.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.600
No.

26:57.600 --> 26:58.600
It's a car.

26:58.600 --> 26:59.600
It's burning.

26:59.600 --> 27:00.600
Yeah.

27:00.600 --> 27:01.600
Well, it could be.

27:01.600 --> 27:04.600
That could be categorized as a squeal.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.600
That's not a squeal.

27:07.600 --> 27:10.600
How many more of these are there?

27:10.600 --> 27:11.600
Correct.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.600
What's that?

27:12.600 --> 27:14.600
How many more of these are there?

27:14.600 --> 27:16.600
There's like 10 more minutes of this.

27:18.600 --> 27:19.600
Squeal.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.600
No squeal.

27:29.600 --> 27:30.600
That was awful.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.600
Yeah, it was.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.600
I hated that.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.600
No squeal.

27:38.600 --> 27:39.600
Correct.

27:45.600 --> 27:46.600
I also hate that.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.600
I have to go.

27:49.600 --> 27:50.600
No squeal.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.600
That was a squeal.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.600
No.

28:14.600 --> 28:15.600
No.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.600
None of these have been me, by the way.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.600
Even the worst one was not me.

28:20.600 --> 28:22.600
But that's not a squeal.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.600
Let's last squeal for sure.

28:25.600 --> 28:26.600
It's not a squeal.

28:26.600 --> 28:27.600
We can jump.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.600
No squeal.

28:37.600 --> 28:38.600
No squeal.

28:44.600 --> 28:45.600
No squeal.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.600
Plugs.

28:55.600 --> 28:56.600
Wow.

28:56.600 --> 28:57.600
My gosh.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.600
Twenty-nine minutes.

28:59.600 --> 29:00.600
Us.

29:01.600 --> 29:02.600
Us.

29:02.600 --> 29:03.600
Us.

29:03.600 --> 29:04.600
We can jump.

29:04.600 --> 29:05.600
We can jump.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.600
We can jump.

29:06.600 --> 29:07.600
Just.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.600
Oh, look at chicken isn't it.

29:09.600 --> 29:10.600
Oh, no.

29:10.600 --> 29:11.600
No.

29:11.600 --> 29:12.600
No.

29:12.600 --> 29:13.600
No.

29:13.600 --> 29:14.600
No.

29:14.600 --> 29:15.600
No.

29:15.600 --> 29:16.600
No.

29:16.600 --> 29:17.600
You said you had things planned.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.600
That was it.

29:19.600 --> 29:20.600
Squeal or no squeal.

29:20.600 --> 29:21.600
Yes.

29:21.600 --> 29:24.600
I thought that would take a while that we would talk within the segment.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.600
Instead of all we did was squeal.

29:26.600 --> 29:27.600
You.

29:27.600 --> 29:30.600
You said we took too long.

29:30.600 --> 29:31.600
And took three times.

29:32.600 --> 29:33.600
Yeah.

29:33.600 --> 29:34.600
We got to get to the end of this thing.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.600
Think of something else.

29:40.600 --> 29:41.600
Okay.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.600
This is how the sausage is made.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.600
Going back to board games.

30:01.600 --> 30:08.600
Did you know that Candyland was invented for kids who were like who had polio and to be able.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.600
It's so easy that they can teach themselves it.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.600
Like little little kids who can't read yet.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.600
So that could have come in handy when a mirror was a child.

30:16.600 --> 30:17.600
Yeah.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.600
It was all in the polio.

30:18.600 --> 30:19.600
Yeah.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.600
I mean, most board games are pretty self-explanatory, especially like back then.

30:22.600 --> 30:27.600
They just just like slap like Simpson's branding on a regular board game.

30:27.600 --> 30:30.600
And it's always just like roll the dice and pick up a card.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.600
There wasn't much more at it to it.

30:32.600 --> 30:35.600
I guess Simpson's not believe that was cool.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.600
All right.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.600
That is fairly simple, too.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.600
Jeff, how's that for waxing?

30:44.600 --> 30:46.600
It's pretty good actually.

30:46.600 --> 30:49.600
Pertinent interesting fun fact that I knew about it.

30:49.600 --> 30:54.600
What I'm sitting here feeling is that Candyland has always sort of bested my ass.

30:55.600 --> 30:56.600
Like he never asked about.

30:56.600 --> 30:57.600
That sucks to learn.

30:57.600 --> 30:58.600
What's that?

30:58.600 --> 31:00.600
He never used to win.

31:00.600 --> 31:04.600
Never used to understand the instructions.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.600
Never used to know how to play.

31:06.600 --> 31:10.600
So to hear that it was invented for kids with polio.

31:10.600 --> 31:15.600
To be able to understand without any adult supervision or explanation.

31:15.600 --> 31:16.600
Permir.

31:16.600 --> 31:17.600
I didn't say that.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.600
Candyland's kid.

31:19.600 --> 31:22.600
Candyland scared me as a child.

31:23.600 --> 31:24.600
Because of that.

31:24.600 --> 31:25.600
The swamp.

31:25.600 --> 31:26.600
Yeah.

31:26.600 --> 31:27.600
I like it.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.600
That guy.

31:28.600 --> 31:29.600
Yeah.

31:29.600 --> 31:30.600
Maria Diabetes.

31:30.600 --> 31:33.600
So she was afraid of anything sweet.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.600
Just a little goof.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.600
Do you guys ever get into Catan?

31:37.600 --> 31:38.600
That was a big thing.

31:38.600 --> 31:40.600
I a decade ago.

31:40.600 --> 31:43.600
Hate settlers of Catan.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.600
I think it made me hate board games.

31:45.600 --> 31:46.600
Wow.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.600
Anytime my friends.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.600
Like sick just playing a board game.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.600
I'm like I'm good actually.

31:52.600 --> 31:53.600
Hold on.

31:53.600 --> 31:55.600
What about like a game night?

31:55.600 --> 31:58.600
Haven't had one in a while.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.600
That didn't involve like video games.

32:00.600 --> 32:01.600
Okay.

32:01.600 --> 32:02.600
That's fair.

32:02.600 --> 32:03.600
I mean, I was going to lob up.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.600
What the fuck was it called?

32:05.600 --> 32:07.600
The one we played with Jeff.

32:07.600 --> 32:10.600
Rubin when he called you America.

32:10.600 --> 32:13.600
The last game.

32:13.600 --> 32:14.600
Yeah.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.600
That was the last game.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.600
I was thinking jackbox.tv.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.600
Jackbox was also fun.

32:20.600 --> 32:24.600
Quiplash had its nice moment in the early early pandemic.

32:24.600 --> 32:26.600
Are we in a nostalgic for the early pandemic yet?

32:26.600 --> 32:27.600
Or is that sort of...

32:27.600 --> 32:28.600
I am.

32:28.600 --> 32:29.600
Or not early.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.600
Those first three months.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.600
I was like sad as shit, but I was having a great time.

32:33.600 --> 32:34.600
Because you were bored.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.600
Like you didn't have anything to do.

32:36.600 --> 32:37.600
Yeah.

32:37.600 --> 32:38.600
It's the opposite of now.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.600
You just woke up and you're like what now?

32:40.600 --> 32:45.600
I'm just a free agent until question mark question mark.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.600
It also is...

32:47.600 --> 32:49.600
We all had a bunch of...

32:49.600 --> 32:50.600
Well, maybe not everybody.

32:50.600 --> 32:54.600
But a lot of people had extra walking around money because there was no walking around.

32:54.600 --> 32:55.600
You know what I mean?

32:55.600 --> 32:57.600
There was no going anywhere.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.600
Let me finish.

32:58.600 --> 32:59.600
Sorry.

32:59.600 --> 33:00.600
There was...

33:00.600 --> 33:01.600
You couldn't go anywhere, basically.

33:01.600 --> 33:02.600
So like...

33:02.600 --> 33:05.600
There was no going out to eat.

33:05.600 --> 33:06.600
There was no going out to get drinks.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.600
Like that stuff adds up.

33:08.600 --> 33:12.600
All you had was to get groceries delivered.

33:12.600 --> 33:18.600
I feel like I spent way too much money on food because I was getting stuff delivered.

33:18.600 --> 33:25.600
I've had to really try hard to pair that back from really pandemic.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.600
Which I'm not nostalgic for.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.600
Well, what was the most normal life?

33:29.600 --> 33:31.600
A more the most...

33:31.600 --> 33:32.600
A more the most pandemic.

33:32.600 --> 33:33.600
A more the most...

33:33.600 --> 33:34.600
A more the most...

33:34.600 --> 33:35.600
A more the most...

33:35.600 --> 33:36.600
A more the most...

33:36.600 --> 33:38.600
A more the most...

33:38.600 --> 33:39.600
A more the most...

33:39.600 --> 33:40.600
A more the most...

33:40.600 --> 33:41.600
A more the most...

33:41.600 --> 33:52.920
A more an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an o a a an an an an an an an a an an an an an an an an an an an

33:52.920 --> 33:55.520
an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an a an an an an an an an an an an an an an Ana

33:55.520 --> 33:56.520
That's what I said, man.

33:56.520 --> 34:02.520
What was that like in me?

34:02.520 --> 34:03.520
What?

34:03.520 --> 34:07.520
Oh, did you see like an uptick in Patreon subscribers?

34:07.520 --> 34:08.520
At that time?

34:08.520 --> 34:09.520
Oh, I don't know.

34:09.520 --> 34:10.520
That's a good question.

34:10.520 --> 34:13.520
Because everyone was at home and looking for stuff to do.

34:13.520 --> 34:14.520
Yeah.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.520
Like Riley and I started out with a digital things.

34:17.520 --> 34:18.520
Yeah.

34:18.520 --> 34:20.520
Had a boom during that.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.520
Remember like live shows that you're like,

34:22.520 --> 34:24.520
we're all Zoom shows at first.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.520
Yeah, we did a review of your live show.

34:26.520 --> 34:35.520
But also Riley and I as Patreon had like 2.5 X them out of subscribers that it has now at the time.

34:35.520 --> 34:36.520
Interesting.

34:36.520 --> 34:37.520
Because people didn't have anything.

34:37.520 --> 34:40.520
There was no competition in the real life.

34:40.520 --> 34:44.520
The steepest drop-off was yeah, like March 2021 when people started getting vaccinated.

34:44.520 --> 34:46.520
Like as soon as people started getting vaccinated,

34:46.520 --> 34:48.520
I think they stopped paying for it.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.520
Because what we were doing like Zoom parties,

34:51.520 --> 34:54.520
which we still do Patreon.com forward slash Riley and Jeff.

34:54.520 --> 34:56.520
And now it's like as soon as you can go to a real party,

34:56.520 --> 34:59.520
I think people stopped wanting to do that.

34:59.520 --> 35:00.520
That makes sense.

35:00.520 --> 35:01.520
Yeah.

35:01.520 --> 35:02.520
I forgot about Zoom parties.

35:02.520 --> 35:03.520
That was so weird.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.520
I got invited to like Zoom discos.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.520
And we would just like,

35:07.520 --> 35:09.520
Well, we still do them.

35:09.520 --> 35:11.520
So tread lightly.

35:11.520 --> 35:15.520
You're like cracking up at the idea of the kind of awesome.

35:15.520 --> 35:18.520
It was just, it was just a moment of the times.

35:18.520 --> 35:19.520
I don't know.

35:19.520 --> 35:20.520
I was just, and I remember being like, yep.

35:20.520 --> 35:21.520
That's my plan.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.520
And it's a legit plan.

35:23.520 --> 35:24.520
Yeah.

35:24.520 --> 35:27.520
You're funny to email people saying you're having a Zoom birthday this year.

35:27.520 --> 35:31.520
It'd be funny if you went to the hospital soon.

35:31.520 --> 35:34.520
Plugs.

35:34.520 --> 35:36.520
Um, Jesus.

35:36.520 --> 35:39.520
My Twitter, I guess.

35:41.520 --> 35:42.520
Twitter.com.

35:42.520 --> 35:52.520
Someone fell to me on sale.

35:52.520 --> 35:55.520
How about that?

35:55.520 --> 35:58.520
Uncell.

35:58.520 --> 35:59.520
You want people pay you?

35:59.520 --> 36:00.520
Wouldn't hurt.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.520
I didn't know I'd ask for that.

36:01.520 --> 36:02.520
Yeah, you could ask for anything.

36:02.520 --> 36:03.520
You're in plucks.

36:03.520 --> 36:06.520
It's sort of the wild west of podcasting.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.520
Like what's your venmo?

36:08.520 --> 36:10.520
Ali Khan.

36:10.520 --> 36:13.920
A. L. L. L. I. E. Space dash. K. H.

36:14.520 --> 36:15.520
Sweet.

36:15.520 --> 36:17.520
Cardiac arrest. Ideally.

36:18.020 --> 36:19.520
Say that again.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.020
The hospital thing.

36:21.020 --> 36:23.520
Ideally it's really a different kind of cardiac event.

36:23.520 --> 36:24.520
Yeah.

36:24.520 --> 36:26.020
Or like yeah.

36:26.020 --> 36:27.020
I don't see that happening.

36:27.020 --> 36:29.520
Maybe your veins just freeze.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.520
My veins freeze.

36:34.520 --> 36:37.020
Which is going to be an if I were you live stream.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.520
Next week.

36:38.520 --> 36:40.020
Yeah, Jeff, are you on that?

36:40.520 --> 36:41.020
I know.

36:41.020 --> 36:42.520
I'm really excited for that.

36:44.520 --> 36:46.520
Yeah, you're not too busy here.

36:46.520 --> 36:49.020
No, I'm not too busy for this.

36:49.020 --> 36:50.520
It's just the timing of all this shit.

36:50.520 --> 36:53.020
It's also hard to get three people onto a zoom.

36:53.020 --> 36:54.520
At the same time.

36:54.520 --> 36:57.020
Without it being like, I don't know fucking.

36:57.520 --> 37:01.020
Angie, like nobody wants Garcia on the show.

37:01.020 --> 37:02.020
I'm sorry.

37:03.020 --> 37:07.020
Well, it's because it's because it's a last minute request.

37:07.020 --> 37:08.020
Yeah.

37:08.020 --> 37:11.020
That was good.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.020
Anyway, yeah.

37:13.020 --> 37:15.020
YouTube.com slash have gone.

37:15.020 --> 37:18.020
If I were you live stream Friday.

37:18.020 --> 37:20.020
February 17th.

37:20.020 --> 37:21.020
Yeah.

37:21.020 --> 37:22.020
12 p.m.

37:22.020 --> 37:24.020
Pacific time.

37:24.020 --> 37:26.020
It's going to be great.

37:26.020 --> 37:27.020
It'll be a lot of fun.

37:27.020 --> 37:29.020
I think it's our first live stream.

37:29.020 --> 37:30.020
It's not.

37:30.020 --> 37:32.020
It's very exciting.

37:32.020 --> 37:34.020
It's very safe.

37:34.020 --> 37:36.020
It's it's also not.

37:36.020 --> 37:38.020
It's just on the floor for an episode.

37:38.020 --> 37:40.020
For.

37:40.020 --> 37:43.020
You guys did one during the pandemic.

37:43.020 --> 37:45.020
You did an FRIU live stream.

37:45.020 --> 37:46.020
Good on us.

37:46.020 --> 37:47.020
Sure.

37:47.020 --> 37:48.020
Like you were a episode.

37:48.020 --> 37:49.020
Yeah.

37:49.020 --> 37:50.020
I produced it.

37:50.020 --> 37:52.020
Ben was there.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.020
Pat Castle showed up.

37:54.020 --> 37:56.020
I think Jill and Avi taught it a segment.

37:56.020 --> 37:57.020
It was fun.

37:57.020 --> 37:59.020
Well, that was a live show, isn't it?

37:59.020 --> 38:01.020
It was live streamed.

38:01.020 --> 38:02.020
For sure.

38:02.020 --> 38:03.020
For sure.

38:03.020 --> 38:05.020
I guess I imagine that as a different thing.

38:05.020 --> 38:06.020
It's all tickets to that.

38:06.020 --> 38:07.020
It's a live show.

38:07.020 --> 38:09.020
This is just like, hey, we're recording an episode.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.020
And it's also being live streamed.

38:10.020 --> 38:11.020
Yeah.

38:11.020 --> 38:12.020
Which should be fun.

38:12.020 --> 38:13.020
So what you mean?

38:13.020 --> 38:14.020
Jeff, aren't you going to be there?

38:14.020 --> 38:15.020
Yes.

38:15.020 --> 38:20.020
I'm excited for that.

38:20.020 --> 38:21.020
It's Jeff's internet slowers.

38:21.020 --> 38:22.020
My internet slowen.

38:22.020 --> 38:23.020
Everybody's.

38:23.020 --> 38:25.020
I think it's Jeff.

38:25.020 --> 38:26.020
Something's happening.

38:26.020 --> 38:27.020
We got to get out of here.

38:27.020 --> 38:29.020
Anybody else need any other plug?

38:29.020 --> 38:31.020
Yeah.

38:31.020 --> 38:33.020
Ali, Mertica, plugs.

38:33.020 --> 38:35.020
Something.

38:35.020 --> 38:39.020
Firejet engines are in letter boxed.

38:39.020 --> 38:40.020
Yeah.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.020
Make it.

38:41.020 --> 38:42.020
Yeah.

38:42.020 --> 38:46.020
Follow me on letter boxed and Twitter and Instagram.

38:46.020 --> 38:53.020
And Venmo, repay me money, Ali Con.

38:53.020 --> 38:56.020
At Jeffery James Lennon's room, at Jeffay already on Twitter.

38:56.020 --> 39:01.020
We'll see you guys again next week, hopefully, bear with us.

39:01.020 --> 39:20.620
Please just come back next week, it'll be better if you hear what it is.

39:20.620 --> 39:22.060
That was a HIDDUM original.

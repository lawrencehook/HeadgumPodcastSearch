00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Are you staying over there?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
He does that so far.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Why up? Why up?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Why does it still get over here?

00:30.000 --> 00:44.000
Why does it sound like an evil wedding march?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
What's that?

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Why does it sound like an evil wedding?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
It's a Halloween wedding.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Is that a microphone?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah, that's just a microphone.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Is that a microphone?

00:56.000 --> 01:05.000
Usually there's silence during the processional, right?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
During the wedding march?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I don't really know, is there?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Where did you find this?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
What's that?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Where did you find this?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
This is on YouTube.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
It says a wedding march sort of.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Turn it down.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Turn it down if you can't hear us.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
That's great, much better, right?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
How long did you want that to last?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I didn't want it to last any amount of time.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
There's 30 seconds left in the song.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
That's what you're asking.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
There's feedback for sure.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
What is that in the buzz?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Yeah, kind of a buzz.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
We should use this for when you walked on the island.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
The buzz.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
The buzz.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I love it.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
There you go.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Wow.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
I mean, what a special week, am I right?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Yeah.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
You guys always remember this, especially Casey.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Specialist week of your life.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Most special.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Yeah.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
How are we feeling?

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
I mean, this is the, we should say that this is the pre-nup show.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Headgum podcast episode because the last of us to get married.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Amir and Avital.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
The last of you.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Are you guys married?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Well, I don't think we plan on it.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Yeah.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
You don't have anything planned.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
I haven't even met anybody.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I've never met anyone.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
So.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Hi.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Obviously you guys are the one.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Oh my god.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
The ruffle.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Well, we should.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm kind of emotional.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Thank you.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Yeah.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
At the thought of like, you guys not being bachelor's anymore.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Right?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
How does that feel?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Did you guys start just letting me finish that?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
It feels bad.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
We were bachelor's.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
We were in a relationship.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
What?

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
It's not like we were single up until this day.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Exactly right.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Actually, you still are until Saturday.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Exactly.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
That's what a bachelor party is.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
We've had a very close relationship.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
One way.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
One way.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Whether or not the relationship is closed.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Two sets of legs aren't.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Amir right?

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Meaning.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Meaning.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Sexual experimentation.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Enjoying each other's bodies.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Transcending through somatic healing.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Does that make sense?

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Somatic?

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
What's that?

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Somatic healing.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
What's wrong with you?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
God.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
You don't listen.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Let me see that rock girl.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
It's just the engagement ring.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
It's just the engagement ring.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
That's the most important ring.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
It's been there for months and months.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
I don't know this.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
When did you...

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Well, let's fucking...

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Casey.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
You're smiling.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm never seen you smile before.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
I just love love.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Casey's crying.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
It's a very hollow ring.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
What is that?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
12 carrots?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
It's not a diamond.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
It's a moonstone.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Is that your birthstone?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
No.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Not even.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Fuck.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
I don't know anything about how these things go.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Something borrowed.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Sorry.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
I always feel like we're cutting you off.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
That's just how a normal conversation is with you.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Review.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Don't repeat.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
This listen.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
I had...

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Casey will appreciate this.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
First of all, Casey, we should say that you just sold a script, right?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Congratulations.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Wow.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Well...

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Okay.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Let's not.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
To Jeffree.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
I wish that film's cool.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
I sold it to Jeffree.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Wow.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
For an over-over spend.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
The script is barely format.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
It let alone good.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
No, I went to mail.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
What's that?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
It was an email.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
You said...

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
You said...

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
I always tell you that you guys are cutting me off.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
What was that?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
You don't have to yell what's that.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Every time someone talks is all.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
What's the script?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
I don't want to get into it, right?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
No.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
You know what's the time for the sort of the log line of this.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
In a way, we're getting married, but you've given birth.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
And that's bigger.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
That's a bigger deal because you brought new life into this world.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Not only just one life, but how many characters?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Yeah, lots of lives.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
There's two main characters, two sporting characters.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Four lives.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
You got three kind of actors in here.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
You've got two actors in on a mirror.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
He's actually a very good actor.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
He doesn't really like it.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
He doesn't like it.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
That's cooler.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
That's so much cooler to have the talent.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
But not want it into the end.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Yeah.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
That's your chest and your ankles.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Well, this is maybe too earnest.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
But you should feel special because he acts in things that you write.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
And he will not do it for a lot of people.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Yeah.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Oh, yeah.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Yeah.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
I mean, granted it's for a headgun.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
That's sort of a force.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
I'm not already near a wheelhouse that only Jeffrey can write for.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
What?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
I'm right next to you.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Yeah.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
But you make me feel vulnerable.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
And the acting is kind of hard for me.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Jeff just feels like different snack ideas.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Do you know?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Exactly.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Um.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Sorry.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Just one second.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Got it.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
The claps in.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Um.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
I think you're vulnerable.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
That's beautiful.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Proposal story or how did it happen?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
It doesn't quite matter right now.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
What's that?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
No, it does.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
This is the time that you kind of tell about like,

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Did he surprise you on a scavenger hunt?

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Did he draw a bat?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
It's slash butter.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
I did draw a lot of bats for her.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Well, you were saying that he draws a lot of hard lines in the sand,

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
but I'm not sure.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
When did I say that?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I think it was that alive show last time.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
Like, what would be an example of a hard line that I would describe him drawing?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
So it would be like, let's figure out, you know,

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
how we're going to divvy up chores.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
And then he's like, I will not do the kitchen.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
You're like, okay, like fine.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
I guess I'll do the kitchen and you can do the bathrooms.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
That seems worse.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
And then he's like over the moon to do the bathroom.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
That's a hard line that he draws.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Another one is no cheating on me.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
It's like.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Yeah.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
So yeah.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
You got to be more flexible.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Not really.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Really?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
No cheating on me.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
That's what I'm saying.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Like I'm trying to get dog.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
No.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Hey.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Hey.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
You brought a spritz bottle into the office.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
That's more cake.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
No.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
You guys were the arrow on couple and silver lake and COVID.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
What's that?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
What is that?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Casey knows I have no idea what you're doing.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
I'm an island.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
I'm an island man today.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
It went viral on Twitter.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Sorry.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
X.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Oh, the woman leading a man on a leash.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Yeah.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Well, that went viral on Twitter, not X.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Right.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Yeah.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
That's true.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Dog cost him an Adamadacharx was like walking him into Arrowoff.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Wow.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Why did you choose Adamadacharx?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Because what she was wearing and doing?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
You can't put people into boxes like that.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Yeah.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
It could have been just a don't an orthodontist walking a human dog.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
It would have to be Adamadacharx say.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
And how did he know it was a dog and not a donkey,

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
so hard.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
And barking like an animal.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
OK, well, not all animals are the same.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Men can have rabies.

08:04.000 --> 08:04.500
That's right.

08:04.500 --> 08:11.940
Yeah, so I guess if they get bitten by dog or a bat, a horse, a rabbit horse, exactly right.

08:11.940 --> 08:17.460
Are one to walk around? We're getting too far away from you. All right. How did you propose?

08:18.420 --> 08:26.740
I proposed in Santa Monica on a beach. Will Rogers, or sorry, the key to storytelling

08:26.740 --> 08:31.860
is specificity, universality through specificity. The reason we're leaving out details is because

08:31.940 --> 08:36.980
I don't want you and everyone in mind to know. But it's already in the past. You know, like you've been

08:36.980 --> 08:40.980
getting mad. I'm sorry. I would never do this to you of a talk. But I've been leaving it for that reason.

08:40.980 --> 08:44.660
But I've been like doxing the wedding details on the show for months and you keep getting really

08:44.660 --> 08:48.820
angry. You have to get that out. You're saying you can't release that detail. I don't know if it's

08:48.820 --> 08:53.220
because of like the gun epidemic in this country or what? Or if it's just a stranger showing up.

08:53.220 --> 08:58.740
Certainly. But it's all been cut out because it's in the future. But this episode doesn't come out

08:58.740 --> 09:02.980
to left of wedding. So we can say. Is that true? October 15 comes out Friday. Oh, you know what?

09:02.980 --> 09:10.100
It's this one. But this all being said, this was this this was in the past, which means it has

09:10.820 --> 09:15.780
it's already been sealed in wax, right? But this episode comes out before the wedding. We'll get

09:15.780 --> 09:20.180
to that. I'm just saying to post it. We're focused on the matter at hand. Maybe this is the episode

09:20.180 --> 09:24.500
we do a ticker. You were saying like, you know, like the first take to where it's like the

09:24.500 --> 09:30.100
I style. What's talking about now? What's coming up? Exactly. And what was just spoken of?

09:30.100 --> 09:35.140
So that we can know people can know if they want to rewind. That's just in the case of someone

09:35.140 --> 09:39.940
opening the YouTube video, clicking at at random slash at nausea, which is how you watch YouTube videos

09:39.940 --> 09:54.340
usually. And I'd love to talk to you guys about subject. I'm so sorry for wasting 45.

09:54.340 --> 10:01.380
I do have a wedding to play. Starting a job on Monday that I have to prep for. It is sort of

10:01.380 --> 10:07.460
not agree. No, my point is that the proposal's already happened. Nobody can do anything this

10:07.460 --> 10:11.700
hour. It's already sealed in wax. So he's already sourd it. So we don't. So that's here. That's

10:11.700 --> 10:16.740
why you don't want to tell us. It's been a sourd story. But the other story is that we went to,

10:16.740 --> 10:21.620
we were on the west side. We went to a beach proposal happened when to see my parents then

10:21.620 --> 10:29.460
ate a very nice sushi dinner in the valley. So she knew? No, sushi bar. Oh, that's good.

10:29.460 --> 10:32.340
That's really good. Yeah. Do you like sushi or is that what I'm your likes?

10:33.700 --> 10:40.660
Actually, she ate. He went with Ben. She was before. And I got so insanely jelly.

10:40.660 --> 10:46.180
Oh really? I love sushi. We don't go to this fancy sushi place. And I wouldn't stop talking about it.

10:46.180 --> 10:51.060
And then before that proposal, he finally made a reservation. I was like, how did you know?

10:51.060 --> 11:01.700
That's really. Redemption art. I call that. How did you feel on the day? Do you have reservations

11:01.700 --> 11:06.260
or had you guys already see a place on the second? I don't have a time 30 p.m. Basically,

11:06.260 --> 11:10.980
pretty hard to get. You have to do it a month in advance. But so is I would tell all my

11:10.980 --> 11:17.220
costs. Of course. Trust me with the sushi. Do you want me to cost a year? Do you trust the

11:17.220 --> 11:23.460
chef with the rest of your life? No. That's true. That's the thing. You're only her first husband.

11:23.460 --> 11:27.460
Does that make sense? The practice one. Exactly, right. So that you start her husband. Yeah,

11:27.460 --> 11:31.540
like you're in high school and you have a crush on that certain someone. And then you're like,

11:31.540 --> 11:35.300
I don't want to be a virgin. I don't want to be a virgin. I feel like my mind is made.

11:36.020 --> 11:40.420
This isn't like a passing fancy. Obviously, it tells not my first wife. I was going to say it's

11:40.420 --> 11:46.820
like fallies. Yeah. Have you been married before? Wait, sorry to who? It's not funny. It's like

11:46.820 --> 11:50.180
who are you married to? I can if you kept us all in the dark. This is really fucked up. I'll

11:50.180 --> 11:54.020
just mean that there won't be a second. That's not what that means. That sounds like a threat.

11:54.660 --> 12:01.300
That way. I would never. Casey, can you kind of just back up and analyze how you viewed that as

12:01.300 --> 12:05.140
a threat? Like what about his body language? What about that? I think just just the sentence,

12:05.140 --> 12:09.940
there will not be a second. Is that the other word line? Yeah. You got to like crazy

12:09.940 --> 12:15.060
hard lines. It's insane. I'm saying if I die sometime during our marriage. And we do hope

12:15.060 --> 12:20.100
of he tells not allowed to remarry and that's written into the prenuptial. Well, you haunt us if I do.

12:20.100 --> 12:23.780
I mean, play the song again. Dane, nane, nane, nane, nane, nane, nane.

12:23.780 --> 12:38.420
You're a music fan. I am. What was it like Neil Younger or something? I couldn't tell. Was it?

12:40.420 --> 12:44.660
It was George Harrison. Of course. You said play that song again. You didn't say which one?

12:44.660 --> 12:50.260
I wanted to play the Macob. You did say which one he'd sort of sang dial wedding. He went, dane,

12:50.340 --> 12:57.940
nane, nane, nane. I'm totally actually wanted a Macob wedding. Ready or not, style.

12:57.940 --> 13:02.820
Or is that true? Yeah, I think my dream scenario would be more like ready or not. It would be

13:04.100 --> 13:08.740
you chased me through the woods with weapons. But I did get a little cake topper. That's like

13:09.460 --> 13:14.420
two, two, yeah, very spooky two. I mean, it's also October. So it was a good one. Is that going to be

13:14.420 --> 13:20.020
on the wedding cake or? Yeah. It's like two. Yeah, I don't have a picture of it or I would tell you.

13:20.020 --> 13:26.260
But it's two corpses. So you proposed on a beach? It's an apology. It details, but I think it is,

13:26.260 --> 13:30.740
I don't know, vulnerable for other people. Yeah, it's a good one. All right, we'll move on.

13:30.740 --> 13:34.180
If it's other people, we'll move on. If it's obvious to other other people, we'll move on.

13:34.180 --> 13:38.580
I guess one thing that I can say, that's funny about it is that we had, I've been having

13:38.580 --> 13:44.340
like crazy jaw issues, PSA, don't get a night guard if you don't need one. We went my life.

13:44.340 --> 13:49.060
But we were seeing like a TMJ expert and it was really stressful and trying to figure out what was

13:49.060 --> 13:54.660
going on. And I had said, maybe we can go to the beach after to kind of make it a nicer thing.

13:54.660 --> 13:58.260
And it was like, yes, which already was kind of weird that you're so ready to do that.

13:58.260 --> 14:02.340
I love the beach. Yeah, we've got a minute of the beach. We don't go to the beach.

14:02.340 --> 14:06.180
And then he had already dropped Luke off with his cousin so that we would have the day.

14:06.180 --> 14:09.940
And I didn't write. Like, I was like, oh, that's weird. But I didn't think anything about that.

14:09.940 --> 14:14.660
And then we go to the beach. I guess the funny detail without getting too into it is a family

14:14.660 --> 14:19.620
member had had surgery and is talking about, um, rectal bleeding and anal prolapse.

14:19.620 --> 14:24.020
Oh, and it mirrors like, get off the phone. And I'm trying, and this is what's happening.

14:24.020 --> 14:29.140
It's like, gradually. And then finally, I get off the phone. There's like this much

14:29.220 --> 14:34.020
on left. And he's like, today's been such a good day. And I'm like, no, it has been.

14:36.260 --> 14:40.660
And then I'm like, oh, as soon as that happens. And he's like, I want every day to be this good. I'm like,

14:40.660 --> 14:46.900
okay. And then I can then I like check and see that his hand is reading for. I go. Yes.

14:46.900 --> 14:53.140
And then he threatened me. You better remember, I'm trying a hard line in the sand murder or

14:53.140 --> 15:00.340
ingame. And that's very sweet though. Wait, so, but it was, it was after an orthodontist appointment.

15:00.340 --> 15:06.900
It was after like a TMJ specialist appointment. Got it. We're past orthodontists at this.

15:06.900 --> 15:11.940
Yeah. We were specialists. Yeah. Yeah. I've got a question if I may. Yes. If I get,

15:11.940 --> 15:15.540
yeah, of course. Get in. Sorry. It's yours to say yes. I can't. I sure. Yeah. Now, you know,

15:15.540 --> 15:19.860
it's your week. It's your day. Don't let me out. I'll tell me. I ask a question. Uh,

15:19.940 --> 15:22.980
it's what's more for a mirror. Oh, okay. Great. Did you write that line?

15:23.540 --> 15:28.900
The today was so great. No, it's never day would be great or whatever. It even say great.

15:28.900 --> 15:34.180
It's a good. No, we don't know what I said. You really don't know what I said. That's true.

15:35.460 --> 15:41.060
That being said, I did say good. No, I don't even remember saying that specifically, but I

15:41.060 --> 15:46.260
didn't pre-write it now. You just sort of winged it. Yeah. We spoke from the heart. Yeah.

15:46.340 --> 15:51.300
And the heart said today was a good day. Well, there were highlights before that.

15:51.300 --> 15:56.100
Were there? Yeah, but those were in your hair. So it was weird. I was happy to have you

15:56.100 --> 16:04.340
in your day. I was happy to have you in my hair. Do you remember any or you're just trying to

16:04.340 --> 16:09.380
excuse your. Oh, no, I remember some bold talk off. Okay. Okay. Great. Um, good for me.

16:09.380 --> 16:13.700
That'll be on the picture. Wedding planning podcast. Let's talk about it. I know it's just what

16:13.700 --> 16:20.980
that can be. Yeah. You do. How many times have you been married? I haven't yet. I just hear tell

16:21.860 --> 16:26.740
of the process being a nightmare. We can't see you. It's so far so good. No, it seems like great.

16:26.740 --> 16:30.980
It's really. No, it's just so. Um, I guess my first question is,

16:30.980 --> 16:38.180
what? No, I do. Can you just believe the date? I'll leave all of this, but this is coming out on Friday.

16:38.340 --> 16:46.740
Okay. It don't have a security. This is why. No, there's no way because of liability insurance,

16:46.740 --> 16:49.620
right? And this is what I'm also worried about what happened last night. We'll talk after this,

16:49.620 --> 16:55.620
but general liability. Oh, we have that, but not security. We can still get murder. Yeah,

16:55.620 --> 17:00.420
we can cut that. Cutting. Just like I can't remember where we're going to start cutting. Yeah. We

17:00.420 --> 17:06.580
chose the Met Gala because we think it's incredibly beautiful. And is it because you're a history

17:06.580 --> 17:12.420
musician? You're the one in the wedding. In terms of, because you guys went to a different wedding

17:12.420 --> 17:17.460
at the same venue. Was that the deciding factor? It was, yeah, it was really beautiful. We loved it,

17:17.460 --> 17:22.660
then. Well, there's a certain magic. Have you been there? Have you been to this? Have you been to this?

17:22.660 --> 17:27.860
Have you been to this place? I have driven past. Okay. I haven't been inside. I'm unbelievably excited.

17:27.860 --> 17:31.140
Don't get the vetting. Don't get the vetting. Then you. And I'm also excited to meet Abbie Tells

17:31.140 --> 17:36.020
family to see all my friends that are at the wedding. And, you know, so we've sat you with my

17:36.020 --> 17:44.900
brothers. Is that good? Really? Oh. Oh my. Now, I might look bad upon B. He might speak ill of me.

17:44.900 --> 17:49.300
Oh. No, is that true? No, you're sequestered with headgum people. That's what I thought. Yeah. That's what

17:49.300 --> 17:53.540
Jake did and it was a call. It was me and Nick Rad and we were like floundering. We didn't know

17:53.540 --> 17:57.700
what to talk about. Yeah, what did you land on? Ultimately like art skills. Well, you're both in

17:57.700 --> 18:02.980
complete art. We didn't even put that together until before and then after the wedding. Right? So we didn't

18:02.980 --> 18:07.540
talk her. Yeah. Where's like talking points that you can have when you see me? It wasn't in the

18:07.540 --> 18:18.740
cards. Nice. Very good. No. No, it wasn't. No, it wasn't. So it's just that you had been to that place

18:18.740 --> 18:24.260
before. Yeah. I remember thinking like for some reason that it would not be feasible. Yeah. It is

18:24.260 --> 18:29.620
really hard at this place. It's hard to get it. They don't help you with anything. So this is like

18:29.780 --> 18:34.660
even the people that got married there were kind of like don't do it. It's a borderline Airbnb situation.

18:34.660 --> 18:39.700
Yeah. It's more used like, yeah, they don't. They just don't give you anything. That's kind of

18:39.700 --> 18:44.900
crazy. But it is so pretty. You'll see. Yeah. So you've been, you got to do a site visit. Yeah,

18:44.900 --> 18:49.140
and really from the wedding, having seen like how they pulled it off, we're like, okay, we can do it.

18:49.140 --> 18:54.100
Yeah. And by we, I mean, my mom who's doing most of the work. And then let's talk about the wedding

18:54.100 --> 18:59.140
schedule because a lot of people do again, this is all coming up before the day. Okay. So I don't want

18:59.140 --> 19:03.780
this coming out. Friday, October 13th. So if you listen to this episode, there's still time.

19:04.820 --> 19:10.820
That's what tonight. Right. Be listening to this act. You know, this is all land to our things. I don't

19:10.820 --> 19:16.820
want out there. And then there's a day sort of a winch in this. There's like a well, it's been a whole

19:16.820 --> 19:24.420
person and unhappening. Who's going to be there? Is it all just a hip young friends or is the fans not

19:24.420 --> 19:32.740
usable? Of course not. And maybe we just release this next Friday. Sure. But then I still don't want

19:32.740 --> 19:39.700
every single point of detail out there. 42. Are you ashamed of me? I'm here. You can stay.

19:43.300 --> 19:48.340
We'll believe all of that, of course. But how did you decide on the schedule? Like,

19:49.300 --> 19:54.260
well, let's do it all in one. Let's get it. Like a one take situation. Let's do it all in. Sorry,

19:54.260 --> 19:59.380
it's supposed to two weddings. Or sometimes I feel like there's like the legal thing, which only

19:59.380 --> 20:03.460
you're like friends and family show up to. And then there's a reception. And that's like friends.

20:03.460 --> 20:07.940
I have my family's all orthodox or my parents and my best friends still is. Is it lying for my

20:07.940 --> 20:14.420
of me? Yeah, my boy. There's my first sighted. He gets about learning shit about you that he can

20:15.380 --> 20:19.060
just like a little and they're flying in. Where are they coming from? Where are their names?

20:19.060 --> 20:24.500
Like little fucking friends. He's not really. Yes, that was like more jerky.

20:27.060 --> 20:31.300
Speaking of more jerky, can you get a more fucking chimed in in a minute? Because you're asking some

20:31.300 --> 20:36.740
details of their wedding. And you don't have it, my friends. I don't know.

20:37.460 --> 20:41.460
How are you going to shoot it if you don't know the backstory? You have to create a story.

20:41.780 --> 20:47.780
I figured we'd have a meeting about it. It's just a story. What are you even needing about it? It's now.

20:48.500 --> 20:53.380
Is this the meeting? What's that? This is the pre-meeting. Yeah. Oh, nice. Um.

20:55.060 --> 20:57.380
How are you talking about that curgrin through the asthma episode? Nope.

21:03.380 --> 21:08.980
Yeah. Um. What are you talking about now? Take a break. We're going to have to take a break. Why?

21:09.140 --> 21:14.740
Just for ads. Oh. It's episode I think is brought to you by see the thing is.

21:16.020 --> 21:22.740
Good to know. Years ago, you know, in 2020, 2021, I really wasn't sleeping. Well, I wasn't sleeping

21:22.740 --> 21:27.140
enough. The quality of my sleep kept getting interrupted. I kept waking up at the middle of the night. I couldn't

21:27.140 --> 21:32.500
understand why. And then I started taking a supplement routine. I started taking some vitamins

21:32.500 --> 21:37.860
and that did help. But eventually that fizzled out because they were expensive and because I just

21:38.020 --> 21:42.820
couldn't bear taking like 15 pills every day. I would forget or when I was traveling. I didn't

21:42.820 --> 21:48.020
want to take that many. It with me. It was inconvenient. But then I found AG1. And if you're a long-time

21:48.020 --> 21:53.940
listener, you know that I've been drinking AG1 by athletic greens for about two years now. And I get all

21:53.940 --> 21:58.180
the support and the immunity boost in qualities, the mental clarity things. It's really the mental

21:58.180 --> 22:03.380
clarity, which is the reason why I do it. Um, that looks out for my health in one drink instead of

22:03.460 --> 22:09.140
15 different pills and vitamins. Uh, that's because AG1 is a foundational nutrition supplement.

22:09.140 --> 22:13.540
That supports your body's universal needs, like gut optimization, stress management, and immune

22:13.540 --> 22:20.340
support. Since 2010, athletic greens is AG1 drink, has led the future of foundational nutrition,

22:20.340 --> 22:26.500
the tongue twister, the future of foundational nutrition. Continuously refining their formula

22:26.500 --> 22:30.980
to create a smarter and better way to elevate your baseline health. That's really what it is.

22:30.980 --> 22:36.820
Every morning I wake up, I have a glass of water, and then I have my AG1, and then I have my coffee.

22:36.820 --> 22:42.100
And that's like, that's all I need to start the day, feeling good, feeling like I have mental

22:42.100 --> 22:45.940
clarity, and that I've cleared up some of the confusion of waking up, and that I'm off to the races.

22:45.940 --> 22:52.580
That boosts my energy, everything. AG1 is the supplement I trust to provide the support, my body needs

22:52.580 --> 22:57.140

23:19.140 --> 23:24.660
And we're back. Yeah, why that's sure. I was trying to act like a supportive wife.

23:25.220 --> 23:28.820
Honestly, it's kind of patenated in an interesting way. I feel like when

23:28.820 --> 23:33.300
yeah, you see how that black is faded to gray? That's like what people want out of shirts.

23:33.300 --> 23:37.300
Yeah, thank you. Well, it is from July 1. Sorry, let me finish. You might want to crop it.

23:37.300 --> 23:41.940
Yeah, you're right. Or just at least do a tie. Yeah, that's cool.

23:41.940 --> 23:47.060
Tie it up. I'm dressed for a walk, because I'm trying to make an occasion. And for the occasion.

23:47.060 --> 23:50.820
And the job you want. I did sleep in it, and then I thought, oh, this would be kind of nice to

23:50.820 --> 23:56.740
wear on the podcast. Exactly. I'm wearing my worst underwear today. We would never have known.

23:56.740 --> 24:02.660
I know. Okay. Well, it makes it the worst. It's loose. It's thin. It's thread bear. It's like

24:02.660 --> 24:06.500
me and these from five years ago. And you're also in like a very wrinkled suit.

24:08.500 --> 24:15.860
By the way, is this California cocktail enough? I don't know what that means. And so I brought it

24:15.860 --> 24:20.500
to see if this works. And then I'm gonna get it pressed. Yeah, you can pretty much wear any

24:20.500 --> 24:25.220
cool article of clothing. Yeah, it's cool with the little cropped pants, too. Those aren't cropped

24:25.220 --> 24:31.940
pants. He just has very thin legs. I don't know if we'll be able to. Yeah.

24:33.540 --> 24:39.300
Crop. So. You sort of started started that. Do you have a break?

24:40.020 --> 24:44.900
When did you do it? The short suit. I wore it to, did I do it to fix it? No, I wore it to

24:45.780 --> 24:49.460
some wedding. You did do wear it to some wedding. And people were complimenting like,

24:49.460 --> 24:53.540
well, that's smart because it's really hot out. It was Lebron and then you. Yes, that's right. Those

24:53.540 --> 24:58.500
were the two most important people in the first. Oh, that's Lebron and then me. Yeah, I

24:58.500 --> 25:05.300
forgot what wedding. You were the third. Um, I like your glasses. Thank you. We're all

25:06.100 --> 25:11.700
certain. So it's um, but let's just maybe we have to move on Casey. That's, uh,

25:11.700 --> 25:15.700
pet wall. It's a pet wall reference. Got it. Um, I don't know what pet wall is.

25:15.700 --> 25:20.340
Uh, pit wall. It's a formula one podcast that we do here on the, on the head,

25:20.340 --> 25:25.220
going at work. I know that because I listened to every head gum podcast. Same. Same size.

25:25.220 --> 25:31.220
Yeah. Actually, I'm going to start a pet wall. It's been on you podcast. Pet walls good.

25:31.220 --> 25:37.140
I like pet wall. I like it. It sounds like pet sounds. Yeah. Pet wall and that the podcast also sounds

25:37.140 --> 25:41.940
like that. Oh, that's great. Yeah. Then I would listen. Yeah. We need more Brian Wilson.

25:43.540 --> 25:52.980
If I should have a review life was to go on. I just been sitting here trying to figure this out

25:53.540 --> 25:57.540
without asking because I feel like it's a little rude. Well, I can't figure out something's

25:57.540 --> 26:05.700
going to ask. This is the first time you reflected for asking everything in five years. So I can't

26:05.780 --> 26:12.180
imagine how fucked up this question is going to be. What's the why now of your nubsules?

26:12.740 --> 26:16.900
You know, in Hollywood, they're like, why this? Why now? Why are you the one to write this project?

26:16.900 --> 26:22.660
So why are you guys the one to write this story? And why now? Do you remember the gun detail

26:22.660 --> 26:27.380
from the proposal? So it's just that you feel threatened. It had to be now.

26:27.700 --> 26:40.340
It had to be now. This is like a Hollywood exec meeting. Why you? Why now?

26:42.340 --> 26:47.140
Worst sound. Who are you most dreading seeing at the wedding? And don't say Casey because he's here.

26:50.020 --> 26:56.340
Who are you most dreading at the wedding? Well, we obviously aren't an answer that.

26:56.340 --> 27:01.220
No, not honestly, but do you have one personally? I believe it out. Yeah. I guess we're both

27:01.220 --> 27:05.220
thinking of the same person. Do you think why did you invite them then? It was an accident.

27:08.580 --> 27:12.420
I would have thought it was like maybe a family member and you're like, okay, we have to invite

27:12.420 --> 27:19.460
them when you're just accidentally a friend or a family member. I think I know who it is.

27:19.460 --> 27:28.180
Do you know? So it's not goony. And Israel, man, I met 12 years ago as your cousin.

27:29.300 --> 27:33.780
No, goony's not my cousin. Got it. He was racist, actually. Sorry about that.

27:35.780 --> 27:38.820
Listen, we got to send you some shit out. I don't know where this sound is.

27:38.820 --> 27:42.980
Precision is quite nice. Wait, sorry. What was the rude one? What was it? Who are you?

27:42.980 --> 27:46.660
Oh, just why the, what's the why now? Okay. That was a rude state. I see. Yeah.

27:47.460 --> 27:51.220
We are for sure. Well, on that note, let's thicken, thicken.

27:52.180 --> 27:54.660
Casey's infected me. He's Irish.

27:58.900 --> 28:02.500
Beautiful. God forbid, right? I mean, obviously, you guys are going into this,

28:03.780 --> 28:08.820
considering the what-ifs. And I just thought that we should really get all their ducks in the

28:08.820 --> 28:14.260
row, decide on what would happen in the event of separation down the line so that you can

28:14.260 --> 28:18.420
enjoy the wedding, so that you can enjoy the time to be together afterwards to have.

28:18.420 --> 28:21.940
Because that makes sense. So I thought that we could craft a pre-enupural agreement here.

28:21.940 --> 28:27.700
And then I have my, my attorney's office. And she, this is, she's a real attorney. And she's

28:27.700 --> 28:33.140
going to have the whole thing notarized ratified, signed, printed, inked by the next episode.

28:33.140 --> 28:38.180
Wow. It's beautiful. We didn't end up doing any pre-enupural stuff. So this is perfect.

28:38.180 --> 28:40.580
This is tough. Because there's a lot of, you know, first of all, it's like,

28:40.740 --> 28:45.380
I don't know how much it's worth in the future, but for now, Headgum has some value.

28:45.380 --> 28:48.820
And then for you, it's like, you were basically the star of fringe, right? So like,

28:50.820 --> 28:56.580
we're going to, you have, I would say, I mean, I, this is going to sound rude, too. I feel like

28:56.580 --> 29:01.380
obie-tall is more upside. I did also just get a job. And now more, he's using me for my money.

29:01.380 --> 29:05.540
I know. You just got staffed, right? Yeah, he keeps telling me that I'm the breadwinner now.

29:05.540 --> 29:08.580
We have to fucking figure this out. All right. So let's start this.

29:08.740 --> 29:14.580
How about, if, if in, in case of separation, just to for the avoidance of doubt,

29:14.580 --> 29:20.260
not say in case. Let's say when we separate for the, so just to be safe. So we know you're not using

29:20.260 --> 29:26.020
me for my money. I keep all my money and I keep all of your money. I love this. I love this.

29:26.020 --> 29:31.140
We can get more into it because I have lion items here. That's good. So these are contract points set

29:31.140 --> 29:38.500
forth by contracts carousel.com, which I think is the sort of like unabashed leader in free

29:38.500 --> 29:44.340
and up shall agreement discussions. And I just want to make sure that you guys know what you're

29:44.340 --> 29:49.620
getting into here. I mean, marriage is a big deal. I know that you guys own a home, but this is harder

29:49.620 --> 29:55.540
than that, right? Because you can't get into an argument without. Right? What was that look like?

29:56.020 --> 30:01.380
I probably could get into you hear me yelling at my phone. I could probably get mad at the

30:01.380 --> 30:10.340
house similarly. I don't feel consider it. I'm not above it. No, but I'm, I'm serious. I mean,

30:10.340 --> 30:14.340
like, there's, I feel like your career has more heat around it. Oh, okay. I'm here. You're sort

30:14.340 --> 30:18.900
of on ice. So I just think that it's much more realistic. That Abbey Tal is going to come into a

30:18.900 --> 30:23.940
large sum of money over the next decade than it is a mirror. And don't say, oh, I own 30% of

30:23.940 --> 30:29.540
head gum and there's like investors. It's my 30% now. I don't know 30%. Well, then let's sign the

30:29.540 --> 30:37.460
prenapped. How would a percentage do you own? Again, all very, very, very information. Oh, he gave,

30:38.420 --> 30:44.420
so I'm not going to comment. Financial disclosures. Yeah. So according to Kerasel,

30:44.420 --> 30:50.660
contracts, Kerasel, I'm sorry. Now you got me Santa Casey. One of the most set anything in 35 minutes.

30:50.740 --> 30:54.580
And I appreciate you being here. I called Casey last time. I texted you. Yeah. Do you want to tell

30:54.580 --> 31:00.980
the story? Sure. It's a great story. Jeff said, can anybody do the head gum podcast tomorrow morning?

31:02.100 --> 31:08.820
Specifically, are you going to be in the office tomorrow? And I said, no, but I can be and he's like,

31:08.820 --> 31:13.060
great. See you tomorrow. Sorry. We're running out of time. Yeah. And now he's here. He's only asking

31:13.060 --> 31:17.540
you guys about your wedding. Yes. I'm like, okay, great. One of the most significant

31:17.540 --> 31:26.260
prohibitions. It's almost of all of our time. It's the need for both parties to declare

31:26.260 --> 31:32.260
their financial assets and liabilities completely. Right. So it compromises bank accounts,

31:32.260 --> 31:36.900
investments, real estate, debts, and other financial obligations. And without this provision,

31:36.900 --> 31:40.260
the agreement may be invalid if it's later found that one party was dishonest about the

31:40.260 --> 31:44.180
economic situation. Is this a good time to tell you that a mirror has a real gambling problem

31:44.180 --> 31:47.780
and is severely in debt? We are going to get to that. We actually are going to get to it. Nothing

31:47.780 --> 31:53.700
that. Um, I'll be told you can send us in an email. Um, a mirror lets hear it. What? Oh, financial

31:53.700 --> 31:58.660
disclosures. I'll be talking, send it in an email, but I'm here. Let's hear it. Well, we don't have

31:58.660 --> 32:02.260
time for both of you guys to disclose your finances. So I'll be told we'll handle later. Yeah.

32:02.260 --> 32:05.700
I'm here. Let's hear your financial information verbatim line by line.

32:06.260 --> 32:11.060
SOOPED IN NUTTS. Let's go. Let's go. I like the checking account. Thank you, count. Yeah. Where

32:11.060 --> 32:14.900
are you at Chase? JP Morganearn. Are you bad? Be a vapor probably because the closest

32:14.900 --> 32:20.100
branches. You know, you've said that before. Do you want to hear our address out? I think

32:20.100 --> 32:29.540
that would help. We've got it before. I just got right at my door. I'm telling you, he's a fucking

32:29.540 --> 32:35.460
squirrel. And he takes thing to me. I said I want one for the answer. You're garage unit. You're

32:35.460 --> 32:40.580
twoplexed unit. He said there is none. And then you memorized the address. No, you

32:40.580 --> 32:45.140
memorized it way before. I didn't even look at it. No, it's her anything. No, he does it off the top of his head.

32:45.140 --> 32:49.940
And at the time someone gets hired at headgum. Jeff's first thing is to figure out what

32:49.940 --> 32:55.540
they're adding. Addresses and memories. I think it's address. I don't know verbatim, but it's on

32:55.540 --> 33:10.020
Ingridale. Ingridale. I know that that's close. That's the one thing you believe. Investments. What

33:10.020 --> 33:17.700
do you got? Yeah, I'm invested in like stocks and mutual funds. No. Yeah. Yeah. And now the only thing

33:17.700 --> 33:22.580
you're invested in is this marriage. And nothing else.

33:25.060 --> 33:30.180
Yes, thank you. We did already handle real estate. You don't have any vacation rentals.

33:30.180 --> 33:34.020
You don't have any time shares. Yeah, no. No time.

33:34.180 --> 33:40.900
From those Skylar gizondos. That's a time share with Skylar gizondo. Marieka's going to love that.

33:42.180 --> 33:45.780
I know the name actually, but I couldn't tell you why. You don't have a Broadway person?

33:45.780 --> 33:49.060
Yeah. You said Marie. I don't have a Broadway. But he was in like where the millers are something.

33:49.060 --> 33:56.020
Okay. You guys don't have. Oh. You know. That's awesome. That's the only reason I was like, I just

33:56.020 --> 34:02.660
was crazy. That is actually pretty nuts. Can't say. I don't think I can say. That's her lawyer. No. It's not,

34:02.740 --> 34:10.020
yeah. That's funny. You guys don't have like a case. I'm not supposed to say. I. I'll cut that.

34:10.020 --> 34:13.060
Okay. Because I also avoided an NDA just then. Okay.

34:13.700 --> 34:17.700
Did you? This episode so far, 91 seconds long. How did you do that?

34:17.700 --> 34:20.180
How did he said? They bring him fashion.

34:26.180 --> 34:31.060
What? You guys don't have like a fucking beach house or a beach condo. You know that paradise

34:31.060 --> 34:34.660
go. You can get one for like $125,000. I know you can afford that.

34:36.340 --> 34:38.900
And don't say you don't know anything. I know you can afford that.

34:40.500 --> 34:47.300
All of our money is in the world. Which is so down now. Student debt? What? Why are you worried right now?

34:47.300 --> 34:53.460
You're concerned. Just for what? No. Because I don't want you guys to end up split at all.

34:53.460 --> 34:59.060
And then if you do it, I want the finances to just go to the mirror. Why does it matter for you?

34:59.060 --> 35:05.700
Because I'm going to have to see both of them afterwards. And I don't want to have to pick up the pieces

35:05.700 --> 35:13.060
emotionally. You think I'll be told, go to you in the case of a separation?

35:14.980 --> 35:18.660
Also, you were pushing for the separation. You said not in the way.

35:18.660 --> 35:25.300
Forget it. Forget it. Let's move on to division of property. Another common term in a prenuptial agreement

35:25.380 --> 35:30.660
is how the couple's assets will be divided in the demand of a divorce. In some circumstances,

35:30.660 --> 35:35.780
the prenupt may define that a certain asset will stay separate property and not be subject to a division in

35:35.780 --> 35:43.540
divorce. Yeah, the times. So the time share time share. Yeah, we don't have a time share.

35:43.540 --> 35:48.420
But the eventual one, because I know you can afford it. If we get a time share, then I'll be talking

35:48.420 --> 35:52.580
about it. Thank you. That's a huge win for you. All right, moving on to that obligation.

35:54.580 --> 35:59.620
Prenupts can address debt obligations, including those responsible for any debt incurred

35:59.620 --> 36:05.700
during the marriage. Credit card debt, mortgage payments, and other financial obligations may be included.

36:05.700 --> 36:10.340
Without a provision in the prenupt, the couple may have to rely on state laws to determine who's

36:10.340 --> 36:13.860
responsible for paying up the debt. Here's going to be a kind of a problem. If one of you guys has

36:13.860 --> 36:17.620
a ton of debt in the other one doesn't California, common law marriage, right, common law

36:17.620 --> 36:22.260
state. So that's going to be 50, 50 unless you have this swimming in before Sunday, right?

36:22.260 --> 36:26.900
So that's the original. We don't have debt. I didn't go to school. I'm uneducated. So I have no

36:26.900 --> 36:32.660
student debt. I went to public university in 2005. So it's like $4,000. Some people are afforded.

36:32.660 --> 36:38.820
UCB as in upright citizens. You went to UCB. So that's kind of a mic drop. All right. Any

36:38.820 --> 36:43.220
skeletons in your guys' closet or? Literal or?

36:43.220 --> 36:54.500
It's financial or? Maybe, you know, and he said no student debt. You said no. You have a mortgage.

36:54.500 --> 37:00.500
That's kind of considerable debt. You're only eight years into that. So that's 22 years of debt.

37:01.780 --> 37:06.900
And don't say that the monthly payments go down marginally every month that you pay off the

37:06.900 --> 37:10.740
principle. I really don't think so. Because I think you might have done interest only for the

37:10.740 --> 37:17.300
first sentence. Right? You think that? Any other next cards? You think you know about, like,

37:17.300 --> 37:25.060
they're the owners of my wrong. Did you do a 15 year? I don't think so. Did you do five year

37:25.060 --> 37:31.860
ARM? I doubt it. For someone who rents, you know too much about owning property. I'm trying

37:31.860 --> 37:36.660
to figure the shit out. Are you with? I don't know. Forget this. It's not so support.

37:36.660 --> 37:42.260
AKA Alamone. What are we thinking? I keep Luke and then you pay to keep him in that

37:42.260 --> 37:48.180
highlight forever. He's a tiny prince, a small dictator of sorts. And he's a very

37:48.180 --> 37:54.740
expensive king that we have to sort of keep. He dines on ribeye only. You know the story.

37:54.740 --> 37:59.940
In my guru or Japanese, they find out. Japanese marble. The marbling is unbelievable.

38:00.340 --> 38:10.420
And when he doesn't let us even smell it. Inheritance rights, prenatural agreements can also

38:10.420 --> 38:17.220
address inheritance rights. Inheritance rights. A thing's songy voice about what our parents

38:17.220 --> 38:26.180
passing away. Casey, can you hit the wall? No, that's the day, right? Can you fire his ass? No.

38:26.260 --> 38:31.060
Got it. Yeah. It's a my contract. He can't fire me. Yeah. You said that like my pillow.

38:32.660 --> 38:38.020
Well, yeah. We went on my contract.com. Whatever this one is. I'll copy you. That looks pretty.

38:38.020 --> 38:41.700
Natural agreements can also address inheritance rights, including how the couple's assets will be

38:41.700 --> 38:49.220
distributed upon one spouse's death. Not parents. Okay. So to mean if I die, I get every day. If I die,

38:50.100 --> 38:56.900
if I die and fight, I die. So you basically run so fast into the Wall Street bull that you're gone.

38:58.900 --> 39:04.980
Based just on physical appearance, I feel like this one is only relevant to how

39:04.980 --> 39:10.180
obitals life will be post-woven felt. But what's the plan here, guys? For what? I said based just on

39:10.180 --> 39:15.700
physical appearance, you're the only one who will have to deal with a death. Oh, I see. Because he's

39:15.940 --> 39:23.700
saying that. Yeah. What's the plan? It's nice that he's alive. But I guess if he dies, it's good that

39:23.700 --> 39:28.420
I'll have everything. I get that. Are you splitting it? Is it all going to her or some of it going to

39:28.420 --> 39:33.700
me or who would never go to you? I feel like, but in a way, you know, you know, when you like walk

39:33.700 --> 39:38.660
behind somebody. I was being judged, but then I felt a little bad. That's the difference between you.

39:38.660 --> 39:42.820
You so see a pack. You'll judge about anything. I'll be told who has a kind heart. She doesn't.

39:42.820 --> 39:51.620
She feels like he's worried about people on YouTube thinking I'm a mom. Yeah. I'll be hanged and

39:51.620 --> 39:58.500
quartered for that. Last one's business interests. Do you own a business? No. Okay. So we don't have

39:58.500 --> 40:01.540
anything to worry about because we have it's just head gum. You know, and that's going to be belly

40:01.540 --> 40:06.980
up in the next five years, right? Probably by new years. But one day I will start a business and it

40:06.980 --> 40:11.220
will be a competing podcast network and it will put head gum under. So I'll get there. Thank you.

40:11.300 --> 40:17.700
I'll tear that. Oh. I'll call it butt gum.

40:21.300 --> 40:25.860
Welcome to the Jeffley wed game. What am I? Why? Yeah.

40:29.860 --> 40:36.020
It's you. I think it's fun to have you. All right. Yeah. We'll take that. You can also say that for any episode

40:36.100 --> 40:41.300
you've been on. Why are any of us ever here? Let's say I had our lovely couple. I introduced

40:41.300 --> 40:48.100
yourselves. Hey, my name is Amir Blumenfeld. I'm from Los Angeles. Yeah. I know.

40:54.580 --> 41:00.020
This is the Jeffley wed game. It's the newly wed game with the twist and you'll find out the twist later.

41:00.820 --> 41:06.100
Oh, on you. Now on you's here. Now on you said she can make it. I begged her to come on this episode.

41:06.100 --> 41:15.940
Hey, on you. Nobody's there. All right. This is the Jeffley wed game. It's basically like the

41:15.940 --> 41:21.940
newly wed game with the twist. I love it. I'm going to have to ask you to leave the room for

41:21.940 --> 41:26.260
and then we'll scream for you to come back in. All right. This is just for like this is exactly like the

41:26.260 --> 41:32.020
newly wed game. So, you know, have some water out of the shelter. Really? Just for like three minutes.

41:32.020 --> 41:36.500
Just for three minutes. Up on the table. And we'll call you back in and then a mural goes on.

41:36.500 --> 41:40.900
Does that make sense? This is basically how well do you guys know each other and how strong is the union.

41:40.900 --> 41:45.380
Right. Yeah. So we'll literally scream a blood curling scream at the top of our lines.

41:45.380 --> 41:51.620
We're going to get the radio not wedding. Exactly. All right. Amir. Yeah.

41:52.260 --> 41:57.700
Uh, why these are these are just questions for you. This is how I think she'll respond. Exactly.

41:57.700 --> 42:00.900
Well, it's also about what you think. It's a little bit different than the newly wed game. It's

42:00.900 --> 42:07.300
a Jeffley wed game. Why would you? Why would your spouse say that she is the better catch?

42:08.580 --> 42:17.460
She's younger and more attractive than she. Do you understand that the reason your spouse is never

42:17.540 --> 42:22.740
really shelled out for an expensive birthday gift is that you're not worth the price? No, I don't think that.

42:23.620 --> 42:30.900
What is your spouse's guilty pleasure? You? No. My spouse's guilty pleasure is

42:32.260 --> 42:37.700
you can you can refer to her by name, can't you? This is not a newly wed game because I'm usually multiple

42:37.780 --> 42:42.660
participants. Well, this is the Jeffley wed game. Okay. That's true. She likes

42:46.500 --> 42:53.700
sweets. I guess candies and what's your favorite candy? She's more of a pastry woman like

42:53.700 --> 42:59.940
some cookies and yeah, can't have like anything sweet in the house. Your spouse takes your hand

42:59.940 --> 43:05.380
and pulls you to the dance floor. She leans in and tells you this song reminds me of you. Why is

43:05.380 --> 43:11.620
that song just the sounds of non-as-anesthetic oral surgery? Why is it that I asked that on the

43:11.620 --> 43:15.860
newly wed game? No, this is a Jeff that on the Jeffley wed game. Do you want me to refer? It would be a

43:15.860 --> 43:22.100
different song. It wouldn't be that. Why is that song just the sounds of non-anesthetic oral surgery?

43:22.100 --> 43:32.180
Because she thinks I have a nice teeth. All right. Thank you so much. We're going to have to ask you

43:32.180 --> 43:59.060
to pop out and grab a towel and bring her back in for her. How's your heart? How's your

43:59.060 --> 44:16.820
love life? I can hear there's music. Yeah, there's music. We didn't talk about anything in the mean

44:16.820 --> 44:26.100
time. Yeah. That's me. I'm here. All right. So questions for I would tell. What did your spouse or

44:26.100 --> 44:33.060
sorry? Why did your spouse wear mariles on the first date? Or did he just have marile wearing

44:33.060 --> 44:38.020
energy? I don't know what mariles are. Do you want to pull up a photo of mariles and then I'll

44:38.020 --> 44:45.540
ask that question? Yeah, okay. Sorry. Oh, I don't know what it is either. People under 30 will love that.

44:47.540 --> 44:52.900
Your spouse has the day off and he's spell it. M-E-R-R-E-L. We're staying in a photo of us.

44:53.380 --> 45:03.380
All right. Your spouse has the day off and an empty house. Why does your spouse choose? Yeah.

45:04.180 --> 45:15.940
Let's see. Oh, yeah. These are ugly. Can you show it to camera one? I'll put it in a lower third.

45:16.660 --> 45:20.900
You're spouse has the day off. Okay, we're leaving scheduling for Monday morning. Any

45:20.900 --> 45:26.980
ways to progress? Okay, great. Your spouse has the day off and an empty house. Why does your spouse

45:26.980 --> 45:35.940
spend the day bad? Spend it bad? Yes. Because he's bad. Got it. I know this is like asking.

45:35.940 --> 45:41.780
And he had to leave for this? Yes. Got it. I know this is like asking like which viral disease is your

45:41.780 --> 45:48.900
favorite, but what was your best date with Amir? Did you ask him this question too? Different

45:48.900 --> 45:55.060
questions. Great. Oh, oh, I feel like I need an answer faster, but now I'm really thinking about it

45:55.060 --> 46:00.100
and I don't. None of them have been, no. There was a day that we went to

46:02.100 --> 46:08.180
Disconso Gardens. That was really fun. What one was that? Approximately. Five years ago. Really?

46:08.180 --> 46:13.220
Yeah, maybe. We don't go on dates. And we don't like each other anymore. No, we said we never stop.

46:13.220 --> 46:18.980
This is my best advice. Never stop dating your wife. That's right. I'll never stop dating my wife.

46:18.980 --> 46:24.260
Um, all right. Thank you. Let's bring Amir back again.

46:24.260 --> 46:26.260
Amir!

46:39.140 --> 46:44.660
Put us on chairs. Let's just do the next thing. Fucking sit!

46:45.700 --> 46:48.660
Wasted airtime! Come on!

46:57.380 --> 47:04.740
You like me? Well, wait, let's see how you answered these questions first before I commit.

47:04.820 --> 47:08.660
It's the Jeff Lee wed game. It's not the newly wed game. So you guys aren't privy to that

47:08.660 --> 47:13.380
information to incentivize you to listen to the episode, right? To get those two impressions.

47:13.380 --> 47:17.220
That's true. You're not going to say them right now. Well, I want to make sure that see the thing is

47:17.220 --> 47:22.260
is getting their their ad package. You know, their money's worth. So you have to listen to the

47:22.260 --> 47:26.260
episode if you want to listen to what they said. All right, here we go. I can also ask you on the way home.

47:26.260 --> 47:32.580
Yeah, right now. What did you say? Yeah. All right, time to play most likely to. All right.

47:33.540 --> 47:37.460
Casey, you're the judge. Let's bring you in on this. All right. Basically, you have to judge if they're lying or not.

47:37.460 --> 47:42.420
Okay. All right, here we go. Lightning round, really. Most likely to accidentally find a portal

47:42.420 --> 47:44.980
to another dimension.

47:46.260 --> 47:55.940
It's a set. Say it. I mean, sorry, Casey. I don't think she's lying. Great.

47:56.900 --> 48:02.900
And Amir said, Avitall. Yeah. I do think he is lying.

48:06.580 --> 48:11.220
Because it's the truth as we know it. Because I think Amir thinks he'll find the portal. But he said that you

48:11.220 --> 48:19.060
would be interesting. I think you think I would. Yeah, I'm just guessing. Because he wouldn't be open to it.

48:19.060 --> 48:23.540
He would be like, that's not anything. Yeah, he'd ask you to do a bit of cool. Here we go. Okay, right?

48:24.340 --> 48:26.980
Most likely to drive his Mazda into a deer.

48:28.020 --> 48:32.180
Probably me because I have the Mazda. Amir. Okay. Because I love deer.

48:32.980 --> 48:39.060
Yeah. Amir's telling the truth. Oh, he's shit. Okay. Most likely to miss their flight

48:39.060 --> 48:45.060
because they packed at the last minute. Definitely Avitall. Definitely me. Casey, I'm like an acquaintance to

48:45.060 --> 48:51.220
how tall. They seem confident. I'll say they're telling the truth for sure for sure. All right.

48:51.220 --> 48:57.300
Most likely to get high to numb his emotions surrounding Jake's sold out NADPOD at Cardiol.

48:58.580 --> 49:01.620
The first part was Avitall. The second part was me. What's that?

49:03.460 --> 49:09.940
Most likely to get high to numb out is Avitall. The specific Jake on NADPOD was would be me.

49:09.940 --> 49:14.820
It's only a very full question. So let's hear the second part. So I guess he's jumping to repeat it? No, I guess

49:14.820 --> 49:20.740
me the most likely to get high to numb his jealousy. He's still more likely me. Really?

49:20.740 --> 49:30.580
Yeah, because Jake and I have shared in how little Amir gets jealous. Like we have

49:30.580 --> 49:34.660
more heightened emotions. We are more likely to be jealous overall than Amir or Jill.

49:34.660 --> 49:38.660
Is that because you're at peace with yourself Amir or is that because you don't feel anything?

49:39.380 --> 49:44.420
Yes. That's a question for our therapist, I guess.

49:44.820 --> 49:51.300
Do you not in singular therapy? I was and then I stopped going. Sounds like my dad. Why?

49:51.300 --> 50:02.340
He might be your dad. Most likely to clap when the plane lands. Neither of us. Really?

50:02.340 --> 50:08.100
Yeah. I was clapping now. But not when the plane lands. All right. Most likely to have to

50:08.100 --> 50:23.780
bust out of the truth. I'm here. That's me. I love Vegas.

50:23.780 --> 50:31.140
That's true. And then the last one, most likely to get kind of too drunk at the wedding.

50:32.100 --> 50:40.820
I'm just like the cases. Yeah. Casey. Yeah. Okay. Sure. I would say I'm more likely than you,

50:40.820 --> 50:50.420
but probably neither of us will. Yeah. Did we win? You definitely won and your prize is that

50:52.820 --> 50:56.740
I don't know. Your prize that I won't dox the wedding. Else we've everything out or I'll release

50:56.740 --> 51:07.540
this next week. You're welcome. What are you most excited about for the wedding?

51:07.540 --> 51:13.780
For the wedding or for your entire marriage? For the wedding. I want the marriage one.

51:15.540 --> 51:19.780
For the wedding, I am really excited to be at that wedding venue. And then I'm excited to see

51:19.780 --> 51:25.140
like Marieka and Jake. Okay. I love his love. His love is love is love. So I like I'm

51:25.620 --> 51:29.220
about my dress. You don't give a shit. He really doesn't care about your business. Wow.

51:29.220 --> 51:32.740
I'm excited. What kind of cake is it? Is the vanilla home in class? There's going to be

51:32.740 --> 51:36.740
more than one cake. None of them are like traditional wedding cakes, but there'll be several

51:36.740 --> 51:41.140
normal cakes. I've always pretty hands off for planning the wedding. Exactly right.

51:41.140 --> 51:46.260
I love cake. I love cake. Care about as the cake. Yeah. That's true. And the music.

51:46.260 --> 51:50.340
Care a lot about the music. Yeah. We'll be playing cake by the ocean. Nice. Thank you.

51:50.420 --> 51:59.860
At a long cake. Okay. Nice. I'm really excited. I love weddings. I've been to one since

51:59.860 --> 52:05.060
Jake's. So this is other than to a cake since Jake's. I said I'm excited for the wedding.

52:05.060 --> 52:12.100
Oh, sorry. And what are you most excited about for the marriage? Probably the linking and building

52:12.100 --> 52:16.580
of it all. I mean, I want to see how this brings you guys together financially, mostly.

52:16.900 --> 52:23.220
Are you going to see that? How will you see it? I'll probably break into our bank accounts.

52:23.220 --> 52:27.700
Jeff will be a guarantor on our joint savings. I was going to say a trust store.

52:28.580 --> 52:32.820
So because here's the thing, did you guys buy your house through a trust or is it in your name?

52:34.820 --> 52:45.300
Plugs. Plugs. What do you guys have going on other than the obvious? Do you want to plug the

52:45.300 --> 52:49.940
wedding? It seems like you want to keep everything under wraps. Yes. We do. Yes. Don't plug it.

52:51.220 --> 52:55.300
You can still watch Passover.gate because Jeffery and Amir are both in it. Oh, that's good.

52:55.300 --> 52:59.540
Passover.gate out during the filming of that. I don't remember what I said because it was improvised.

52:59.540 --> 53:04.980
Yeah. Was it was, I know that the show was good, but was my episode. Yeah. It was a semi-scripted

53:04.980 --> 53:10.500
web series starring Avitalia. People really like the Holy Star of Justin's. That's right. Passover.gate. That's

53:10.500 --> 53:16.500
right. That's the URL slash title. And I social distance. I found really annoying to type.

53:16.500 --> 53:23.540
And also, frankly, not as punchy as ever. Thank you. And that's the link. I said Passover.gate is good.

53:23.540 --> 53:32.180
Passover.gate is good. Let's see your plugs. Pitwall podcast. I don't know when this episode

53:32.180 --> 53:37.460
comes out. I know this Friday. Ideally. This Friday. Either ideally this Friday or next Friday.

53:37.460 --> 53:41.220
Okay. Well, we just had Riley on the show. Oh, that's fun. Yeah. Jeffery's going to be there.

53:41.220 --> 53:47.940
But he slept through it. No, it's purpose. Not a plan. My phone was plugged in with an alarm.

53:47.940 --> 53:52.740
Another plug. Yeah. And Puntel plugs. Don't you have those? I don't know.

53:52.740 --> 53:56.260
I actually met Dr. Arthur Benz and who I sent you to. Yeah.

53:57.460 --> 54:03.780
He needs to plug me. Oh, plug it up. I thought he needs to plug me. Puntel or otherwise.

54:04.740 --> 54:11.380
But and Puntel my favorite plug. And the eye doctor does the butt exactly right. The Puntel is my partner.

54:11.380 --> 54:15.540
I think because you mentioned that I was the star of the friend. I'm going to hopefully after this

54:15.540 --> 54:20.580
job ends toward again. So go if you would like to go. I would like to go to go. Yeah, please.

54:20.580 --> 54:26.740
I heard that it was good from who friends of mine saw it who are at fringe. They said Heidi

54:26.740 --> 54:32.420
you are not, but yeah. That's cool. But also. Yeah. It's dark. But that's very dark. Yeah. That's nice.

54:32.420 --> 54:38.020
But if you go, if you go to Abitalash.com, just try to actually get that plug in, then you'll have

54:38.020 --> 54:42.740
that will be dates and updates to sign up for the email list. Nice. Sorry. I feel like I took the plugs

54:42.740 --> 54:47.940
too seriously. No, you should. That's the only part of this that's worth while for you. I'm here.

54:47.940 --> 54:53.540
Follow me on Instagram. I'm at Abitalash. Nice. Nice. Oh, that's sweet.

54:54.420 --> 55:01.380
You're keeping your name. Yeah. I'm pushing for him to take mine. But Amir Ash, I don't mind that.

55:01.380 --> 55:07.780
Right. It sounds like a small rash, though. Amir Ash. Amir Ash. It's a mirror rash.

55:07.780 --> 55:13.620
Yeah. It's just a secret. Yeah. Yeah. You don't hear it till he says it that way.

55:13.620 --> 55:20.100
Amir Ash makes sense. You don't say Amir Ash. Yeah. I do think Amir Ash sounds like a cooler guy. Thank you.

55:20.100 --> 55:25.140
And I should send you a lower last name than Blumenfeld for sure. Yeah. But you drive the

55:25.140 --> 55:30.660
back. That is the only thing that nobody can say. Amir Ash. But you say Amir Ash. But it's not Amir

55:30.660 --> 55:35.860
Ash. It's Amir Ash. Amir Ash. What about Amir Ash? Because you're brother. Take it. They did

55:35.860 --> 55:40.420
a portmen to him and his wife, right? It became blue. Yeah. They changed their last name. You don't

55:40.420 --> 55:45.380
say what it's like. Ash is sold. Yeah. Then we lose everything that's good about Ash. We love

55:45.700 --> 55:54.420
Luminous rash. You're obviously not taking this seriously. If you can't even, yeah. If you

55:54.420 --> 55:58.820
can't even take a plug section seriously. Amir, are you going to take the vows? That's right. You'll

55:58.820 --> 56:25.780
be there and find out. IRL. That was a hit-dum original.

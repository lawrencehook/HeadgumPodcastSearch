that are like one degree of separation from each other.

00:35.980 --> 00:38.980
So I'm just going to use it for emphasis.

00:38.980 --> 00:41.980
New York Shitty Style, right?

00:41.980 --> 00:43.980
We're back at it again.

00:43.980 --> 00:46.980
We should say the corner of three.

00:46.980 --> 00:47.980
Can you say that?

00:47.980 --> 00:48.980
Okay.

00:48.980 --> 00:51.980
There you go.

00:51.980 --> 00:52.980
How's that?

00:52.980 --> 00:55.980
You can turn the can's down a little bit.

00:55.980 --> 00:56.980
Can's, she says.

00:56.980 --> 00:57.980
Yeah.

00:57.980 --> 00:59.980
Very small studio.

00:59.980 --> 01:04.980
I don't know if it's obvious, but Marieka's like a yard away from me right here.

01:04.980 --> 01:06.980
It actually isn't obvious.

01:06.980 --> 01:07.980
It looks like it is across the room.

01:07.980 --> 01:08.980
Yeah.

01:08.980 --> 01:09.980
It really isn't.

01:09.980 --> 01:10.980
It's uncomfortably close.

01:10.980 --> 01:12.980
I can't see Joel at all.

01:12.980 --> 01:13.980
Yeah, that's true.

01:13.980 --> 01:18.980
But Joel can, here's the thing, Joel can see you on this camera screen.

01:18.980 --> 01:19.980
One, two, five.

01:19.980 --> 01:20.980
Is that smile?

01:20.980 --> 01:21.980
Nice.

01:21.980 --> 01:23.980
Nice.

01:23.980 --> 01:25.980
This sucks.

01:26.980 --> 01:29.980
Right?

01:33.980 --> 01:35.980
Marieka and I saw Broadway show last night.

01:35.980 --> 01:37.980
I think that's fair to say, because it is the truth.

01:37.980 --> 01:38.980
It does the truth.

01:38.980 --> 01:40.980
We saw your lives, love.

01:40.980 --> 01:41.980
Almost fucked it up.

01:41.980 --> 01:42.980
Yep.

01:44.980 --> 01:47.980
Lots questions, concerns for me.

01:47.980 --> 01:49.980
Not for the cast, not for the creators.

01:49.980 --> 01:50.980
For you.

01:50.980 --> 01:51.980
In a way.

01:51.980 --> 01:52.980
Yeah.

01:52.980 --> 01:53.980
I want to do enjoy it.

01:53.980 --> 01:54.980
I enjoyed the show.

01:54.980 --> 01:55.980
No.

01:55.980 --> 01:56.980
Okay.

01:56.980 --> 01:57.980
But not with me.

01:57.980 --> 02:01.980
Like you enjoyed the act of going to a Broadway show with me.

02:01.980 --> 02:03.980
No, it was good.

02:03.980 --> 02:06.980
I feel like you're lying.

02:06.980 --> 02:08.980
No, I really like going with you.

02:08.980 --> 02:10.980
And I wanted to go to musical with you for a long time.

02:10.980 --> 02:12.980
So it was nice to finally do that.

02:12.980 --> 02:13.980
Yeah.

02:13.980 --> 02:14.980
But you hated the show.

02:14.980 --> 02:15.980
I know.

02:15.980 --> 02:16.980
I really liked the show.

02:16.980 --> 02:17.980
There was like two songs.

02:17.980 --> 02:18.980
Sorry.

02:18.980 --> 02:19.980
Numbers.

02:19.980 --> 02:21.980
That were a little bit garbage water.

02:21.980 --> 02:22.980
Okay.

02:22.980 --> 02:23.980
But everything else.

02:23.980 --> 02:25.980
I don't remember the names.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.980
Well, what was, what were the parts?

02:27.980 --> 02:32.980
I am going to look up the track listing.

02:32.980 --> 02:35.980
I feel free to play along at home.

02:35.980 --> 02:37.980
Yes, which songs of here lies love.

02:37.980 --> 02:38.980
Jeff didn't like.

02:38.980 --> 02:39.980
Yeah.

02:39.980 --> 02:41.980
Because it is a to mostly sung through show.

02:41.980 --> 02:44.980
With music by the different flat voice.

02:44.980 --> 02:45.980
Flat voice.

02:45.980 --> 02:46.980
Flat voice.

02:49.980 --> 02:52.980
I'm always interested in these sorts of events where people are like,

02:52.980 --> 02:55.980
I really want to see a Broadway show with you.

02:55.980 --> 02:58.980
Because in some ways, it's solitary.

02:58.980 --> 02:59.980
Right.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.980
It's a lot of avenue isn't good.

03:02.980 --> 03:03.980
That's yeah.

03:03.980 --> 03:05.980
That's the one where they're like fighting.

03:05.980 --> 03:06.980
Yeah.

03:06.980 --> 03:08.980
I kind of like that friend character didn't matter.

03:08.980 --> 03:09.980
Yeah.

03:09.980 --> 03:11.980
I like the choreography during that show.

03:11.980 --> 03:12.980
That's true.

03:12.980 --> 03:13.980
That's true.

03:13.980 --> 03:14.980
Because they're like pretending to walk.

03:14.980 --> 03:17.980
One of my favorite things to do too is to say just like an opinion that I have.

03:17.980 --> 03:19.980
And then but say it like it's fact.

03:19.980 --> 03:20.980
Yeah.

03:20.980 --> 03:21.980
So like that song is bad.

03:21.980 --> 03:22.980
Yeah.

03:22.980 --> 03:23.980
It's nothing.

03:23.980 --> 03:24.980
It's not that I don't like it.

03:24.980 --> 03:25.980
Yeah.

03:25.980 --> 03:27.980
But order 181 was maybe my favorite.

03:27.980 --> 03:28.980
That's very good.

03:28.980 --> 03:29.980
Your lies love is great.

03:29.980 --> 03:30.980
Thank you.

03:30.980 --> 03:32.980
I don't know how to say it.

03:32.980 --> 03:33.980
There we go.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.980
Everyone so great on it.

03:35.980 --> 03:36.980
Mm-hmm.

03:36.980 --> 03:39.980
And we should say also to your point, Joel.

03:39.980 --> 03:42.980
The tickets that we had are we're standing room tickets.

03:42.980 --> 03:44.980
I've never seen a musical like this.

03:44.980 --> 03:45.980
Yeah.

03:45.980 --> 03:46.980
Is immersive.

03:46.980 --> 03:49.980
Like you're in a dance club.

03:49.980 --> 03:50.980
Yeah.

03:50.980 --> 03:54.980
So we were it was less of an opportunity to go into a dance theater.

03:54.980 --> 03:55.980
Yeah.

03:55.980 --> 03:56.980
It was way.

03:56.980 --> 03:59.980
But a dance club where they sort of force you to dance.

03:59.980 --> 04:01.980
When and where and how to dance.

04:01.980 --> 04:02.980
Right.

04:02.980 --> 04:03.980
It's like the songs are instructions.

04:03.980 --> 04:04.980
Exactly.

04:04.980 --> 04:05.980
There was a line dance where you had to.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.980
That was my least favorite part.

04:07.980 --> 04:09.980
That was maybe the other song that I was like this is.

04:09.980 --> 04:11.980
Why was it your least favorite part though?

04:11.980 --> 04:13.980
The dance is simple and bad.

04:13.980 --> 04:15.980
I didn't want to line dance.

04:15.980 --> 04:16.980
But you didn't have to.

04:16.980 --> 04:17.980
And you did.

04:17.980 --> 04:19.980
And you put Gusto into it that you didn't need to.

04:19.980 --> 04:20.980
Yeah.

04:20.980 --> 04:21.980
Because I did.

04:21.980 --> 04:22.980
Listen.

04:22.980 --> 04:23.980
There's two good options.

04:23.980 --> 04:25.980
One is to not participate at all.

04:25.980 --> 04:27.980
But that's not even the good.

04:27.980 --> 04:31.980
The best one is to like participate in a way that makes you look like you're really getting into

04:31.980 --> 04:32.980
it.

04:32.980 --> 04:34.980
So you allow others around you to have the freedom to look like animals.

04:34.980 --> 04:36.980
And I'm never going to be that person.

04:36.980 --> 04:37.980
No.

04:37.980 --> 04:38.980
And you shouldn't be.

04:38.980 --> 04:39.980
I don't know why I did that.

04:39.980 --> 04:44.980
But I do think that half-heartedly line dancing is maybe the same in the world.

04:44.980 --> 04:47.980
So I really needed to put some effort in.

04:47.980 --> 04:48.980
Fair enough.

04:48.980 --> 04:49.980
Fair enough.

04:49.980 --> 04:52.980
I don't like when they tell you to jump because I'm never going to jump.

04:52.980 --> 04:53.980
Yeah.

04:53.980 --> 04:54.980
There were a lot of things.

04:54.980 --> 04:55.980
They were like, jump.

04:55.980 --> 04:59.980
I'm just like, I have to kill these heel problems growing up.

04:59.980 --> 05:00.980
So I don't know if I'm going to jump.

05:00.980 --> 05:02.980
Very thin ankles.

05:02.980 --> 05:03.980
Yeah.

05:03.980 --> 05:05.980
My kill is heel is thus.

05:05.980 --> 05:06.980
Yeah.

05:06.980 --> 05:11.980
And I also, I don't know if this isn't just in this specific scenario.

05:11.980 --> 05:15.980
But at any time, I'm required to put my hands up.

05:15.980 --> 05:16.980
Yeah.

05:16.980 --> 05:17.980
I don't want to.

05:17.980 --> 05:18.980
I can't.

05:18.980 --> 05:21.980
I like physically can't do it.

05:27.980 --> 05:31.980
So you don't like line dancing to all I do is win.

05:31.980 --> 05:35.980
Is there a specific dance or everybody's hands go up?

05:35.980 --> 05:36.980
Yeah.

05:36.980 --> 05:38.980
My would go up, but they would not stay there.

05:38.980 --> 05:39.980
Sure.

05:39.980 --> 05:40.980
Yeah.

05:40.980 --> 05:43.980
I physically like can't make myself do it.

05:43.980 --> 05:44.980
It's very strange.

05:44.980 --> 05:45.980
Yeah.

05:45.980 --> 05:46.980
Sorry.

05:46.980 --> 05:47.980
I just talk amongst yourselves.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.980
I trusted her to focus the cameras and she didn't.

05:50.980 --> 05:53.980
I absolutely did.

05:53.980 --> 05:54.980
What's the problem?

05:54.980 --> 05:56.980
Maybe it just looks bad on the monitor.

05:56.980 --> 05:57.980
It might.

05:57.980 --> 06:04.980
I did because I did the thing that Casey tells us to do.

06:04.980 --> 06:07.980
So loud.

06:07.980 --> 06:08.980
So loud.

06:09.980 --> 06:10.980
I like that song.

06:10.980 --> 06:11.980
That was it.

06:11.980 --> 06:14.980
It is a beggar, but insanely loud.

06:14.980 --> 06:16.980
I'm trying to find some new sounds.

06:16.980 --> 06:20.980
So I thought that we could maybe just, I could press some buttons and you guys could tell

06:20.980 --> 06:21.980
me whether they're winners or not.

06:21.980 --> 06:22.980
Gotcha.

06:22.980 --> 06:23.980
Is that fair?

06:23.980 --> 06:24.980
Yeah.

06:24.980 --> 06:25.980
Or would you have more to say?

06:25.980 --> 06:26.980
Sure.

06:26.980 --> 06:27.980
Previous one was a winner.

06:27.980 --> 06:28.980
Got it.

06:28.980 --> 06:29.980
Okay.

06:29.980 --> 06:32.980
Maybe like let's edit the volume though.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.980
Thing is, I don't know if sounds are objectively good or bad.

06:38.980 --> 06:40.980
Or if it's more about how you use them.

06:40.980 --> 06:43.980
That's true, but they have to have potential for use.

06:43.980 --> 06:48.980
Like, if you don't, if you hear this out and you can't see where it would be placed

06:48.980 --> 06:49.980
in the show, it's not the winner.

06:49.980 --> 06:50.980
Yeah.

06:56.980 --> 06:57.980
That's a keeper.

06:57.980 --> 06:58.980
That's a keeper.

07:06.980 --> 07:07.980
Sounded like a whale.

07:08.980 --> 07:09.980
I don't know.

07:09.980 --> 07:10.980
I don't know.

07:16.980 --> 07:18.980
Is that, was that editor?

07:18.980 --> 07:19.980
That's it.

07:30.980 --> 07:35.980
I like the last two, but I wish they were longer.

07:35.980 --> 07:36.980
This one's long.

07:36.980 --> 07:37.980
I don't like it though.

07:37.980 --> 07:40.980
I think we need more like intro music kind of stuff.

07:40.980 --> 07:41.980
Okay.

07:41.980 --> 07:42.980
Okay.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.980
Like, I want to enter the studio to that.

08:02.980 --> 08:03.980
Yeah.

08:03.980 --> 08:05.980
The announced like a wrestler.

08:05.980 --> 08:06.980
Yeah.

08:06.980 --> 08:07.980
For sure.

08:07.980 --> 08:12.980
I did want to do a straight up like boxing match between me and a mirror.

08:12.980 --> 08:14.980
I also really wasn't allowed to show.

08:14.980 --> 08:21.980
No, I think there'll be, I, one of the gaming channels I used to watch

08:21.980 --> 08:26.980
did like a wrestling thing where they trained to be wrestlers,

08:26.980 --> 08:29.980
and then like actually learned like the flips and stuff.

08:29.980 --> 08:30.980
Yeah.

08:30.980 --> 08:33.980
But I think it would be really funny if you guys just know training

08:33.980 --> 08:36.980
when into a boxing ring.

08:36.980 --> 08:41.980
I'm just kind of like, swatted at each other.

08:41.980 --> 08:46.980
The issue is I think like, the reason why boxers do what they do,

08:46.980 --> 08:51.980
correct me if I'm wrong, Joel, is that they're making millions of dollars.

08:51.980 --> 08:53.980
That's probably fair.

08:53.980 --> 08:54.980
Sorry.

08:54.980 --> 08:56.980
I said, correct me if I'm wrong, Joel.

08:56.980 --> 08:58.980
I'm not correcting you.

08:58.980 --> 09:00.980
So I'm wrong.

09:00.980 --> 09:01.980
I'm right.

09:01.980 --> 09:02.980
You're right.

09:02.980 --> 09:03.980
I didn't even correct you.

09:03.980 --> 09:04.980
I just gave you.

09:04.980 --> 09:06.980
No, I, I, I agreed.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.980
I think a lot of boxers do it for the love of the game.

09:09.980 --> 09:10.980
Yeah.

09:10.980 --> 09:16.980
Like they have some internal aggression that feels good to let out.

09:16.980 --> 09:17.980
I don't know.

09:17.980 --> 09:20.980
I don't know what to do.

09:20.980 --> 09:26.980
Um, I also, I mean, there's like creator clash.

09:26.980 --> 09:30.980
I think it would be really funny if somehow you guys ended up at that event.

09:31.980 --> 09:32.980
What is that?

09:32.980 --> 09:34.980
Is that a boxing match for like YouTube?

09:34.980 --> 09:35.980
Yeah.

09:35.980 --> 09:36.980
Literally, yes.

09:36.980 --> 09:38.980
How much did they get paid?

09:38.980 --> 09:40.980
I'm trying to like, they do it for charities.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.980
I don't want to, I don't want to do it for charity.

09:42.980 --> 09:44.980
I'll do something else for charity.

09:44.980 --> 09:46.980
Have you ever thought of anyone physically?

09:46.980 --> 09:47.980
Yeah.

09:47.980 --> 09:48.980
Physically.

09:48.980 --> 09:52.980
Uh, not like throwing hands, but like, I've never said that.

09:52.980 --> 09:55.980
It sounded so wrong coming out.

09:55.980 --> 09:59.980
I, I got in like an altercation in college once.

09:59.980 --> 10:00.980
Yeah.

10:00.980 --> 10:02.980
What was the situation?

10:02.980 --> 10:06.980
If I tell the story, I'm going to sound like I'm telling the story to be a hero.

10:06.980 --> 10:07.980
Wow.

10:07.980 --> 10:09.980
Sometimes you are a hero.

10:09.980 --> 10:11.980
You could tell the story.

10:11.980 --> 10:14.980
You could tell us about PJ clerks.

10:14.980 --> 10:16.980
It's either or.

10:16.980 --> 10:18.980
I guess.

10:18.980 --> 10:20.980
You didn't want to tell the story.

10:20.980 --> 10:21.980
I was giving you an out.

10:21.980 --> 10:23.980
What about this?

10:23.980 --> 10:25.980
No.

10:25.980 --> 10:28.980
This is, I'm not like pulling these out of thin air.

10:28.980 --> 10:30.980
The, the soundboard website that I use.

10:30.980 --> 10:33.980
This is, they're like, most popular sounds.

10:33.980 --> 10:36.980
And there's no way somebody's using this, that often.

10:36.980 --> 10:55.980
I really didn't think you could rhyme this much in Mandarin.

10:56.980 --> 10:57.980
That was sick.

10:57.980 --> 10:59.980
It was really cool.

10:59.980 --> 11:01.980
I couldn't plan the time signature.

11:01.980 --> 11:03.980
Let's take a break.

11:07.980 --> 11:10.980
Guys, I want to tell you about a new show that I think you're going to love.

11:10.980 --> 11:11.980
All right.

11:11.980 --> 11:13.980
It's called See the Thing is.

11:13.980 --> 11:14.980
It's called See the Thing is.

11:14.980 --> 11:19.980
It's hosted by Grammy Award winning R&B artist Bridget Kelly and media personality,

11:19.980 --> 11:20.980
Mandy B.

11:20.980 --> 11:24.980
Every week Bridget and Mandy offer grown honest and slightly toxic takes on all

11:24.980 --> 11:28.980
things, music, pop culture and of course dating and relationships.

11:28.980 --> 11:29.980
All right.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.980
I do a segment on this show called dating in LA.

11:31.980 --> 11:33.980
Nobody likes to talk about it.

11:33.980 --> 11:34.980
So the segments go kind of poor.

11:34.980 --> 11:37.980
So if you always wanted to know what that segment could have been,

11:37.980 --> 11:40.980
this show has it for you.

11:40.980 --> 11:42.980
Do you have a hard time finding new music?

11:42.980 --> 11:44.980
You should listen to the show.

11:44.980 --> 11:47.980
Are you a millennial who misses what life was like in the 2000s?

11:47.980 --> 11:49.980
You should listen to the show.

11:49.980 --> 11:52.980
Are you interested in multiple perspectives, perspectives,

11:53.980 --> 11:55.980
on relationships and dating?

11:55.980 --> 12:01.980
Are you interested in non-male bashing podcasts that hold both sex is accountable?

12:01.980 --> 12:06.980
See the thing is is a podcast that allows space for a wide range of thoughts and emotions.

12:06.980 --> 12:10.980
Most recently, they've sat down with guests such as Ari Lennox,

12:10.980 --> 12:17.980
Brig Big Freedia, Remy Ma, Van Lathen, Robert Glasper, Dere McCesson,

12:17.980 --> 12:20.980
Chloe Bailey, Mooney Long, and Neo.

12:20.980 --> 12:22.980
So if you want to know what Neo's up to,

12:22.980 --> 12:24.980
check out that episode. Sounds like a good one.

12:24.980 --> 12:28.980
Join Brigida and Mandy every week as they update you on everything going on in the world

12:28.980 --> 12:30.980

12:30.980 --> 12:35.980
Subscribe to see the thing is on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, or on YouTube.

Check it out.

12:38.980 --> 12:46.980
And we're back.

12:46.980 --> 12:49.980
What's that sound?

12:49.980 --> 12:52.980
Oh, it's a tick-tock.

12:52.980 --> 12:53.980
Tick-tock.

12:53.980 --> 12:54.980
Shares in.

12:54.980 --> 12:55.980
Yeah.

12:55.980 --> 12:57.980
Here we go.

12:57.980 --> 12:59.980
How long...

12:59.980 --> 13:02.980
Almost called you a Maria Ga.

13:02.980 --> 13:05.980
Maria Ga, how long have you lived in New York City?

13:06.980 --> 13:07.980
Eight years.

13:07.980 --> 13:08.980
Eight years.

13:08.980 --> 13:09.980
Eight years?

13:09.980 --> 13:10.980
That's it?

13:10.980 --> 13:11.980
What do you mean?

13:11.980 --> 13:12.980
That's it.

13:12.980 --> 13:13.980
I lived in LA for eight years.

13:13.980 --> 13:14.980
Okay.

13:14.980 --> 13:16.980
But I feel like I just went to school.

13:16.980 --> 13:17.980
Really?

13:17.980 --> 13:18.980
Yeah.

13:18.980 --> 13:19.980
Should I ask?

13:19.980 --> 13:20.980
Should I ask?

13:20.980 --> 13:21.980
Joel?

13:21.980 --> 13:22.980
Two years, right?

13:22.980 --> 13:23.980
1.5.

13:23.980 --> 13:24.980
All right.

13:24.980 --> 13:26.980
So you guys basically, you've lived here for a long time.

13:26.980 --> 13:27.980
Let's say.

13:27.980 --> 13:28.980
Combined like nine and a half.

13:28.980 --> 13:29.980
Yeah.

13:29.980 --> 13:30.980
No, I'm saying both of you have.

13:30.980 --> 13:32.980
And so I'm like...

13:33.980 --> 13:36.980
You have had to have seen everything at this point.

13:36.980 --> 13:37.980
First is me.

13:37.980 --> 13:40.980
I've only ever lived here for extended stays.

13:40.980 --> 13:41.980
Right.

13:41.980 --> 13:42.980
Right.

13:42.980 --> 13:47.980
So like you guys have sort of like this cultural thumb on the pulse

13:47.980 --> 13:49.980
that I frankly will never have.

13:49.980 --> 13:52.980
Because I'll never catch up to y'all in terms of how long I've lived here.

13:52.980 --> 13:54.980
Even if I moved here today.

13:54.980 --> 13:57.980
You have an experience things that we have experience.

13:57.980 --> 13:59.980
I've never been to Ellis Island.

13:59.980 --> 14:00.980
Me neither.

14:00.980 --> 14:01.980
What?

14:02.980 --> 14:06.980
Well, I wanted to talk to you guys because last night I went to PJ Clarke's.

14:06.980 --> 14:07.980
Right.

14:07.980 --> 14:08.980
1884.

14:08.980 --> 14:09.980
Let me finish.

14:09.980 --> 14:11.980
Like five minutes.

14:11.980 --> 14:13.980
Is that like weird bar in Midtown?

14:13.980 --> 14:15.980
Is that that awesome bar on the priest?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.980
It's barely a priest.

14:17.980 --> 14:18.980
Definitely about death.

14:18.980 --> 14:19.980
Lennox Hill.

14:19.980 --> 14:21.980
I think I've actually been there before.

14:21.980 --> 14:24.980
But like you feel like you're in like the 1930s.

14:24.980 --> 14:25.980
1880s.

14:25.980 --> 14:26.980
Sure.

14:26.980 --> 14:29.980
And you can tell the difference by the way.

14:30.980 --> 14:31.980
Yeah.

14:31.980 --> 14:34.980
I'm sort of a hunter.

14:34.980 --> 14:36.980
Well, I'm thinking of PJ wheel hands.

14:36.980 --> 14:37.980
What is that?

14:37.980 --> 14:38.980
What is that?

14:38.980 --> 14:39.980
Maybe I'm getting wrong.

14:39.980 --> 14:40.980
Wait.

14:44.980 --> 14:45.980
Sorry.

14:45.980 --> 14:47.980
I'm trying to drink this whole thing because I had hard

14:47.980 --> 14:48.980
palpitations last night.

14:48.980 --> 14:50.980
The can't be up till 429.

14:50.980 --> 14:51.980
Yeah.

14:53.980 --> 14:54.980
PJ Clarke's.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.980
It's the corner of third and

14:58.980 --> 15:00.980
60th or 55th.

15:00.980 --> 15:01.980
Yeah.

15:01.980 --> 15:02.980
I've been there.

15:02.980 --> 15:03.980
There you have it.

15:03.980 --> 15:04.980
I have PJ Clarke's.

15:04.980 --> 15:06.980
I just confused it with wheel hands.

15:06.980 --> 15:07.980
What is wheel hands?

15:07.980 --> 15:08.980
Yeah.

15:08.980 --> 15:11.980
It's just another name that sounds like it's a made up thing to sound old.

15:11.980 --> 15:12.980
PJ.

15:12.980 --> 15:15.980
This PJ Clarke's is actually opened in 1884.

15:15.980 --> 15:16.980
Okay.

15:16.980 --> 15:17.980
Well, I've been there.

15:17.980 --> 15:18.980
Okay.

15:18.980 --> 15:19.980
Well, you've been there.

15:19.980 --> 15:20.980
Or that's awesome.

15:20.980 --> 15:21.980
There's a different PJ Clarke's.

15:21.980 --> 15:22.980
Yeah.

15:22.980 --> 15:24.980
But that's the original and the rest are just sort of like.

15:24.980 --> 15:26.980
There's a PJ Clarke's in Philadelphia.

15:26.980 --> 15:27.980
Yeah.

15:27.980 --> 15:28.980
Have you been through that one?

15:28.980 --> 15:29.980
No.

15:29.980 --> 15:30.980
Philadelphia J Clarke.

15:30.980 --> 15:31.980
Yeah.

15:31.980 --> 15:32.980
No.

15:32.980 --> 15:35.980
I wanted to ask you guys about a couple of old New York's mainstays.

15:35.980 --> 15:37.980
See if you'd been there.

15:37.980 --> 15:38.980
See what your thoughts were.

15:38.980 --> 15:41.980
And then I'll share mine about PJ Clarke's.

15:41.980 --> 15:42.980
And you know.

15:42.980 --> 15:43.980
I guess.

15:43.980 --> 15:44.980
I'm going forward.

15:44.980 --> 15:46.980
This is not a segment of people are going to like any.

15:46.980 --> 15:47.980
There we go.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.980
Francis Tavern.

15:49.980 --> 15:50.980
I have been there.

15:50.980 --> 15:52.980
Opened in 1762.

15:52.980 --> 15:55.980
Let me finish when I say when I introduce them.

15:56.980 --> 15:57.980
Have you been there?

15:57.980 --> 15:58.980
Yes.

15:58.980 --> 15:59.980
Joel.

15:59.980 --> 16:00.980
Nope.

16:00.980 --> 16:05.980
Located on the corner of Pearl and Broad Street in downtown Manhattan.

16:05.980 --> 16:09.980
Francis is a 250 year old bar.

16:09.980 --> 16:11.980
And restaurant with a storied past.

16:11.980 --> 16:17.980
I mean, how often do you get to be in a room that's been there for, I don't know, 250 years?

16:17.980 --> 16:18.980
Not often.

16:18.980 --> 16:20.980
And so how did you feel when you're there?

16:20.980 --> 16:21.980
I sat outside.

16:22.980 --> 16:25.980
But I did go to the bathroom.

16:25.980 --> 16:27.980
Moving on.

16:27.980 --> 16:29.980
Oh, bathroom.

16:29.980 --> 16:30.980
He's just a hole in the ground.

16:30.980 --> 16:31.980
Look at this.

16:31.980 --> 16:33.980
PJ Clarke's 1884.

16:33.980 --> 16:39.980
PJ Clarke's been surfing up delicious burgers in a cozy setting for nearly 150 years.

16:39.980 --> 16:40.980
Right?

16:40.980 --> 16:43.980
And so when you're there, you can't help but feel that history.

16:43.980 --> 16:47.980
But he Holly proposed to his wife there, maybe.

16:48.980 --> 16:50.980
Leo Frank Sinach.

16:50.980 --> 16:52.980
Often said at table 20.

16:52.980 --> 16:53.980
Did you sit at table 20?

16:53.980 --> 16:57.980
I sat at the bar and the bartender pitted me because I was there alone.

16:57.980 --> 16:58.980
I tried to read a book.

16:58.980 --> 17:00.980
It was too loud.

17:00.980 --> 17:03.980
And it is my fault that you were there alone because you didn't invite me and I said no,

17:03.980 --> 17:05.980
I have to go grocery shopping.

17:05.980 --> 17:07.980
It was also Wednesday at like 10.

17:07.980 --> 17:08.980
Yeah.

17:08.980 --> 17:12.980
I mean, I did have to go grocery shopping.

17:12.980 --> 17:15.980
But I also wanted to go home quickly.

17:15.980 --> 17:20.980
And I did not go home quickly because I went to three grocery stories.

17:20.980 --> 17:22.980
What grocery stores did you go to?

17:22.980 --> 17:27.980
I went to a natural market on 8th and 54th.

17:27.980 --> 17:31.980
I went to a few to Emporium.

17:31.980 --> 17:34.980
I tried to go to Gristidis, but it was close.

17:34.980 --> 17:39.980
So I went back to the natural market and bought what I thought was too expensive there.

17:39.980 --> 17:40.980
Oh, my.

17:40.980 --> 17:43.980
Do you have to do consider joining for the grocery stores?

17:43.980 --> 17:44.980
I invited him.

17:44.980 --> 17:45.980
I considered it.

17:45.980 --> 17:49.980
But then I realized what the reality of that would be would be just me following

17:49.980 --> 17:53.980
Marika in like a whole foods and commenting on what she bought.

17:53.980 --> 17:58.980
But that is kind of I love going to the grocery store with friends.

17:58.980 --> 17:59.980
I think it's fun.

17:59.980 --> 18:01.980
It oftentimes offers a really new perspective.

18:01.980 --> 18:02.980
That's true.

18:02.980 --> 18:03.980
Totally.

18:03.980 --> 18:04.980
That's true.

18:04.980 --> 18:05.980
That's true.

18:05.980 --> 18:06.980
That's true.

18:06.980 --> 18:09.980
Two guys came up and sat.

18:10.980 --> 18:12.980
Basically next to me at the bar.

18:12.980 --> 18:15.980
And the bartender, I guess, knew them.

18:15.980 --> 18:17.980
They were seemingly regulars.

18:17.980 --> 18:21.980
And they were like already kind of drunk, I think.

18:21.980 --> 18:24.980
And they ordered like triple whiskeys.

18:24.980 --> 18:28.980
Like they look like caricatures of like drinkers.

18:28.980 --> 18:30.980
These guys were born in 1884.

18:30.980 --> 18:33.980
It felt that way or at least like the 80s.

18:33.980 --> 18:34.980
And they kept telling this one.

18:34.980 --> 18:36.980
They had nothing in common.

18:36.980 --> 18:38.980
This one guy kept saying the same joke over and over.

18:38.980 --> 18:41.980
And then eventually just googled the origin of the joke.

18:41.980 --> 18:43.980
And it wasn't funny.

18:43.980 --> 18:47.980
He was like, the brain may go to shit.

18:47.980 --> 18:51.980
Like your heart may be on fire.

18:51.980 --> 18:55.980
But the liquor is always there when you're feeling dire or something.

18:55.980 --> 18:59.980
And he had that like alcoholic voice where they were.

18:59.980 --> 19:03.980
And he kept saying it and he told the bartender it like three times.

19:03.980 --> 19:06.980
The bartender kept being like, ah, that's that's cool.

19:06.980 --> 19:07.980
Yeah.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.980
And then his friend got up to go to the bathroom.

19:10.980 --> 19:13.980
And then he was like, you're not found the origin of the same.

19:13.980 --> 19:16.980
I was like, it doesn't matter.

19:16.980 --> 19:20.980
You're not happy and you guys aren't friends.

19:20.980 --> 19:23.980
You just come here.

19:23.980 --> 19:25.980
Anyway, I'm moving on.

19:25.980 --> 19:28.980
Keen's steakhouse 1885.

19:28.980 --> 19:29.980
Are you from there?

19:29.980 --> 19:30.980
No.

19:30.980 --> 19:34.980
Over 150 years ago, publishers played right some producers met and mingled.

19:34.980 --> 19:36.980
At the renowned Keen's steakhouse.

19:36.980 --> 19:39.980
Before seeing a show.

19:39.980 --> 19:41.980
What?

19:41.980 --> 19:43.980
What's straight on?

19:43.980 --> 19:45.980
What street is it on?

19:45.980 --> 19:49.980
I wasn't prepared for any follow-up questions, but let me Google it.

19:49.980 --> 19:50.980
I mean, this is...

19:50.980 --> 19:53.980
Because you are asking the two people that don't eat steaks.

19:53.980 --> 19:55.980
It's on 32nd and 6th.

19:55.980 --> 19:56.980
Interesting.

19:56.980 --> 19:59.980
And when I said 32nd, I meant 36th and 6th.

19:59.980 --> 20:00.980
Gotcha.

20:00.980 --> 20:03.980
So far from Broadway, but that's true.

20:03.980 --> 20:04.980
That's their fault.

20:04.980 --> 20:05.980
And oh, maybe.

20:05.980 --> 20:07.980
You guys haven't been to Keen's?

20:07.980 --> 20:08.980
No.

20:08.980 --> 20:10.980
Moving on.

20:10.980 --> 20:13.980
Peter Luger's steakhouse 1887.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.980
The familiar, but never been.

20:15.980 --> 20:16.980
You guys don't need steak.

20:16.980 --> 20:17.980
You don't need steak.

20:17.980 --> 20:18.980
Well, they do have such.

20:18.980 --> 20:19.980
They do have such.

20:19.980 --> 20:20.980
They do have such.

20:20.980 --> 20:21.980
Is that true?

20:21.980 --> 20:22.980
I think so.

20:22.980 --> 20:24.980
Here's what I'll say about Peter Luger.

20:24.980 --> 20:28.980
I had the pleasure and leisure of going there with a friend two years ago.

20:28.980 --> 20:30.980
And I've never thought thinking about it.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.980
It's unreally.

20:33.980 --> 20:37.980
They have this like thick cut bacon as a side.

20:37.980 --> 20:38.980
And it's just...

20:38.980 --> 20:40.980
It's crazy good.

20:40.980 --> 20:42.980
And I thought that it was going to be all hype.

20:42.980 --> 20:43.980
But it was...

20:43.980 --> 20:44.980
It was truly unbelievable.

20:44.980 --> 20:48.980
And you can tell that it's been there since the late 80s.

20:48.980 --> 20:49.980
1880s.

20:49.980 --> 20:50.980
Not quite the...

20:50.980 --> 20:51.980
Yeah.

20:51.980 --> 20:54.980
Because when you say 80s, people think like...

20:54.980 --> 20:56.980
leather jackets.

20:56.980 --> 20:58.980
You know, great economics.

20:58.980 --> 21:00.980
Reganomics.

21:01.980 --> 21:03.980
We should go to Peter Luger.

21:03.980 --> 21:04.980
But about cats is deadly.

21:04.980 --> 21:06.980
Why are you guys having fun?

21:06.980 --> 21:07.980
I am having fun.

21:07.980 --> 21:10.980
I was looking up to see if they did actually lose their Michelin star.

21:10.980 --> 21:11.980
And is it true?

21:11.980 --> 21:12.980
Um...

21:12.980 --> 21:14.980
Tell me it isn't true.

21:14.980 --> 21:17.980
In 2022.

21:17.980 --> 21:18.980
You lost some missions.

21:18.980 --> 21:20.980
Well, I ate their early 2022.

21:20.980 --> 21:21.980
So they just...

21:21.980 --> 21:22.980
This was later.

21:22.980 --> 21:23.980
Yeah.

21:23.980 --> 21:24.980
I don't know what changed.

21:24.980 --> 21:25.980
But I...

21:25.980 --> 21:26.980
You can order it.

21:26.980 --> 21:27.980
Yeah.

21:27.980 --> 21:28.980
I'm fucking door-dash.

21:28.980 --> 21:29.980
And I'm like, maybe I do that.

21:29.980 --> 21:31.980
Because getting the reservation is what's hard.

21:31.980 --> 21:33.980
I feel like that's why they lost their Michelin star.

21:33.980 --> 21:36.980
It can be the Michelin star restaurant door-dash.

21:36.980 --> 21:37.980
I know.

21:37.980 --> 21:38.980
There's a lot of those.

21:38.980 --> 21:39.980
There's a whole category.

21:39.980 --> 21:40.980
Yeah.

21:40.980 --> 21:41.980
What's that?

21:41.980 --> 21:42.980
I don't like that.

21:42.980 --> 21:43.980
Actually, on...

21:43.980 --> 21:44.980
Yeah.

21:44.980 --> 21:45.980
On...

21:45.980 --> 21:46.980
Door-dash.

21:46.980 --> 21:47.980
It's like Michelin-rated.

21:47.980 --> 21:48.980
Maybe it's on a...

21:48.980 --> 21:49.980
Maybe that's not like...

21:49.980 --> 21:50.980
Star.

21:50.980 --> 21:51.980
It's just like...

21:51.980 --> 21:52.980
Cats is deadly.

21:52.980 --> 21:54.980
No, I know none of us have ever been here.

21:54.980 --> 21:55.980
But I know.

21:55.980 --> 21:56.980
I have a hat from there.

21:56.980 --> 21:57.980
Me?

21:57.980 --> 21:58.980
Yeah.

21:58.980 --> 21:59.980
No.

21:59.980 --> 22:01.980
You're thinking of someone else.

22:01.980 --> 22:02.980
Maybe pile.

22:02.980 --> 22:03.980
But...

22:03.980 --> 22:04.980
Because...

22:04.980 --> 22:05.980
I think about you guys all the time.

22:05.980 --> 22:07.980
I think my pile is that he loves...

22:07.980 --> 22:10.980
When Harry Met Sally, because he loves that scene,

22:10.980 --> 22:13.980
where she sort of fakes you know.

22:13.980 --> 22:15.980
Because he's like...

22:15.980 --> 22:18.980
That was a sexual awakening.

22:18.980 --> 22:20.980
And I don't want to...

22:20.980 --> 22:21.980
And it was a fake.

22:21.980 --> 22:22.980
And it was a fake.

22:22.980 --> 22:23.980
Yeah.

22:23.980 --> 22:25.980
Rows.

22:25.980 --> 22:26.980
I've never been to a house.

22:26.980 --> 22:27.980
Like the marinara sauce?

22:27.980 --> 22:28.980
Yeah.

22:28.980 --> 22:29.980
Yeah.

22:29.980 --> 22:30.980
I've had the sauce.

22:30.980 --> 22:31.980
I've had the sauce.

22:31.980 --> 22:35.980
I feel like nobody is missing out.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.980
Because it seems like it's hardy red sauce Italian, which I hate.

22:38.980 --> 22:41.980
What's your preferred Italian?

22:41.980 --> 22:42.980
I think I...

22:42.980 --> 22:45.980
I think I want hardy red sauce Italian.

22:45.980 --> 22:48.980
I think I like... like Northern Italian.

22:48.980 --> 22:49.980
What?

22:49.980 --> 22:51.980
What's that cuisine defined by?

22:52.980 --> 22:53.980
I don't know.

22:53.980 --> 22:54.980
Less heavy pasta's.

22:54.980 --> 22:57.980
You know, not always fucking bowl-in-ase this.

22:57.980 --> 22:58.980
The gas.

22:58.980 --> 22:59.980
Creamy Italian.

22:59.980 --> 23:00.980
Otherwise.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.980
I like a mushroom pasta.

23:03.980 --> 23:04.980
You know, I like...

23:04.980 --> 23:06.980
An agnalotti, you know.

23:06.980 --> 23:07.980
I don't know.

23:07.980 --> 23:08.980
I don't want to speak too soon.

23:08.980 --> 23:12.980
You know, the economic growth in different regions of Italy.

23:12.980 --> 23:13.980
The 80s?

23:13.980 --> 23:14.980
Is it the best president ever?

23:14.980 --> 23:15.980
No.

23:15.980 --> 23:16.980
Before the 80s.

23:16.980 --> 23:17.980
Before the 80s.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.980
It's directly correlated with when...

23:19.980 --> 23:23.980
The church in different parts stopped allowing people to marry their cousins.

23:27.980 --> 23:28.980
It's a great fact.

23:28.980 --> 23:29.980
Can you say that again?

23:29.980 --> 23:30.980
That's a great fact.

23:30.980 --> 23:32.980
Because...

23:32.980 --> 23:34.980
Like...

23:34.980 --> 23:35.980
The...

23:35.980 --> 23:36.980
Not new to marry their cousins.

23:36.980 --> 23:37.980
Let them to need to travel further.

23:37.980 --> 23:38.980
Meet more people.

23:38.980 --> 23:41.980
Let to much more like spread of ideas and economic growth.

23:41.980 --> 23:44.980
So the poor regions are the ones where they were allowed to marry their cousins

23:44.980 --> 23:45.980
from much longer.

23:45.980 --> 23:48.980
And they say it is these like very simple agrarian societies.

23:48.980 --> 23:49.980
We do not care.

23:49.980 --> 23:50.980
We do not care.

23:50.980 --> 23:55.980
We do not care.

23:55.980 --> 23:58.980
I'll bow in your tongue.

23:58.980 --> 24:01.980
Oh, wow.

24:09.980 --> 24:10.980
Barbetta!

24:10.980 --> 24:11.980
Where's that?

24:11.980 --> 24:12.980
Nope.

24:12.980 --> 24:16.980
Um, this is where we need the noise.

24:16.980 --> 24:19.980
This is where we need the noise. Like why can't we play? We don't care back.

24:19.980 --> 24:23.980
We live with that was easy button if you want to know that.

24:23.980 --> 24:27.980
I don't know where it is. I'm going to assume that lower Manhattan or some shit.

24:27.980 --> 24:30.980
Here we go. Grand Central Oyster Bar and restaurant.

24:30.980 --> 24:32.980
No, but they've heard about it. Really?

24:32.980 --> 24:35.980
Walked past it. Is this in Grand Central Station?

24:35.980 --> 24:38.980
Yes. Why don't we go there for lunch?

24:38.980 --> 24:40.980
Um, great.

24:40.980 --> 24:41.980
There is.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.980
I want to chance back to. I'll say New Yorker.

24:43.980 --> 24:45.980
Last sheeting virus.

24:45.980 --> 24:48.980
That was a sound of a bunch of oysters and the water.

24:48.980 --> 24:50.980
The salt water.

24:50.980 --> 24:53.980
I almost had oysters yesterday. So thank fucking God.

24:53.980 --> 24:54.980
I did.

24:54.980 --> 24:59.980
Instead I had a whiskey at PJ Clarks.

24:59.980 --> 25:05.980
Um, have you, do you know about this cheesy in Grand Central?

25:05.980 --> 25:07.980
I've heard of it. Yeah.

25:07.980 --> 25:10.980
I went to it last year. It's a pretty cool.

25:10.980 --> 25:11.980
How do you feel?

25:11.980 --> 25:13.980
How do I feel in general?

25:13.980 --> 25:15.980
About going there.

25:15.980 --> 25:19.980
I felt good about it because it was for.

25:19.980 --> 25:21.980
No, it was for a party.

25:21.980 --> 25:24.980
And after party for the.

25:24.980 --> 25:26.980
Oh, for a movie premiere.

25:26.980 --> 25:29.980
And I was at the bar at the same time that Owen Wilson was at the bar.

25:29.980 --> 25:32.980
So I loved that person.

25:32.980 --> 25:36.980
I saw Owen Wilson getting off the bedford.

25:36.980 --> 25:38.980
Stop on the L.

25:38.980 --> 25:39.980
Did I say about this?

25:39.980 --> 25:40.980
I think you might.

25:40.980 --> 25:42.980
It was me Johnny and our friend.

25:42.980 --> 25:45.980
And we were very intoxicated.

25:45.980 --> 25:46.980
And we saw him.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.980
And we were like, hi.

25:48.980 --> 25:50.980
I'm Johnny.

25:50.980 --> 25:52.980
And I'm like, drunk out of my mind.

25:52.980 --> 25:55.980
And that's Owen Wilson.

25:55.980 --> 25:57.980
It's not that funny.

25:57.980 --> 25:59.980
He said that to me.

25:59.980 --> 26:01.980
No, John, like the bit was like,

26:01.980 --> 26:03.980
I know that I'm like fucked up.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.980
But like, that is Owen Wilson.

26:05.980 --> 26:07.980
No one's going to believe us.

26:08.980 --> 26:10.980
Old town bar.

26:10.980 --> 26:11.980
I think we've been there together.

26:11.980 --> 26:12.980
I don't think so.

26:12.980 --> 26:13.980
Not you and me.

26:13.980 --> 26:14.980
No.

26:14.980 --> 26:15.980
Where?

26:15.980 --> 26:16.980
No, where is old town bar?

26:16.980 --> 26:17.980
It's like right here.

26:17.980 --> 26:21.980
I'm going to take my throat to the old town bar.

26:21.980 --> 26:25.980
I'm going to gargle all of the ails.

26:25.980 --> 26:26.980
Nice.

26:28.980 --> 26:29.980
Fuck you guys.

26:31.980 --> 26:33.980
I've never been here.

26:33.980 --> 26:34.980
Okay.

26:34.980 --> 26:37.980
Well, we had a big New York office happy hour there.

26:37.980 --> 26:38.980
Cool.

26:38.980 --> 26:39.980
Wasn't invited.

26:39.980 --> 26:44.980
What about health is or haven't been to the restaurant, but

26:44.980 --> 26:45.980
um,

26:45.980 --> 26:48.980
I've been frequently either almond croissants.

26:48.980 --> 26:52.980
One of my favorite baked goods of all time.

26:52.980 --> 26:54.980
And you still have to at my old job.

26:54.980 --> 26:56.980
A lot of people would order lunch from there.

26:56.980 --> 26:59.980
So I used to have to call them like every day in order lunch for delivery.

26:59.980 --> 27:00.980
All right.

27:00.980 --> 27:02.980
What about Gage and Tolmer?

27:02.980 --> 27:03.980
Pardon?

27:03.980 --> 27:04.980
Forget it.

27:04.980 --> 27:05.980
Just fucking.

27:05.980 --> 27:06.980
Let's move on.

27:06.980 --> 27:07.980
Thank you.

27:07.980 --> 27:08.980
I wasn't drawing though.

27:08.980 --> 27:09.980
I know.

27:09.980 --> 27:13.980
But oftentimes what you enjoy is what the audience hates.

27:13.980 --> 27:16.980
That's why it is a ton of times that you're not having fun.

27:16.980 --> 27:18.980
We can do this again.

27:18.980 --> 27:19.980
You made it.

27:19.980 --> 27:21.980
And we're just the first time.

27:21.980 --> 27:22.980
Oh, I went.

27:24.980 --> 27:25.980
I don't know.

27:25.980 --> 27:27.980
What do you guys fucking suggest?

27:27.980 --> 27:28.980
It's been 33 minutes.

27:28.980 --> 27:29.980
I don't know what else to do.

27:29.980 --> 27:32.980
I'm fucking exhausted because I couldn't go to sleep until 4.30.

27:32.980 --> 27:35.980
I just wanted to have a ton of fun.

27:35.980 --> 27:36.980
Hey.

27:36.980 --> 27:41.980
I thought this would be a fun energy episode to not go into.

27:41.980 --> 27:42.980
To go into with us.

27:42.980 --> 27:45.980
I think we've had a great energy.

27:45.980 --> 27:46.980
No.

27:46.980 --> 27:47.980
I sure did.

27:47.980 --> 27:49.980
I thought it was going to be a good energy.

27:49.980 --> 27:50.980
And then it wasn't really.

27:50.980 --> 27:53.980
What's your, I think that it's your fault then?

27:53.980 --> 27:54.980
No.

27:54.980 --> 27:59.980
I think you disagree with most.

27:59.980 --> 28:04.980
What about the energy do you know like?

28:04.980 --> 28:07.980
You don't like that there's not a game.

28:07.980 --> 28:09.980
I do like a game.

28:09.980 --> 28:13.980
But the two segments have been playing all of the music sounds.

28:13.980 --> 28:15.980
Yeah, I didn't, I don't like.

28:15.980 --> 28:17.980
And listening restaurants in New York,

28:17.980 --> 28:21.980
which also I think is like annoying when people do it in normal conversations.

28:21.980 --> 28:24.980
How does it podcast as even worse?

28:25.980 --> 28:33.980
I thought that the conversations underneath those were fun.

28:33.980 --> 28:35.980
But maybe you just need to contribute more.

28:35.980 --> 28:37.980
Maybe that's a problem.

28:37.980 --> 28:40.980
Yeah, I only can have fun when I dominate things.

28:55.980 --> 28:59.980
Can you do the slap sound again?

28:59.980 --> 29:02.980
I agree that everyone is going to hit this episode.

29:02.980 --> 29:03.980
Can you do this?

29:03.980 --> 29:04.980
I'm really gonna do it.

29:04.980 --> 29:05.980
Do you mean the punch sound?

29:05.980 --> 29:06.980
I'm shown.

29:06.980 --> 29:09.980
Yeah.

29:11.980 --> 29:13.980
The camera was not yet.

29:13.980 --> 29:14.980
I'm laughing.

29:14.980 --> 29:15.980
I'm laughing.

29:15.980 --> 29:17.980
I'm a character actor.

29:17.980 --> 29:20.980
That's not what that means.

29:20.980 --> 29:25.980
What was your question?

29:25.980 --> 29:27.980
It was no way.

29:27.980 --> 29:30.980
My God.

29:30.980 --> 29:34.980
I just asked why you were excited to do.

29:34.980 --> 29:35.980
Well, I'm in New York.

29:35.980 --> 29:38.980
Yes. Oh, my God.

29:38.980 --> 29:40.980
Sorry, what was your question?

29:40.980 --> 29:41.980
I'm not asking you again.

29:41.980 --> 29:42.980
No, come on.

29:42.980 --> 29:43.980
No, come on.

29:43.980 --> 29:45.980
I didn't hear it the first three times.

29:45.980 --> 29:48.980
I think you two spent too much time to go to the past 70 years.

29:48.980 --> 29:49.980
That's true.

29:49.980 --> 29:50.980
It's true.

29:50.980 --> 29:53.980
I did for a chef to go to two different musicals.

29:53.980 --> 29:54.980
You didn't force me.

29:54.980 --> 29:56.980
I said, I want to see a musical with you.

29:56.980 --> 29:58.980
And then you also invited me to the first thing, which was good.

29:58.980 --> 29:59.980
Yeah.

29:59.980 --> 30:00.980
That is good, though.

30:00.980 --> 30:01.980
Yeah.

30:01.980 --> 30:02.980
Well, it's a fun.

30:02.980 --> 30:04.980
You know, it's a different vibe.

30:04.980 --> 30:06.980
There you go.

30:06.980 --> 30:07.980
See Titanic.

30:07.980 --> 30:08.980
That's right.

30:08.980 --> 30:09.980
Is that a musical?

30:09.980 --> 30:10.980
Yeah.

30:12.980 --> 30:14.980
I am excited to.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.980
I'm really just excited to see friends.

30:16.980 --> 30:17.980
That's the point of the visit.

30:18.980 --> 30:19.980
Yeah.

30:19.980 --> 30:21.980
But after this, I've to record some ads.

30:21.980 --> 30:24.980
And then I'm going to take the train up to the diamond district.

30:24.980 --> 30:28.980
And just go look at a bunch of vintage watches that I can never force.

30:28.980 --> 30:30.980
But it'll be fun.

30:30.980 --> 30:34.980
I passed a watch store in Green Point recently.

30:34.980 --> 30:36.980
That's not a lot.

30:36.980 --> 30:37.980
A watch repair place.

30:37.980 --> 30:38.980
I know the place.

30:38.980 --> 30:39.980
Yeah.

30:39.980 --> 30:41.980
I knew you were still living on that street actually.

30:41.980 --> 30:43.980
Well, you don't live there.

30:43.980 --> 30:45.980
You stayed there for an extended period of time.

30:45.980 --> 30:46.980
What's the difference?

30:46.980 --> 30:49.980
We're always just staying where we are for extended period.

30:49.980 --> 30:50.980
Unless you buy a house.

30:50.980 --> 30:51.980
And even that.

30:51.980 --> 30:52.980
What's that?

30:52.980 --> 30:53.980
None of your kind of just.

30:53.980 --> 30:54.980
We're all just here.

30:54.980 --> 30:55.980
See, now it's really.

30:55.980 --> 30:56.980
That's interesting.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.980
What you're saying is just like putting gatekeeping.

31:01.980 --> 31:04.980
Like what about the life isn't temporary.

31:06.980 --> 31:07.980
Um, yeah.

31:08.980 --> 31:09.980
That was good.

31:09.980 --> 31:11.980
That was like every person.

31:11.980 --> 31:14.980
That was like every dumb person's favorite joke for like 10 years.

31:14.980 --> 31:15.980
My name is Jeff.

31:15.980 --> 31:16.980
Yeah.

31:16.980 --> 31:17.980
It's not even a joke.

31:17.980 --> 31:19.980
Wait, I like that joke where it was like.

31:21.980 --> 31:22.980
Oh, so your name is Jeff.

31:22.980 --> 31:24.980
And it was like the guy whose name is spelled J.

31:24.980 --> 31:25.980
Yeah, FF.

31:25.980 --> 31:26.980
Yes.

31:26.980 --> 31:27.980
Whatever.

31:27.980 --> 31:28.980
The other guy.

31:28.980 --> 31:29.980
Yes.

31:29.980 --> 31:30.980
And then me would say why.

31:30.980 --> 31:31.980
Yo.

31:31.980 --> 31:32.980
That was good.

31:32.980 --> 31:33.980
But like that.

31:33.980 --> 31:35.980
When I was in like bringing this podcast.

31:35.980 --> 31:36.980
When I was in high school,

31:36.980 --> 31:37.980
just everybody would be like,

31:37.980 --> 31:38.980
My name is Jeff.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.980
I'm like, that's not a joke.

31:40.980 --> 31:41.980
I don't know what that is.

31:41.980 --> 31:44.980
I think it's from 21 Jump Street.

31:44.980 --> 31:45.980
Oh, yeah.

31:45.980 --> 31:46.980
It is really?

31:46.980 --> 31:48.980
I'm just like even in context.

31:48.980 --> 31:49.980
It's not funny.

31:49.980 --> 31:52.980
I think it's like 2% of names that just.

31:52.980 --> 31:54.980
People think it's funny.

31:54.980 --> 31:57.980
No, like, like, if you have them at the wrong moment.

31:57.980 --> 31:58.980
Oh, yeah.

31:58.980 --> 32:01.980
Like if your name was like Charlie when Charlie bit my finger came out.

32:01.980 --> 32:02.980
Like, yeah.

32:02.980 --> 32:04.980
That's just like what your life was.

32:04.980 --> 32:05.980
Yeah.

32:05.980 --> 32:06.980
Um.

32:06.980 --> 32:07.980
Um.

32:07.980 --> 32:20.980
Oh, yeah.

32:20.980 --> 32:21.980
Yeah.

32:21.980 --> 32:22.980
Yeah.

32:22.980 --> 32:23.980
Yeah.

32:23.980 --> 32:24.980
Yeah.

32:24.980 --> 32:25.980
We have.

32:25.980 --> 32:27.980
Are we getting one to do a look at this?

32:27.980 --> 32:28.980
I would like to.

32:28.980 --> 32:29.980
I'm hungry.

32:29.980 --> 32:30.980
Starving.

32:30.980 --> 32:31.980
I stomach has been grounded.

32:31.980 --> 32:32.980
42 minutes.

32:32.980 --> 32:34.980
We could call it here and just let people be really upset.

32:34.980 --> 32:36.980
Or we could save it somehow.

32:36.980 --> 32:45.980
Well, not after this flesh-getting fucking virus that you guys mentioned, but I would go somewhere like interesting like that, sure.

32:50.980 --> 32:51.980
Blugs.

32:55.980 --> 32:57.980
You guys think I should have prepared something?

32:57.980 --> 33:03.980
I don't think you should have prepared something I think you should have prepared something I think you should not have played as many as undefexas you did.

33:03.980 --> 33:05.980
You think that's what it would do?

33:05.980 --> 33:06.980
Yeah.

33:06.980 --> 33:08.980
Why don't we just talk for a bit then?

33:08.980 --> 33:09.980
About what?

33:09.980 --> 33:11.980
Fucking, oh, you know what?

33:11.980 --> 33:14.980
Maybe like some of the oldest, now we did that.

33:15.980 --> 33:18.980
Let's do some of the newest bars in New York City.

33:21.980 --> 33:23.980
People are gonna hate that.

33:24.980 --> 33:30.980
What's like the most pressing issue that you guys are dealing with in your life that you're willing to share and get my advice about?

33:30.980 --> 33:40.980
I have to go to a wedding tomorrow at an Italian restaurant, a formal attire.

33:40.980 --> 33:45.980
The outfit I ordered was a jumpsuit, not arriving on time.

33:48.980 --> 33:55.980
All I have by way of, I guess formal attire is a suit, but I don't know what shirt to wear.

33:55.980 --> 33:58.980
Ralph Lauren says,

33:58.980 --> 34:04.980
not said says current that the sexiest thing a woman can do is wear a tux.

34:04.980 --> 34:06.980
So I think you should rent a tux.

34:06.980 --> 34:08.980
I'm not gonna rent a tux.

34:08.980 --> 34:10.980
Can I not ask my advice if you're not gonna do that?

34:10.980 --> 34:18.980
Well, the invite said Ben will be in dark suits.

34:18.980 --> 34:20.980
So I saved not tux's.

34:20.980 --> 34:21.980
It's not black tie.

34:21.980 --> 34:22.980
Not black tie.

34:22.980 --> 34:23.980
Not formal.

34:23.980 --> 34:25.980
If it's not black tie, it's not formal.

34:25.980 --> 34:27.980
Well, it said formal.

34:28.980 --> 34:30.980
They don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

34:30.980 --> 34:31.980
I agree.

34:31.980 --> 34:35.980
Clearly they didn't go to an etiquette class and subsequently be a shaperun for that etiquette class

34:35.980 --> 34:36.980
when they were in high school.

34:36.980 --> 34:37.980
And that's what you said.

34:37.980 --> 34:38.980
Did you do that?

34:38.980 --> 34:39.980
I sort of did.

34:39.980 --> 34:40.980
That could tell you.

34:40.980 --> 34:41.980
It wasn't a silly idea.

34:41.980 --> 34:42.980
It wasn't a silly idea.

34:42.980 --> 34:43.980
It wasn't a silly idea.

34:43.980 --> 34:48.980
Basically, you like make sure that the guys are behaving themselves.

34:48.980 --> 34:50.980
And you do it like super rudely.

34:50.980 --> 34:54.980
But I was so rude to the kids, but it was just so funny to me.

34:54.980 --> 34:57.980
The only person who doesn't need to abide by the rules at the shaperun.

34:57.980 --> 34:58.980
Exactly right.

34:58.980 --> 35:02.980
So I didn't abide by the rules when I was in the etiquette class, which he was just

35:02.980 --> 35:04.980
so my parents wanted me to be able to box step.

35:04.980 --> 35:06.980
So I don't know why.

35:06.980 --> 35:09.980
That was all they teach you is a box step.

35:09.980 --> 35:13.980
And then outdated social norms that I've never encountered as an adult.

35:13.980 --> 35:16.980
They're like, a lady always wears her gloves.

35:16.980 --> 35:21.980
And it's like, if a woman's approaching the table, you stand up and it's like, all that shit.

35:21.980 --> 35:26.980
But then I needed a job in high school and I worked at a cafe, but it was too much work.

35:26.980 --> 35:27.980
So then I decided to do this instead.

35:27.980 --> 35:28.980
Why was it too much work?

35:28.980 --> 35:30.980
A lot of divorcees.

35:30.980 --> 35:33.980
So we're demanding, not very nice.

35:33.980 --> 35:35.980
Some of your time and your energy.

35:35.980 --> 35:36.980
Yeah.

35:36.980 --> 35:38.980
A spirit, almost.

35:38.980 --> 35:40.980
But my spirit was fed by yelling at children.

35:40.980 --> 35:41.980
Yeah.

35:41.980 --> 35:43.980
So I was like, I feel like that's often the case.

35:43.980 --> 35:46.980
But I feel like there was always like, in Joel, you were probably one of these guys.

35:46.980 --> 35:50.980
But it was basically like, there was always like a two or three guys that were like the bad boys.

35:50.980 --> 35:51.980
Yeah.

35:51.980 --> 35:52.980
And they were like in the class, kind of.

35:52.980 --> 35:53.980
Back in the class, kind of kids.

35:53.980 --> 35:54.980
Yeah.

35:55.980 --> 35:56.980
Of course.

35:56.980 --> 35:57.980
I don't believe it.

35:57.980 --> 35:59.980
I think you were a middle of the class.

35:59.980 --> 36:00.980
No.

36:00.980 --> 36:01.980
No.

36:01.980 --> 36:02.980
No.

36:02.980 --> 36:03.980
I actually really established the energy.

36:03.980 --> 36:05.980
I was going to bring to our off-site in Denver.

36:05.980 --> 36:07.980
We had our first meeting.

36:07.980 --> 36:09.980
And I was like, I'm sitting in the back row.

36:09.980 --> 36:12.980
You actually, you're dressed like one of these kids now.

36:12.980 --> 36:13.980
Yeah.

36:13.980 --> 36:14.980
You're an adult now.

36:14.980 --> 36:16.980
What was your energy like in middle school?

36:16.980 --> 36:18.980
Way more toxic.

36:22.980 --> 36:23.980
Me too.

36:23.980 --> 36:26.980
So then I was like, I was, I, to a tone for that.

36:26.980 --> 36:30.980
I was like, let me like really crack down on these.

36:30.980 --> 36:31.980
Okay.

36:31.980 --> 36:34.980
I would say toxic was front of the class.

36:34.980 --> 36:35.980
No.

36:35.980 --> 36:37.980
You were front of the class.

36:37.980 --> 36:38.980
I was not front of the class.

36:38.980 --> 36:39.980
What were you middle?

36:39.980 --> 36:40.980
Middle to back.

36:44.980 --> 36:47.980
I don't like, I don't like volunteer information.

36:47.980 --> 36:49.980
So like raising my hand.

36:49.980 --> 36:52.980
Well, like speaking of.

36:52.980 --> 36:56.980
What do you most presently dealing with?

36:56.980 --> 36:58.980
What do you mean?

36:58.980 --> 37:00.980
I said this wedding.

37:00.980 --> 37:02.980
Beyond the wedding.

37:02.980 --> 37:04.980
Speaking up.

37:04.980 --> 37:06.980
Joel.

37:06.980 --> 37:08.980
What are you dealing with?

37:08.980 --> 37:12.980
I thought Joel said the first thing because I'm so tired.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.980
Joel.

37:14.980 --> 37:17.980
What are you dealing with most presently?

37:18.980 --> 37:20.980
Life is pretty good at the moment.

37:20.980 --> 37:22.980
I'm sorry to say.

37:24.980 --> 37:28.980
You know, just the constant.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.980
What are we doing with our lives?

37:31.980 --> 37:33.980
Totally.

37:33.980 --> 37:35.980
How should one be Jeff?

37:35.980 --> 37:37.980
I guess that's my question for you.

37:37.980 --> 37:39.980
One should be.

37:39.980 --> 37:40.980
Joy.

37:40.980 --> 37:41.980
Joy.

37:41.980 --> 37:45.980
One should stay wise if you already've gotten there.

37:45.980 --> 37:47.980
And then if not, you should get wise.

37:47.980 --> 37:48.980
Right.

37:48.980 --> 37:51.980
And.

37:51.980 --> 37:54.980
I think that I think for a live show, you should get.

37:54.980 --> 37:56.980
Because I'm on the verge of like a not.

37:56.980 --> 37:58.980
It's either going to be a breakdown or it's going to be a breakthrough.

37:58.980 --> 38:01.980
It's either going to be a piphany or a palpitation.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.980
Exactly.

38:03.980 --> 38:05.980
Um.

38:05.980 --> 38:07.980
In body.

38:07.980 --> 38:09.980
Kind.

38:09.980 --> 38:11.980
Totally.

38:11.980 --> 38:13.980
So that's sort of adding to the duo.

38:13.980 --> 38:14.980
Yeah, so it's.

38:14.980 --> 38:15.980
Be joy.

38:15.980 --> 38:16.980
Be joy.

38:16.980 --> 38:17.980
Get wise.

38:17.980 --> 38:18.980
Body kind.

38:18.980 --> 38:19.980
Yeah.

38:19.980 --> 38:21.980
Um.

38:21.980 --> 38:23.980
All right.

38:23.980 --> 38:25.980
I can do that.

38:25.980 --> 38:29.980
What about like embellish?

38:29.980 --> 38:32.980
Everything.

38:32.980 --> 38:34.980
Faith.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.980
So.

38:36.980 --> 38:40.980
Sort of be not truthful about what you believe.

38:40.980 --> 38:41.980
Yeah.

38:41.980 --> 38:42.980
No.

38:43.980 --> 38:44.980
Um.

38:44.980 --> 38:46.980
I think that you should get those tattoos that you want.

38:46.980 --> 38:47.980
The be joy.

38:47.980 --> 38:48.980
Go wise.

38:48.980 --> 38:50.980
On stage live.

38:50.980 --> 38:53.980
I don't think I could do more tattoos with letters because I've already done.

38:53.980 --> 38:55.980
I've already done words here.

38:55.980 --> 38:56.980
Okay.

38:56.980 --> 38:57.980
But like.

38:57.980 --> 39:00.980
The one inch of your body.

39:00.980 --> 39:02.980
I don't think you should have.

39:02.980 --> 39:03.980
I don't know.

39:03.980 --> 39:05.980
It looks weird when people do too much writing.

39:05.980 --> 39:07.980
And I don't even just mean as tattoos.

39:07.980 --> 39:09.980
I mean like I look at certain authors.

39:09.980 --> 39:11.980
You know, with a skeptic a lot.

39:11.980 --> 39:13.980
That's like you're getting paid by the word.

39:13.980 --> 39:14.980
You're sure.

39:14.980 --> 39:16.980
That's what you switched to podcasting.

39:16.980 --> 39:17.980
Yeah.

39:17.980 --> 39:18.980
Yeah.

39:18.980 --> 39:19.980
Otherwise I would have been an author.

39:19.980 --> 39:21.980
That would have been great.

39:21.980 --> 39:22.980
You should write a book.

39:22.980 --> 39:23.980
Honestly.

39:23.980 --> 39:27.980
I would write a great.

39:27.980 --> 39:28.980
I think.

39:28.980 --> 39:29.980
Yeah.

39:29.980 --> 39:30.980
I think you should write a book.

39:30.980 --> 39:31.980
What you're going to be about getting.

39:31.980 --> 39:32.980
Being joy and getting wise.

39:32.980 --> 39:33.980
And then.

39:33.980 --> 39:34.980
I think.

39:34.980 --> 39:37.980
You write the forward and you kind of shoehorn in your own.

39:37.980 --> 39:40.980
It's actually about embellishing faith.

39:41.980 --> 39:43.980
I actually have an interesting story.

39:43.980 --> 39:44.980
Why?

39:44.980 --> 39:45.980
Yeah.

39:45.980 --> 39:46.980
Before that.

39:46.980 --> 39:48.980
I do think you should write a book.

39:48.980 --> 39:49.980
And I think it should either be.

39:49.980 --> 39:50.980
Yeah.

39:50.980 --> 39:51.980
Like self-help.

39:51.980 --> 39:52.980
Or.

39:52.980 --> 39:53.980
Uh.

39:53.980 --> 39:54.980
You would write like.

39:54.980 --> 39:57.980
A fiction book about.

39:57.980 --> 39:59.980
You're like.

39:59.980 --> 40:00.980
Uh.

40:00.980 --> 40:02.980
You know, going to the.

40:02.980 --> 40:03.980
What's the can't.

40:03.980 --> 40:04.980
Laurel Canyon.

40:04.980 --> 40:05.980
Like a.

40:05.980 --> 40:06.980
Yeah.

40:06.980 --> 40:07.980
Some character in that era.

40:08.980 --> 40:11.980
Emma Klein already did that with her book Daddy.

40:11.980 --> 40:13.980
It's takes place in Laurel Canyon partially.

40:13.980 --> 40:14.980
That's one book.

40:14.980 --> 40:17.980
That's the only story we told in modern day, Laurel.

40:17.980 --> 40:20.980
It doesn't have to be modern day, Laurel.

40:20.980 --> 40:21.980
It can be.

40:21.980 --> 40:22.980
I made up Laurel.

40:22.980 --> 40:23.980
Right.

40:23.980 --> 40:24.980
You know.

40:24.980 --> 40:25.980
And I don't know the.

40:25.980 --> 40:26.980
It could be the Laurel.

40:26.980 --> 40:28.980
Or you want to see in the world.

40:28.980 --> 40:31.980
It's just going to be like waxing about how I want the real estate

40:31.980 --> 40:32.980
prices to come down.

40:32.980 --> 40:36.980
It's kind of a manifest out.

40:36.980 --> 40:37.980
Yeah.

40:37.980 --> 40:38.980
Yeah.

40:38.980 --> 40:41.980
I think we have to get a look out of here.

40:41.980 --> 40:42.980
Um.

40:42.980 --> 40:43.980
Plugs.

40:43.980 --> 40:44.980
Oh, sorry.

40:44.980 --> 40:45.980
Yeah.

40:45.980 --> 40:46.980
Joel.

40:46.980 --> 40:47.980
No.

40:47.980 --> 40:48.980
No.

40:48.980 --> 40:49.980
No.

40:49.980 --> 40:50.980
No.

40:50.980 --> 40:51.980
No.

40:51.980 --> 40:52.980
No.

40:52.980 --> 40:53.980
No.

40:53.980 --> 40:54.980
No.

40:54.980 --> 40:55.980
No.

40:55.980 --> 40:56.980
No.

40:56.980 --> 40:57.980
No.

40:57.980 --> 40:58.980
No.

40:58.980 --> 40:59.980
No.

40:59.980 --> 41:00.980
No.

41:00.980 --> 41:01.980
No.

41:01.980 --> 41:02.980
No.

41:02.980 --> 41:03.980
No.

41:03.980 --> 41:04.980
No.

41:04.980 --> 41:05.980
No.

41:06.980 --> 41:07.980
You have worth.

41:07.980 --> 41:08.980
For sure.

41:08.980 --> 41:09.980
You have worth for sure.

41:09.980 --> 41:10.980
You have a little bit worth.

41:10.980 --> 41:11.980
A little bit worth.

41:11.980 --> 41:13.980
But no plug still.

41:13.980 --> 41:14.980
That's fair.

41:14.980 --> 41:15.980
Be joy.

41:15.980 --> 41:16.980
Get wise.

41:16.980 --> 41:18.980
Embodied kind.

41:18.980 --> 41:20.980
And embellish having worth.

41:20.980 --> 41:21.980
Um.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.980
Follow me.

41:23.980 --> 41:26.980
I'm Marie Dalon on Twitter slash x.

41:26.980 --> 41:27.980
Instagram.

41:27.980 --> 41:28.980
Blue sky.

41:28.980 --> 41:29.980
Threads.

41:29.980 --> 41:30.980
Letterbox.

41:30.980 --> 41:31.980
Tick-tock.

41:31.980 --> 41:34.980
Listen to the pit wall.

41:35.980 --> 41:39.980
By me, an oval ice machine.

41:39.980 --> 41:42.980
And.

41:42.980 --> 41:44.980
Um.

41:44.980 --> 41:45.980
Go see.

41:45.980 --> 41:46.980
Glory days.

41:46.980 --> 41:47.980
2024.

41:47.980 --> 41:49.980
King company production.

41:49.980 --> 41:50.980
Great.

41:50.980 --> 41:51.980
Great.

41:51.980 --> 41:52.980
Before that could.

41:52.980 --> 41:53.980
I guess I.

41:53.980 --> 41:54.980
Yeah.

41:54.980 --> 41:55.980
And do that.

41:55.980 --> 41:56.980
Wearing.

41:56.980 --> 41:57.980
When are those?

41:57.980 --> 41:59.980
Really nerdy issues.

41:59.980 --> 42:01.980
Kind of front of the class kid.

42:01.980 --> 42:02.980
Kind of.

42:02.980 --> 42:03.980
Exactly.

42:03.980 --> 42:04.980
I don't know.

42:04.980 --> 42:05.980
Be joy.

42:05.980 --> 42:06.980
Be joy.

42:06.980 --> 42:07.980
Get wise.

42:07.980 --> 42:08.980
Obviously.

42:08.980 --> 42:09.980
Embodied kind.

42:09.980 --> 42:11.980
How delicious.

42:11.980 --> 42:12.980
How hate.

42:12.980 --> 42:13.980
How happy.

42:13.980 --> 42:14.980
How happy.

42:14.980 --> 42:16.980
There's a great substance in Canada.

42:16.980 --> 42:17.980
See those paradox.

42:17.980 --> 42:18.980
Yeah.

42:18.980 --> 42:19.980
Yeah.

42:19.980 --> 42:23.980
Do you guys know the founder of Crox made a new shoe called Joy Bees?

42:23.980 --> 42:27.980
Which is the exact same thing as Crox just to hexagons instead of circles?

42:27.980 --> 42:28.980
And I kid you not.

42:28.980 --> 42:31.980
These hexagons are so circular looking.

42:31.980 --> 42:34.980
You need to like really zoom in to tell that it's six lines.

42:34.980 --> 42:35.980
And not just a circle.

42:35.980 --> 42:38.980
I really feel like I should too.

42:38.980 --> 42:41.980
Because it's just the inverse of my personal mantra.

42:41.980 --> 42:42.980
Yeah.

42:42.980 --> 42:45.980
I think we should.

42:45.980 --> 42:47.980
These are the same fucking thing.

42:47.980 --> 42:49.980
This is the way it's crazy, right?

42:49.980 --> 42:50.980
That's insane.

42:50.980 --> 42:52.980
Well, this I couldn't get over it.

42:52.980 --> 42:54.980
I had like spent two of the best hours in my life.

42:54.980 --> 42:56.980
What a waste of his time.

42:56.980 --> 43:00.980
Like nobody's going to switch over from Crox.

43:00.980 --> 43:03.980
And he's investing his own money into this shit.

43:03.980 --> 43:04.980
What the fuck?

43:04.980 --> 43:06.980
Just have the ease of billionaire.

43:06.980 --> 43:10.980
No, I think he actually had a big according to Kimber, the woman who was helping me

43:10.980 --> 43:12.980
by shoes at the shoe store in Boulder.

43:12.980 --> 43:15.980
He got into some big fight with the original Crox people.

43:15.980 --> 43:17.980
So that's why he kind of had to move on.

43:17.980 --> 43:18.980
I see.

43:18.980 --> 43:20.980
I thought he sold it though.

43:20.980 --> 43:22.980
Maybe.

43:22.980 --> 43:26.980
But I guess this kind of fits your thing if there's no new ideas.

43:26.980 --> 43:27.980
Yeah.

43:27.980 --> 43:29.980
So give me the fucking Crox guy round out.

43:29.980 --> 43:32.980
That guy's a genius.

43:32.980 --> 43:33.980
Fucking legend.

43:56.980 --> 43:58.980
You

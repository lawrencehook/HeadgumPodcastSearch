WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
And I'm not even really that sick.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
I just feel really run down in recovering.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
And it's just like it's so fucked up

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
that we can never just take a week off of this bullshit.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Yeah.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
I don't want to perform right now.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
I'm in a grumpy mood.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
You got to zip the show?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
What's that?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Is this already the show?

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
No, we haven't started because of Limerica.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
Limerica is not...

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
She's ill-prepared and she's ill at ease.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
And I'm recovering.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
I said I was recording a minute ago.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Fine.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
And yes, this is the show.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
And this is the show.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Here we go.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Welcome to the show.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
If you're just tuning in,

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
this is the head-gum podcast.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
What?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Of course, I'm just tuning in.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
I should just start it.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
All right, all right.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Casey's picking up the energy.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah, I don't necessarily have it today.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Let's just say that.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Mereka, what's wrong?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
What are you talking about?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Mereka, I need it.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
She's...

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
What?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Sushi?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
It's 2015.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Our lunch arrived as the started.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
You guys ordered sushi as a cup of tea for lunch?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah, come on in.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
This is this guy.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Come on in.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
This sucks.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
It's hard to come.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
It's a cup of tea.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
It's a cup of tea.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
It's a cup of tea.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
It's a cup of tea.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Oh, I think I need to turn on that mic.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Oh, yeah.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
All right.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Well, as she gets up, we should introduce...

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Making her head-gum podcast debut.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Rishou!

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Rishou!

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Rishou!

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Rishou!

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Rishou!

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Also, am I levels okay?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Now they're better.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
You have a flat ass.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Has anyone ever told you that?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Uh, no.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
But nobody's ever said that I had a nice round ass.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
It's for my ass.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Does that make sense?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Have we started?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Yes.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
But we started.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
But that was...

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
What's that?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
I don't think that was on camera or...

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Did we just stop and start again?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
I had to stop and start to arm the mic.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Yeah.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
For sure.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Um...

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
I don't have headphones so I can't hear what we're using.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
There's no headphones over there.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Oh, my god.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Make it the end of the mic, you.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Uh, more than me.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
So the great episode.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
And I knew this would happen.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
You know, sometimes...

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Yeah.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Sometimes you wake up feeling dangerous.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Sometimes you wake up feeling...

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Sort of pathetic.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Like, yeah.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Do you want to mean?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Oh, yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Yeah.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Rishou, how does it work?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
How does it work?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Did you wake up?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Dangerous.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Which is pathetic.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Which is pathetic.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Because it's just this.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Rishou, do you want to introduce yourself what you do at the network?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Um...

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
How you're feeling today?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
And maybe...

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Yeah.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Like...

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
That's enough.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
That's enough for now.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Yeah.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
That's enough for now.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
That's enough for now.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
That's enough for now.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
That's enough for now.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Yeah.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
What's your immigration status?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Pending.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Really?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
No.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm a U.S. citizen.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Okay.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
That's good to hear.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
I know.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Sorry.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
And what's your...

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Let's do social security number.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
That just do...

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Just one day.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
What's your role here at the company?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I don't know.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Do you, do you guys know?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
You're a producer engineer.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
I'm a producer and engineer.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Yeah.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I'll speak for a rishou, for what shows.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Case ...

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Exxo gossip king and the basketball podcast.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
A good one.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Yeah.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
It's about baseball.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
It's about basketball.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
It's about baseball.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
It's about baseball.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
It's about baseball.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
It's about baseball.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
It's about baseball.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
It's about baseball.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
It's about baseball.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
It's about baseball.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
Are you excited, nervous?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I feel like you were forced to do this.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
I'm a little scared.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
And on you said she was going to be here to protect me, but she's not here.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
She did say that.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Yeah.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
I feel like my bad habits are rubbing out on you.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Like promising one thing.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
And what way?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Delivering.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
In what way, is that what you said?

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Just like, yeah, over promising under delivering.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
What?

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
Rochelle, you produced an engineer the last episode of, if I were you.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Yeah.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
The very last one.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
But you didn't know it was the last one.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
No, no one told me that.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
You were the, I'm going to show up and help record.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
And.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
So interrupting a kind of interesting conversation for the,

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
I'm going to the week, well, bond of the week, which doesn't matter anymore.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Skyler, jizbondo.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Sure.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Jizbondo is my pick.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I feel like we said come before.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
I'll see you changed his name.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
What's his last name?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Jizbondo.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Who is that?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
No, his last name is jizbondo.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Who is that?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
He, you know his face.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
He plays Will.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
He's in book smart.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Yeah.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
He's in the righteous gemstones.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
He has a great career.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
I'm jealous of him.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Who is he in both of those?

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
He's the, he's Danny McFreads son.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Yeah.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Can we just?

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
And then he's the kid that shows up to the castle.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Guys.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Bring it in.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Yeah.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Well, now that I know who it is, I can top it up.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I do think he would be a good.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
That Michelle produced the last name.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
You can't go back to that.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
What?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Why not?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
We moved on.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
We had to do bond of the week at the five minute episode.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
I mean, it marked.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
No, he did not.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
And nobody else did their bond.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Nobody else cares to do their bond.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
I also feel like let's get bond of the week started.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Let's circle back to you producing the last episode of if I were you.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
And then we'll do everyone's bond of the week.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
That's it.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
That was the whole story that Michelle sort of tied into my podcast.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Lower now because she was there for the finale.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
Are you frustrated at all that you could have avoided the cancer that was if I were you?

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Because you were like one episode away from never having to touch that shit.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
I did a couple other ones.

06:47.000 --> 06:56.000
What's the bond of the week?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Michelle, who's your bond of the week?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
I don't know if you've ever heard the show.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Of course not.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Yeah.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
What's the bond of the week?

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
So Daniel Craig is out as James.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Okay.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
So every week until the next bond is cast.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
We're loving up our pick for the next 007.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Okay.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Okay.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Okay.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Yeah.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
And my pick this week was Skyler Gisando.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Or should we say Skyler Gisando.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Yeah.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
You did see that a lot.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
You can also go last if you want to get a feel for how people pick this.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
I'll go next.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
All right.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Similarly, I'll just go with Tim bolts.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Yes, bond.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Okay.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Tim bonds.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Yeah.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
That's kind of nice.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
No, that's good.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
I'm going to go directly.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
You said it.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
So don't say it was really good.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
I said Tim bonds.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Well, I was saying a mirror.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
A mirror thing was good.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
I'm going to go with the minions.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
All of them.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
That's interesting.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
That's cute.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Yeah.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
That's good.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Because they could kind of stack on each other and be tall.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Yeah.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
You're not worried that they can't speak English.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
So like the classic line.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I said set banana before.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
I know that much.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
He said banana, which is not really banana.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Imagine them saying James Bond.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Bond.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Bond.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
It's really good.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
See, that's the kind of shit we took.

08:24.000 --> 08:33.000
You can also pass, I guess.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
That one's ever done that for you.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
I'm going to go casey bond to you.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Pretty good.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
You said James Bond.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
We've already been.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
You've already been.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Yes.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Oh, okay.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Then Marie could have already been.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I think I chose you.

08:54.000 --> 09:06.000
Because someone made the list of our running Bond of the weeks.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
And I think I chose you as.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
But when you're specifically when you're wearing your bowloat.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Oh, I like that.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
What?

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Make it something happened.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Nothing sorry.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Just whispering to me, I don't even know what he's saying.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
He's like giving a note.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
How about this for a bond, really?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
I heard a hungry gate.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
I'm saying why are we even.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Yeah.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Now I'm just going to speak to you too.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
But like why do we even do this show?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
It's like nobody wants like it.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Because nobody.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Nobody.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Like we're coming together to try to make shit happen.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
But nothing ever does.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Other than like, I don't know.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Are we coming together to make shit happen?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Down town up.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
The downtown episode was good.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Yeah.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I liked the fuck up some rise episode.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
People like last week.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
We knew about it.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
And last week.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
But then that was like a gimmick.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
You know.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Nothing.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
We're all in front of the camera.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
I'm Rika's in New York.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
This is a nothing burger.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Or shall welcome to the show.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
I hope you're having fun.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
You can really.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Thank you.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Thank you.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I just wanted to comment.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
That was really taken to the phrase nothing burger.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Mm.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
And I don't really know what the origin is.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
You started saying it.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
I think it's funny.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
What is a nothing burger?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
But it's like a basketball thing.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Well basketball is like he scored a 50 burger.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Like when he has 50 points.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
But nothing burger is like when you just basically had burger

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
to a quantity is like a thing.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
But I didn't think nothing burger is specifically a basketball

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
reference.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Like this whole.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
This whole trial is a nothing burger basically.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Did you say podcast?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
No.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Because that's actually the word of the day.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I didn't say it.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
What is a show about?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Thank you.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Exactly.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
You're getting it.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
That was the serious question.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
No, that's the correct.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Valorality.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Moving around.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Discuss.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
Do you feel young?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
These days not really.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
A body is hurting.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I'm going to go with them now.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
My bones are aching.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
So Casey's bones are aching.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Marie could just set it flat out.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
No.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
You're 40, bud.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
So I think you don't feel young.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yeah.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
I mean, I don't feel old.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
I just feel like I'm, yeah, my age.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
So, you know, bumps and bruises.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Trying to maximize sleep, health, food.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
Thinking about mortality more than I was at age 20, sure.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
But I wouldn't say I feel old.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
But yeah, I don't feel young either.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Do you fear death?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
No, I don't really fear death.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
It's so far away that I'm more concerned with more like a current problems.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
If I was you, well, now that you don't have the show anymore, I'll just say if I were you,

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
I'd be, I'd be fearing finishing out my mortgage.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I mean, hanging it off.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
Because that means I'll have a lived in that house for third years.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
That house, yeah.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
It's fine.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Yeah.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
But you want to like, your house should be an expression of your personality.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
And it uses kind of like a white box.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Really?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Well, because you have a nice patio.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
You have the car report for the show.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Yeah.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
How's that for a show's house this weekend?

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
For a show, would you say that your house is an expression of your personality?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Maybe the inside.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Yeah.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
I don't know about the outside.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
But yours is a rental, we should say.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Yes.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Okay.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
One second.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Because you don't have control over the outside.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
You only have control over the inside.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
On which you put your mark, your stamp.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
I guess so.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
I guess I could, I could do something.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
What did you think about the outside of my house?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Yeah.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
I didn't really see the inside.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
We shall have a birthday party.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Whoa.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Oh, yes.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Speaking of getting older.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Do you feel young?

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Um, no.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
When's your birthday?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
April 30th.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
And then I hit the big 3L.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Whoa.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
30 on 30.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
30 on 30.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Holy smokes.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
Rochelle had a bunch of fun decorations about being old now.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Which was kind of insulting as someone older than 30.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Yeah.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
I was like, well.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Come on.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Oh my god.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
I'm 30.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
I'm like, yeah.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
I think she has a point.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
What?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Because both of us are not 30.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Really?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Yeah.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
How old are you guys?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
I'm 40.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
I'm 29.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
I'm 28 actually.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Soon to be 29.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
We should say.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Yeah.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
I'm like, and half a year.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
What is this?

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
Because 28 and a half.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
This show is...

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Nothing.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Nothing.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Yeah.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I'm 25.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Oh wow.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Yeah.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I try to kill you here.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Every time.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
I'll be asked about you.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Yeah.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
We don't seem like we're 15 years apart, right?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Are you trying to say that you seem younger?

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
I think I'm a little...

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
I feel a little bit younger.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
You feel a little bit older.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
So we're both like 29.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
Now I would say, like, I'm 38ish and you're sort of 28ish.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
But you're still...

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
I mean, it's so old.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Yeah.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
I don't know.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Yeah.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
It's still 10 years apart.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Yeah.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Yeah.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Yes.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
The only that gives it away is the silver in your hair.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Great.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
But I feel like...

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
You got to be a little cowice.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Two of them here.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
I think it's great.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
I think it's great.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
I think it's great.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
That's good.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Yeah.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I want to be salt and pepper.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
But I'm older.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
I think it's sort of a...

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
What's that?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I didn't say anything.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Discuss.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
What do you guys think land in Donovan is doing right?

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Go soccer player?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
The soccer player?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
The soccer player?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Yes.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Go soccer player.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
Guys, how often is it that you get caught up in what others need from you?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Right?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Rather than what you need from you?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
All right?

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
It's hard because it's so easy to spend all your time giving.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
And it can leave you feeling stretched thin and burnt out.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Right?

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
That's where therapy can come in because therapy gives you the tools to find more balance in your life.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Right?

15:41.000 --> 15:48.000
So you can keep supporting others while also supporting yourself and not leaving yourself behind.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Again, guys.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
I'm in therapy every week.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
I'd therapy today.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
And I'm soaring.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
I don't know what else to say.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
I mean, I finally had that hour to give to myself.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
And then now tonight, I'm already to go to go to that head gum happy hour.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
I'd dynasty typewriter to give to others because I mean, the joy, the wisdom that I spew is a gift.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
I don't know what else to say.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
like, slack when a patient.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Yeah.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Yeah.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
That's for sure.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
That's not on me.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
This is the head gum product.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
It's slack.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
It's coming from head gum.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
It sounded like a slack, like a DM.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Like not even in, like, a group channel.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
So was Marty texting us about lunch?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
What was the...

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
No.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
It was about lunch.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
We got to get on that.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
No.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Mike has been trying to slide.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I mean, I'm sort of looking here.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Like a her with.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Yeah.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Won't you just respond to him?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Well, it doesn't look as then it validates him.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
You know, it's like when people, yeah.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
Like, Marie, good people probably slide into your DMs, right?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Do you ever respond?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
You don't take me on slack?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
No, on Instagram.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Not that much.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
But you get headgum fans reaching out to you.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Uh, I'd say, like, everyone's in a while.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
But I also am really bad about, like, checking the,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
the, like, one sort of...

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Requested out.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Sure.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Yeah.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
Resil, do you want to plug your social media?

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Um, you can follow me on Instagram.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
At your dinner score on your score, Sard.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
That's good.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Is that your last name, Sard?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
No.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Do you think our first name was Yard?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
It's not.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Resil, Yard, Sard.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
The strike is in full.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
What are we discussing?

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
The WGA strike.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Marie, get in full effect.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Oh, the strike is in full effect.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Why haven't we struck?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Because, because we're sure how much we have.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Are you paid hourly or he's salary?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
I'm paid hourly.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
So how much do you make an hour?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
You don't have to answer that.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
But also employee solidarity, because I'm, I mean,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
make less than you, and then I can use this as negotiation

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
with his ass to get more.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
To get more for you, but not her.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Well, if I make more, she could use that.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Oh, let's get point.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
You don't have to answer it.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
I mean, I, it's up to a mirror, honestly.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Me.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
How did I get involved in this whole rig of my role?

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
Uh, yeah, I also agree that you don't have to answer it.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Well, it's better for him if you don't answer it.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
She's the boss.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Rica?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Thoughts on your salary.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
I mean, you're never seen an invoice.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Yeah.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Rica's right.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Oh, yeah.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Does it mean you, do you know how much I get paid?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Probably not.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
I don't know.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Not at all.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Do you know Casey?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Not at all.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
I think I do.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Okay.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
40.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
What?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
I'm just not here.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Does it mean I'm not protection?

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
And this is on her.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
I'm protecting her.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
I'm protecting her.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
You said that on your feels guilty.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
I'm not going.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
I'm protecting her.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Casey hired me.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
I.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Yeah.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
I said we should hire her.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
You said we'll start?

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
You at 7.25 an hour.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
That's what I said.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Yes.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
That's what I said.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
How do you guys know it?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Don't point like that.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Yeah, don't point like that.

19:46.000 --> 19:52.000
I think the first time we met officially was in a group chat game of survivor.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Yeah.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Oh, wow.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
And then I betrayed Casey.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Yeah.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
She dated my ex.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
In the game of survivors.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Sure.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Yeah.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
How does it add to the text game of survivors?

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
She won the game.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Oh, really?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Is it just like a group chat where like somebody gets focused?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Wait.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
I have a question.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Yeah.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Common friends.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Which is a group chat.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Text game of pega.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.020
We were in a editing collective call eraser trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash

20:20.020 --> 20:21.020
trash trash trash trash.

20:21.020 --> 20:25.020
And then who put you in a group tech you're an ex.

20:25.020 --> 20:27.020
One big dot again?

20:27.020 --> 20:27.040
Oh, Martin Dave Seeker.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.000
Yeah.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
My live gave.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Good broad you.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
Yeah, I was thinking of yeah different day.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
I've been talking before.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.520
Cooking before we see your.

20:37.520 --> 20:40.360
does Dave Seeker wear a flıyor?

20:40.360 --> 20:42.400
Ever know what?

20:42.400 --> 20:44.320
It's the type of pilot's watch.

20:44.320 --> 20:45.160
Flieger?

20:45.160 --> 20:45.520
Yeah.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.840
I don't think you were as flieger.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.240
I do have a Seeger hat and I've told them

20:49.240 --> 20:51.640
that he should get a Seeger hat himself.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.480
Or David?

20:53.480 --> 20:54.760
A David hat?

20:54.760 --> 20:56.320
Yeah.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.960
And he could alternate depending on if he's feeling his first

20:58.960 --> 21:01.120
name or his last name.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.440
A lot of people call him Seeger.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.440
Wow!

21:11.440 --> 21:14.040
You guys must have been really trusting of Casey

21:14.040 --> 21:17.440
because I didn't have any interviews when I was hired here.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.840
You didn't do any interviews?

21:18.840 --> 21:19.040
Yeah.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.040
Some people I've heard have had to do four,

21:21.040 --> 21:22.040
which is way too many.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.840
I had to do three.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.640
I think the difference is full-time versus freelance employee.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.040
My final interview was with Danny and Angie

21:29.040 --> 21:30.840
and I was confused why.

21:30.840 --> 21:31.840
Yeah.

21:31.840 --> 21:32.840
Yeah.

21:32.840 --> 21:33.840
You like to be like today?

21:33.840 --> 21:34.840
For us to part together.

21:34.840 --> 21:36.840
Somebody in the conference room with their back to the door.

21:36.840 --> 21:37.840
I think that's Alex.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.840
Berkman?

21:39.840 --> 21:41.840
Get her in here.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.840
This is her every day.

21:43.840 --> 21:46.840
You should get her on the one hand.

21:46.840 --> 21:47.840
She's doing the next.

21:47.840 --> 21:48.840
It's doing the next shift.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.840
I think it's you.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.840
Berkman.

21:52.840 --> 21:54.840
Allie and I'm not doing the next one.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.840
What?

21:56.840 --> 21:57.840
And what?

21:57.840 --> 21:58.840
I'm not doing the next one.

21:58.840 --> 21:59.840
What?

21:59.840 --> 22:00.840
Erica.

22:00.840 --> 22:03.840
And we're going to try and get Berkman on and then if you can,

22:03.840 --> 22:06.840
would really love to have you because I don't want it to be all.

22:06.840 --> 22:07.840
Very good.

22:07.840 --> 22:08.840
Where is it?

22:08.840 --> 22:10.840
She's not coming.

22:10.840 --> 22:11.840
You're confused.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.840
You don't want it to be all women.

22:13.840 --> 22:14.840
Yeah.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.840
What amere supposed to be on that one?

22:16.840 --> 22:17.840
No.

22:17.840 --> 22:18.840
I don't care about that.

22:18.840 --> 22:20.840
I just want a familiar face because otherwise,

22:20.840 --> 22:23.840
it's mostly people who are never on the show.

22:23.840 --> 22:24.840
And I've been on a lot.

22:24.840 --> 22:25.840
That's true.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.840
Alex can kind of hold it down.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.840
Also amere supposed to be on that one.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.840
That's why we're spending this episode talking about the next episode.

22:33.840 --> 22:34.840
That's what we're talking about.

22:34.840 --> 22:36.840
We're always in pre-pros.

22:36.840 --> 22:39.840
Here's a segment that I like to call.

22:39.840 --> 22:40.840
Um.

22:40.840 --> 22:41.840
Okay.

22:47.840 --> 22:48.840
So right.

22:56.840 --> 22:57.840
This was way shorter.

22:57.840 --> 22:58.840
That's a weird point for it to cut off.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.840
This is a segment I like to call.

23:00.840 --> 23:01.840
So what?

23:01.840 --> 23:07.840
So these are our local headlines that shouldn't have been reported.

23:07.840 --> 23:13.840
Uh, the first one is this golden statue was ridiculed when a local government

23:13.840 --> 23:14.840
erected it.

23:14.840 --> 23:18.840
Then gold prices skyrocketed.

23:18.840 --> 23:19.840
So what?

23:19.840 --> 23:20.840
So what?

23:20.840 --> 23:21.840
So what?

23:21.840 --> 23:22.840
You know what?

23:22.840 --> 23:23.840
You know what?

23:23.840 --> 23:24.840
I see.

23:24.840 --> 23:25.840
So what?

23:25.840 --> 23:26.840
Yeah.

23:26.840 --> 23:31.840
West Hartford Connecticut removes no trespassing signs in town.

23:31.840 --> 23:32.840
That's why I went to high school.

23:32.840 --> 23:35.840
Just days after installation.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.840
So what?

23:37.840 --> 23:39.840
Actually, I care about that one.

23:39.840 --> 23:40.840
I went to high school there.

23:40.840 --> 23:43.840
Wait, what's the actual, they removed the sign?

23:43.840 --> 23:44.840
Mm-hm.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.840
Break it, you hear about that?

23:46.840 --> 23:47.840
Is this thing?

23:47.840 --> 23:48.840
I hear about it.

23:48.840 --> 23:49.840
We got, are you, as news to me?

23:49.840 --> 23:51.840
Are you Gilmore girls?

23:51.840 --> 23:52.840
No.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.840
But you went to high school in Hartford.

23:54.840 --> 23:56.840
Less Hartford.

23:56.840 --> 24:01.840
In West Hartford born and educated?

24:01.840 --> 24:05.840
On the playground is where I did all of my trespassing.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.840
What grades were you in?

24:07.840 --> 24:12.840
And what, when you get, when you were in Hartford?

24:12.840 --> 24:14.840
Um, I was, but we should say that.

24:14.840 --> 24:16.840
It's for the viewer who just saw that.

24:16.840 --> 24:18.840
What, she just kind of heard a little aside away from the mic.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.840
Rook is housing tuna right now with soy.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.840
And so I think that that was literally.

24:23.840 --> 24:24.840
No, literally.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.840
It's sweet soy sauce or wasabi onto the looks of it.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.840
Wow.

24:27.840 --> 24:28.840
That looks fancy.

24:28.840 --> 24:29.840
Oh, where's it from?

24:29.840 --> 24:30.840
That looks good.

24:30.840 --> 24:31.840
Straight shot.

24:31.840 --> 24:33.840
She's going to pop up.

24:33.840 --> 24:42.840
I was actually kind of in every grade when I was in high school.

24:42.840 --> 24:46.840
Which is normal sounding, but I skipped grades.

24:46.840 --> 24:50.840
So I started in ninth because my credits hadn't transferred.

24:50.840 --> 24:54.840
And then I at the end of the year, I was in 10th.

24:54.840 --> 24:58.840
And then I started 11th, but graduated early.

24:58.840 --> 25:00.840
So it was also kind of in 12th.

25:00.840 --> 25:01.840
So it was there for two years.

25:01.840 --> 25:04.840
Which, so you kind of finished high school.

25:04.840 --> 25:05.840
Sorry.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.840
It's kind of interesting.

25:07.840 --> 25:08.840
You did it.

25:08.840 --> 25:09.840
You did it.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.840
I didn't want to use.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.840
Um, I mean, technically three.

25:13.840 --> 25:16.840
I was homeschooled for ninth grade.

25:16.840 --> 25:17.840
By who?

25:17.840 --> 25:18.840
And you were home school.

25:18.840 --> 25:19.840
My mother.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.840
And she just straight up was like, this is geometry.

25:21.840 --> 25:22.840
Here's US history.

25:22.840 --> 25:24.840
Here's whatever.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.840
Um, I took.

25:26.840 --> 25:27.840
Technically.

25:27.840 --> 25:44.840
Well, I took geometry as like a, um, like an online course in three months.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.840
Actually, I did that.

25:46.840 --> 25:51.840
And during the summer of eighth grade.

25:51.840 --> 25:54.840
Um, so that was a whole thing.

25:54.840 --> 25:58.840
But yeah, I did a lot of online courses for like individual subjects.

25:58.840 --> 26:06.840
And then I went to a nerd camp where I like took biology.

26:06.840 --> 26:07.840
Sorry.

26:07.840 --> 26:12.840
I was planning a needle lunch.

26:12.840 --> 26:14.840
Is needle the new um speed?

26:14.840 --> 26:15.840
It kind of is.

26:15.840 --> 26:16.840
I've only been there once.

26:16.840 --> 26:21.840
I've only been there once.

26:21.840 --> 26:27.840
We don't have the sacks points anymore.

26:27.840 --> 26:28.840
Remember that?

26:28.840 --> 26:29.840
The sacks?

26:29.840 --> 26:30.840
Yeah, I do.

26:30.840 --> 26:31.840
That was the shit.

26:31.840 --> 26:32.840
We should.

26:32.840 --> 26:33.840
We should.

26:33.840 --> 26:34.840
But you know, and you know who's fault it is.

26:34.840 --> 26:37.840
Grayson.

26:37.840 --> 26:40.840
Rachelle, would you say you're more or less confused about what this show is?

26:40.840 --> 26:43.840
Now that we're about half hour deep into an episode.

26:44.840 --> 26:46.840
I think I'm with the same amount of confused.

26:46.840 --> 26:47.840
Right.

26:47.840 --> 26:48.840
Well, but there's no clarity.

26:48.840 --> 26:49.840
There's no clarity.

26:49.840 --> 26:50.840
There's no failure.

26:50.840 --> 26:51.840
How can we?

26:51.840 --> 26:52.840
Yeah.

26:52.840 --> 26:53.840
Advertise with failure.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.840
And now we don't.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.840
Do you mean like take it up?

26:57.840 --> 26:58.840
Yeah.

26:58.840 --> 26:59.840
Can we help?

26:59.840 --> 27:00.840
Can I get a log line?

27:00.840 --> 27:01.840
Yeah.

27:01.840 --> 27:02.840
I mean, the log light is that it's kind of a mess.

27:02.840 --> 27:04.840
But organized chaos seemingly.

27:04.840 --> 27:09.840
But the log line that I came up with is it's 45 minutes of pop culture.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.840
Pop culture discussion.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.840
I mean, spirited games and quizzes.

27:14.840 --> 27:15.840
And gotcha journalist.

27:15.840 --> 27:16.840
Are the status.

27:16.840 --> 27:17.840
Part.

27:17.840 --> 27:20.840
When you read it on the website, there are going to be

27:20.840 --> 27:21.840
Stutters.

27:21.840 --> 27:22.840
Yeah.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.840
Let me tell you something about my email inbox.

27:24.840 --> 27:25.840
I.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.840
So I got spam bombed this week.

27:27.840 --> 27:28.840
Right.

27:28.840 --> 27:29.840
And yeah.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.840
And so what happened was.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.840
I get an email saying.

27:33.840 --> 27:37.840
Your new American Express gold card is in the mail.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.840
And it's being shipped to a zip code that I don't live in.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.840
And I'm like, OK, that's weird.

27:42.840 --> 27:43.840
I don't know.

27:43.840 --> 27:46.840
There's, maybe this is just like a fake email.

27:46.840 --> 27:51.840
And if I click on it and try and give them any of my information, then actually the fraud will happen.

27:51.840 --> 27:56.840
Around this email, though, I get like 800 spam emails.

27:56.840 --> 28:04.840
A lot that had signed to be up for every fucking service email list newsletter imaginable.

28:04.840 --> 28:08.840
And so I'm fucking having to click on subscribe, report spam for all of them.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.840
But I'm like, it eventually calmed down.

28:10.840 --> 28:11.840
This was on Friday afternoon.

28:11.840 --> 28:12.840
Monday morning rolls around.

28:12.840 --> 28:14.840
Your card is out for delivery.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.840
Another spam bomb.

28:16.840 --> 28:18.840
Monday afternoon.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.840
Your card has been delivered and activated.

28:20.840 --> 28:21.840
Holy shit.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.840
There's somebody with a card with,

28:23.840 --> 28:25.840
seemingly cart blanch access because, by the way,

28:25.840 --> 28:27.840
MX doesn't have a credit limit.

28:27.840 --> 28:28.840
Right.

28:28.840 --> 28:29.840
That's how you get in the real trouble.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.840
Um, but that's true.

28:31.840 --> 28:32.840
Really.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.840
MX doesn't have a credit limit.

28:34.840 --> 28:35.840
I'm almost positive.

28:35.840 --> 28:36.840
Yeah.

28:36.840 --> 28:37.840
For a gold card.

28:38.840 --> 28:42.840
Well, like, you can literally buy a half a thousand dollar card.

28:42.840 --> 28:45.840
I didn't think it had a credit limit.

28:45.840 --> 28:49.840
I had to call MX and report the fraud.

28:49.840 --> 28:50.840
They were very kind.

28:50.840 --> 28:51.840
They were very nice.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.840
They were Richard kind at a certain point.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.840
Because they were like,

28:55.840 --> 28:58.840
I'd like to tell you about your card.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.840
It's not a great Richard kind.

29:03.840 --> 29:06.840
Can you just be a little more Richard?

29:06.840 --> 29:11.840
I was in a little tinder to find dumbass.

29:11.840 --> 29:15.840
So I unsubscribed and reported spam for like over a thousand emails

29:15.840 --> 29:17.840
over the past week.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.840
And some of them are still trickling in, though.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.840
One of them being fluerly.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.840
Which is sort of like fairity,

29:25.840 --> 29:28.840
but I think it's period underwear.

29:28.840 --> 29:31.840
Why don't we advertise with them?

29:31.840 --> 29:33.840
Fluority.

29:33.840 --> 29:34.840
Fluority.

29:34.840 --> 29:35.840
Fluority.

29:35.840 --> 29:36.840
Fluority.

29:36.840 --> 29:37.840
Fluority.

29:37.840 --> 29:38.840
Fluority.

29:38.840 --> 29:39.840
Yeah.

29:39.840 --> 29:40.840
Yeah.

29:40.840 --> 29:41.840
So I was right.

29:41.840 --> 29:42.840
It is menstrual underwear.

29:42.840 --> 29:43.840
And I do think people can maybe use this.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.840
Wait, no, it's actually, no, it's the cup.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.840
But it looks like it's not even an English.

29:47.840 --> 29:49.840
Might not be an American company.

29:49.840 --> 29:53.840
Well, we have listeners across the globe.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.840
Here we go.

29:55.840 --> 29:59.840
Welcome to goder quote.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.840
Goder quote.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.840
Or quote.

30:03.840 --> 30:04.840
Okay.

30:04.840 --> 30:05.840
Did you guys, why are you seeing what?

30:05.840 --> 30:07.840
Well, you're like, you're put out by the whole episode.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.840
Keep going.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.840
Are you comfortable, Marika?

30:13.840 --> 30:19.840
Do you have enough soy?

30:19.840 --> 30:22.840
So you guys heard about this Ed Sheeran thing, right?

30:22.840 --> 30:23.840
No.

30:23.840 --> 30:24.840
What do you mean no?

30:24.840 --> 30:25.840
No, I don't follow Ed Sheeran.

30:25.840 --> 30:27.840
I don't either, but it was all over the news, right?

30:27.840 --> 30:30.840
It actually mattered not just for Ed, but actually for music in general.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.840
The future of it, et cetera.

30:32.840 --> 30:33.840
What happened?

30:33.840 --> 30:34.840
Am I boring you?

30:34.840 --> 30:38.840
No, just say what fucking happened.

30:38.840 --> 30:41.840
We all said we didn't know.

30:41.840 --> 30:42.840
Explain it.

30:42.840 --> 30:51.840
Ed Sheeran had been a part of a lawsuit for years about if he, from the state of Marvin Gaye,

30:51.840 --> 30:57.840
saying that he stole, let's get it on with his song, thinking out loud.

30:57.840 --> 30:58.840
I don't know.

30:58.840 --> 30:59.840
I don't know.

30:59.840 --> 31:00.840
I don't know.

31:00.840 --> 31:01.840
All right.

31:01.840 --> 31:02.840
You know what I'm thinking out loud.

31:02.840 --> 31:03.840
You know what I'm thinking out loud.

31:03.840 --> 31:04.840
Exactly.

31:04.840 --> 31:07.840
I know what you're thinking out loud.

31:07.840 --> 31:17.840
I don't want some people to actually, that's pretty good.

31:17.840 --> 31:24.840
I don't want some people to actually, that's pretty good.

31:24.840 --> 31:26.840
I love it.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.840
Every single way.

31:28.840 --> 31:31.840
Maybe I just tell you why I am.

31:31.840 --> 31:32.840
Think about it.

31:32.840 --> 31:33.840
Keep going.

31:33.840 --> 31:35.840
Thinking and loving heart.

31:35.840 --> 31:39.840
Has it not to the heart of a thousand stars.

31:39.840 --> 31:40.840
The ring of bells.

31:40.840 --> 31:41.840
So ringing about.

31:41.840 --> 31:43.840
Suit out in my car.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.840
The clock!

31:45.840 --> 31:47.840
The clock!

31:51.840 --> 31:53.840
Go to quote.

31:53.840 --> 31:54.840
I want to know your guys's opinions.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.840
We're going to play the songs back to back.

31:56.840 --> 31:58.840
And I want to know if you think

31:58.840 --> 32:01.840
Ed Sheeran plagiarized Marvin Gaye.

32:01.840 --> 32:02.840
Okay.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.840
The lawsuit did finish up with the jury saying he didn't.

32:05.840 --> 32:06.840
But I don't know.

32:06.840 --> 32:07.840
I want to hear you guys just thought.

32:07.840 --> 32:08.840
So this is the original.

32:08.840 --> 32:09.840
This is Marvin Gaye's.

32:09.840 --> 32:10.840
Let's get it on.

32:10.840 --> 32:31.840
So that's Marvin Gaye and this is Ed Sheeran.

32:31.840 --> 32:32.840
This is not.

32:32.840 --> 32:33.840
Sorry.

32:33.840 --> 32:35.840
That was the TikTok version.

32:35.840 --> 32:38.840
Here's the video that's just both of them back to back.

32:39.840 --> 32:42.840
Well, we're loving you.

32:42.840 --> 32:44.840
To a 70.

32:44.840 --> 32:46.840
Let's get it on.

32:48.840 --> 32:49.840
Yeah.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.840
Like not even close.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.840
They assume because of the tempo or something.

32:55.840 --> 32:56.840
Here's the thing.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.840
The chord progression is the exact same I think.

32:58.840 --> 33:00.840
But it also I think is up and active or something.

33:00.840 --> 33:01.840
And you.

33:01.840 --> 33:05.840
There are already been ruleings that you can't copyright a chord progression.

33:05.840 --> 33:07.840
There's only so many octaves.

33:07.840 --> 33:08.840
Yeah.

33:08.840 --> 33:09.840
Yeah.

33:09.840 --> 33:10.840
Yeah.

33:10.840 --> 33:12.840
I've heard songs sound a lot more similar than those things.

33:12.840 --> 33:13.840
Yeah.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.840
Appearance protection comes down to what's in the sheet music.

33:15.840 --> 33:16.840
Okay.

33:16.840 --> 33:19.840
What did you think of my version versus the edge?

33:19.840 --> 33:21.840
Like when you heard the edge Sheeran song or like, oh, no.

33:21.840 --> 33:22.840
I like there's better.

33:22.840 --> 33:23.840
Right.

33:23.840 --> 33:28.840
There's a character to your voice as in it sounded worse.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.840
But like in a charming way.

33:31.840 --> 33:32.840
Yeah.

33:32.840 --> 33:33.840
More attainable.

33:33.840 --> 33:34.840
Yeah.

33:34.840 --> 33:36.840
Are you looking at the menu again?

33:36.840 --> 33:37.840
Are you looking at the.

33:37.840 --> 33:38.840
Yeah.

33:38.840 --> 33:39.840
What do you guys want from Needle?

33:39.840 --> 33:40.840
Do you want the churring fun?

33:40.840 --> 33:41.840
Still what?

33:41.840 --> 33:43.840
The churring fun.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.840
Have you eaten that needle?

33:45.840 --> 33:46.840
No.

33:46.840 --> 33:47.840
It's good.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.840
I've been saying I should go there.

33:49.840 --> 33:50.840
Yeah.

33:50.840 --> 33:51.840
I went once.

33:51.840 --> 33:52.840
Have you guys had the salted yolk French toast?

33:52.840 --> 33:53.840
This looks like a heart attack.

33:53.840 --> 33:54.840
All right.

33:54.840 --> 33:55.840
Yeah.

33:55.840 --> 33:56.840
That one looks a little heavy.

33:56.840 --> 33:57.840
But it also probably tastes delicious.

33:57.840 --> 33:58.840
That's true.

33:58.840 --> 33:59.840
That's true.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.840
Good food.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.840
Is that the end of the song?

34:03.840 --> 34:04.840
That is me.

34:05.840 --> 34:06.840
Well, or go?

34:06.840 --> 34:07.840
Yeah.

34:07.840 --> 34:08.840
Oh, we're going.

34:08.840 --> 34:09.840
That.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.840
That title doesn't make any sense.

34:11.840 --> 34:12.840
Go.

34:12.840 --> 34:13.840
Whoa.

34:13.840 --> 34:19.840
Is it the greatest of all time or is it a quote of the greatest of all time?

34:19.840 --> 34:23.840
You only explain the situation with the.

34:23.840 --> 34:25.840
So you're saying you should vote on a video game.

34:25.840 --> 34:26.840
Play a game.

34:26.840 --> 34:27.840
It's a game.

34:27.840 --> 34:28.840
It's a game.

34:28.840 --> 34:29.840
It's a game.

34:29.840 --> 34:33.840
I'm so blessed of doing games on this show.

34:33.840 --> 34:35.840
It was less of a segment of more of an anecdote.

34:35.840 --> 34:36.840
We're going to.

34:36.840 --> 34:37.840
You guys don't.

34:37.840 --> 34:38.840
Yeah.

34:38.840 --> 34:39.840
Appreciate it when I put a ton of work.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.840
This is something I've noticed in outline in this shit.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.840
When I put a ton of effort into it, they don't go well.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.840
Oh, we got a Jeffrey.

34:46.840 --> 34:47.840
Jeffrey.

34:47.840 --> 34:48.840
He's pretty good.

34:48.840 --> 34:49.840
He's great.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.840
Yes, but you have to be sparing with Jeffrey.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.840
Jeffrey is like, Jeffrey, but it's all like wrong answers.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.840
Kind of fun, right?

34:56.840 --> 35:01.840
Would you say it's better than Jeff explaining a lawsuit and then telling us not to worry about it?

35:01.840 --> 35:02.840
I would have to play Jeffrey.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.840
To make that fall.

35:05.840 --> 35:07.840
Well, I don't have a Jeffrey prepared.

35:07.840 --> 35:12.840
I'm saving it for our potential tour, which, by the way, no word from Katie on that.

35:12.840 --> 35:14.840
Katie was like, I'm going to check the budget.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.840
No, she didn't.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.840
It's been a month since that happened.

35:18.840 --> 35:20.840
And a mirror brought it up the other day.

35:20.840 --> 35:21.840
And it all looked fair.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.840
I like the idea of doing a show on the woods.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.840
That's what I was saying.

35:27.840 --> 35:29.840
I said this on the livestream last night.

35:29.840 --> 35:31.840
Literally outdoors.

35:31.840 --> 35:32.840
West Coast tour.

35:32.840 --> 35:33.840
Right?

35:33.840 --> 35:34.840
We're going to do L.A.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.840
Big Sur San Francisco Portland.

35:36.840 --> 35:37.840
What?

35:37.840 --> 35:38.840
America.

35:38.840 --> 35:39.840
And then the news is called.

35:39.840 --> 35:40.840
Yes, buddy.

35:40.840 --> 35:43.840
And then the exactly right in this gets what it's a comedy show.

35:43.840 --> 35:44.840
So the for shell.

35:44.840 --> 35:45.840
This is the idea, right?

35:45.840 --> 35:48.840
It's called the episode would be called if a tree falls.

35:48.840 --> 35:55.840
And it would be a last minute secret show that we announced day of at the Henry Miller library stage.

35:55.840 --> 35:57.840
It's not secret anymore.

35:58.840 --> 35:59.840
Well, they're not going to win.

35:59.840 --> 36:00.840
It is.

36:00.840 --> 36:01.840
They're not going to know what it is.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.840
And you want some people there.

36:03.840 --> 36:04.840
Right?

36:04.840 --> 36:06.840
So we go ahead and we're like, okay, we're going to do a tour in August.

36:06.840 --> 36:07.840
Right?

36:07.840 --> 36:08.840
We're going to do a tour in September or something.

36:08.840 --> 36:12.840
The L.A. show is on August 17th.

36:12.840 --> 36:13.840
Right?

36:13.840 --> 36:16.840
And then our San Francisco show isn't until August 20th.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.840
People can infer that the fucking if a tree falls in episode is going to be somewhere

36:19.840 --> 36:20.840
between there.

36:20.840 --> 36:21.840
Right?

36:21.840 --> 36:23.840
And so some people, especially Barry and people,

36:23.840 --> 36:25.840
can't hang out at a library for days.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.840
Wow!

36:28.840 --> 36:34.840
I just think we should be running for a day and if I'm wrong for that, what's it?

36:34.840 --> 36:36.840
Keep going.

36:36.840 --> 36:38.840
You interrupted.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.840
And I'm not even talking to Casey.

36:40.840 --> 36:41.840
If I can Marieka.

36:41.840 --> 36:43.840
And a shit.

36:43.840 --> 36:45.840
Two dates.

36:45.840 --> 36:49.840
That's all I need to revamp this whole Shabaz.

36:49.840 --> 36:50.840
It has to be profitable.

36:50.840 --> 36:53.840
We can't just go to the middle of the woods and lose money.

36:53.840 --> 36:56.840
That's why Katie asked to check for the budget.

36:56.840 --> 36:57.840
Really?

36:57.840 --> 36:59.840
Because old cost is money.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.840
Well, what if the episode does so well online?

37:02.840 --> 37:06.840
Most of these episodes do the same regardless of who's on them or where they were recorded.

37:06.840 --> 37:11.840
So you can't say, oh, this episode will be exceptionally well-attended or whatever.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.840
And we also can sell ads.

37:13.840 --> 37:17.840
Yeah, knowing that there will be a bump in traffic for that particular episode.

37:17.840 --> 37:20.840
Well, the only way to balance it out would be ticket sales.

37:20.840 --> 37:21.840
Right.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.840
And you want to do it in the middle of fucking nowhere.

37:23.840 --> 37:24.840
So nobody will come.

37:24.840 --> 37:28.840
And you don't want to even tell people when it is.

37:28.840 --> 37:32.840
Well, if we do a live show from Carmo by the scene.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.840
That's the same area.

37:34.840 --> 37:35.840
Beautiful.

37:35.840 --> 37:36.840
That's the same area.

37:36.840 --> 37:37.840
We're going to lose money on that.

37:37.840 --> 37:40.840
Because any venue there is going to take like 20%.

37:40.840 --> 37:41.840
The Henry Miller Library.

37:41.840 --> 37:42.840
The Henry Miller Library.

37:42.840 --> 37:45.840
I already talked to them in person.

37:45.840 --> 37:46.840
I talked to the owner of the library.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.840
I was like, do you guys do shows here?

37:48.840 --> 37:49.840
They said, yes.

37:49.840 --> 37:52.840
So a podcast called The Edmund podcast could we do it here for free?

37:52.840 --> 37:55.840
He said, yes.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.840
As long as people buy books.

37:57.840 --> 38:02.840
It's a library where they're selling books.

38:02.840 --> 38:03.840
It's a cool library.

38:03.840 --> 38:04.840
I've been there.

38:04.840 --> 38:07.840
It's like, it's not like a library in the sense that you're thinking.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.840
It's more like.

38:09.840 --> 38:10.840
It's a book store.

38:10.840 --> 38:12.840
A book store in the woods.

38:12.840 --> 38:14.840
Two book minimum.

38:14.840 --> 38:17.840
I'll have you ever been to the Henry Miller Library.

38:17.840 --> 38:18.840
We're not making money.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.840
There's something in there.

38:21.840 --> 38:22.840
Should we do a podcast here?

38:22.840 --> 38:23.840
I think that'd be cool.

38:23.840 --> 38:24.840
Yeah.

38:24.840 --> 38:25.840
I have an idea.

38:25.840 --> 38:26.840
Oh.

38:26.840 --> 38:27.840
Good paper.

38:27.840 --> 38:28.840
No.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.840
I don't like the idea.

38:30.840 --> 38:33.840
Take me to here and talk to me.

38:33.840 --> 38:34.840
Yeah.

38:34.840 --> 38:35.840
What's the idea?

38:35.840 --> 38:36.840
It's okay.

38:36.840 --> 38:37.840
It's too late.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.840
It's too late now.

38:39.840 --> 38:40.840
Great.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.840
I want to play your little jingle.

38:42.840 --> 38:45.840
Little fucking TikTok sound.

38:45.840 --> 38:49.840
I'm sending an animosity and I want to know who the headgum rivals are.

38:49.840 --> 38:50.840
Oh, it's amazing.

38:50.840 --> 38:52.840
It's kind of everyone versus me.

38:52.840 --> 38:53.840
You're seeing him.

38:53.840 --> 38:54.840
You haven't said anything.

38:54.840 --> 38:56.840
It's towards each other.

38:56.840 --> 38:59.840
But it's also kind of you versus a mirror.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.840
Yeah.

39:02.840 --> 39:05.840
How long did that survival game take over text?

39:05.840 --> 39:06.840
Was it like a one night affair?

39:06.840 --> 39:07.840
Like a multi week battle.

39:07.840 --> 39:08.840
Multi week.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.840
And then do you plan to end in Donovan still lives in LA?

39:10.840 --> 39:12.840
The soccer player?

39:12.840 --> 39:13.840
Yeah.

39:13.840 --> 39:14.840
I don't know.

39:15.840 --> 39:16.840
Well, he played for the galaxy.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.840
So you could have inferred.

39:18.840 --> 39:21.840
But that galaxy doesn't really play in LA.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.840
Doesn't LA FC play like in LA proper.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.840
Bye.

39:26.840 --> 39:27.840
I can't get myself.

39:27.840 --> 39:31.840
So no flag.

39:31.840 --> 39:32.840
No flag.

39:32.840 --> 39:33.840
No.

39:33.840 --> 39:34.840
No.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.840
A hard out.

39:36.840 --> 39:41.840
Oh, my God.

39:44.840 --> 39:59.840
That was a hit-dum original.

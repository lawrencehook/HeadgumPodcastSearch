WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a headgum original.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
God

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Is it glitching out?

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
New York Shitty.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Yes, the big grapple.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Yeah, the big grapple.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
The Granny Smith.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
City that never yawns.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Yeah, John.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm in Philadelphia.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
No, I'm finally made it to God.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I was peeking for that entire thing.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm in New York City.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
It's too cold outside to be outside.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Because my Airbnb has a yard that I was going to record from.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Because the inside scalding hot.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
So that's interesting.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
So yeah, I guess you'll never be just right in the city that's always awake at night.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
What about opening the window?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Because it's a.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Uh, hot outside or hot inside cold out.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Well, the windows really small.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
And then it's also right by garbage.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
So I don't really want the smells of.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Composed.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Wafting in.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
And you have no control over the heat.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I looked around.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
I can't find a nest.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
I can't find an old school style one.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Is there there's got to be there's a radiator, right?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Or what?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
A radiator.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
You can a radiator.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Yeah.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah, but that would make it hotter.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah, but there's a valve on the radiator that you can just twist it to turn it off.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
I don't know this New York City nonsense, man.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
And LA, it's perfect always.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
You got to you see that radiator right there?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
That's a nice even heat.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
It's a nice even heat.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
There's a little bit of moisture in that because it's a steam heat.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I want to send heat.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
That won't get flagged.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Let's not go to Johnny per second.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Villa, what's new in the life and times slash what's new in the Villa Villa?

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Because you're in your place in New York.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Fucker.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
This is awful.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
This is not how I wanted to start my week.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
It is my recording.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah, we're recording a one last morning.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Thanks for giving me a video.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Yeah.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Not in a way.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
It really was Thanksgiving break.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Also.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah, the first thing I didn't want to see this morning was you shirtless,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
drinking cold bro.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Speaking ill at us.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
But what's happening in the life and times of Villa is nothing much.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
Last week during Thanksgiving break, I went to my hometown.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
And early in the home.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Yeah, we're going to New Jersey.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Hell yeah.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
No, it's all you ever talk about on this show.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
It's the best place in the whole world, man.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Really?

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Hell yeah.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
I thought you don't even like it that much.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Not really, but it's the best way.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
It's the best way.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah, it's the best way.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
It's the best way.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
It's the best way.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
It's the best way.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Too much we can handle.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
I can handle.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Yeah.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
But I went to a hometown bar.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Yeah.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Kind of expecting some things.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
One thing's giving.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
Kind of expecting to see all the people who just stayed in their hometown.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Just kind of feeling a little bit better about myself.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
But I walked in with a bad heart.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And I left like the grinch.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.460
with my heart growing 10 times that size and it was just nice to see everybody but I

03:51.460 --> 03:57.720
really was so nice and I wore my people like you knew or yes okay they're all like

03:57.720 --> 04:01.120
you were you were looking forward to like going over there gloting over them

04:01.120 --> 04:06.440
right I left this shit hole I live in New York shitty now but instead they were

04:06.440 --> 04:10.840
melting hot yeah they were they were like cool they were kind they were nice

04:10.840 --> 04:16.200
and you're yeah then you you left with your heart full. Uh-huh yeah I was

04:16.200 --> 04:21.800
absolutely a sour person. A sour person. What was the energy that you like

04:21.800 --> 04:27.520
went in there with like were you were you negative up front or were you like

04:27.520 --> 04:30.960
kind of like fake nice then they were real nice back and you were like well

04:30.960 --> 04:37.360
shit now I feel bad. I kind of walked in trying to be as a loophus possible. I don't think

04:37.360 --> 04:44.120
why go the ball. You're going to like be to agitate others and to be approached

04:44.120 --> 04:49.560
that's really sad. Yeah it was really sad which made me in turn kind of sad

04:49.560 --> 04:53.520
so I walked up to someone said hi and all of a sudden the tables had turned

04:53.520 --> 05:00.320
for my emotions. That was all it took. Yeah. I'm just saying hello. It's not really

05:00.320 --> 05:06.520
high Johnny. Oh my god. Everyone here is so fucking great real. Not like the city

05:06.520 --> 05:12.600
where I live. What were you like in high school, Johnny? I was a theater kid

05:12.600 --> 05:17.280
through and through but interestingly enough the theater kids at my high school

05:17.280 --> 05:22.360
some of them were like part of the popular crowd so I was kind of adjacent to

05:22.360 --> 05:29.560
that was really cool. Not really. I was near the popular theater kids. And they

05:29.560 --> 05:33.800
weren't even the most popular kids. They were just the popular of the theater kids.

05:33.800 --> 05:39.960
Hell yeah. What productions did you do in high school? And he's

05:39.960 --> 05:46.920
sometime we should say rest in power. Absolutely. The goal. He said has passed.

05:46.920 --> 05:54.120
It was sad. He was 91 though. He wasn't 91 but he went. He went to a two show

05:54.120 --> 06:01.840
a day on Wednesday. He saw two plays on Wednesday and then died on Friday. Isn't that crazy?

06:01.840 --> 06:08.120
That is crazy. The sadder one is Virgil Ablow. Rest in power.

06:08.120 --> 06:17.500
That is sad. I'm wondering the both three. I was definitely more affected by

06:17.500 --> 06:20.900
Virgil Ablow down. Yeah. It's sad to see somebody that is like absolutely

06:20.900 --> 06:27.020
peaking, crushing it, never regardless. Yeah. Also surprising. So yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry, Jeff

06:27.020 --> 06:33.420
or you said you wanted the third one to be Jake you said? Hmm. No, I said I wonder who

06:33.420 --> 06:37.980
the third one is and then I couldn't help but wonder what if it's Jake? Well, it

06:37.980 --> 06:43.260
couldn't be because I'm not at that. Like I wouldn't be. I wouldn't be in that

06:43.260 --> 06:47.300
company as like the third person to die. Nobody would be like man can you

06:47.300 --> 06:52.740
believe Sondheim Ablow and her wits in the same week. No, I thought that you

06:52.740 --> 06:58.180
didn't you interview for the LVMH job the Louis Vuitton? No, I wasn't even

06:58.180 --> 07:04.300
asked. I know it was even available. I don't think I would. Like been on their

07:04.300 --> 07:08.060
radar because I don't really know. Well, it wasn't like an open because it was like an

07:08.060 --> 07:14.740
indeed thing. No, it's more like I also I work it. I like founded this company.

07:14.740 --> 07:21.700
So I'd be weird if I was like looking for jobs on indeed ever. Anything.

07:25.700 --> 07:28.900
Can you imagine me applying for a job?

07:30.900 --> 07:37.940
In fashion. In fashion maybe. I would love to consult for like buck and buck

07:37.940 --> 07:43.140
Mason. I would I have ideas for future. It feels like up your alley. You kind of

07:43.140 --> 07:49.700
a fashion line in a way. Oh, yeah, actually I do. I did start another job. I make

07:49.700 --> 08:00.420
wallets and hats. Yeah. Jeff, what are you? Yeah. What are you distracted? I would. I was

08:00.420 --> 08:04.380
like my little baton. It was a little Johnny because you laughed right after you said

08:04.380 --> 08:10.140
that and that wasn't funny. Wait, what? I just got a little turned around. I didn't

08:10.140 --> 08:17.140
sleep very well last night because it was too hot. Yeah, that's part of it. I knew

08:17.140 --> 08:23.980
about the way. That I almost did. And then I thought that these were windows. I thought

08:23.980 --> 08:31.420
that these were windows, but it's actually just it's a Velcro curtain over what appears

08:31.420 --> 08:38.020
to be open wall. So it's like crawl space. What's the rest of the apartment like? Do

08:38.020 --> 08:44.820
you guys want to tour? Yeah. Yeah, might as well see if I can do this. So it's like a studio

08:44.820 --> 08:52.580
and a basement. It's cool. Okay. Well, that's it. Good. I'm only here for like four days. And

08:52.580 --> 08:56.860
then you're only there for four days. Yeah. And then I do a housing swap with my friend. There's

08:56.860 --> 09:07.180
a full bathroom. Oh, I see. So you're in a shitty Airbnb right now. In a way. It's it's

09:07.180 --> 09:13.140
not shitty. It's surprisingly cheap for having your own place. Yeah. It isn't a basement.

09:13.140 --> 09:19.020
And the ceilings are certainly low. Yeah. The shower. I've been ducking the shower. Yeah.

09:19.020 --> 09:24.220
That's on God. What's the address of this place? You'll actually be long gone by the

09:24.220 --> 09:27.460
time you leave. So you don't even have to believe it out. Well, no, because I don't want

09:27.460 --> 09:33.260
to duck like the building because this is the thing. It's like wherever I go, it becomes

09:33.260 --> 09:39.860
a kind of a celebrity spotting spot. Not really. Is that? Yeah. Yeah. I would agree. I would

09:39.860 --> 09:44.300
agree with everyone who said it wasn't. It sounded like you didn't hear Johnny or Marika,

09:44.300 --> 09:49.340
but they both said it didn't become a celebrity spotting. It's gone. Be left. All right.

09:49.340 --> 09:57.980
If it was going. What were the productions, Johnny? I'm curious too. I did rent. I did Tommy. That

09:58.060 --> 10:03.020
the who musical. It's great. Carousel. Those were the musical I think, but I'm good

10:03.020 --> 10:11.820
stuff. The year. Are you in carousel? In carousel? I was just part of the ensemble. What about

10:11.820 --> 10:21.500
what about rent? What about rent? What about rent? I wish Tommy's where I had my time to shine. I was

10:21.580 --> 10:29.820
up. Come on, dude. In a rough thing, man. No, like I was with Jake, like they come on, man. Yeah, man.

10:29.820 --> 10:39.660
Bye. I'm soul. Do you guys watch tick tick boom? Oh, yeah. That's why he was on the

10:39.660 --> 10:51.420
American musical. Did he write that one? He wrote. He is dead. He wrote a one man show

10:51.420 --> 10:57.580
called tick tick boom. Everyone was adapted into a three person musical by David Auburn.

10:59.100 --> 11:04.860
But like with the same songs he wrote. I didn't make sure. You know, I read like a whole

11:04.860 --> 11:10.860
bunch about Stevenson. I'm this weekend because I got a New York Times subscription. We can't

11:10.860 --> 11:18.380
subscription. Thanks. It's actually made me pretty cultured, pretty smart, and actually a little bit

11:18.380 --> 11:23.900
better than frankly, everyone on this call. I have the most good thing every day of the week.

11:25.100 --> 11:32.700
Really? Do you know how to read the crossword? I can't think you're out. Like I feel like I know

11:32.700 --> 11:38.700
not I would know the answers. I just don't know how to fucking do it. I did the crossword today.

11:39.420 --> 11:44.540
Really took me three minutes because I didn't know the word ZARF. Oh, you're talking about the

11:44.540 --> 11:49.580
fucking mobile crossword. The crossword game. No, you know what? I'm not going to take you to the

11:49.580 --> 11:55.660
reason. It's not today. You are. What did you learn? Oh, I just I mean, I thought it was fascinating

11:55.660 --> 12:03.260
how collaborative like theater is. There's just so many like adaptations from books and old shows,

12:03.260 --> 12:08.620
and there's just like so many people constantly like working together and making new shows from old

12:08.620 --> 12:13.420
ones and fixing things and doing things different. I kind of thought it was all just like

12:13.500 --> 12:20.060
you write like the movies, write an original thing, do it, and then that's it. So I thought it was

12:20.060 --> 12:27.500
fascinating. Yeah, it was cool. Did you watch TikTok? I thought you cared about Steven Sondheim.

12:27.500 --> 12:33.100
You said, rest in power, but then you don't want to talk about the rest. You're so

12:33.100 --> 12:40.380
you love Saturday and I it's the only song time. Yeah. Yeah. I think I used to listen to the Assassin

12:40.460 --> 12:49.180
soundtrack. Yeah. That was my great song to get one. Really different. I saw that on last Friday.

12:49.180 --> 12:53.980
No, the fright. Not this past Friday, but the one before the 19th. Wait, so again,

12:53.980 --> 12:59.900
so it came back. It's opening again. It's been re-others and off Broadway production of

12:59.900 --> 13:07.340
Assassins, right? Who's in it? Sorry. Steven past Squally, Judy Kuhn, Adam Chandler-Virat,

13:08.860 --> 13:19.340
Tavvy Gavenson. Oh, I love Tavvy. Yeah. I don't know she'd acted. Yeah, I think I've seen her in every

13:19.340 --> 13:26.300
big she's ever dot on stage except for one show, which is weird. But it was a it was a fine production

13:26.380 --> 13:30.700
Assassin's is the show I've seen of his the most I've seen three different productions.

13:32.220 --> 13:37.180
It's good. Wow. Did you see the OG one? The one with Duggy Houser in it?

13:39.260 --> 13:45.420
Wait, who is oh, you know Patrick Harris? That's right. I didn't see that one. No. That was the first one,

13:45.420 --> 13:52.140
right? No, there is a off Broadway production in 1990. Wow. That's the original one.

13:52.140 --> 14:00.540
With Victor Garber. Well, don't know shit in cyclopideos. This is the only thing in my brain.

14:01.260 --> 14:07.100
It's kind of shit. It's this kind of awesome. And people don't apparently don't want her talking

14:07.100 --> 14:13.660
about formula one. Really? Was it people who were like one person and then he could keep saying

14:13.660 --> 14:19.980
that everybody doesn't want it at all. I said it one time. You said it like three times. I swear to God.

14:20.300 --> 14:28.460
Do you see my Ferrari hit? Yeah. That's really cool. It's good at it. I'm trying to go to

14:28.460 --> 14:37.420
Le Mans next year. And I like, oh, we could go. I had to call a travel agency or like a company that

14:37.420 --> 14:43.980
does camping bookings. And I talked to this nice British man for 30 minutes. It was like,

14:43.980 --> 14:48.940
just going on and on. He was like, I've been going for 20 years. Like, we can help you do whatever you

14:48.940 --> 14:54.540
want. And I was like, OK, this is amazing. Does he do that for everybody? Who did you? This is like

14:54.540 --> 15:00.460
he was like, it's a family business. I run it with my wife. Oh my God. And we like pride ourselves in

15:01.420 --> 15:06.460
helping people. And he was also like no one has ever called from New York City wanting to go to

15:06.460 --> 15:11.820
Le Mans. I was like, that seems crazy. Wow. We, and so this is Florida. You're going to go

15:11.820 --> 15:18.060
by camping in France next summer. That's the plan. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. Watching Porsche's just

15:18.060 --> 15:24.460
whip around in the woods. Yeah. Watching fast gunner wrap his car around at Goddamn tree.

15:25.020 --> 15:30.620
Oh, shoot. Imagine me going to France and then watching Michael Fazbatter die.

15:32.380 --> 15:36.620
It would have to be your fault. You're the only person from New York that ever went to Le Mans.

15:36.620 --> 15:43.420
It's true. It's still one thing that's changed. Anyway, that's my plan. It's going to be great.

15:44.460 --> 15:48.860
I think the commenter that didn't want you to talk about racing was Jeff just judging by his face while

15:48.860 --> 15:55.420
you're chatting about it. So yeah. I'm really glad the conversation 10 minutes and he's shook.

15:58.140 --> 16:03.420
I missed all of that. Sorry. What? It's fine. Yeah. We can move on. Yeah. Okay.

16:04.220 --> 16:09.020
Uh, you said Le Mans. I heard that. What about Le Mans in this? So it's like you're having sex.

16:09.020 --> 16:15.340
I mean, let's see a dress if you have me and be. Nice. That's right around the corner for me.

16:15.340 --> 16:26.380
It's not too far from you. Yeah. Um, sorry. It's fine. Wow. Where's that ice coffee from?

16:27.660 --> 16:32.620
It's like a reguglio or something? What is it? It's across the street. Let me look at it.

16:32.700 --> 16:38.940
This smells for the way. Yeah. Ringo Levia. Ringo Levia.

16:39.980 --> 16:43.900
Something like that. Yeah. Ringo Levia. Something like that. I said it.

16:46.140 --> 16:52.540
I've even just four or five six. Four or five six. I'm a thanks. Oh, okay. It looks kind of cool.

16:52.540 --> 17:01.420
It's called four five six. Let me finish. Yeah. Where is it? It's on Richardson Street across the street.

17:03.580 --> 17:09.020
Then there's this bar called the Richardson. And it's description on Google is out of the way,

17:09.020 --> 17:17.580
bar offering specialty cocktails. That's not a selling point. It is, it shouldn't be that.

17:17.580 --> 17:22.940
Because it sounds like that was like written when, you know, prime Williamsburg was having its heyday.

17:22.940 --> 17:29.820
Yeah. Now when was that Richardson 2005? 2000. I guess. Yeah. 2000 probably 2000 like eight.

17:29.820 --> 17:37.500
Because now it's just like a mall. Yeah. Everything is on the way. Yeah. That's a busy little corner

17:37.500 --> 17:47.420
at there. Yeah. I love Greenpoint. Greenpoint is good. Yeah. I like that. I walked home. Well,

17:47.420 --> 17:55.100
yeah, I was walking in Greenpoint earlier today. You walked home. So you, what you've been suggesting this

17:55.260 --> 18:02.140
entire time. I'm tired. I didn't get a lot of sleep. And now you're saying I was walking home.

18:02.140 --> 18:07.980
Wow. You're, you're, you're fucking greenpoint. You're preoccupation with the Mon's pubis.

18:08.700 --> 18:13.820
You're, I'm, you're a few, I'm going to wear clothes right now. I, you're, you're a

18:13.820 --> 18:19.660
barrio. You're living in a basement on Richardson Street. Fucking, you're way across Brooklyn.

18:19.740 --> 18:29.580
I'm a lethargic. Oh, I can't have sex without being tired about it. Oh, what was I going to say?

18:29.580 --> 18:37.580
Oh, I went to Zelon in last night. Oh, yeah. It's pretty good. What is that? It's a, it's a vegan,

18:37.580 --> 18:47.180
or a vegetarian place right by vital. My climb is vital. My hands are cold. Did you go to vital?

18:47.180 --> 18:58.060
When did you get here? I got here three weeks ago. I didn't tell anybody. No, I got here yesterday at four.

18:58.940 --> 19:04.780
And nice. So all you did is go to Zelon and have sex and come home.

19:06.780 --> 19:11.900
Yeah, I wanted to see Johnny, but it didn't respond to my fucking emails.

19:12.860 --> 19:18.220
E-mails. Why are you ready again? You have a Sunday because it was Sunday. You're probably

19:18.220 --> 19:24.380
getting a ton of texts. No, Sunday is probably the least busy day of the week for everybody.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.260
Yeah, but definitely a day when you don't want to check your email.

19:29.260 --> 19:33.500
All right, scary. I guess I'm not a living New York. All right. Then I guess I don't, I haven't

19:33.500 --> 19:37.660
assimilated yet. Is that fine? Can I have a couple of weeks? Yeah. I mean, you definitely haven't

19:37.980 --> 19:46.380
your fucking coffee at Ringo Levio. That's an Italian place. They do pasta at dinner, man. That's like

19:46.380 --> 19:53.900
time. I also went to Sweet Leaf. Is that fine with you? Sure. I don't know what that is. Okay.

19:55.020 --> 20:01.260
She went, so you went, what is you drinking now? Did you get tea? No, this is hot coffee.

20:01.260 --> 20:06.700
You got a hot coffee and a cold brew. Yeah, you got to have a shambi.

20:08.620 --> 20:15.740
A little bit of both, but aren't he Paul me in a way? Hot cold room temp for both cops at a certain point.

20:15.740 --> 20:26.140
Yeah. Green or otherwise? Do you get another chat to you? Did you get another chat to you?

20:26.140 --> 20:34.380
What is this? Yeah, I got a it's a lemon. It's crazy. Is that a real chat to you? Yeah.

20:34.380 --> 20:44.700
Yeah. It's for my dead dog. He only ever played with lemons. You should say that that's so much to you.

20:44.700 --> 20:53.660
Piles dog. I can't even. Okay, then it's also for piles. Another scapegoat, by the way,

20:53.660 --> 21:00.380
for his failing marriage. First the house, then the dog, then the kid. It's like he's had lemon.

21:00.380 --> 21:06.540
Get to the root of the issues. Don't just keep like making yourself distracted. I'm sorry to say

21:06.540 --> 21:11.740
it's really not your place to be talking about someone else's marriage by the way. Wow.

21:12.700 --> 21:18.620
That's not that shouldn't be crazy to hear Johnny's been pretty quiet on this this podcast too.

21:18.620 --> 21:24.300
I feel like that really. Yeah, that's a fucking ringer. By the way, I hope that this energy

21:24.460 --> 21:29.980
doesn't carry over past the break because I don't want this episode marked by controversy.

21:36.620 --> 21:41.740

you something that helps millions, right? It's you, too. It's all you do. You should

26:20.540 --> 26:34.060
get on so much that brings people joy. I hate that one. Yeah, very good. Yes. Are you on

26:34.060 --> 26:48.540
field? I don't know. In crime. That's it. The follow-ups. There's no follow-ups at this point because

26:48.540 --> 26:54.700
if she doesn't, it doesn't even seem like she knows what it is. I don't. Can't even let his listeners

26:54.700 --> 27:00.060
understand what you're talking about. It's like an annual schedule of sex, three sums, and kink.

27:04.700 --> 27:12.300
And I wondered if you were maybe thriving on it. He's not mad. What man? I didn't say anything.

27:12.300 --> 27:17.580
What are you? What are you? I need an annual people at once. You're some like Johnny.

27:19.820 --> 27:25.500
I'm having a talk. I'm having a talk. Yeah. I'm having a talk. Yeah. I have to be the New York energy

27:25.500 --> 27:40.540
man. You just got here. I'm sorry man. I can't. It's infectious in the city.

27:41.500 --> 27:48.620
It never sleeps. I mean last night, it was, it was crazy the energy and green point. But the

27:48.620 --> 27:54.060
lights up for the holidays. Yeah, not it is really nice. You're in the basement. It's so funny

27:54.060 --> 28:01.180
to be like, there's really the energy. You're just in a fucking hot basement. You're saying the

28:01.180 --> 28:08.780
city you're in Brooklyn. You're really care about Manhattan, which is what that is all city. All right,

28:08.780 --> 28:13.340
no man, I love Manhattan. That's great. I was there in that street. Oh, it's you got it. Oh,

28:13.340 --> 28:19.180
what do you do? You got it. You just made it. I don't like the restaurant. Wow, it is.

28:19.180 --> 28:24.620
It's how it also is. I was walking around for me and in square it is so hot. Oh,

28:24.620 --> 28:28.460
what? How did you go? That's where I was. I was walking around so we should go to the

28:28.460 --> 28:35.580
two like one shot with the in the square square. Yeah, that's I love that. It's awful. I hate

28:36.060 --> 28:41.100
this one. Is it really bad? Is there a better one? Because I just want to do something Christmasy.

28:41.100 --> 28:45.740
It's just so crowded. I would do the Bryant Park Christmas one. That's like a little

28:45.740 --> 28:55.900
where the hell is this park? 42nd street between 40 seconds. Yeah, it's also got the ice skating

28:55.900 --> 29:01.420
if you want. What's that shit? The Broadway shit. And then I make a Broadway reference in my

29:01.500 --> 29:09.740
size. Yeah, I said nice. You just said 42nd street. The name of a musical with a song. That is

29:09.740 --> 29:18.220
also called 40 seconds shit. That's all you did. That was easy. Yeah. So Bryant Park you'd recommend.

29:18.220 --> 29:22.380
Because I just all I want. I'm sorry that I'm getting angry about it because it's just passion.

29:22.380 --> 29:29.100
All I want is to just have a hot chocolate from somewhere interesting. Spike it with my own

29:29.100 --> 29:33.420
peppermint schnapps and walk around it. Walt's around rather a Christmas market with bay.

29:35.260 --> 29:41.260
Yeah, do do Bryant Park. Watch people I skate. You could even walk up to the

29:41.820 --> 29:45.740
Rockefeller Christmas tree at that point if you wanted to. No, because that's bullshit because

29:45.740 --> 29:51.180
you're not like pairing the things makes them not too singular experiences. So I could have

29:51.180 --> 29:54.780
had two Christmas experiences and instead you're trying to get me to do them both in one night

29:54.780 --> 29:58.940
not come off like it's a grocery list. I'm not going to be from field wants to do this with you.

29:59.900 --> 30:05.340
For casual sex and three sums and you're going to say like come get a fucking hot coffee with

30:05.340 --> 30:13.580
me a hot chocolate hot pot. And go to the Christmas market. I know you were like very

30:13.580 --> 30:18.940
cute sex fetish thing. But yeah, we're the married couple. You'll roll play as the

30:18.940 --> 30:24.780
son wants a fucking candy cane. Mummy, mumsie and dad Z. Can I get a hot chocolate?

30:25.340 --> 30:30.620
Lord. It's easy to have fun if you know the avenues.

30:32.460 --> 30:39.580
What happened to you? Yeah, do you know? First, second, third. All of the numbered ones. C. D. E.

30:42.060 --> 30:46.300
The avenues. Yeah, I mean kind of. Yeah, I know.

30:47.260 --> 30:53.500
It's like, I don't know for seven you. Yeah, major killer. Don't be afraid to switch

30:53.500 --> 31:01.500
shit up spontaneously or not. I wouldn't have been here for wasn't for a couple conversations with

31:01.500 --> 31:10.300
Michael. Michael. You're going to give Michael the credit for having you come to New York.

31:10.300 --> 31:16.860
That was that was me man. It was both of you, but mostly Michael for saying his friend

31:16.860 --> 31:21.580
wanted to sublet for a couple of months. And I was like, you didn't even take him up on that.

31:21.580 --> 31:27.340
Yeah, because it was too late by the time I decided five days past suddenly it's not an option anymore.

31:27.340 --> 31:32.700
Right. So you missing out on that sublet option is what made you realize you wanted to.

31:33.660 --> 31:40.860
I, you always want we can't have. And once I couldn't have that sublet, I had to be here.

31:41.500 --> 31:49.260
Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Because I also offered you a place. I'm in love with the Boca.

31:49.980 --> 31:51.900
My next move is going to be the Boca Raton.

31:53.500 --> 31:59.500
Well, came first the song that you sang and then said that or would you actually want to move to Boca

31:59.500 --> 32:03.900
and then he sang the song? No, I just let's move on. Right. Full steam ahead.

32:04.540 --> 32:07.500
Of course. Let's take it into.

32:12.940 --> 32:16.940
Bond. Bad one. Let's get into it. Murdie, let's start.

32:17.660 --> 32:22.860
Alright. Mine is Bradley James, but only if Colin Morgan is his cue.

32:24.060 --> 32:28.860
The stars of Merlin, BBC, back together again. Do you mean, do you mean, M?

32:29.820 --> 32:37.420
No, I mean, cue. Okay. I have to just look at British actors really quick.

32:37.980 --> 32:40.300
They don't have to be British. You said they did.

32:41.020 --> 32:45.020
No, because Pierce Brosnan was Irish and actually Sean Connery was Scottish.

32:45.900 --> 32:49.100
So I guess it's like kind of from the UK area. Yeah.

32:50.140 --> 32:54.140
Okay. But we've also said like Richard kind. So yeah. And that's my favorite one.

32:54.140 --> 33:00.220
I've always suggested Bill Nye. I think. Yeah. Yeah, which was as American as it gets.

33:00.220 --> 33:04.620
Right. But what about Bill Nye spelled N-I-G-H-Y?

33:05.580 --> 33:11.580
Well, yeah, that's what's like the next Bond is. Oh, my, he. Yeah. What about Damian Lewis?

33:11.580 --> 33:17.820
It's time we had a redheaded Bond. I don't think Nye is. You can be a redhead and be a stone-cold killer.

33:18.620 --> 33:24.460
I'm sorry to say what about Eddie Redmayne or Eddie Red. No, Maine. Like the Maine.

33:26.460 --> 33:33.100
Not the actor. Just a different guy named Eddie. My friend Ed has red hair. Yeah. He has Ed hair.

33:33.100 --> 33:40.060
Yeah, he Ed has Ed hair. That's true. Let's let's do this. Let's make the next Bond Taylor

33:40.140 --> 33:47.100
Lotner. And I like that now. No, because you're me out because get me. He's dated multiple

33:47.100 --> 33:53.820
tailors. Right. So he's kind of a ladies man of which James is as well. If that was you

33:53.820 --> 33:58.460
actors in Hollywood would have like dated multiple. Yeah. Partners. And okay.

33:58.860 --> 34:03.020
You could check the box of being a ladies man or being considered that. And if that was the only

34:03.020 --> 34:08.540
reason I would say forget it, but there's another reason he was shark boy. Right. So

34:10.460 --> 34:17.660
there's already a built-in audience for Taylor Lotner in terms of once he's the last thing he worked on.

34:18.380 --> 34:23.260
He did some CW show or something that nobody gave a shit about. That's the other thing. He's been

34:23.260 --> 34:29.180
away for a while. And so to come back. Right. So no one gave a shit. No one gave a shit about him. Andy

34:29.180 --> 34:35.340
has a built-in audience. Which one is it? By the way, Bond has the built-in audience. They have the

34:35.340 --> 34:43.740
global franchise. They don't need anyone to bring someone to bond. Do you think Bond is looking

34:43.740 --> 34:50.380
for a fucking influencer? And it wouldn't be Taylor Lotner. No, it would be long. He's on Kuku,

34:50.380 --> 34:55.980
which is a British TV show. Oh, there we go. So he's working with the Brits. He might have a flat.

34:55.980 --> 35:01.260
Which is a way because I don't know if MGM can put someone up for the whole entire time.

35:02.220 --> 35:07.340
Oh, and it'd be like for a couple of weeks. Yeah, he might have to work as a local as they say.

35:07.340 --> 35:12.540
And that's kind of where you cover your own. But I'll see Bond's traveling. Right. So

35:12.540 --> 35:17.580
probably on location. Yeah. That's true. There's going to be a lot of travel involved. I bet he'd

35:17.580 --> 35:23.180
have to book his own travel. So yeah, Lotner is comfortable using kayak or whatever to book his own

35:23.180 --> 35:29.260
travel. Then maybe he would get the part. My thinking is thus is that he was shark boy. And he kind of

35:29.260 --> 35:37.180
fucking crushed to the shark boy. Sure. He was a child, but yeah. Oh, there's has to be a nod.

35:37.180 --> 35:43.980
There has to be a nod to shark boy in Bond. So it's 007, but maybe like the next watch has like a shark on it.

35:47.260 --> 35:52.140
Do you just want them to reference shark boy in Lafegrell somehow? You don't need Taylor

35:52.220 --> 36:01.260
Lotner to do that. Yeah, you play the reaction you wanted. You wanted polite laughter. Johnny who's

36:01.260 --> 36:08.140
your Bond of the absolute god damn week? He's on a high streak right now. He's playing Mario

36:08.140 --> 36:14.700
and he's also playing Garfield. No way. Let's get Chris Pratt on the on the horn. God. That's

36:14.700 --> 36:20.780
horrible. I'm a horn. So you haven't even offered it to him yet. No, not yet, but we got to ask him at least.

36:23.180 --> 36:31.980
A Kevin Porter casting decision in the making. Yeah, we should get Kevin Porter to just do this one

36:31.980 --> 36:41.420
part of the show every week. I hate that. I hate that choice because he's not even swath.

36:41.660 --> 36:47.820
He's not, but I think he could bring a new energy to the James Bond franchise. Let's see my

36:47.820 --> 36:53.820
essence on our cheeks. I feel like it's conservative. Yeah, this guy's super conservative. I

36:53.820 --> 36:57.580
think he'd say some snappy one liners like there's an explosion happening behind him. He's like,

36:57.580 --> 37:02.220
wow, that was an explosion. So you want snappy one liners. You're not going to go Ryan Reynolds?

37:03.500 --> 37:09.180
Absolutely not. Because I need a conservative man. Why? American values to the big screen.

37:09.740 --> 37:14.460
They already have every fucking Clint Eastwood movie is exactly what you're saying.

37:16.140 --> 37:23.180
Why don't we get Clint Eastwood on the horn, too? He's not the M. I hope Clint East, I'm sorry to say

37:23.180 --> 37:30.700
I hope Clint Eastwood's the third in this celebrity triad of deaths. Wow, pretty his first. Yeah,

37:30.700 --> 37:38.540
he's a major killer. Put yourself out there on a limb or the plank. So basically say controversial

37:38.620 --> 37:43.420
shit for the sake of contrarianism. That's bad advice. Terrible. Controversy.

37:46.540 --> 37:52.780
Actually, what I do with radiator. I wanted to get a conversation going. I don't even pronounce it like that.

37:52.780 --> 38:00.060
I'm a man. That's radiator. Good. It's really nice. See Jake, what you said, like when you said

38:00.060 --> 38:05.340
radiator, that was like very lighthearted and fun. And that's a nice way to start conversation.

38:05.340 --> 38:10.940
But what Jeff was doing was, uh, stirring the pot in a really bad way. Jeff. We're seeing you

38:10.940 --> 38:15.820
probably pay attention. Someone. Yeah, you probably pay attention, Jeff. Yeah. That was like a conversation

38:15.820 --> 38:20.220
about you. You're basically chastizing what you did. And you looked at your phone

38:21.180 --> 38:26.860
during it. And that's such an easy thing to do to hold your phone below the zoom. But it's like you

38:26.860 --> 38:33.020
raised it into the frame. Almost as a fuck you to Villa. Yeah. Look at your pop socket.

38:33.980 --> 38:37.740
It's just a sticker. Oh, it's weird. That's not grateful, Dad. Is that grateful that

38:37.740 --> 38:42.380
there's a John Mayer? Is it both? They're kind of one in the same. It's grateful that I wouldn't

38:42.380 --> 38:49.180
say they're one in the same. Doesn't Jamega go on tour with the dead and company. Yeah. Is any

38:49.180 --> 38:55.020
part of the company? He's part of the company. Not part of me. So when the same is not because

38:55.020 --> 39:05.900
don't know what the fuck you're talking about. We'll talk about week plans. And I don't mean

39:05.900 --> 39:13.180
plans for this week. I mean W. E. A. K. Right. So what are some tentative shit that you guys want to

39:13.180 --> 39:18.940
do this week? Oh, I love that actually. Yeah. That's great energy. On Thursday, I'm looking at

39:18.940 --> 39:22.940
actually what I want to talk to you about this. I want to go on a on a big long bike ride on

39:22.940 --> 39:26.700
Thursday. But I'm looking at the weather and it's going to be kind of cold in the morning. So I'm

39:26.700 --> 39:37.260
already thinking about bailing the night before. If you're interested, you should try to get your hands

39:37.260 --> 39:42.300
on a bike. I actually was going to try and get one for sheep on Craigslist because I'm trying to be

39:42.300 --> 39:49.180
active as shit this winter. Do you want my bike that probably needs to be a little bit fixed?

39:49.180 --> 39:56.300
But I don't use anymore. Yeah. Wait, your room room bike? No, my eye. All the regular. Yeah. Oh,

39:56.300 --> 40:03.900
perfect. Yeah. Jeff. Take it. At the very least, it needs the tires blown up. At worst, maybe

40:03.900 --> 40:10.620
it needs some new brakes. But I'll drive you to pick up Jeff. And we can pick it up, bring it to my

40:10.620 --> 40:15.020
bike shop. They'll get it to tune up and we'll whip around the city on Thursday unless it's too

40:15.020 --> 40:22.380
cold and I might have to reschedule. Okay. I also wanted to ask you actually, um, in January,

40:22.380 --> 40:28.540
I wanted to go up state for a weekend. Can I rent your car for the weekend? Rent my car.

40:28.540 --> 40:33.500
Yeah. Just borrow my car. I mean, I wanted to toss you a couple of bucks because Lord knows

40:33.500 --> 40:39.420
it could use it. Yeah, depending on the weekend, you can borrow the car renovation, you know,

40:39.420 --> 40:43.900
get our renovation on the townhouse. So like strap for cash and honestly strapped with that

40:43.980 --> 40:48.620
cat. What do you mean? You are a cat. I don't understand what we should say.

40:50.620 --> 41:02.860
Me and Chris Pratt. Yeah. I have a concealed carry permit that I use. Uh, my week plan. Yeah,

41:02.860 --> 41:10.140
let's do this. So I'm just looking at bikes. After I've off radio. Yeah. But sure. Yeah.

41:10.860 --> 41:17.420
Uh, one of my friends from college is coming into the city on Wednesday. But can't get dinner

41:17.420 --> 41:23.900
can only like do something before. So I think I'm going to go to the Bryant Park market and then maybe

41:23.900 --> 41:28.780
try and see a play afterwards because I'm in the area. But I don't know what play yet. I gotta decide.

41:28.780 --> 41:32.860
Can we last a minute? Hmm. Are you trying to decide because you've seen them all? Or like,

41:32.860 --> 41:39.820
are there ones that you haven't seen? It's a bit of both. Uh, I think the healthy dose is both.

41:39.900 --> 41:45.180
I think there's like maybe one or two that I haven't seen yet. Cool. Yeah.

41:46.220 --> 41:52.860
Johnny week plans. Uh, here's a really, really weak plan. I don't know if I'm going to go

41:52.860 --> 41:59.660
back home on Thursday night or Friday morning because my mom invited me to watch earthwind and fire

41:59.660 --> 42:06.380
with her at a, at Atlantic city. So you can't get enough of Atlantic city, man. You can't get enough

42:06.380 --> 42:11.020
of a fucking going home. Now you just, you have a taste for it. Yeah. I love it. You want to go back

42:11.020 --> 42:15.500
on Thursday for the show. When's the show Friday or Saturday? Friday's there for Thanksgiving.

42:15.500 --> 42:19.740
Okay. So you want to go there Thursday so you can go out to that bar. Your hometown bar.

42:19.740 --> 42:22.860
Thursday Thursday and Berlin. It's not going to be the same because no one's home.

42:22.860 --> 42:27.020
Right. Thanks. Well, I can bring that energy. I can bring that positive energy back.

42:27.020 --> 42:27.820
Not really.

42:28.300 --> 42:39.980
I guess maybe, but I feel like I can. I feel like I'm that that's sociable. Yeah. Even though you

42:39.980 --> 42:47.820
describe yourself as the Grinch when you went in their last talk. Yeah. Everybody knows this,

42:47.820 --> 42:52.300
the follow-ups to the Grinch you became a popular guy. Everyone fucking loved him.

42:52.300 --> 42:58.940
Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? There was an eyelash on my fucking laptop,

42:58.940 --> 43:03.820
and not Billy. Not the good kind. It was my hair. Let's talk about

43:03.900 --> 43:17.980
Amazing. Grace. A sweepstakes. I entered 6,000 times into an omelette sweepstakes

43:17.980 --> 43:27.180
to win a month in Tarzanna. This is not a joke. To an omelette? I am not a crook.

43:27.260 --> 43:39.820
Oh, we're having a ton of fun today. What are you doing? What are you saying? You sing song

43:39.820 --> 43:45.340
and you're just like, you're in a raffle to win a month in Tarzanna. Then you said I'm not kidding.

43:45.340 --> 43:53.020
Then Rick has asked you several times what you're talking about. And then he blew up. And then he blew up.

43:53.420 --> 44:00.620
What is a month? Yeah, I'm trying to find what he's talking about. You say nonsense.

44:00.620 --> 44:08.940
We asked you to clarify. And I got the omelette part which is sad. It's a month, Olamansha.

44:10.940 --> 44:18.620
Imagine you entered a raffle to win a house in Tarzanna. It's one of those like

44:18.620 --> 44:23.900
Cape Cod spec homes. It's like if it was in any other town would be amazing. But in L.A.

44:23.900 --> 44:27.340
where there's so much amazing real architecture. It's like, that's not really the kind of house you

44:27.340 --> 44:34.780
want to get. But you still entered the raffle. Well, yeah. It's like like 500 bucks for 6,000 entries.

44:35.660 --> 44:41.100
I have a hundred dollars. You paid cash. It's for charity. I'm going to win because no one

44:41.100 --> 44:45.260
else is putting that many entries. And I'm sorry to say, but I'm going to have a house.

44:49.580 --> 44:53.580
And please, please, you say you were the elephant.

44:53.580 --> 45:00.700
From a basement. Underneath the BQE. Please, nobody else. If you're hearing this enter this

45:00.700 --> 45:07.180
sweepstakes because I need there to be less entrance. So in fact, if you're listening to this

45:07.180 --> 45:12.860
and you have entered, email the email the provider and rescind your entrance. Yeah, I think

45:13.100 --> 45:19.580
there's two ways that oh, May's not sweepstakes. Can anyone enter as you? Did the eyelash

45:19.580 --> 45:24.060
from your computer go into your mouth when you blew it? My own hair wasn't my mouth. Got it.

45:25.820 --> 45:30.380
4.3 million dollars. So the idea is to get the house, maybe throw a party in it. It has a

45:30.380 --> 45:36.140
movie theater. Maybe do a screening of like something awesome. And then liquidate the bush. So basically

45:36.220 --> 45:44.700
make that cash. And then by in cash, a house in a better area for less. So that I'm suddenly

45:44.700 --> 45:53.740
I don't even have fucking housing costs. Does that make sense? Plugs. What do you think?

45:53.740 --> 45:58.060
What do you guys say? No, we didn't even make it to the waxing portion.

45:58.060 --> 46:07.900
This is the worst. It was February. You're a long way to go, bud. Yeah, but if you end well,

46:07.900 --> 46:12.780
I'm working against my own interest here because if you enter before, no, I'm going to say it

46:12.780 --> 46:15.340
because I don't want at least to want to win a bunch of money.

46:22.140 --> 46:26.540
Does this really go to charity? Yeah, I don't think it actually will go to charity. If

46:26.540 --> 46:33.100
you enter a raffle to win a free house, they give the money they made to charity. It feels like

46:33.100 --> 46:42.220
that would go towards covering the cost of the house. You should have played that after you

46:42.220 --> 46:46.940
fucking said all the stuff about how you were going to liquidate the house. Yeah, and live rent free.

46:49.180 --> 46:54.940
I thought what I said was interesting. I'm sorry if it wasn't. It's okay. I mean, I hope you

46:54.940 --> 46:59.980
won a house. That'd be cool. Yeah, you guys would have a free place to stay. Any time you come to

46:59.980 --> 47:06.780
fucking LA. What is oh, maze? It's just a place where you speak. It's just a sweepstakes. It's a

47:06.780 --> 47:10.300
fucking website. Yeah. It's just a sweepstakes. It's a fucking website. Yeah. It's just right now. It's

47:10.300 --> 47:17.580
going to tell you what is so sad. It was 24 doughnuts. That was not what it meant today. Also,

47:17.580 --> 47:22.380
my friend is friends with this guy. I could get you a date with him. Oh, thank you. Let's do that.

47:22.940 --> 47:33.500
Let's do that. Let's do that. Rather than me paying $500. And then today, today alone, 7200 people

47:33.500 --> 47:41.740
have donated for this house. Yeah. This is so fucking stupid. This is awful. You shouldn't have

47:41.740 --> 47:47.180
donated. I'm sorry. Oh, do you want to hear what the description is for this house? It's so stupid.

47:47.260 --> 47:54.460
Yeah. As the classic quote says, go west, young dreamer, and land an LA pad with a poolhouse

47:54.460 --> 48:00.540
or something to that effect. In any case, winning this five-bed six-bath thoroughly thrilling

48:00.540 --> 48:06.780
property, even the court-site counters will make your heart race, is the modern equivalent of striking

48:06.780 --> 48:12.300
gold. And because this is Los Angeles, the epicenter of entertainment, you'll land an entertained

48:12.300 --> 48:17.980
reverse haven with an open concept kitchen and living room that leads you to an equally enticing

48:17.980 --> 48:24.860
backyard. Pool, hot tub, sports court, pudding green. Your fantasy features are all here.

48:24.860 --> 48:30.780
Back inside, main bedroom suite with its fireplace walking, closet, soaking tub and oversized

48:30.780 --> 48:38.620
showers and enough to make you actually scream, Yureka. This is Johnny Roses. I'm sorry. I absolutely wrote

48:39.100 --> 48:45.100
this. I hope you enjoyed it. I, you know what, it's probably in, it's probably in in Sino.

48:47.340 --> 48:50.140
Is that a deal breaker for you? Because you just paid five hundred dollars.

48:50.860 --> 48:54.540
Yeah, you didn't find any of this stuff out before. You guys are going to be late. I'll be the

48:54.540 --> 48:58.620
one. I'll have the last laugh when I paid five hundred dollars for a four point three million dollar

48:58.620 --> 49:03.900
months. I'm sorry. And you guys would be saying Yureka, like a couple of like a loser. And you know what,

49:03.900 --> 49:08.540
we'll, we'll watch in the movie room. We'll watch Le Mans at the months. Nice. Yeah, thanks.

49:09.100 --> 49:11.500
Pleasure to meet you, Marie. Well, they're nice. It's been a cool.

49:14.540 --> 49:16.620
This is just in Jeff has good luck.

49:19.580 --> 49:23.820
Not really if you bought five hundred dollars. Was it news entry ticket?

49:24.940 --> 49:29.740
Fucking plugs. All right. 46 minutes into this nonsense. Let's get it over with. Marie,

49:29.820 --> 49:37.180
what are you going on? I got nothing going on. But listen to exo exo gossip kings.

49:37.180 --> 49:42.140
It's really funny. New podcast with Carl Tart in the Marwoods or watching gossip girl.

49:44.220 --> 49:51.660
Listen to history of heat or a new podcast presented by stock ex. Two episodes out. It's a six

49:51.660 --> 50:01.420
episode series. Yeah, follow me on Twitter and Instagram and letterboxed at Marie Kayle on.

50:03.580 --> 50:08.940
I love the name of your travel agent. Let's, let's shout that person out because I need to

50:08.940 --> 50:13.980
even. Okay. Actually, I'm going to, I'm going to give Steven a call. Yeah, he should. Yeah,

50:13.980 --> 50:17.100
come to France. That's going to be great. I kind of want to.

50:18.060 --> 50:23.820
Yeah, I'm going to go glam thing. And then ideally, the plan is to fly from France to Montreal

50:23.820 --> 50:29.980
and go to the Grand Prix. So weekend back. I was going to say, okay, cool. I still want to go to

50:29.980 --> 50:34.940
Monaco. That's, that's the Grand Prix that I want to grand sea. But actually, there's not

50:34.940 --> 50:40.220
a lot of overtaking in Monaco. So maybe not a lot of overtaking. Maybe I don't want to see that.

50:40.220 --> 50:47.020
Maybe I'll go to Azerbaijan. I think the Monaco would be fun if we were rich and cool.

50:47.580 --> 50:52.380
Yeah. So that's what we have to strive for. Let's plug, if you are going to go to Monaco and

50:52.380 --> 50:57.660
you have a boat that we can watch from. No, it's up. Nobody's going to. Because I want to,

50:57.660 --> 51:03.580
if they listen, I should be one rich person that listens to this or somebody that has rich parents

51:03.580 --> 51:14.060
or somebody that has parents that are Carlos signs is dad. Yeah. So then that's my point. We're

51:14.140 --> 51:19.100
trying to get into the Ferrari paddock for sure. What the hell is a paddock?

51:20.460 --> 51:25.820
It's where you hang out when you're close with La Clare. It's where you hang out when you're

51:25.820 --> 51:31.340
boys with signs. And it's where we would talk about plans for the day and plans for the evening

51:31.340 --> 51:37.340
celebrating their inevitable fifth and sixth place finishes. Yeah. So we're telling our old

51:37.820 --> 51:54.140
signs. Yeah. Maybe sick. Johnny. Yeah. This is a verbal plea to act

51:54.140 --> 52:01.980
build a bear on Twitter to unblock me. Why do you say they didn't like getting DM saying you're playing

52:01.980 --> 52:09.420
God? Something like that. It's insane that they even read that. What do you do with your free time?

52:10.380 --> 52:19.020
This, I'm terminally online. Yeah, permanently online. I mean, same, just in a different way.

52:21.180 --> 52:30.700
But yeah, follow me on Instagram at Johnny V, JOH and NYVI and yeah, that's my plug.

52:32.780 --> 52:40.620
Jeffrey. Jake. Have a new place. Yeah, I, I genuinely just want to go to Monaco. So if you have a

boat at me on Twitter, Instagram or you know, find a way to contact me. That should be on you.

52:48.060 --> 52:53.020
I feel like you have enough money to get a small boat. Get a small boat. No,

52:53.020 --> 52:59.020
I ain't fucking Monaco. Two days. That's probably like $4,000. That's a lot of money. But you

52:59.020 --> 53:07.180
have that at $4,000. Yeah, I mean, I, I had Jeffrey James on Instagram at Jeff. Boy,

53:07.180 --> 53:13.340

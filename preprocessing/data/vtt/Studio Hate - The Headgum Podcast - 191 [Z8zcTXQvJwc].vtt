00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
We're a step-to-side ever.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
To where we to call.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Can you see the camera?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
No, I can see you.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
You're not going to able to see me at a step-to-side.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
I happen in the last three times, I've been on.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Andrew Pile fucked up this episode already.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
He's not even here, that's a great question.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Right?

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
It's that he reset the Wi-Fi network, because the Wi-Fi is down.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Well, I don't want to put it all on Pile.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
You don't actually, he's got his own paternity leave.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
So he won't.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
I don't even think he'll listen to this.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
So yeah, let's put it all on Pile.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Yeah.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
And he's not going to be here for a while.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Because, by the way, you get double paternity if you have the twins.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Is that double-type?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Sorry.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Is that true?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
I don't think it's true.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Don't ask me.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Yeah, I don't think that's true.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
He has to do.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
So we both look to you, like, oh, like Casey must know.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
It's been like a per child.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Right.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
How many kids do you get?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Quadruple.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Really.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
It's exponential.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
And experiential.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Yes.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
And how long is it end?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
It's paternity leave.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I think it's three months.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
So he gets a year.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
That's amazing.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
A year without Pile, I actually do think the company would fall off the rails.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
A year without Pile.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm a year without style.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I'm a year without Pile.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
That sounds like a Casey script.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
What?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
A year without Pile.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
It's a utopian society movie.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
He won't stop bringing up his movie.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
He won't.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Keep stopping.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
It's Hollywood narcissism getting the Casey.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
I mean, I don't know what else to say.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
It's like, I know my resolution to him was to go Hollywood.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
But I feel like you've gone so Hollywood.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
You've bordered into Hollywood Regency, which is a little bit ghost.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Can we start?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Yes.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
We've started.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Oh, did you play the theme song?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Yeah.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
I heard it.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Okay.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Or is that?

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
So we can't see Brad and he can't hear the noise.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Now he can.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
There it is.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Yeah.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Perfect timing.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
We go straight into this.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Don't laugh.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
We have to get through every time.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Elton John.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Donald Glover.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Yannick Sinner.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Connor Bidard.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
That's not a real person.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
No way.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
I know black.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
That's what I'm going to say.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
That's what I'm going to say.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
No one draft it.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
No one draft it.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
No one rafter.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Exactly.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
His name will be in the right.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
The rafters.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Number one.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Number one.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
He plays Bond.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Are you guys still tired?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
I was tired.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Is number for that.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Other than hockey.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Can you guys.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Or other than Brad.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
I should say.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Can you guys name 10 hockey players.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Richard Zednik.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I said other than you.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Boy tech.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Volski.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Of a Colorado.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Will have.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Redski.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Sydney.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
That's too.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Fascinating.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
That's a great.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
That's for.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Mark Messier.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Mark Messier.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
He's a good guy.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Yeah.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Brad.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
We're not including you.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
You obviously know a lot about hockey.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Dave Mc'Rick Wong.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Number 30.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
He's like, Trevor Wattier.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Trevor Wattier.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Yeah.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
He plays for Leaves.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Andy Bauer.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Leaves.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
It's the leaf.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Casey Sariah.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
He's got a chime in here.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
It's not the leaves.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Yes.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
I made up Trevor.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Yeah.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Beacon.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
I think that's that's what I thought about, got it.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
I think that's what he's like.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Roger.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
That's a lot of experience.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
That's a serious part.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Actually.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
What?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
That's a Cleveland guardian.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
What is it the fact that I'm behind the desk that you guys.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.500
the desk that you guys don't listen to me. Yeah, I just can't hear you. Is there a

03:44.500 --> 03:49.960
Ohio hockey team that you follow? Yeah, Columbus Blue Jackets Rick Nash number 61

03:49.960 --> 03:57.080
Rick Nash the wrestlers. That's where it's Kevin Nash and it's

03:57.080 --> 04:04.520
clear. My dog is Nelson John. We know. Be got a bomb. He's going to be the first

04:04.520 --> 04:10.640
he's going to be got. Yeah, bomb and be Grammy Oscar Tony. I think really good,

04:10.640 --> 04:14.880
which is also I think a good name for another character in the bond

04:14.880 --> 04:21.320
universe. Be got. That's like a charming Grammy Oscar Tony. Okay. Well, I think

04:21.320 --> 04:29.420
Be got is could be a good nickname for a guy. A guy named Bob and the Oscar

04:29.420 --> 04:36.280
and the Oscar Tony. It does kind of actually sound like it does actually sound

04:36.280 --> 04:40.920
like a character that would have been in the performance. You think that's Italian

04:40.920 --> 04:47.080
sounding Be got Tony? Oh my god. Last name Tony that's a mafia name. Yeah, I'm not

04:47.080 --> 04:52.400
going to have this kind of and I still keep thinking that the door is open. It's not

04:52.400 --> 04:57.800
because they took the film off the bush, right? And in my peripheral, which by the way,

04:57.800 --> 05:01.520
the vision's coming back. Oh, that's nice. The headaches are ensuing God, because I hit

05:01.520 --> 05:05.160
my head again. Yeah, I want to get into something that I'm here said, but right before

05:05.160 --> 05:11.360
this. And Brad, I'm not sure if you heard you said imagine if this because we had a

05:11.360 --> 05:13.680
lot of tech issues, which I think we should spend the first 30 minutes of the show

05:13.680 --> 05:18.480
talking about. Okay. I haven't said every time. We don't need a lot of time.

05:18.480 --> 05:22.920
At Mr. Griver, happening right now, raining, I can see the rain right now, falling

05:22.920 --> 05:28.240
off the awning, right? Yeah. So the Wi-Fi is down. It isn't there there. That should

05:28.240 --> 05:32.600
be fine though, because the ethernet was connected. Guess what pile did? What? Disconnected

05:32.600 --> 05:37.520
the entire Wi-Fi from afar, from a fraternity leave. I'm like, we were doing fine

05:37.520 --> 05:42.800
without pile. And I actually think that a year without pile, right in the director by Casey

05:42.800 --> 05:51.720
Danyu, or sorry, Cassie Danyu? No. Would be better, because a mere said, as I also

05:51.720 --> 05:57.880
spilled a bunch of hard drives, he said, imagine if this was happening during a real podcast.

05:57.880 --> 06:02.920
Yeah. What the fuck was that about, man? I was saying that like this is basically a fake

06:02.920 --> 06:09.640
show. And that if that happened during an actual podcast with a host that we respect, it

06:09.640 --> 06:14.080
would be embarrassing. I feel like he doesn't even know what he's saying, because I feel

06:14.080 --> 06:19.480
like that's not that can't be what you mean. It is. I was very direct. And I used this

06:19.480 --> 06:24.040
specific words to get across that exact message, which is, is it that you aren't that

06:24.040 --> 06:27.840
guy? Is it that you feel comfortable on the show? Is it that it's like, oh, it's an

06:27.840 --> 06:31.120
in-house show. So it's not like something you have to make your bed of a friend is

06:31.120 --> 06:36.800
yeah. That's not no. Really? You should definitely make your bed of a friend is coming

06:36.800 --> 06:51.120
over. All right. Wow. That's why I'm using the same energy, though, to my first bullet

06:51.120 --> 06:59.440
point of my outline. What is this? Why? Why? That's your first full-page. You're out

06:59.440 --> 07:03.800
line. There's this studio G. Yeah. For the better part of a month, we haven't been booked

07:03.800 --> 07:10.240
in that studio. Why haven't I gotten a taste? Because there are three of us in this room

07:10.240 --> 07:19.520
right now. And the studio G is designed for four plus. Okay. I get that. Like a repertoire.

07:19.520 --> 07:24.000
Yeah. How do you ensemble? How do you remember which one is the UH, which one is the

07:24.000 --> 07:28.960
studio G? Because I'm in the torture member. Sorry. Are you thinking right if I step

07:28.960 --> 07:35.960
in right here? I do. But go ahead. Studio H stands for Studio H as in like Jeff G.

07:35.960 --> 07:41.920
Studio G. So now it's Studio H. Studio G was built for me as in it does stand for I'm sorry

07:41.920 --> 07:48.440
to say. Yeah. So you're the last person we thought about. One building G. I don't

07:48.440 --> 07:53.280
get that. I really don't get that. Because I feel like if we could be hopping

07:53.280 --> 07:59.480
harder than thither between Studio H and Jeff, suddenly we're really out of your time.

07:59.480 --> 08:10.080
Studio H. You got your G. Yeah. She was after you. I mean, I get them thinking that

08:10.080 --> 08:22.160
the studios are called H and Jeff. Yeah. Um. She re-askered

08:22.160 --> 08:32.560
everyone. You get ass. Um. As long as we get my ass in there. Sue. H. No, this is,

08:32.560 --> 08:38.440
what did you just put in your mouth? Is that gum or gum from earlier? I just need a buzz

08:38.440 --> 08:46.600
to get me through the shit and Brad is a buzz with this show. Let's hear from Brad. No comment.

08:46.600 --> 08:52.640
What is your shirt say? Where is Marieka? And they can't see. Yeah, we can't see.

08:52.640 --> 08:59.280
Me and a mere kid. Is there something on the back of Brad? Here we go. Here we go.

08:59.280 --> 09:07.640
Yeah. He shirts a fewers. New merch says, where is Marieka? I'm sure it's where it says

09:07.640 --> 09:12.720
one of the most. It's new merch. It says where is Marieka? Where is Marieka?

09:12.720 --> 09:18.440
I think it's a little weird or it's just Brad who's making the merch. It's me. It's

09:18.440 --> 09:23.680
for my show. Wow. Hill King's podcast has my episode about your company called

09:23.680 --> 09:30.560
Brad's. Nice to see you to ask. It has not good. Right. I was, yeah. We're joking

09:30.560 --> 09:36.800
and having fun over here. And I'm pissed behind the dust. Yeah. There's a lot of things

09:36.800 --> 09:40.760
going on. One's not better or worse than the other. But let me tell you, one studio is

09:40.760 --> 09:45.800
worse than the other. That's what it says. This one sucks. This is a premiere studio.

09:45.800 --> 09:53.000
Amir, can you point over your left shoulder? What kind of color do you think that is? I'm

09:53.000 --> 10:03.240
just curious. Is it giant green? It's not giant. Is it coal? Or is it charcoal? They went

10:03.800 --> 10:11.320
and they wouldn't have this in studio. Like a blue. Exactly. It's dark blue. Yeah. Which is

10:11.320 --> 10:19.960
not pleasing to the eye. Like giant wood. I find it. The works with the studio lighting really

10:19.960 --> 10:26.680
well. Everyone looks real flattering when they're sitting with the dark and stormy blue

10:26.680 --> 10:31.640
that we have on the walls. I'm not supposed to get dust kind of growing on me as well. First

10:31.720 --> 10:37.160
daylight or something. Yeah. Kind of like twilight. And the last sort of people love it.

10:37.160 --> 10:40.360
Yeah. Like you can't remember anything. So when you're looking through things like through

10:40.360 --> 10:44.040
the sexist images or when like a house is like warm on the inside and cool on the outside.

10:44.040 --> 10:48.840
It's when the warmth comes from the the comedy. Right. And then the coolness comes from

10:48.840 --> 10:52.440
frankly, the charcoal. And at a certain point, cola would have been too warm.

10:52.520 --> 10:56.520
Yeah.

10:58.520 --> 11:01.880
February. We're in February. I can't believe the first month is already behind us because

11:01.880 --> 11:06.360
to me it was a fever dream of health problems being in and out of the ER in hospital.

11:06.360 --> 11:11.160
In and out of consciousness. Exactly. Right. Yeah. Exactly. Right. February made me

11:11.160 --> 11:23.800
shiver. Because it's cold out of it. With every paper I deliver. Bad news on the door

11:23.800 --> 11:33.560
step. I couldn't take one more step. Finish it. I can't remember. Oh my god. You cut me off.

11:33.560 --> 11:42.760
So now I'm in it song. We're already a month into the year. And I feel like half of my

11:42.760 --> 11:47.960
goals for the show haven't come true. That's fine. That's what I mean. That's five. There's only

11:47.960 --> 11:53.720
11 more months. Yeah. So it like a portion of each of the eight percent of your goals have

11:53.720 --> 11:59.400
yet. Yeah. You did not have. I would say that maybe about 8 percent. Yeah. Yeah. And let's find

11:59.880 --> 12:03.800
nice to have like a good better workflow going. You know, like the guest booking process has been

12:03.800 --> 12:08.040
good. Johnny's coming back on the show on Friday. Oh, that's exciting. Yeah. Wait for the return.

12:08.040 --> 12:13.640
I'm recording for the following Friday release. Yeah. Not for this Friday but next Friday.

12:13.640 --> 12:17.640
But anyway. Can I talk about some of my goals? Are you guys going to muffle me? Like,

12:17.640 --> 12:21.320
you have been all of last year. I try to get a live show going in Madison Square Garden. It didn't

12:21.320 --> 12:26.920
happen. Well, you wanted to get a show going near Madison Square Garden. But not at the actual

12:27.480 --> 12:33.160
like add up like a fact that a mirror doesn't know speaks to the incompetency of the content team.

12:33.160 --> 12:39.880
Not really. No, not really. That's the opposite. Yeah. That's the fact that I was shielded from that

12:39.880 --> 12:44.440
hair brain scheme is actually a good thing. You think that they kind of know like the chain of

12:44.440 --> 12:50.040
command and where ideas would stop stop. Yeah. Exactly. I think you're pestering people in between

12:50.040 --> 12:55.080
me and you. But yeah, but then my anger started festering at people. Yeah. Yeah. Does it make sense?

12:55.160 --> 12:58.360
And then you ended up not doing the show. Yeah. And then I ended up faking a concussion to

12:58.360 --> 13:02.200
try and get sympathy so that the content team would be like, which concussion did you fake? The first,

13:02.200 --> 13:08.360
the second one of the first. The second one. Here are my goals for the year for the ahead go.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.840
Yeah. And for my role as an ahead go. We've already had like our our meetings where we discussed

13:14.840 --> 13:18.280
the goals for the year. And so here's the event that gets mentioned here. Of course at the

13:18.440 --> 13:26.280
mid February. Let's hear your goal. Yeah. Yeah. Crack down on red tape. Crack down on red tape.

13:26.280 --> 13:32.600
Crack down like you're trying to find it and eliminate it. Crack down like my ideas should get

13:32.600 --> 13:37.640
pushed through a lot. God, I don't think that's what that means. No, because I'm cracking down

13:37.640 --> 13:42.120
about cracking down. I'm cracking the whip because I feel like it's like whip it whip it good.

13:42.120 --> 13:48.040
Let's whip up good ideas. Mm-hmm. Yeah. See, all I need to get is in the room. All I need is

13:48.040 --> 13:54.200
that foot that cancels in the door. You're in the room. I'm in H. I wouldn't say that's the room.

13:54.200 --> 14:00.280
The room is studio G. Yeah. And that's for damn sure. I guess one way for me to remember is like

14:00.280 --> 14:07.400
Jeff's not allowed in studio G. Yeah. And that's like his name. So that's one way for me to remember.

14:07.400 --> 14:12.360
And when you say not allowed, do you mean like I might get in there next week? I would say you aren't

14:12.600 --> 14:18.840
able to record in there ever. Okay. As a general rule of thumb or as like general with a cap of

14:18.840 --> 14:23.080
energy. It's just a scheduling conflict. Is that what you're saying? No, because sometimes it's open,

14:23.080 --> 14:27.560
but we still don't want you to be there. And it's, but you were saying it's because there's only two of us

14:27.560 --> 14:37.080
do have little H energy. Yeah. I don't know if it's a little in the big g lower case H energy of a man.

14:38.040 --> 14:47.240
That's that studio back there. Where we keep all the wires in the table. Yeah. A closet,

14:47.240 --> 14:55.240
a glove right on Sunset Boulevard. You can hear tapering car driving by. That's your room for ads.

14:55.240 --> 15:03.960
You're saying for Brad. That's what I was saying. Cracking down on red tape though. I want a

15:04.520 --> 15:11.880
single handedly fire of the content. You can't do that. You can't. I know. That was a big swing.

15:11.880 --> 15:17.400
But now that I got your taxes. I want there to be less barriers to entry to do something interesting.

15:17.400 --> 15:21.240
People always get mad at me because all these episodes are repetitive, right? I have great ideas.

15:21.400 --> 15:25.720
I don't have the cash to do. Hey, we've talked about about some of these ideas. We've got to

15:25.720 --> 15:31.320
email you about that one idea that I've talked to you in passing twice. You know, features of mirror.

15:31.320 --> 15:35.960
Yeah, well, yeah. We're going to do it for 200. Okay. What is that like a jeopardy thing?

15:36.520 --> 15:46.920
Can we do that for $200? It's good. What's jeopardy? I only know Jeffrey. I always run jeopardy.

15:46.920 --> 15:51.000
They were an answer. The doughboys weren't on jeopardy because I tried to get them on the show.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.800
And then the way that they were put on the show was during the 24 hour live stream. We lost the

15:55.800 --> 16:01.080
footage. Yeah. Yeah. So this is what I'm talking about with cracking down on red tape. Like sometimes

16:01.080 --> 16:04.840
a lot of ideas are just thrown at the wall. The Mario Kart live stream. It's like, oh,

16:04.840 --> 16:08.520
like those do well for numbers. People donate. Like it's all this that the other. But I'm like,

16:08.520 --> 16:15.400
what about what happens in the arena? What about the things that happen between these four lines?

16:16.120 --> 16:20.520
Sorry. I stopped listening because I'm I'm looking at the desk and you are standing.

16:20.520 --> 16:26.280
Yeah. I can't really taught cable. You're jerking it that I don't know what it's plugged into.

16:26.280 --> 16:33.000
But you make one slight move with your right foot and you are pulling everything out of their

16:33.000 --> 16:42.120
sockets. One could also argue that I'm the only one keeping it. And you've moved your feet. You're

16:42.120 --> 16:48.200
still still as taught is to be the feet. Already you're calling them out. The last time we

16:48.200 --> 16:52.760
did this show, you were like, by the way, when you wear your bloodstone boots, your ankles look

16:52.760 --> 16:58.680
really thin. Yeah. If I remember correctly, we you wanted like criticism, right? Like you want

16:58.680 --> 17:05.720
us to criticize you. Okay. Get thicker ankles by doing what? Get full. Go to the gym.

17:05.800 --> 17:09.400
Or what about thinner boots? Gold number two thinner boots. Gold number two.

17:11.000 --> 17:18.680
Enjoy the finer things in life by taking time to rest. Fucking what? Is that the one you have

17:18.680 --> 17:24.600
done? That's the 8%. Yeah. You were worried that you weren't getting through your goals fast enough.

17:24.600 --> 17:30.120
And your second goal is to rest. To take time, yeah, to kind of slow down, to kind of make sure I'm

17:30.200 --> 17:37.240
taking time to enjoy the finer things. Yeah. Which includes studio G. And so so so you at the

17:37.240 --> 17:42.440
same time feel like you have not been getting enough done. Yeah, but doing this is achieve like

17:42.440 --> 17:50.040
goal or not resting. Exactly right. But by resting, I actually it's oxymoronic. I achieve that goal.

17:52.280 --> 17:56.680
But you haven't rested yet or have you rested? I've rested not enough. Okay. So a goal achieved.

17:57.640 --> 18:03.160
Next goal is to colonize studio G. Yeah. A lot of them are g-based goals. I might have to

18:03.160 --> 18:12.840
store in the barricade as in just the interior there. Barricade is studio G, OF. Is that from Lumez?

18:12.840 --> 18:21.480
Yeah. Because I am miserable. I am less miserable. Brud, speak up, right? Sure, man.

18:22.120 --> 18:27.000
Yeah. I feel like you were the wearer's mureka shirt. And because she's not here,

18:27.000 --> 18:33.080
he's just going to boycott the episode. Much like I might start boycotting studio age. You

18:33.080 --> 18:37.560
can boycott studio age, but you're not allowed in studio G. So where are we going to record zoom?

18:38.120 --> 18:43.560
If that's what you want, if you're boycotting it. I said I want to colonize studio Jeff.

18:45.160 --> 18:49.240
Do you know how to use that equipment? That equipment. He doesn't know how to use this equipment.

18:49.960 --> 19:01.800
Got him. Let's do it again. Yeah, but it's like, you know, how many jokes does it take before,

19:01.800 --> 19:09.240
you know, you get to the center of my anger. I don't know 50. One, two, three, four, three, four.

19:09.960 --> 19:17.000
Yes. All right. Here we go. Next goal is to have a ton of fun.

19:19.240 --> 19:23.960
See, you want to cut. You want to mount on and have a thousand pounds of fun.

19:26.280 --> 19:32.120
Because like the unit of measurement, 2000 pounds. Yeah. I don't mind that. But either way,

19:32.120 --> 19:36.360
just fractionally, let's have half the amount of fun we're having before. Still a lot of fun.

19:37.320 --> 19:45.000
Really? Thousand pounds. Yeah. My last one is to put Maria out of a job. All right. Um, here we go.

19:55.000 --> 20:02.360
My hair position is geo. This is something I like to call warming or wrenching.

20:02.360 --> 20:12.520
Worming, warming, warming or wrenching heart addition. The band? What band?

20:12.520 --> 20:26.440
Heart. Oh, man. How do I get you alone? Heart. Because Valentine's Day is after this episode

20:26.520 --> 20:33.400
a few days. I'm going to read a couple, um, headline. It really sad when you said that. I

20:33.400 --> 20:39.720
am, I had to burp. So you can play the Saturday. Me like having to like, yeah, um, you're more

20:39.720 --> 20:46.520
gassy than sad than sad. Yeah. Um, I'm going to list off a bunch of news headlines and you're

20:46.520 --> 20:51.560
guys are going to tell me if these stories are heart warming or heart wrenching. Does that make sense?

20:51.560 --> 20:56.360
Yeah. All right. Here we go. Number one. Animal shelter celebrates after all pets adopted for

20:56.360 --> 21:04.200
first time in nearly 50 years. Warming. Yes, that's a car warming to me. Brad, I'm a little wrenched

21:04.200 --> 21:11.800
by that. How so you want rescue animals to be? Well, it kind of seems like the adopted all of them

21:11.800 --> 21:18.360
at once. Like that seems nefarious, right? Who is adopting the role of the dogs at one time? Yeah.

21:18.360 --> 21:24.520
I know. I know. Maybe it was yours. Sounds like some shit you would do. I didn't. I won't

21:24.600 --> 21:30.840
I'll put them back. See, dude. I put them. I'll put them back. They're eating the atmospheric

21:30.840 --> 21:38.120
river and the basket. Uh, here we go. Local grandson commits grand mattresside by injecting

21:38.120 --> 21:44.040
untasteable amounts of sour yeast into celiac grandmother's soup over the span of nine months

21:44.040 --> 21:54.040
inherits a lot. But warming a real headline. Local grandson grand mattresside. Yes.

21:54.680 --> 22:00.840
Kill like a grandmother. Injecting yeast, sour yeast, which has gluten in it. Not all yeast does

22:00.840 --> 22:06.840
case. I know you're thinking. Not all yeast naturally yeast does not have any wheat in it. Of course,

22:06.840 --> 22:17.880
sour yeast is not all yeast. Yeah. Swimming or heart wrenching. Wrenching. Okay. And you guys. Yeah. All right.

22:18.440 --> 22:23.400
That's warming to me. He came because he got that bag. He came. He came. He saw you conquered with

22:23.880 --> 22:28.840
yeast. Who? All right. Burger King worker who didn't miss a day of work in 27 years buys home with

22:28.840 --> 22:42.040
crowdfunding donations. Um, heart wrenching to me. How so? Uh, 27 years and, uh, you know,

22:43.880 --> 22:49.720
he came that he can't afford to buy a home. But he did with the, well, the fact that society

22:49.720 --> 22:56.840
has to pick up the slack, uh, in the, in the spaces where, you know, uh, the government or our

22:56.840 --> 23:03.000
employers should be maybe putting people before profits. You know, all that, all that stuff. I can't get into

23:03.000 --> 23:08.280
it all right now. And that is great detail. But it just, it just really bothers me when it's like,

23:09.080 --> 23:15.320
I need, I really need this life-saving surgery. And I hope I can pass my go, uh, go fund me

23:15.800 --> 23:20.440
fundraising goal together. Okay. Let's talk about healthcare them for a second. So like,

23:20.440 --> 23:24.440
we pay taxes to the government. The government subsidizes the insurance companies. And then we also

23:24.440 --> 23:29.640
pay the insurance companies. Put yourself in the shoes of, uh, etna. You don't think they want

23:29.640 --> 23:37.000
dual income. You're standing up for the health insurance companies. Is that not cool to do?

23:37.880 --> 23:42.120
First, it's not cool. I think I don't think, I don't think there's been a point in history

23:42.120 --> 23:45.800
where it's been cool to do. I know. I just, yeah, I was just imagining what if I was at

23:45.800 --> 23:52.360
there. I want multiple income sources. You know, blue cross, blue shield. Yeah. So hearing

23:52.360 --> 24:04.520
you stand up for it and it really pisses me off. I do have a PPO. I think it's warming.

24:05.400 --> 24:15.480
I had bigger king to have a castle. He got it. All right. He gained confidence, but none survived.

24:15.480 --> 24:24.200
Shy man tosses sharp jacks in front of a public bus. Where? Okay, before I am, wouldn't survive.

24:24.200 --> 24:28.600
Where did you pull this headline? Like, from Apple news or something.

24:28.920 --> 24:36.360
You wrote it. Of course you wrote it. The jacks. I can't imagine any new source covering this story.

24:36.360 --> 24:40.760
Yeah. This story growing jacks in front of what was it? You think I could have written this? What was it?

24:40.760 --> 24:47.720
When we're talking. He gained confidence, but none survived. Shy man tosses sharp jacks in front of a bus.

24:47.720 --> 24:55.640
Jacks. None survived. None. Even him. He, no, he gained confidence. Okay. Why?

24:56.600 --> 25:02.920
I mean, why? Why is that got confident? Because there's no shoes of a shy man. He was shy.

25:02.920 --> 25:09.800
Yeah. Imagine having the power to do that. I have sharp jacks and be like, all right. I'm going to do it.

25:09.800 --> 25:16.920
Tossing him in front of a fucking EV and topples over. Jacks like the old game jacks.

25:16.920 --> 25:23.720
Yes. That's what I thought. Mean guys name John. Jacks. Right.

25:23.800 --> 25:29.960
Next headline. Cupboard board on the same day at the same hospital.

25:29.960 --> 25:33.480
Wed on their birthday. Those are twins.

25:36.040 --> 25:41.960
So hard wrenching. Oh, yeah. That should burn. It shouldn't marry your twin. No.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.520
That took a turn for the birth.

25:46.280 --> 25:47.720
Nice. Thanks.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.720
Anx.

25:51.560 --> 25:54.920
Something borrowed something blue chew.

25:54.920 --> 25:59.320
Jokester groom shows up to nocturals pitching modest 10.

26:01.640 --> 26:02.840
Like god.

26:05.720 --> 26:09.320
The hell more. I think that's kind of, yeah. It's kind of special.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.720
They could be that vulnerable in front of friends and family.

26:11.720 --> 26:16.760
Vulnerable. Yeah. He had a semi for the entire ceremony. It was a fully.

26:16.760 --> 26:21.240
It's just that it appears the semi. It was pretty modest. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah.

26:23.400 --> 26:30.360
I think that's hard for me. Yeah. I agree. I think it's hard for me. Nice.

26:31.960 --> 26:36.520
Good Samaritan helps Michigan man plow driveway and wife.

26:41.720 --> 26:49.000
Heartwarming, right? Yeah. So again, where are you pulling these heavy. From the fucking internet?

26:49.000 --> 26:55.080
I don't have time to check the source. Right? Some of them feel nice and cool and some of them

26:55.080 --> 26:59.720
are just you saying that a grandmother was killed with yeast. That one's off me.

26:59.720 --> 27:04.360
The name of the segment is heartwarming and a arranging. I thought it was warming the wrenching.

27:04.360 --> 27:07.720
Or if you're arranging heart edition and you're like some of these are kind of heartwarming and

27:07.720 --> 27:14.040
other ones are like vial. I'm like they're bright. Like a small poem before every headline.

27:14.040 --> 27:20.200
And that's not usually what it looks like in like the New York Times or the LA Times or

27:20.840 --> 27:29.000
scenes from studio Jeff a newspaper edition. That's a headline. That's a local news.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.800
That's a newspaper. That's a paper that I'm from studio Jeff. Newspaper edition.

27:33.880 --> 27:39.640
There's a newspaper that he started. I see. And he's pulling the headlines.

27:41.800 --> 27:46.680
The world's first corn star man has penis replaced with a cob.

27:48.280 --> 27:56.280
Oh, they they they wrote that article about it. It was honestly free Bradvertizing.

27:57.240 --> 28:03.240
My hair position is geo. All right. Heartwarming first cornstarch.

28:09.320 --> 28:15.160
You have another punch. I was yes ending. No, I feel like he stole the thunder on that trick a little bit.

28:16.440 --> 28:22.920
That is all right. Because you've got your little applause and then I got mine. I want my flowers.

28:22.920 --> 28:28.600
And I think that's fine to ask for. Man keeps alive language thought to be extinct.

28:33.240 --> 28:40.120
Warming. Warming. Okay. Non-profit organization dedicated to making all primitive languages go

28:40.120 --> 28:44.280
extinct receives $10 billion grant from the Bill of Melinda Gates Foundation.

28:45.080 --> 28:51.720
Right, Jean. Oh, yeah. And that just goes to show you that there's two sides to every story.

28:51.720 --> 28:56.200
Yeah. Yeah. And there's two sides to every coin and both sides speak English.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.440
You should have like a boo.

29:03.480 --> 29:06.680
A boo. Yeah. Well, everything I say. I think that.

29:08.520 --> 29:10.840
That was a recording. I didn't say that a lot.

29:13.640 --> 29:16.360
Yeah. All right. Let's just get into this next part in a second.

29:22.200 --> 29:28.200
Welcome to Ask Jeff. You guys have heard of Ask Jeeps. Yeah. This is Ask Jeeps.

29:30.760 --> 29:36.840
My god. So basically, you know, again, it's it's a kind of a Valentine's day theme. We're kind of

29:38.280 --> 29:48.360
Yeah, we're kind of circling it. It's a little bit. Yeah. It was an easy. It's Valentine's. It's not actually

29:48.440 --> 29:55.880
set those two days after. Valentine's Day can be tricky. You know, it's a precarious time of the year,

29:55.880 --> 30:01.560
especially if it's there, precarious time of the month. No. Really?

30:04.120 --> 30:05.320
I thought it was a nice pun.

30:10.280 --> 30:15.640
Anyway, I thought that you guys could kind of write into me and ask me matters of the heart.

30:15.720 --> 30:22.200
And I could solve your problems for you. Kind of like Jeeps. Okay. Tell me the biggest

30:22.200 --> 30:25.960
woe of your love life and let Uncle Jeff save your ass before it's too fast.

30:27.880 --> 30:35.640
Too last. Well, if I, Brad, you're married, right? More than Mary. Yeah. Okay.

30:35.640 --> 30:44.680
Hopefully we got two married guys here. I'm not married. I did ask asked three different women.

30:45.800 --> 30:52.360
To Mary. Not at the same time. But I had an extra seat to go to this movie screening.

30:53.800 --> 30:58.920
It's like, you know, here in Los Angeles, they have like the one on Sunday. Yeah, this is the one on Sunday.

30:58.920 --> 31:04.840
And they bring like directors or writers because they're trying to get the Oscars. So I had an

31:04.840 --> 31:11.960
extra RSVP to the screening and I asked, I said, hey, would you like to go? They said, oh, I can't

31:12.840 --> 31:16.760
all three of them said that. No, that was the first one. Second one. Hey, would you like to go?

31:17.880 --> 31:21.480
I'm at a town. Sorry. Third one. Hey, would you like to go?

31:23.160 --> 31:29.400
No, I don't like you. I don't like you. I don't know you. Oh, somebody you didn't know. No. Yeah.

31:29.400 --> 31:35.080
Well, I mean, I'm making up with details in the last one. But basically, I asked three people to go to this

31:35.080 --> 31:40.440
thing and they all decline. Yeah. So what's the question? Where do you ask him, Jeeps?

31:41.080 --> 31:45.400
What should I do? Like, how do I? Sorry, anyone wants to go? The screening's already happening.

31:45.400 --> 31:51.480
Okay, but how do I in the future get a yes? I think, I feel like, I don't want to gender it, but I feel like,

31:52.600 --> 31:59.640
no. I don't know a lot of women who want to go to like niche film screening.

31:59.640 --> 32:04.600
Academy Award nominate. Yeah. I'm sure there are plenty, but I just am like, that feels like a crazy

32:04.600 --> 32:11.320
first day. What would it have been a first day for all three? No, I know these people. Really. Yeah.

32:11.320 --> 32:18.360
I'm a car. Were you asking specifically within the context of it? I was asking. I was asking,

32:20.120 --> 32:24.120
yeah, if you know them, it might not have been the date to them. I mean, I don't know.

32:24.120 --> 32:27.960
Sorry. Yeah. Can I just jump in here? I'm so sorry. Sure. I'm trying to get more details,

32:27.960 --> 32:31.880
but you might want to cool it with the Diet Coke. I'm here. I feel like every time I record,

32:31.880 --> 32:36.920
you're like, how is it asked for time? Well, I mean, it's like a caffeine boost. Well, I mean,

32:36.920 --> 32:43.880
it's a cancer inducing. Is it? Yeah. It's probably like three of these a week through those every

32:43.880 --> 32:49.400
time I see you. Actually, studies aren't quite conclusive on that, Jeff. Sorry, fact check. Yeah.

32:49.400 --> 32:53.880
I don't, we don't need a fact check on the show. Why, why Diet Coke over Coke zero?

32:54.760 --> 33:00.200
I actually, I never used to have any soda growing up. I didn't like Coke or Diet Coke or Coke zero.

33:00.280 --> 33:05.160
I just started drinking these because they were in the office like six months ago. So I've never

33:05.160 --> 33:11.000
had a Coke zero. Oh, you should try. I love Coke zero. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that this interrupted

33:11.000 --> 33:18.200
their story. Oh, I was like, yeah, trying to, you know, do the, the game or whatever. It's more of a

33:18.200 --> 33:23.480
I was at giving you with genuine. Do they think it was a date or was it like friends that you already

33:23.480 --> 33:31.080
had? I don't know. I was nebulous. It was more like, hey, I've got an XR RSVP, which is like

33:31.080 --> 33:35.080
to come. Maybe it sounded too casual where they were like, I don't know. Yeah, there's

33:35.080 --> 33:39.080
something special about that. Is this a date that you wanted? It's not a bit. It's matters

33:39.080 --> 33:45.480
the heart. Okay. Oh, that's the most recent. And that's, it was also a, the middle of a storm

33:45.480 --> 33:51.560
on Sunday. So that was a tough sell. Well, before, I mean, I was asking, I was probably giving

33:51.640 --> 33:55.240
like five days notice. Got it. So they weren't like a, they weren't taking that into

33:55.240 --> 33:59.960
the fact. Yeah. So they didn't know. When, when Sunday came around and it started raining,

33:59.960 --> 34:03.400
I was like, oh, are you actually into any of these women or you just wanted someone to go

34:03.400 --> 34:10.760
with to the thing? Oh, I could have been. I have, I have interest, but I think if it was a

34:10.760 --> 34:15.640
more romantic ask, they would have, one of them would have said, yes. Okay. Well, because it felt too

34:15.720 --> 34:24.040
casual. Yeah. I'm like, raise about it. Okay. You also said the second one was out of

34:24.040 --> 34:31.000
town. So it sounds like that person wouldn't have come anyway. Yeah. Yeah. One one told me that she

34:31.000 --> 34:38.280
had dragon plans. What's dragon plans? Where's I now? You didn't follow up at all. I have dragon

34:38.280 --> 34:45.160
plans. All right. No worries. No, she said, I've got dragon plans all weekend. And I said, I'm hearing

34:45.240 --> 34:51.720
that a lot these days. Have you? No. I was just goofing around. You think she's like,

34:51.720 --> 34:56.120
ooh, I'm crazy. I'm going to hang out with a dragon or she like, there's a metaphor that we've

34:56.120 --> 35:01.720
not heard probably playing Dungeons and Dragons. Oh, I had dragon plans last weekend. I've been hearing

35:01.720 --> 35:14.680
that a lot. Dragon my third leg. I've been down to pull it up. Why? Because it's fucking flooded. Right.

35:14.760 --> 35:22.360
And I'm using my hose as a pump to help save the town. Now that's real. I'm

35:22.360 --> 35:29.400
siphoning rain. Are you sure you want to my taxi driver with me and spewing it where necessary?

35:29.400 --> 35:32.840
Yeah. I have GRDA. All right. I'm here. Ask you, yes.

35:34.680 --> 35:40.520
Because whoa, of your love life. Not really love life, but we're considering answering it wrong.

35:41.240 --> 35:47.000
Answering it. Asking it wrong. Yeah. How much wallpaper is too much? How much wall

35:47.000 --> 35:53.560
paper is too much? Are you wall papering your house? It's been brought in. Two rolls that I've been

35:55.160 --> 36:05.640
he stumbled over that. What did you say? It's been two rolls. So you pasted wall. And then he just

36:05.640 --> 36:10.360
kind of trailed off. Pattern repeat is too big for this wall.

36:12.760 --> 36:20.440
Siphoning off. That's the hardest song. But I'm sorry. I get a lot of rolls in and I've had him on.

36:23.480 --> 36:28.840
All our repeat makes room feel bigger. It's the finest of the papers. That's really good.

36:29.800 --> 36:34.760
Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad and Sany. Thanks. That was Casey.

36:38.200 --> 36:43.640
Yeah. You can have wallpaper like four in one room. That's different wall paper.

36:43.640 --> 36:47.800
Yeah. Four different wall papers. How ghost does it get with the mirror? I don't know.

36:47.800 --> 36:53.480
There's this whole design trend of maximalism or something. Not maximal. Right. I mean, I say you

36:53.480 --> 36:59.240
have to put your foot down somewhere, but one accent wall, all walls, but one pattern,

37:00.280 --> 37:07.000
one colored wall, like a charcoal or a cola. I like the second one. Not so much the first. Of course.

37:07.960 --> 37:11.800
Here's, you want my actual advice? I don't know. Maybe I'll buy that vision pro and I can sort of

37:11.800 --> 37:18.520
live design the home so you can visualize it properly. And then you would never need to actually

37:18.520 --> 37:23.960
physically do it if you just live in the end of vision pro. I don't mind that. Are you guys

37:23.960 --> 37:29.160
intrigued by the vision pro? Nope. I want to, I'm intrigued by each wall paper. Which rooms in your

37:29.160 --> 37:33.560
house are you trying to wallpaper? Living room. Living room. Yeah. I wouldn't do that. Interesting.

37:33.560 --> 37:38.600
I don't like these other four different patterns. I mean, you could put you could put the same

37:38.600 --> 37:43.400
pattern on all four walls. Can I pitch something for your house? Sure. I know the floor plan.

37:43.400 --> 37:49.720
Yeah. Living room. I would keep like a white, but like a warmer white than what you have in there.

37:49.720 --> 37:55.720
Like a fucking Swiss coffee, right? I don't know. And then the whole way, same continues into the whole

37:55.720 --> 38:00.280
way. You just painted your cabinets in your kitchen, right? You know, like a pink? Really.

38:01.080 --> 38:05.560
I've seen some sticker, like people have been like a sand pattern with a sticker on the

38:05.560 --> 38:11.080
cupboard. Now you're lost cause you don't get it. Well, now because your responses are clearly

38:11.160 --> 38:14.120
indicative that you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. So it's just like work with a

38:14.120 --> 38:18.600
designer or don't do your bullshit or work with a designer. Don't ask me that. I'm done to work with

38:18.600 --> 38:25.720
the designer. Really? Yeah. I don't have any recommendations. I can. I think your office, you should

38:25.720 --> 38:31.000
do wallpaper or statement wallpaper. There's a wallpaper in the office behind the teal couch.

38:32.760 --> 38:37.400
And I didn't want to have to ramp the teal couch. What? I don't know. I think you might want to go

38:37.560 --> 38:42.840
with more like a. I couch was more of like a lie. I'm trying to say I'm a cold. It'd be like a dead

38:42.840 --> 38:47.800
salmon, a flat white. Yeah, a flat white with a dead set. You're just describing an awful breakfast.

38:49.400 --> 39:01.080
The flat white cheese that is fine. What's that? Brad? Uh huh. They said it couldn't be done.

39:01.960 --> 39:08.360
They said married men don't have woes. And yet here we are. Tell me the biggest one of your

39:08.360 --> 39:14.040
love life and how I can save your ass before it's too last. Uh, well, we don't have any woes,

39:14.040 --> 39:18.760
really. So I can't really help you there. You're not helping me. What do you think this is?

39:18.760 --> 39:22.280
This is just for the show. I'm trying to help you. Well, you wanted my advice, right?

39:23.080 --> 39:32.280
I want you. I want you. I want to help you with giving you advice. I don't think you're

39:32.280 --> 39:46.200
quite in a position to do that. Why is that? No, I'm curious. You're just kind of not. You know,

39:46.280 --> 39:54.200
I don't know what it means. She's like in general. Yeah, for sure. You're anti-wise. Yeah.

39:55.000 --> 40:06.840
And meanwhile me over here. Am. So I don't even think you gave me advice on my

40:06.840 --> 40:13.960
genuine inquiry. Yeah. Casey in point. Yeah. What's the case? One.

40:15.400 --> 40:22.520
And point. I did. I said make a definitive date happen. Oh, yeah. I mean, yeah, that's no problem.

40:23.400 --> 40:27.160
I didn't say it was a hard issue. I'm just saying that's my advice. Yes, yes, for Jeff's advice,

40:27.560 --> 40:33.720
I think I advice to Casey was honestly better to have Riz. Yeah, that's great advice.

40:34.120 --> 40:45.720
Have Riz. You'll be swimming in the atmospheric river of box. Oh, my. Have Riz about it. Take me to the river. Take me to the

40:45.720 --> 40:58.120
Rizmer atmospheric river. The IARC classifies Aspertame is possibly carcinogenic to humans,

40:58.120 --> 41:06.200
based on limited evidence. It might cause cancer in people. But soldiers, I don't know, smoking.

41:06.200 --> 41:11.560
And you don't see me not doing that. Yeah, I'm saying that the evidence isn't conclusive.

41:12.600 --> 41:13.960
Even better. I mean, there's the evidence.

41:15.800 --> 41:22.680
They haven't finished. You know, they have another album in the world. Let's just

41:24.040 --> 41:28.920
let's round it out. Let's bring the episode home. Let's not end on this note. Okay. What's that famous

41:28.920 --> 41:35.000
evidence? Evanescent song. Wake me up. Wake me up inside. I can't wake up.

41:35.080 --> 41:38.200
Give me another than the same thing.

41:42.200 --> 41:50.520
Dark enough with the camaraderie with the singing and unison with the being in time.

41:50.520 --> 41:57.400
All right. It's supposed to be dividing your asses. Yeah. So that I'm the one in charge. Okay.

41:57.400 --> 42:04.120
Divide and conquer Studio Joff. This is H. Fuck. And it will always be.

42:06.120 --> 42:11.880
Good. I'm starting to come around on Studio H. Well, Studio How?

42:16.600 --> 42:17.080
Plugs.

42:19.080 --> 42:24.280
Right. Let's get the fuck out of here. I am doing my one-man show.

42:24.280 --> 42:32.200
Oh, no way. Moment tonight. So you missed it. Unfortunately. This is the first I've heard of this.

42:32.200 --> 42:36.280
This isn't real. I haven't planned it. I'm just trying to put it in the ether. You're trying to

42:36.280 --> 42:42.680
put it out there to do tonight. He's creating FOMO Jeff. Have I heard of it?

42:43.240 --> 42:47.640
Even if that's true. Why are you yelling at me like that's like he's doing this awesome thing.

42:47.640 --> 42:53.560
Get off his back. He's creating FOMO. That's nothing. That's nothing. He's creating it.

42:53.640 --> 42:57.720
He's creating something. It's more than say about anybody else.

42:58.760 --> 43:05.000
Casey, what do you got? Listen to the pit wall. It's easy. Yes, he's coming out soon.

43:05.000 --> 43:10.440
Yeah, Director of the Survive is dropping at the end of the month and we will be talking about it.

43:10.440 --> 43:14.600
Episode by episode or two episodes at a time. We haven't figured it out yet. Man,

43:15.640 --> 43:21.480
we're still on hiatus. It's the off season. I have so much to do outside of the pit wall.

43:22.280 --> 43:28.520
How am I supposed to be planning podcasts a month in advance? I don't know. I feel. I just

43:28.520 --> 43:35.480
am like, oh, like, I'm so much going on. You don't do anything else here besides this. You hit

43:35.480 --> 43:41.160
your head once and you hit your head three or four times since. Every time you're telling us you're

43:41.160 --> 43:47.480
feeling a little bit better, you hit your head again. And I'm, excuse me, you're starting to think

43:47.560 --> 43:53.080
it's so that we don't have you do other stuff. You're sort of doing it as a crutch. Yeah.

43:53.080 --> 43:58.280
Oh, I should be on crutches. Yeah, exactly. So yeah, the pit wall.

44:00.840 --> 44:10.200
Follow me on Instagram and I Casey, don't you? Brad. Go. Listen to slash watch The Hill King's podcast on

44:10.200 --> 44:17.400
YouTube and Apple and Spotify Jeff did an episode with us. Has it come out yet? It hasn't come out yet.

44:17.800 --> 44:21.720
It will come out once we start releasing season two. We just finished season one.

44:23.320 --> 44:27.160
But Jeff was in the second episode and it was a really good time and thank you. I was I

44:27.160 --> 44:34.120
guessed it on that episode. The day I got my concussion. Really. And my co-hosts. When in

44:34.120 --> 44:41.240

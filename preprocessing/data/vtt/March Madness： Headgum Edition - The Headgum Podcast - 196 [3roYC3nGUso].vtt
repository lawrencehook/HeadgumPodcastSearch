WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
We're all recording. We're all set up just fine.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Amir, you couldn't have come up with a better background.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Look at Billy. He has the crown molding.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
He has the detailing on the wall.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Not a lot of art, which I don't appreciate.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
You could have put up a poster at five.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Okay, there you go. Good fellows or...

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
No.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Is it when you finish saving the world?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
It is.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
No, it's...

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
I don't...

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
This is actually my prize position.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
I don't...

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
It feels like too early to talk about it.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
I don't really want to talk.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Let's talk about it after the break.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
I guess.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
It's just so fucked up.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
It's the original bottle rocket poster,

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
which I didn't you pay like a thousand dollars for that?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I don't want to.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
I don't want to.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
More.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
But it was over $500, right?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Yeah.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
And then when it got there,

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
you immediately regretted it.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I remember you texted it.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
No, I didn't regretted it at all.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
It's a...

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
It's not...

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
It's fine.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
11 by 17.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
It's not fine.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
I'll talk about it.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Because you guys keep bringing it up.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
It's not a BBaker.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
It's the...

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
It's the poster from the bottom rocket short film that they made

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
when they went to Sundance in 1994.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
And they put it up all around Barcidi, whatever the fuck.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
And then the graphic designer who made it like kept one

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
and then sold it off with the fugue.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
And I got it.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
I was looking for a point.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
And what the audience doesn't know is that

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
when you flip the camera around,

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
the posters on the wall are ghostbusters

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
after life.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Hell of a summer when you finish saving the world

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
crisis, which is a deep cut,

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
no for losers.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Get off of my IMDB.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Yeah, when no number.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
When no number.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
When no number.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Yes.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
When no number.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
ARP.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
When no number.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Yes.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
A TV show that's named after a printer company.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Not print.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
This is kind of broken up right now

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
into like Wes Anderson themed.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Yes.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Inside.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
And then also.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
And then Billy and him.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Jeff.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
No Jeff and his kitchen and a mirror with it

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
and also bad background.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
That's a background's fine.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Yeah.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
So they sold my table and the process of moving house.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Like I'm just moving.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
What is the fifth time?

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
This has got to be six times and six years.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Yeah.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Six and a half if you count me living at home

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
for the pandemic.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Yeah.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
And we do.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Where this show was incubated into what it as we come,

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
which is sort of an up and it's sort of a late night talk show.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
It's.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
It's a rotating door featuring the most important.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
Podcasters at the network.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Are you kidding me?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
What is this?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Here's what we're going to do today.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Have you guys heard of food diaries?

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Um.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Like you have a list of what you ate.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Okay.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Bragg.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
You're studied up.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I'm guessing.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
So yeah.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
It's like it's it's where you like write out what you had

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
for like breakfast lunch snack and dinner and fourth meal.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Um.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Well, today we're going to do mood diaries.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
So that's not just a diary.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Can we let me fucking finish or is it the marica hour?

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
It kind of always is.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
I heard a cat.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Yes.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Mr. Tim recording.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Mood diaries are like food diaries.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Only instead of listing out what you ate,

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
you list out how you felt.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
So this is sort of a side quest that I'm

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
tweeting to you fuckers.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
For the next 45,

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
you guys are going to list four to five.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Mood diary entries.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Things you felt,

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
you know,

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
thoughts you had to swallow instead of say.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
And then we'll read them out at the end of the day.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
So not we're not doing it in the moment.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
We're doing it.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
You're writing it in the moment.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
You're going to read it out at the end.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Gotcha.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Three to six.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Mood diary entries.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Three to six now.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
That's the same as four to five a minute ago.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
I changed it to three to six,

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
because that's the same amount of

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
months that the neurologist told me this morning

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
that it's going to take me to feel 100%.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
For your that concussion.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Yes.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
The post-concussive syndrome,

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
which I was diagnosed with formally this morning,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
to have you're still feeling it.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Because I'm my cognition in slow.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Everything is five times more fatiguing than it should be.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Three to six times more fatiguing, let's say.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
And I was wondering.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
I was wondering.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
To stand for this entire episode.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
It was.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
It engages the core and I don't have a chair.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
You saw the chair too?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Yes.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Yes.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
I thought it was a table.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Well, it was the whole set.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
If it was a chair,

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I'd be sitting there.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Okay.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Three to six diary entries.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
For the mood diary.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Three out the episode.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Time is on.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
You're got.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I don't interrupt y'all.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
Three to six mood diary entries.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Time stamped or otherwise.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Dealers slash Sophie's choice.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
But you do have to point out when it happens.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Just it doesn't have to be so formal as time stamps.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
It could just be, oh, when you said this,

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
I was feeling XYZ.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
And maybe I see Billy writing down one right now.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Maybe that's going to be one of his mood diary entries.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Are we clear?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Can we move on?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Because he barely started.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Okay.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
So you want us to write while we are a court?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Yeah, like just drop down.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
I wouldn't say like write a whole fucking diary entry.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Yes, you are telling him.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
No, I'm saying like I just ended fucking by entry.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
I mean like a bullet point.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
Three to six bullet points of what you felt during the episode.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Okay.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Where's your replays?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
It's in.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Is it like out there where it's kind of like windy?

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Is it like right next to it?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Is it?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Yes.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
It's not really.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
It's barely in.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
More like in.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
But is it next to it?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah, it's kind of next to it.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I am at court like a.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Like going through.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I imagine it is.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
This is not true.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm not even going to be able to believe this.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
It's hyper specific.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
And it's like, it can't be like, oh, this is the neighborhood I live in.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
It's like, I live next to.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
I live next to.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Which don't say that.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
You're a moderate.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
You're telling people though.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
You're giving these little breadcrumbs to people.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Then you're getting mad at us for commenting on them.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
It's not a very severe location.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
I mean, you think a mere house is accessible.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I wouldn't put that in either.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
According to the Hollywood reporters,

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
so how is this in the client?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I saw that.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
I, okay, go on.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Can you guys riddle me this?

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
Why are stars not flocking to the one-shot spot?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
You got to understock that.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
You know, I was taking months like that.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
What's up?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
You got a membership in the last half of the membership.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
When I was writing for Carpool karaoke,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
he said last eight, 18 months.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
This was three years ago.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
This is four years ago.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
2020 to the cost you.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
$2,000 a year.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
You're not great with money.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
I'm not.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
But Carpool, I was being paid three grand a week.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
So one week of work.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I'm already in a surplus from the so-ah, I was membership.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Or you could have just had $2,000.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
And that's where I went wrong.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
That's.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Did you ever go?

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
I had drinks there.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
I want to say thrice.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
How many months did you have the membership?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I had it for a year.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I did have it for a year.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
So it ultimately ended up being, yeah,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
kind of a $660 cover each time.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
But if you're under 30,

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
food is half off.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
And then, was that even open during the pandemic?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
I know Jim's closed.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
I know so how's closed.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
So did they refund you?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I canceled my membership after a year.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Because I was like, I don't go enough.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Yeah.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
114 year old Texan is the oldest person in the United States.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
If you guys lived that long,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
how would you spend your extra years,

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
bad?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Yeah.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Billy, would you sort of wank it?

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Would you sort of have that sort of crank that shaft

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
until you were, you know, returned to dust?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
I don't know.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
If I could be,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I guess cranking my shaft at 114,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
that would be pretty remarkable.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Yeah.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
But yeah.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Because of the age,

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
the age,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
that exclusively because of the age.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Right.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I feel like you guys are like,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
still trying to get your,

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
you know,

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
wits about you in this episode.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
You haven't found solid footing.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
And I don't think it's because I've done the dishes before.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
We started recording,

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Jeff, you have, you have your picture of filthy.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
And I just,

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I don't like this,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
the view of me like towering over you.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
It's really disarming.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
It's just kind of like you're looking at up at us constantly

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
for praying.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Where's your computer has to be on it?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
It's only a high shelf.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
It's on top of the fridge.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
On top of the other,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I look down at you guys.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Can you put your computer in the fridge

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
and then close the fridge

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
and then do that angle

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
where you like open the fridge

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
and look for stuff and then close it?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Yeah, it's a good idea.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
I don't know if you're trying to sabotage the episode

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
or if you're fine with us having good content.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
I appreciate the effort, I guess.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Did your garbage lid not close properly?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Take out the trash.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Yeah.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
People are horny for Austin Butler's

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
doing part two character.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
I guess my question is when?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
I have things to say about this.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
I think he should have been hotter.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I haven't seen it yet,

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
I'm excited.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I'm going to see it in like five days.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
So I,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
you guys can talk about that.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I just want to be able to contribute.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
My only,

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
my only take was that I think they should have made him

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
a little hotter.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
How do you make him hotter?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
What's the,

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
what do you,

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
like hire somebody else?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Is that,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
are you saying he's the hottest he could ever be?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Well,

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
anyone would be like,

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
how did they not make him hotter?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
How would you suggest that they do that?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I think one of the main problems

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
was that he couldn't shave his head

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
so that he was wearing a bald cap over his hair

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
and he looked like mega mild.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Yeah,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
because the hair is bunched up under the cap.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Well,

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
it was just like big.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
And I was like,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
if it was like a little more,

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
just size,

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
I think this would,

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
So what do you say?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
You're wish that

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
his bald head had been to like,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
mega mild and some shots.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
And I would have preferred not that.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
I'm sorry.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
I'm here.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
I didn't see Dune.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Well,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
what am I doing too?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I was going to say,

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
yeah.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
I've seen Dune two three times.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Yeah, it's awesome.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I think quite get it.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
But I thought Austin Butler was a four.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Adam.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Four.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Oh, right.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Yeah.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
We didn't really talk about the so-how house,

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
but I did see a tick talk about it saying that they went public

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
and then opened their floodgates so that they got a lot more people there.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
So it became less.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
It's not exclusive.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Yeah.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
If you want that exclusivity,

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
you're going to want to get a referral to the San Vicente

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
bungalows.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
You're going to want to get into the Nickerbacher club.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Marika style.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Billy.

12:42.000 --> 12:51.000
I just hate how much you want to be a part of this club.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
I think you like to be on the podcast.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Billy said, are you recording this week?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Can I be a guest?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
I said I didn't do this.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
I said I was like, I'm doing it on the zoom.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
And you sit there.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Fucking unmarkedly excited.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Unmarkedly.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
He is excited, but you can't tell.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
That's what I'm picking a bone with.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Okay.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
What time are you?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Decorate your apartment.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Enjoy the show.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Jeff got tapped by the Phoenix club, actually.

13:20.000 --> 13:28.000
Have you guys seen these Willy Wonka experience photos?

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Where was that?

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Because I just keep seeing people talk about it, but I don't know what it was.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Where did it come from?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
It seemed like a firefest situation.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
It was an, yeah, you can explain.

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
The creator said, so yeah, there was this failed Willy Wonka pop-up experience.

13:45.000 --> 13:51.000
And the creator of it said, and this is a quote, it all looked good on paper.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
It was advertised as much of AI generated images.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Got made it look really cool.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
But yeah, this is what it was advertised with.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Yeah.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
That's what it was advertised with.

14:03.000 --> 14:10.000
Well, there's also, there's even more images that are so clearly fucked up.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
Like the words aren't correct because it generated them.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
It's really sad that people got tricked by it.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
This is something Cohen would put together.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
What?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Nothing.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
I'm trying to be like topical and act like I go into the office.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
I don't even know who works at the fucking company anymore.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Everybody keeps getting married.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Acting for an org picture of an org chart.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
No one fucking sent it by the way.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I don't even know if we have that.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Right?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
And everybody keeps getting married.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Their maiden names are going to their fucking partners.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
And vice versa.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
And I'm like, oh, new employee.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Just kidding.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
That's Angie.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Yeah.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Angie to Earthland.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
She just has that post-nup drip.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Or post-nup.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
She'll drip.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Yeah, we got it.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Yeah.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Sorry.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Jesus Christ.

15:18.000 --> 15:25.000
I feel like I'm watching a really boring episode of Big Brother or something.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Can I just check in?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
How many mood diary points?

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Have you guys all entered?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Because we're about to hit the halfway point.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
I want to make sure you're on page.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
I have two.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I have two as well.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
I'm here.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I'm not doing that.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
You have to.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Otherwise, I don't dare my fucking computer.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Dude, it's moved.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
You want the diary to be moved along with the point?

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
I mean, I'll remember how I feel, which is how I always feel when I'm doing these.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
It's so much dead air.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
Do we think there's something like a sound effecter?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Can't hear it.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
There's like a sound work thing happening.

16:11.000 --> 16:18.000
This show is sponsored by better help.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
You know, if you had an extra hour in your day,

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
a lot of people would spend that very differently than the one sitting next to them.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Maybe person A would go for a run.

16:31.000 --> 16:39.000
Person B would take a nap and patient zero would read a book.

16:39.000 --> 16:48.000
The point is, a lot of us spend our time and our lives wishing we had more hours in the day.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
And the question is, what is that time for?

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
And if time was unlimited, how would you use it?

16:55.000 --> 17:05.000
The best way to squeeze that special thing into your schedule is to know what's important to you and make it a priority thus.

17:06.000 --> 17:13.000
Therapy can help you find what matters to you so you can do more of it.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
I'm in therapy every week and I benefit from it personally,

17:17.000 --> 17:25.000
as I pursue to better myself and be a better version of myself today than I was yesterday.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
Yesterday, you said tomorrow, so just therapy.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
If you're thinking of starting therapy, give better help a try.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
Finally, online designed to be convenient, flexible and suited to your schedule.

17:38.000 --> 17:44.000

18:04.000 --> 18:22.000
Welcome to March Madness Headgum Company Edition.

18:23.000 --> 18:41.000
This is a bracket customized by my ass to guess who's going to come out on top this March in regards to income.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
What do you mean?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Who's going to come out on top?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I was going to get to that.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
You guys come off and jump down my throat before I got to introduce the segment.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
Headgum Pot Test Edition March Madness Edition.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Is this the entire bracket or just a quarter of it?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
This is just part of it.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Oh my god.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Yeah.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
So whatever.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
The ceiling is alphabetical slash random.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
There's people here that don't work at the company.

19:08.000 --> 19:15.000
There's 1099 because otherwise I wouldn't be able to be in the bracket.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
Like you're a 20 seed.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
It's alphabetical.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
You really think Angie's a nine seed?

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
Of course that's working, anybody.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Yeah.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
We're going to go through.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
We're going to put together our best March Madness bracket together.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
And then in the description of this video, I'm going to link this bracket so that the list

19:37.000 --> 19:43.000
owners can create their own bracket thus, including Billy.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
I'm not going to listen to this when it comes out.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
With the fuck instance.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
I put a bunch of time and energy into this shit.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
You put a lot of time and put the time energy to other shit.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
What are you talking about?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Every time.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Every time.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
The new table or the new place.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
There's no space for a table.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
There's going to be a kitchen island.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
So the living room is completely empty right now.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
You could be on the floor.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I don't have a living room.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
This is my studio apartment.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
I'm moving in two weeks.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Got it.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
This is your old place.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
We're selling the furniture.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Because the new place doesn't have space for a table.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Got it.

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
So you're going from a studio apartment to a house and a new place doesn't have room for the table.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
Because there was a look before for a kitchen table.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
The new place doesn't have a fucking dining room.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
It has a living room, a bedroom and a kitchen.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
That's it.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
And don't say you can put a table in the living room.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
We wanted to have a sitting area.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Yeah.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
You're going to eat.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
You're.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
There's a kitchen counter.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I'm in a similar situation.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
That's a huge mistake.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
That's a huge mistake.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Can we focus on the camera?

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
I'm in this tiny little studio apartment.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Yes, crown molding.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Whatever.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Yes, nice poster.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
But there's no.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
No one said nice poster.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I said nice crown molding that the poster.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
I think the poster is nice.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
I thought.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Yeah, thank you.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
How is it?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
What?

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
It costs more than a cost more than a so-called house membership for a year.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
And that's not a joke.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Oh.

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
And I wish you.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
And I wish it was a joke.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Because I don't have that much money.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
I don't have a tea.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
I just have a couch and a TV because I just want to watch movies in my apartment.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
I have a bed or whatever in the desk.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
But I hate.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
I hate.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
I hate eating here.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
And it's such a thing.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
I do.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Maybe you live in Brooklyn.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
I know.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
What do you?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
What does that mean?

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Go out to eat.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Yes, so you're.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
As you were saying, you're not living in an area that's like walkable.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
So you should definitely have to tell him to go out to eat.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
Go out for every money.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I never said my advice was good.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
I've been trying to fucking get us back into the,

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
the bracket.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
So you don't like table at your new place.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Are you going to have a television?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
We might.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
I have a projector for no table or no TV.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
We've, I have a projector.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
You have a projector.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
You have a projector.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
There's the sound.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
You're there.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Good and here.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
You stopped sharing.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Much madness.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
I've got a magician.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Right?

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Yeah.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
We can get one.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
A sign of fix by the way.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Really?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Yeah.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
You stopped sharing.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
How do you?

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
I'm not going to know who almost anybody on this list is.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Yeah.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
You want a ring based on.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Round one.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
Ring based on productivity.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
And of their things.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
Because Riley's going to be in Fiji for half a year.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
So she loves his room.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Unfair.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
It's more saying.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Holy shit.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
What an upset.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
The one scene taken.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
The shell shim moving.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Really?

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
Have we ever seen a 32 seed advance like that?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
This sucks.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
You have to do that much.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Clicking just to move.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
So in forward.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
It's bracket HQ's website.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
The UX is all over the place.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
I had to create an account twice just to be able to fill out the bracket.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
You shouldn't have.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
All right.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Magic number two.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
I got this.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
John Grim.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Brad.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
The Grim Reaper.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
He'll.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
He's using John's last name as a nickname for Brad.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Do you even know what they do at the company?

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Yeah.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
You're somebody who's.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
It's like every.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
Your entire friend group like watches and ZW basketball.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
You don't, but you're still filling out a bracket.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
So I'll kind of want to hear from here.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
Because it means your love's basketball.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Yeah, but this has nothing to do with basketball.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
It's a bracket challenge.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
That could be any.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
America loves the company.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
America is the kind of.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
I'm not going to put people together.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
I can do it.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
I'm telling you.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Brad.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
The Grim Reaper.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
He'll.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Be.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
I think we go with Billy's.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Picks.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
That's fine.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
I just I also want as we go for people to know who we're voting for.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
They know Brad.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
They don't really know Grim as much.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Grim used to shoot the Jake in the mirror videos.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Now he what produces segments.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
He's yeah.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
He edits our podcast.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Both audio and video.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
So Grim is definitely out.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Yeah.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
I don't know if you've seen segments.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
I don't think so, Grim.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Why?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Looks and sounds great.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Yeah.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
It sounds great.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
And the video frame looks good.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
It's the contents.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
You're actually on this week's episode.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
By the time this comes out.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Really?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Yeah.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
All right.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
This is a must watch ladies and gentlemen.

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
And GDR Glenn versus Narissa Latte.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
Marika, who do you like better personally?

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
That's not what the brackets about.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
But how are there?

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
Another loophole here is that Angie's on paternity leave.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
So it's not going to happen for her.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
I'm sorry.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
This is a huge upset upset.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
But it's going to be Narissa to have.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
Crazy March so far.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
If we're looking at these seeds versus who moved on around one.

25:47.000 --> 25:53.000
But it is single a little.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
Did I make a scene at your wedding?

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Kind of.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Really?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Yeah.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
I've been trying to figure out why you've been cold to me for months.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Yeah.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Half a year.

26:05.000 --> 26:11.000
Because I was not complimentary about the blue suit.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Because I said blue swage shoes was Elvis's idea.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
Well, you ranked my wedding the week it ended.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
And you gave it like a 22 out of 34 or something.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Yeah.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
It's just it was in comparison to Jake's is all.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
You're right.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
Amelia Mariano.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
Versus will con over.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
What are we thinking here in terms of single elimination, right?

26:40.000 --> 26:45.000
Are we taking the over or the Mariano?

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Here's what I'll say about Amelia.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
I don't know anything about her.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
She is the she is a producer and associate producer of dough boys.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
She showed up to our Halloween party dressed as Ronald McDonald.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Yeah.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
And I truly was like, I thought somebody had snuck into the studio.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
But everyone was like cracking up.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Treating her like a close friend.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
Well, I was sort of being iced out in the corner.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
And I thought I'll have my revenge.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
Will con over.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
I stout in the corner.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
Dane Cardi Alvers is Ferris Monchi.

27:23.000 --> 27:28.000
Ferris also not a full-time employee.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
Editor of newcomers.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
The podcast.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
Jeff is on the floor.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
We're never going to get through this.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
Oh, you there. There's more than one round.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
This isn't sad.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
I thought we were just kidding.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
I was like, all right.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Look at the whole thing I saw.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
You guys are working.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
We're working.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
We're working.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
Because she's worried about her work relationships.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
Do you think I've ever heard about that?

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
No.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Dane Cardi Alvers is Ferris Monchi.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
All right.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
Alley con versus Emma earned bird bring.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
This is hard because they're both such hard workers.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
And bird bringers.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
But Ali is also full-time.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Yeah.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
So maybe we go with Ali for this one.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
All right.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Yeah.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Emma.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
This one's tough because I just got worked from Emma.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
That she's going to be out of town for most of me.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Right.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
And I would never do that.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
So I'm trying to figure out.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
This is the March bracket.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Yeah.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
And it's going to be Emma.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
It's hard because I don't like her.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
She's the one seed to basically.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Yeah.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Can you move this work to Brownlee?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Wow.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
This is tough.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Marika.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Okay.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Yes.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
At least.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
And I hear to make her case.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Yeah.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
And that's part of it.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Is she never comes into work.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
Marika's nose to the grindstone.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
You're in your square.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Every fucking day.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
I don't know.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Two very hard workers.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
So it's hard for me to like choose.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
But I guess since Marika's here, we'll give it to her.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
It's a no brainer as I think what you're saying between the two.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
If you had to fire one of them, it would be Katie.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Is that what you're saying?

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
No.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Now here's a tough one.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Me versus pile.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Holy shit.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
How do you.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Okay.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Micah versus Erica.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
What the hell was that?

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
It was so quick.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
You told us.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
It's been four minutes late.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
You forced on yet a step away from what she was working on.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
To set you up to record over Zoom.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Something you did every day for two and a half fucking years.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
What are you talking about?

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
You versus pile.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
Pile built the tech platform that got you ten million.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Dollars and VC funding.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
What do you have?

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Period.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Anticrosation.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I don't have that.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
You know.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Let's go.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Micah.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Because.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
I don't know Erica at all.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Yeah.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
It seems like you're afraid to pronounce your last name for sure.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Jensen.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Yep.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Nailed it.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Micah.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
All right.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Joel versus Ania.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
That's really real.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
It was.

30:10.000 --> 30:17.000
And Ania saved the day before we started recording.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Yeah.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
I think this is Ania's month.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
I might have to put up a fight for Joel.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Just in terms of.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
What honestly, if he had done this, I would have called.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Joel.

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
If Joel was in charge of the studio, he would have painted the walls and off rust.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
A.K.A.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Cole.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
A.K.A.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Joel.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Done off.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
We're going with Ania.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Yeah.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
We're going with Ania.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
On you zero.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
Marty Michael versus Ryan Chambers.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Hmm.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
That's tough.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
Battle of the small talk.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
I got to go with Ryan.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
The small talk.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
He's taller.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
He lives in Montau.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
He's better at small talk.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
Is Ryan the tallest person at Hedgam?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Let's just.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Thanks.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Come on.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Cohen versus Peter MacArthur.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Two Frenchmen.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Well, Peter lives in Peter.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Yeah.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Frank France current.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Correct.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Correct.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Yeah.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Then it's got to go to Peter, right?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
I.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
I think we did at least one a mirror in the second round.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
You're right.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
So why don't you if it Peter up there.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
And then.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
All right.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Yeah.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Oh, that's all right.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
John versus Casey.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
What?

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
You didn't go back and change.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
I don't want to because I feel like pile.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Built the tech platform that you got.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
You got you guys $10 million in VC fund.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
I've heard your case.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Because you have sort of one person's case.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Yeah.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
And I don't have a gum disease, by the way.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
I didn't say gum disease.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
You said you had pariodontic rosatia.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Okay.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Something that could be.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
We cleared.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
With intense pulse light therapy with a child.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Green.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
With a cold.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
Let's just go Casey because I will hear the end of it.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
What's that?

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
I don't think he listens to this.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
What's that?

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
All right.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Sage versus Jake.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
It's got to be sage.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
Sage is like countlessly editing social clips versus Jake is just being social.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
You're there.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Yeah.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
We could have loved it.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
All right.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
This isn't being social.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
It's a great description.

32:40.000 --> 32:45.000
Sam Masa, Nay Shackle versus Alex Burkeman.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
Who's new last name is going to be Shackle.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
What?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Yeah.

32:51.000 --> 32:57.000
Sam Masa, Nay Shackle versus Alex Shackle, Nay Burkeman.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
I got it.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I mean, I love both of these fuckers.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
But I got to go Smasa.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
What?

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
I got to go with my boy Shackle.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
It's going to be.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
It's going to be Nate.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
All right.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Let's go rapid fire this round.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Shim versus Hill.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Billy, what do you got?

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Jim.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Jim.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
Latic versus Will.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
How do you say your last name?

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
I don't know.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Bill.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
Latic.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Oh, it's big.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
It didn't save me.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
I thought maybe we're going to go each of us decide on one.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
I don't know.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
I always comes down to like,

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
I'm not a fucking conductor of this shit.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
You guys have a bunch of.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Latic or Ladak.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
Let's go play that.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Yeah.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Monshiverses Khan.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
But it's got to be.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Yeah.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Moverses, Marika.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Again.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
I'm too quick.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I'm going to be gone in May.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
I feel like I'm leaning.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Brownlee.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
Is she really going to be gone in May?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
It's piled versus Michael.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Come on.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
Let's go Michael.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
We have the march.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Okay.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
We have the march.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
We do not have the madness.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
You're going to have Michael.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
I feel like I could have won the first round.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Definitely not.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Just don't stope up against Michael.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Because at least Jake is so strong.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
You like show up to work and you hide in a corner.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
You hide in the office.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
You close the door, but it's is.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
I don't know.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
And you kind of like peer out and you're like.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
No.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Seeing who walks in.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
You make the guests uncomfortable.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Here we go.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Oniverses Chambers.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
It's going to be on you.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
On you.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
I believe it's my Whoonge is year.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Oh, be honest.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
I think it might be on your zero.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
Becauseiverses Donna Hugh.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Peter McCartney.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
Not my band, it's just such a historical sounding name.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
All right.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
David versus Maasha Neishacle.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
This is Ref.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
I know.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
It's one double.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Half-step stayin.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Billy, you decide.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
All right.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
I'll sage.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
Holy sh.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
I'll say.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Well, all right.

35:06.000 --> 35:16.000
Elite 8 hours. Left. What's that? You said Elite 8 hours? It's like scary hours.

35:16.000 --> 35:26.000
All right. Converse is browning. This one's really tough.

35:26.000 --> 35:32.000
Okay, Marika's going to the final four. Mike, I've already seen you.

35:32.000 --> 35:38.000
Sage versus Peter MacArthur. This one's kind of French.

35:38.000 --> 35:44.000
Anything else? Sage, MacArthur. Let's go Sage.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
Okay, this is the final four. Is a little bit shocking.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
Brownlee, I assumed. Shima was shocked.

35:52.000 --> 35:58.000
Shackle not being there. I was shocked. Sage being there was not what I expected.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
On your kind of sky in the final four zero style.

36:02.000 --> 36:08.000
Flash dark 30. On you versus Sage. What do you guys think?

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
I don't know. Both help me a lot. So it's hard for me. Sage helps me a lot. On your helps me a lot.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
I will say that Sage is really quick with her social clips turn around.

36:16.000 --> 36:22.000
You didn't quite consider shine green. She didn't quite even sample a collage. She kind of just went straight for charcoal.

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
Didn't even sample more than one charcoal, by the way. Just bought the paint. That's crazy.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Let's go Sage.

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
That's crazy.

36:32.000 --> 36:38.000
Shima versus Brownlee. I mean, that's a no brownlee. It's got to be a Marieka, right?

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
No, it's just like now I'm good. Put up against the one person on my team.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
The only person that you're directly at.

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
What are we thinking now that we can really get into the debate?

36:52.000 --> 36:58.000
The hardest worker in March which hasn't happened yet was Marieka or Sage.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Yeah.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
I think I'm going to have to go with Marieka sage advice, Brownlee.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
That's good.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Like we've both won.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
No, it'd be that you were okay with winning over an intern that you hired.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
I want to be sad about what's happening.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Really?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
She's a assistant.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Production assistant.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Assistant to Mrs. Brownlee.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Ms. Brownlee.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
No.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Go.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
Sage.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
She'll be thrilled.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
This can be the clip that she edits.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
The ball is tipped.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
And their sages.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
You followed in a day.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
You're a shooting sage.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
My computer is freezing.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Give me a second, Billy.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
It's on top of the freezer.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
I'm so sorry to Marieka,

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
Amira and me for losing March madness.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
But if you're going to look me in the eye and say Sage didn't deserve that,

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
then I'm sorry.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
But you're an unfit to host.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Host line.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
The headgum podcast.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
What about who edits this?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
The headgum podcast.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Grace Harper, I knew I was forgetting something.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Someone.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Sorry, Grace.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Do you want to increase in there?

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Guys, we've made it to the final segment.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Which is mood diaries.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Let's hear those entries.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Let's start with a mirror.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Let's start with a mirror.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
I don't know what's the writing and anything down.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
I felt my fault that your face is red now.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
On the spot, the teacher called on you and you have nothing.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
I have to take an L slash pass.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
I guess if I mood when you chose pile over me was disappointed,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
offended, angry, scared, mad.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
All right, very good.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Two more moods.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Three to six entry points.

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
The camera angle reminds me of those

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Dude, you're getting a del commercials.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
It's sort of like this.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Top down, sort of like little boy,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Parental POV.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
You're moving within your teeth.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
You're an uncle to bill air.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Yeah, yeah.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
One more.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
One more.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
When the metal, the soundboard worked.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
It hurt my ears so certainly good.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Billy, let's hear that.

39:53.800 --> 39:57.000
Billy, let's hear that mood diary.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
I hopefully had more than three.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
I hope they didn't prepare.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
I actually didn't have four.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
That's pretty cool.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
It's a mood diary of a winter kid.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
So that's what.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Very good.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Four 41 Eastern.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
I don't have to do this Jeff.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
I'd love to hear.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
I would love to hear it.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Four 41 PM Eastern.

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
Fuller slash.

40:25.000 --> 40:29.000
Ha ha ha ha ha.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
I don't know.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Ten minutes later.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
Four 51.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Jeff admitted to not know who works at the office anymore.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
That's true.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
This isn't really a mood I just said fire him.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Ha ha ha ha.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Four 58.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Just sort of.

40:49.000 --> 40:55.880
Amir said that you have a reject or not a projector that made me happy that is a mood not only

40:55.880 --> 41:04.040
that movie is back for you. Yeah, it brought yeah it absolutely did and then um five

41:04.040 --> 41:12.120
13 March madness ends that took almost 20 minutes is what I wrote. Call it a done segment.

41:12.360 --> 41:16.680
Dance. That was pretty.

41:16.680 --> 41:19.080
You've touched out.

41:19.080 --> 41:21.320
Thin but stretched out and said a dance put tight.

41:21.320 --> 41:22.280
Right. Yeah.

41:22.280 --> 41:24.120
Great. Let me see for sure.

41:24.120 --> 41:31.320
Uh, when it took five minutes to explain the mood diary, I felt fatigued and frail um being

41:31.320 --> 41:36.200
you're not for sure. It wasn't just zoom fatigue. You think it was sure. Yeah, it was just

41:36.200 --> 41:41.720
over all fatigue. Um being in the freezer made me feel claustrophobic and also with full

41:41.800 --> 41:46.280
last night, I'm trying to figure out if fatigue was because of what I said. Yeah, like six hours.

41:46.280 --> 41:49.720
That's not that many. So let's chalk it up to lack of sleep.

41:49.720 --> 41:55.560
Okay. Um yeah, so being in the freezer made me feel claustrophobic and also kind of

41:55.560 --> 42:00.840
wistful. That was a mere idea. Yeah, so he gets points for the wistfulness.

42:02.120 --> 42:08.920
When we were only on the third part of the bracket, I felt close to death and maligned

42:09.800 --> 42:14.680
um and when I lost the bracket, I felt vacant but also kind of chuffed.

42:16.040 --> 42:21.560
And then you throwing the lemon. Uh, chuffed like you were supposed to. We're having a gas

42:21.560 --> 42:27.960
a gaff or you were a gas. Yeah, like having a gas, having a gaff.

42:27.960 --> 42:32.280
Okay. So you feel fine about second place. Right, but then you start throwing the

42:32.280 --> 42:36.840
you start throwing the lemon and it made me feel kind of perturbed and sour to be.

42:36.840 --> 42:40.600
I don't have like substitute teacher energy like Robin Williams and uh

42:41.800 --> 42:45.320
fucking dead post society because I'm not guys. This is what you need to know about the world.

42:47.160 --> 42:53.320
He's not that tall. But they're like children. But they stand on the at the desk at the

42:53.320 --> 42:59.240
anniversary. And the shoulder of giants. The posts that came before them and then before them.

43:00.520 --> 43:05.800
Robin Williams started and dead posts aside. Yeah, I want you to have the energy of

43:05.800 --> 43:13.080
Robin. Robin Williams now. That's like you. Carry out the rest of your day. Um, I just

43:13.080 --> 43:16.760
watched speaking of dead posts this idea. Another movie by the same director of witness. Have you

43:16.760 --> 43:23.880
guys seen that? No. No. Awesome. Really, really great. Cool movie. Harrison Ford plays a detective

43:24.440 --> 43:30.120
and there's a little omish boy who witnesses a murder of another detective and then it becomes this

43:30.120 --> 43:35.560
kind of awesome cop thriller where the omish boy like, I don't want to spoil anything but

43:35.640 --> 43:40.280
basically like Harrison Ford has to sort of protect this omish child. Uh, and they sort of teach

43:40.280 --> 43:45.480
each other about the different, uh, the inner different ways of life. It's it's good. It's really good.

43:46.680 --> 43:54.440
It's really something sort of a sixth sense style. Um, in the sense that there's like a boy in

43:54.440 --> 44:00.600
the detective. Yeah. Um, detective. I've never seen this sixth sense because it was just spoiled to me.

44:01.560 --> 44:06.040
Um, or whatever the like if it's a twist or I just knew it. So I just never watched it.

44:06.440 --> 44:12.760
Right. Same. I've seen signs. I also know the end of signs and I haven't said I you want to

44:12.760 --> 44:18.200
watch signs anyway. It's the signs. Good. Yeah. Did you see signs in the theaters in here or was it

44:18.200 --> 44:27.000
more recent? Do you think? I thought it theater. So afterwards, this probably would have

44:27.000 --> 44:30.440
run the same time that the song was popular. Did you kind of come out of the theater and go?

44:31.560 --> 44:39.160
I saw signs and it opened up by movie came out like eight years after the song.

44:42.440 --> 44:43.400
Why'd you stop?

44:48.600 --> 44:55.320
Keep going. Yeah. With the song. I already sang as much as I cared to. It was ill received. I asked

44:55.480 --> 45:00.600
and I don't think that's on. You just met me with silence. Well, the zoom bliped out and I thought all I

45:00.600 --> 45:08.840
heard was stop. Oh, I did. And then I got chest ties for that also right over the calls on a weekly basis.

45:08.840 --> 45:20.280
I am. You're the little Omish boy. And I need to hire a private eye to detect why people hate

45:20.280 --> 45:28.600
what I come up with. Is it that I don't come into the office more? Is that that I'm not a social

45:28.600 --> 45:45.000
as shackle? Is it that I'm staying nay James? Staying nay James. So it is that.

45:45.960 --> 45:55.640
Oh, I can't understand what you're saying. Saying a nay James. And this obvious. Congrats to

45:55.720 --> 45:58.920
it.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.240
That was a hidden gum original.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.320
Danny, who's your bond to the week and look, we'll get you in on this sort of cash deal

06:38.320 --> 06:44.000
if it comes to you, you're about to say. Sleeper pick, uh, Nick Sabin.

06:44.000 --> 06:51.960
Yeah. Who? He's not the Alabama football coach? Yes, exactly. There's no way. I can see a nice

06:51.960 --> 06:57.640
turn to go on instead of like London and like Paris are going to Tuscaloosa Alabama to stop

06:57.640 --> 07:07.720
some international arms dealer. I feel like you could be the villain. Yeah, it's the whole

07:07.720 --> 07:16.880
part of the whole twist, you know. I feel like I, I'm not going to choose anymore, right?

07:16.880 --> 07:22.360
Cause like I, because you're locking in Aaron Taylor Johnson or you think you're already one.

07:22.360 --> 07:26.640
Neither. Well, I, I don't need to choose because I think I've already won. I'm not going to lock

07:26.640 --> 07:32.960
him in. I have a lot of good options on my list that I've already shared. Varika's more confident

07:32.960 --> 07:39.160
in 2023 than I've ever seen anyone ever be. Talk your shit, queen. This is her Jordan

07:39.160 --> 07:44.600
year. He's right. I mean, he's just going to have the flu.

07:46.600 --> 07:51.000
I'm going to be bad pizza and you tell once. I'm going to shut the fuck up.

07:51.000 --> 07:59.800
I'll say Aaron, I'll go air and Taylor Johnson. No, just because I don't know if it's

07:59.800 --> 08:07.240
been said and I feel like I might be the most accurate. Yes, so far. Yeah. Why do you say that?

08:07.240 --> 08:11.400
Cause it might, I think that I read somewhere that they might be narrowing down and it's

08:11.400 --> 08:18.480
to air and Taylor Johnson. Right. Right. So you're, you feel like a good pick per sources.

08:19.240 --> 08:25.400
Interesting. I want to be the last sort of one to guess the correct one before.

08:26.200 --> 08:33.680
Cheat at the deadline. Yes, right at the deadline announcement. Yeah, we just

08:33.680 --> 08:43.120
move on. Madonna considers a price of $130 for their COVID-19 vaccine following the

08:43.120 --> 08:57.680
end of government contracts. My question to you guys is what is a fair price for a

08:57.680 --> 09:06.960
vaccine for COVID-19? What would you all set it at? This is a short take. What's your

09:06.960 --> 09:17.040
advantage? Yeah. No way. Zero dollars. Okay. Fuck everything that's happening in this world.

09:17.040 --> 09:24.480
Okay. That's an interesting take for sure. I'll go 131 prices right rule style.

09:24.480 --> 09:31.680
And I'll talk to you. Yeah. Damn. Damn. Box them out. So I get everything above 130. It's a

09:31.680 --> 09:35.360
tough time to be a Madonna because nobody wants to take their vaccine anymore and now they have

09:35.360 --> 09:40.400
to start charging. It's sort of a double whammy slash edged sword in that way. It's going to be

09:40.400 --> 09:49.200
difficult for them to find paying customers. I think. Same. Yeah. Who's going to pay for? I mean, I guess

09:49.200 --> 09:55.840
insurance will pay for it right soon. Right. That'd be nice. But TBD, I guess. And then I'm here. What

09:55.840 --> 10:04.240
is insurance does cover it? How do you feel then? That's good. And the way it should work. And so.

10:05.520 --> 10:09.440
I'm happy that the process, even in this hypothetical situation is working out.

10:11.440 --> 10:15.440
Big insurance guy. Yeah. I'm a, I'm a big anthem head.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.200
That's a good answer. We should. Okay.

10:22.560 --> 10:29.360
Blue. Blue. I just want to. I just. That's like a.

10:29.360 --> 10:42.560
Yeah. I can't believe you guys. Danny's the only one with any energy today. That's so

10:42.560 --> 10:50.080
rude. Checking his phone. Really? Yeah. It would be here. That's all. I was just on a cross country flight.

10:51.120 --> 10:57.040
Today. Yes. We're all in LA doing this all in LA. And I'm the only one in the studio.

10:57.600 --> 11:04.640
Yeah. Well, yeah. That we should have just came to the studio. Yeah. At the very least, just

11:04.640 --> 11:10.400
like see each other. I didn't want Danny to have to drive all the way across town. I didn't want to

11:10.400 --> 11:16.560
have to do this all in America, IRL. That's almost every night for Santa, but don't cross again. Danny's

11:16.560 --> 11:24.400
exactly. That's my point of him. He is him. He is him. And that's his son. Really is him.

11:26.400 --> 11:33.920
I mean, he's supposed to be a mere talk about what he's saying. I mean, concentrate. Even at each

11:34.000 --> 11:44.880
between, I was him. Yeah. I got me good. It was a crisis and a metal part with moose in my hair.

11:46.240 --> 11:52.480
Being the hands bone too. That was crazy. Moose in my hair.

11:54.720 --> 12:00.240
The night was that too. Sure. Nick. Yeah. You weren't an insult. You were a cell.

12:04.880 --> 12:11.120
Like an amoeba? Like an amoeba. Yeah. Single cell work. And it's in my guess.

12:11.120 --> 12:17.920
Piece of shit. The hell through problem. Trying to have a fun time. You have candles on the back, Jeff.

12:19.520 --> 12:24.320
Yeah. Are you going to have sex? That way you didn't want to come to that. He was very sick. Yeah.

12:24.320 --> 12:31.200
Right now, I feel like you didn't want to come in because he's just my room. He doesn't believe

12:31.280 --> 12:37.520
an overhead lighting. No one should ever use the overhead lights. Can't hear what you just said.

12:37.520 --> 12:43.440
So nobody should ever use the overhead lights. Is that good? Yeah. It was actually.

12:44.080 --> 12:48.960
I feel like you read that once eight years ago. And now it's your life philosophy. But do you ever

12:48.960 --> 12:56.400
like dig into life? No, no, no. Absolutely not. I felt this way from jump. And then I read an

12:56.400 --> 13:05.280
interview with an art architect slash interior designer who fucking confirmed the shit.

13:06.160 --> 13:13.200
He doesn't even build lights into the ceiling when he builds a home. Right? So why should I

13:13.200 --> 13:20.400
excuse me for a second, actually, everyone? Why should I use the overheads? What? And what's the

13:21.040 --> 13:31.040
thing there? What's the joy of floor lamps over? I say floor lamps. I just said lamps.

13:31.040 --> 13:35.200
This feels impractical. It's like maybe the wind lamps, which is, you've got to,

13:35.200 --> 13:39.520
they're telling you either room, it takes you before you can like automate it, but like still.

13:39.520 --> 13:45.200
I'm jumping down my throat when the only person who already hasn't taken this advice is a mirror

13:45.200 --> 13:51.200
seemingly because his overheads, I have to say actually look pretty nice, actually. So you're one

13:52.480 --> 13:59.440
bedrock stance is already not there. It also, you know, starting to waver warmth the light,

13:59.440 --> 14:04.080
like you're not going to put daylight bulbs in your bedroom, you know, it doesn't have to be bright

14:04.080 --> 14:13.120
white for us. It could be soft. It's over. Excuse me, if it's over 2700 Kelvin, I really think you

14:13.760 --> 14:18.640
shouldn't tin you all. And I think if your bathroom is a warm light,

14:20.080 --> 14:31.680
reconsider your life. Yeah, that is strange. Tickens can have 2700 bathrooms can have 2700,

14:31.680 --> 14:40.000
but even that, you kind of want 2100 Kelvin on the day. And I might have to be a lighting designer.

14:43.600 --> 14:52.560
The tasting table asks does Prosecco really cause the worst hangovers? The truth is in the bubbles.

14:58.560 --> 15:05.200
Anything with bubbles will give you a worse hangover. So it's not really Prosecco. It's just anything

15:05.200 --> 15:11.440
with bubbles. I don't believe in any of the bad versus good hangover. I think that's all fake. It's all

15:11.440 --> 15:16.480
out of all its all poisoned. If you drink enough to feel bad, regardless of the shapers,

15:16.480 --> 15:24.640
doesn't matter what liquor size. Why does the bubble affect it? Does that just make your stomach more

15:24.640 --> 15:32.240
upset? The bubble? All hangovers are caused by dehydration, Danny. I don't know if you need that.

15:32.240 --> 15:39.520
I kind of do this. I've never had a hangover. You turn up? No.

15:40.000 --> 15:48.160
She takes those pills that they give you in gas stations. The horserame ultimate grind.

15:50.160 --> 15:57.360
Hardness the power of the rhinoceros and you're everything. I do most of my shopping at the 711.

15:58.320 --> 16:05.440
That's the most of my food. The Worst Regional asks is now a good time to buy a car.

16:05.440 --> 16:18.480
The answer? No. There's no shock there. Right. But I guess I was surprised that that was the

16:18.480 --> 16:24.320
headline. Is it a good time to buy anything right now? Everything is way more expensive than it was

16:25.280 --> 16:31.040
four years ago. Yeah. I'm going to see a movie tonight. It was like $27. I'm like,

16:31.040 --> 16:39.600
okay, sure. Everything that you're saying. The reacts normal. Now it's a vegan or vegan. M3, a Jan.

16:40.960 --> 16:47.760
With who? Don't worry about it. Can I come? Sure. Nice. I thought you don't like horror movies.

16:47.760 --> 16:52.160
I don't. But everyone's saying this movie is good. Maybe I gotta go. Let me know.

16:52.960 --> 16:56.800
I said that about Barbarian. You didn't want to watch that, right? Yeah, that's too scary.

16:56.800 --> 17:01.200
I felt like how scary it may be. You know, she's a dancing doll. Let's find out.

17:05.600 --> 17:11.760
Yeah. Awesome. Come to a Jeff podcasting on his stomach, right now. Yes, because you know he's sort of grinding.

17:11.760 --> 17:19.200
You just, you know, she's just like a six year old. That doesn't quite know what it means. Yeah.

17:19.200 --> 17:25.520
Yeah. It's ankles just come over his shoulder every chocolate. This was his ass picture, but kind of

17:25.520 --> 17:31.360
clothed. What you're like, so we can see your little feet to the left. Yeah. That's just really weird.

17:31.360 --> 17:41.600
This is so funny. So funny ass. Thankles. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I have it, actually. Let me see those feet

17:41.600 --> 17:47.200
again. Just one more time. Yeah. All right. I got it. I got it before you do them before this. I feel like

17:47.200 --> 17:52.240
it was a while. I should have it because the vibe is just different. You have a very

17:52.560 --> 17:58.320
nice vibe right now. The vibe is different. Jeff, he's kind of him right now.

17:58.320 --> 18:04.960
Right. Yeah. You might think about it. The vote is in. The vibe is him.

18:11.360 --> 18:14.960
According to GQ, Austin Butler left his hair a little messy.

18:17.040 --> 18:17.680
For what?

18:18.400 --> 18:24.320
Bed. Like for out this, sir.

18:26.480 --> 18:32.400
Guy in the shorts better get out of the way. Dominatrix coming through to take the mic at a

18:32.400 --> 18:38.240
Fort Lauderdale City Commission meeting. Good evening, council peoples. You may call me

18:38.240 --> 18:43.120
mistress wearing an outfit that everyone kept comparing to death punk.

18:43.600 --> 18:52.640
There was no way not to lose yourself to mistress, so she brought up a contract for solid waste

18:52.640 --> 19:00.560
management that you will spend almost $1 million. Of course, that got compared to Dr. Evil.

19:00.560 --> 19:07.680
$1 million. Mistress proposed they spend a quarter of that million to support

19:07.680 --> 19:14.240
Dominat's sense of missives to build a dungeon. And in that dungeon? I look forward to

19:14.240 --> 19:20.880
spanking each and every single one of you. The commission members were unfazed. There we say

19:20.880 --> 19:28.720
submissive. Dust a club called Cravex Miami where they don't answer. How may I help you?

19:28.720 --> 19:36.960
How may it be? How may you spank me? Some in the fetish community said mistress Crave is giving

19:36.960 --> 19:44.400
them all a bad name. But Crave told CNN, anyone who says that requires firm and forceful

19:44.400 --> 19:51.040
punishment while promoting a club, she did manage to create some spanking new headlines.

19:51.760 --> 19:56.720
Genimos, CNN. You are dismissed. New York. Okay, thank you.

20:00.800 --> 20:06.800
Have we ever figured out if Janine is related to Katie? Will it be crazy?

20:07.920 --> 20:13.680
Is it the same last name? Yeah. Oh, really? Yeah.

20:15.440 --> 20:21.520
But she's saying most. Genimos, CNN. I really want to have her on the show.

20:21.520 --> 20:26.880
Oh, how am I who are you talking about? Sorry. Yes, that was weird, Jeff.

20:26.880 --> 20:30.800
Definitely. I'll still find you some hoardy ask commissioners. Maybe she has a point.

20:32.800 --> 20:36.640
Well, yeah. I wanted to bring this up just to see first of all the check in on Genimos because she's

20:36.720 --> 20:41.040
my favorite reporter. But also to see how you guys would feel about a publicly funded

20:42.560 --> 20:52.640
BDSM dungeon. Sure. Sure. Yeah. I don't know. Like, I don't know what the public funds,

20:52.640 --> 21:02.240
but that feels like infrastructure. Yeah. Parks. Yeah. Compromise a part. Great. Yeah. Sure.

21:02.240 --> 21:09.840
Whatever secretary of the interior of my house. The Koochi Clubhouse. That's really

21:12.080 --> 21:16.640
Yeah, for like a after you solve homelessness, the next priority should be

21:17.200 --> 21:21.520
Spank Koochi's house. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. All right. We do have to take a quick break.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.200
Thanks, my sponsors. Maybe.

21:24.160 --> 21:33.120
Oh, yeah. Guys, lately I've been listening to a lot of Hollywood handbook

21:34.000 --> 21:39.360
apologies that it's not a headgun podcast, but that is my favorite podcast. And it's been great.

21:39.360 --> 21:44.720
And one reason it's been great to listen to is because I use my Raycon wireless earbuds to do it.

21:44.720 --> 21:49.920
Not wearing them right now in this ad read, but I do wear them on my little canyon walks.

21:50.880 --> 21:55.760
Raycon's everyday earbuds look feel and sound better than ever with optimized

21:55.760 --> 22:00.720
gel tips for the perfect interior fit. These earbuds are so comfortable and they will not budge.

22:00.720 --> 22:04.800
All right. Trust me. I've fallen down plenty of hills wearing them. And by the time I reach

22:04.800 --> 22:11.520
the bottom, they're still in there with the perfect fit. Raycon's give you eight hours of play time

22:11.520 --> 22:16.400
and a 32-hour battery life. And Raycon's our price just right, meaning you get quality audio at

22:16.400 --> 22:21.840
half the price of other premium audio brands. It's no wonder why Raycon's everyday earbuds have

22:21.840 --> 22:29.680
over 50,000 five star reviews. One of my favorite features is that you can customize the sound profile.

22:29.680 --> 22:35.040
So you can create a more isolated listening experience or you can allow yourself to hear

22:35.040 --> 22:39.040
your surroundings more. So if you're walking on the street or something like that where you

22:39.040 --> 22:43.680
kind of or you're walking the airport, I was using them yesterday. You can hear more about what's

22:43.680 --> 22:49.520
going around you in addition to getting that high quality sound. So go to buyraycon.com slash

Up cover episode. Uh, welcome back to that goodbye guest. Uh, do you guys see this?

23:10.960 --> 23:16.480
Noma the quote best restaurant in the world is closing its doors.

23:20.480 --> 23:24.560
Didn't see it. Don't know where it is. Where is it? That's going to be in Copenhagen.

23:26.320 --> 23:32.720
Oh, yeah, forgot. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So this place has long been considered the best restaurant in

23:32.720 --> 23:37.680
the world. Not sure what standards, uh, maybe it's because it had a bunch of Michelin stars for

23:37.760 --> 23:46.560
long time or something. But shake shack is too. Oh, yeah. Shut up. No, mother. Shut up. Shut up.

23:48.640 --> 23:54.880
Uh, all right. So I thought I could list out some dishes just to kind of memorialize no

23:55.760 --> 24:05.440
which is again the quote. What was that? Okay. I'm going to sit down.

24:07.520 --> 24:13.360
All right. So I thought that we can list out some dishes. Some of which are from no

24:13.360 --> 24:19.200
ma the quote best restaurant in the world and some of which I just made. Uh, and uh, this is a segment

24:19.200 --> 24:21.200
I like to call.

24:49.760 --> 25:11.760
Oh, yeah, I was going to guess no ma or no. It's exactly right. That is exactly right.

25:12.720 --> 25:19.680
Oh, this is no mar now. So here we go. Grilled reindeer heart on a bed of fresh pine. That's you.

25:23.040 --> 25:31.040
That is real. And that is from no ma. They send your heart grilled reindeer on a bed of fresh pine.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.360
Here we go. Um,

25:35.360 --> 25:46.960
two-veed hen on a bed of lentils and suck attached. What's a lentil? It's like a string bean.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.720
I like that you asked what a lentil is and not suck attached. Or that is an idea of how to

25:53.840 --> 26:00.800
it's a sound of two-veed hen on a bed of lentils and suck attached. I think that's you. That's real.

26:01.760 --> 26:07.120
So that was me. I'm here you were wrong. Here we go. lentils like a bean. Yeah.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.920
Flounder would grilled in the Nordic fashion.

26:11.600 --> 26:18.080
Plounder? Nordic? I think it's called in the Nordic region. Yeah, this is indescribable.

26:18.080 --> 26:23.680
And you did say flounder? Flounder would grilled in the Nordic fashion.

26:25.200 --> 26:29.760
Nordic fashion sounds like something you'd say. So I would say you. I'm going to go with them.

26:31.760 --> 26:35.520
I mean, it was right. That one was me. Here we go, man.

26:36.960 --> 26:42.560
Sapphrong ice cream in a beeswax bowl. Oh my God.

26:43.440 --> 26:48.160
That sounds very white. You're going to suck with them slash him.

26:50.160 --> 26:51.120
Is it?

26:51.920 --> 26:56.640
There you go. Oh, um, I'm going to go no more.

26:57.600 --> 27:03.920
That was no, uh, ultimately that was no, uh, two-year-old aged carrots with duck brain.

27:06.800 --> 27:17.680
No one's making that duck brain. I really want it to be no, uh, so I'm going to be your old carrots.

27:20.480 --> 27:25.200
There's no way. There's no way. I really want it to be

27:27.600 --> 27:28.400
Jeffrey.

27:30.080 --> 27:37.200
It's not really. That's no, uh, yes. I'm looking at this. I'm right now. All right. Here we go.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.760
Cree duck duck brain.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.080
Cream of head of the woods soup.

27:45.920 --> 27:51.440
I mean, sorry. I'm looking up to your old carrot with duck brain. Yeah. Is it pickled?

27:51.440 --> 27:53.360
Like, what is it? I have to assume.

27:55.680 --> 27:57.520
That shit sounds disgusting.

27:57.520 --> 28:00.400
Keep in mind all of this like left in the ground, maybe?

28:01.680 --> 28:06.160
Yeah. Yeah. It's like we've been growing this for two years. I don't pull. How did you even

28:06.160 --> 28:12.160
needed? Oh, my God. The duck brain is served in the beak. That's disgusting. Okay.

28:12.160 --> 28:15.440
This is the number one restaurant in the world. 10 of the woods soup.

28:16.560 --> 28:17.440
That's you.

28:17.600 --> 28:22.400
In of the woods. Correct. That's a kind of mushroom that looks like a flower.

28:23.680 --> 28:26.400
This looks like torture. This is terrible.

28:27.280 --> 28:32.480
Lime brain. Three pancakes with warmed maple syrup.

28:33.840 --> 28:41.120
What was the first word? Lime. Three pancakes with warm up. Okay.

28:42.080 --> 28:45.280
That's kind of good. It might slap a little bit. Yeah.

28:46.320 --> 28:51.920
I'm here. Jeffrey. Correct. That was me. It's just lemon ricotta pancakes.

28:53.920 --> 29:00.160
A single beetle made of fruit leather made by it. No.

29:03.440 --> 29:09.120
That is a real thing that they had unpaid interns doing, making beetles in a wooden box

29:09.120 --> 29:15.280
and serving them out of fruit leather. That's not shy. That is really amazing. Here we go.

29:15.280 --> 29:16.480
Girl cheese foam.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.960
Where's the foam coming to play? Is it the whole thing is foam?

29:25.360 --> 29:29.840
No way. I mean, I'm going to kind of give it away by saying this, but the foam is supposed to taste

29:29.840 --> 29:36.160
like grilled cheese. Oh. It's like that. Yeah. So you know the exact ingredients.

29:36.480 --> 29:43.200
I just saw a photo. I just saw a foam. Oh. Nice.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.640
Little gem salad with rubies instead of lettuce.

29:53.360 --> 30:05.760
Need texture. That's you, man. That was a salad, but with like a pomegranate seeds instead of lettuce.

30:06.560 --> 30:08.160
That's good.

30:14.720 --> 30:21.280
That was no ma or no. All right. He no ma, but it based on some of the dishes they sell.

30:21.280 --> 30:25.760
I feel like it maybe was for the best. Can hear you. Yeah.

30:28.080 --> 30:34.480
Kind of awkward. I said RIP no ma, although based on some of these dishes, maybe it was for the best.

30:35.440 --> 30:39.360
Man I heard you had enough. The first time I just, you did not have to say it.

30:44.080 --> 30:49.200
This is the first episode of 2020, three that were recording. I feel like everybody did

30:49.200 --> 30:54.800
their like ins and outs of 2023. So I just wanted to open the floor here for these last 10 to 15 minutes

30:54.800 --> 31:00.720
for us to talk about our ins and outs. So guys, what's out for 2023?

31:04.960 --> 31:12.560
Jobs. Yeah. Oh, that's interesting. Like a nine to five, the traditional office. Like a room. Yeah.

31:12.560 --> 31:17.360
At least nine to five, scheduling is out for sure. Love that.

31:18.560 --> 31:22.560
Mertica.

31:24.880 --> 31:31.040
For me personally, you're just for everyone in general. You could do transit industries. You.

31:32.000 --> 31:42.000
I'm an assume you didn't answer, and it's still either. So I personally,

31:42.720 --> 31:49.760
I'm going to try a drink less soda. Yeah. That's a good one. Fair.

31:50.960 --> 31:56.880
More of a resolution than a. Yeah. Society. Oh, getting it, but yeah. It's not trying.

31:57.520 --> 32:05.440
There she is. Oh, I couldn't hear what Jeff said. And I went with a person all night. Okay.

32:06.240 --> 32:15.440
That's all right. For me, I'm going to say what's out in 2023 is looking like garbage. I think

32:15.440 --> 32:20.560
every time I step out of the house, I'm going to want to look like I'm wearing an outfit.

32:22.000 --> 32:22.960
Nice. Yeah.

32:23.440 --> 32:26.720
Where do you shop at?

32:28.000 --> 32:36.720
Uh, that's easy. Really. Glasses use clothes or like people make custom shit. It's, it's like second

32:36.720 --> 32:44.240
hand. Glass city reclaimed is a favorite of mine. Bad tourist vintage is its favorite of mine.

32:44.880 --> 32:53.440
Uh, Dad's closet is a favorite of mine. The shit is to, to Dine for.

32:54.720 --> 32:59.520
I said, I went eating. I would spend the amount of money it takes to Dine at no

32:59.520 --> 33:09.520
Ma, rest in peace. On a ha in a. Proud of you. How would you describe your style, Jeff?

33:09.520 --> 33:15.440
Bad and curious. Bad. Yeah. No, I don't know. Like I think it's kind of, you know.

33:19.200 --> 33:23.600
Fated core. Yeah, me, Becky. Mom's sad core.

33:26.560 --> 33:30.880
Yeah, we get still. You have a good little vibe to you. I'm just, I'm just kidding. Not a trick

33:30.880 --> 33:36.720
question. I just wanted to know. I think like shabby chic, maybe. Maybe a little bit of cottage

33:36.720 --> 33:41.760
core creeping in, maybe a little bit of Ivy League Trad to be seen for this year.

33:42.960 --> 33:50.160
You dress like your famous. That's. He dressed like your crisp pine. Yeah.

33:50.160 --> 33:53.040
People are well. What is your own question? Yeah, 100%.

33:54.080 --> 34:04.080
You had to go full mumeo on a boat. I might go see the full mama Fuku. So I might just have like some

34:04.080 --> 34:13.680
ramen in a dingue. Yeah. Get like handlebar. I'm actually. I'm revising mine in for this year.

34:13.680 --> 34:19.680
Is cyber bullying? I think we should bring it back. Except not me. Don't bully me. But like

34:19.680 --> 34:24.480
just in general on the internet. I think people need to be told off a little more. Yeah.

34:24.480 --> 34:33.680
Oh, interesting. Who is cyber bullying? I don't know. I feel like

34:34.480 --> 34:44.160
at some point, people just like airing all of their problems on TikTok are going to look back

34:45.040 --> 34:52.400
and be like, what the fuck was I doing? It's like when you open the photo booth app on your computer

34:53.280 --> 34:57.520
and you see like photos that you took in middle school on your eye mat, and you're like,

34:57.600 --> 35:05.920
there's a photo of me holding a ukulele going like. Yeah. It's like except that, but it's all public.

35:06.960 --> 35:10.320
Yeah. I've been thinking about deleting TikTok. What do you think, Danny?

35:11.920 --> 35:16.320
I've never been big on TikTok and that's probably detrimental to my career because I feel like

35:16.320 --> 35:23.680
all of my peers are popping off TikTok. Yeah. This is not stressful. It's not like fun. It's like

35:23.760 --> 35:28.720
it's too many random people that you don't know. No one's really nasty. It's weird,

35:28.720 --> 35:32.880
reals, and TikTok. It starts to get to the point where it's like, oh, you know, something you

35:32.880 --> 35:39.280
like, then it's like this dog with no eyes. You know, like, it's like, it's like, baby with it.

35:39.280 --> 35:43.120
It's like, it's like weird. Yeah. Like, why does this pimple popper? Then it's like,

35:43.120 --> 35:47.680
I'm going to show you someone I've been popped out. Like, yeah, I was wanting to see

35:47.680 --> 35:53.040
some highlights and like one little pimple popper video than highlights. I don't need to see this

35:53.040 --> 35:58.080
nasty ass shit right before I did eight inches of wax being removed from somebody's ear.

35:58.080 --> 36:04.720
Yeah. I don't who is this for? Let's get a fucking root canal. It's like, dog. This is a lot for

36:04.720 --> 36:10.480
yeah. I think you got to curate. You got to curate the perfect page, but that's too much work.

36:11.200 --> 36:16.880
Right. That is work. How do you curate? You follow? Just searching and scrolling.

36:18.480 --> 36:22.080
That's miserable. Yeah. It's bad. And I don't recommend it.

36:23.200 --> 36:30.160
So it's TikTok out for this year? No, it's still in. I love TikTok too. I think we should also

36:30.720 --> 36:37.600
bully people more. Oh, TikTok. Back to nowhere. Yeah. Oh, it's more pertinent.

36:37.600 --> 36:41.600
Okay. We need a trophies. You know, except don't bully me.

36:44.000 --> 36:51.680
Don't bully me. Just watch. Don't bully me. Just watch. Don't bully me. Just watch.

36:52.640 --> 36:56.640
That's tired. No. That's the theme of Harry.

36:56.640 --> 37:01.760
Harry had done me that day. That was tight. And so he'll start doing it for weeks on it.

37:01.760 --> 37:05.360
That little comment that you made is for you. You can see it in his smile.

37:05.360 --> 37:09.120
So I'm here. He's not even allowed. That's what you're just going to keep going a little bit.

37:10.320 --> 37:16.800
Danny's the angel that was on my shoulder. Your nails would devil. That loser never wants to pass.

37:17.760 --> 37:23.040
You are the devil's asshole. Can't hear you. Good.

37:24.880 --> 37:30.000
Oh, fucking stomachs to you. That's why you can't. His diaphragm's come for us. He can't feel the speed.

37:32.000 --> 37:37.520
His in the way. I never thought I would talk about to a grown-ass man or something for 40 times.

37:38.800 --> 37:44.560
This is insane. Let's, that's a good enough for good ins and outs. You guys have any last

37:44.640 --> 37:49.840
minutes and outs. Things that are maybe in. What's that? We didn't say any ins. Should we do what's in?

37:52.400 --> 37:59.280
Yeah. I think I didn't. I never really, you never really gave me an opportunity to shut

38:00.320 --> 38:05.280
what I thought. It's not an arbiter of taste or otherwise. You're almost 40.

38:06.080 --> 38:12.160
See, you're not an influencer. Well, I got my finger on the pulse of the sort of older skewing

38:12.240 --> 38:17.200
down. No, you have your finger on the pulse of you because you have part palpitations.

38:19.040 --> 38:25.280
Because you're over the goddamn hell man. I was going to, yeah, I was going to say smoothies are kind

38:25.280 --> 38:30.880
of out. Yeah. Yeah, people are not really into like John's. I mean, I was like, I had

38:30.880 --> 38:37.520
John reduced this morning. And I was like, check the real to have it. Well, yeah, that's fucking

38:38.160 --> 38:43.840
check. We should have been on the same flight yesterday. I flew back from the JFK yesterday.

38:43.840 --> 38:49.520
Really? Yeah, I would have loved to sit in the same row as you. Yeah, I love it and fun. I flew this

38:49.520 --> 38:59.040
morning though. That's all right. What else was it? Also, could you, you could have come to

38:59.040 --> 39:07.200
a botry? No, I was in Kingston. And when was that? Classic. Could have driven down with

39:07.200 --> 39:13.760
Dane, you know. You know what else is in? Didn't hear that. Say, what's your show? What else is it?

39:15.360 --> 39:24.720
What else masks podcast live show? What's that? I guess that's in. I would like to do a live show of this

39:25.040 --> 39:31.760
show in Los Angeles this spring. Is that too much to flask? Can we do it somewhere else? San Francisco?

39:32.640 --> 39:38.960
Dane, Ohio. Why not LA? I feel like that would keep it cheap and easy.

39:40.880 --> 39:46.960
I'd love to do like a tour, but I feel like nobody's going to go for that. No, you should do a tour.

39:46.960 --> 39:50.800
Amir doesn't want to do that. When you do things in LA, you're from LA. There's less of the

39:50.800 --> 39:54.960
impulse to get the tickets. And we do like headgum shows in LA. We have to like, we're

39:54.960 --> 40:02.960
comment a fucking Chicago and now it's like an event. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. All right. Portland's part of the

40:02.960 --> 40:13.760
vibe. Portland's a good place. Boston. Danny, what else do you like? I mean, there's some

40:13.760 --> 40:19.600
places and Texas that might be decent. Austin could be tight. I was going to say Austin. I would say Austin.

40:20.880 --> 40:26.800
I mean, Chicago's a great place. I did Chicago a couple years ago, right? Yeah. Not the show though.

40:26.800 --> 40:32.560
What about just personally? Like Danny, what do you like to eat? What do you like to eat?

40:34.000 --> 40:40.880
Yeah, sandwich is dog sandwich. I do like smoothies. I feel offended. I mean, it's smoothie today.

40:41.600 --> 40:46.080
I was going to do it today, actually, too. That's so funny. Yeah, big homemade smoothies, too.

40:46.640 --> 40:52.240
Homemade. I was going to order it, but maybe now I'll do it in my blender. Yeah. It's the 15 dollars.

40:52.240 --> 40:57.920
They're not worth the amount of like the market rate. Oh, smoothies these days is insane. It's crazy.

40:57.920 --> 41:07.680
Yeah. Yeah. All right, putting in your smoothie bananas strawberries a little yogurt sometimes. I'll do a bit of orange juice

41:07.680 --> 41:16.480
or grape juice. Grinola. That's the fucking genius putting oats or granola in there. Yeah, you're grinding the granola or you're adding it.

41:16.480 --> 41:24.560
We have grinded. We both of us are doing it. I think Danny is kind of cool. So I want to be like Danny.

41:25.680 --> 41:31.760
I've never had granola in the pre blended smoothie. What is that? You're not the guy. Like,

41:31.840 --> 41:38.800
there's one the guy on this. The Timothy blend. That's what we call it. Timothy shallow.

41:39.840 --> 41:49.600
The little bit of him in it. I'll sprinkle a little bit of him in it. That's a lot of carbs.

41:50.560 --> 41:56.240
I don't go a fuck, Jeff. It's my smooth dog. You actually want to put it on fucking smooth. You're not putting

41:56.240 --> 42:01.520
any way. I'm just wondering if you put any plant protein. No, you put the you keep the leaves on

42:01.520 --> 42:10.080
the fucking strawberries. That's all I need. I don't need way protein. What the fuck?

42:10.080 --> 42:16.480
I think I am way protein. No, you're a high school bodybuilder. Right. Yeah. I'm not going to

42:16.480 --> 42:22.960
think fucking puberty. But I'm going to ask man. I don't need protein supplements. I would do a

42:22.960 --> 42:30.480
bodybuilding phase in high school where I had a lot of way every day. But it just didn't work.

42:30.560 --> 42:37.280
Like, I did gain muscle from that. I lost. You ever have a creatine phase? I had a creatine

42:37.280 --> 42:47.440
creative phase. So I would house it for energy, put together a tapestry of a bunch of non-sense

42:47.440 --> 42:57.440
and johns. And it didn't end up getting me into any kind of school that was worth a damn. I mean,

42:57.440 --> 43:04.160
I didn't get into, I didn't get into. Did you go to a good ask college? Did you go to USC? That's true.

43:10.160 --> 43:18.160
Rotate the foot so we can see the bone in the light. Yeah. I mean, my god. That looks like

43:18.160 --> 43:23.200
Dalton. When it down, just put the ankles up. That's crazy.

43:23.920 --> 43:28.240
Well, when you guys got, what do you want to point the people to do? This has been a very good episode.

43:28.240 --> 43:37.120
How's it? I thought it was fun. I think they're so fun. We can see it half the time. That's not

43:37.120 --> 43:43.120
there's nothing else I could have done, Brownlee. There's nothing else.

43:45.200 --> 43:51.680
When this comes out, yeah. We'll have done in live show in LA. So, so you can come to that.

43:52.160 --> 43:58.320
What are we going to do to see you? But watch it when it comes out on YouTube later this month.

43:59.040 --> 44:04.720
And we are doing a New York show. But I think it sold out. So,

44:06.560 --> 44:09.360
them's the breaks if you're there and haven't bought a ticket.

44:09.360 --> 44:22.400
And you know, follow me on letterboxed at Marie Gailon. I am funny on there. And I guess they're

44:22.480 --> 44:39.200

44:45.680 --> 44:53.200
Amirna, I'm Black Jake. That's my new AKA. Yeah, yeah, like Black Jesus, but Jake. Exactly.

44:53.200 --> 44:59.760
Well, that's Jesus. I know why. Right, that is, Brown. That's good. Thank you, Merke.

45:00.640 --> 45:06.240
That was a good one. So, yeah, it will be hosting the Hague of Happy Hour in LA. I guess yesterday

45:06.240 --> 45:11.040
whenever this comes out. But come to the next one and we'll never do it at LA in a couple months.

45:11.120 --> 45:17.440
But follow me at follow sellers, follow my merch or get my merch. I'm sorry. I follow sellers.com.

45:22.640 --> 45:31.680
hanging out, telling jokes. Hell yeah, Amirna. Can't hear you. Amirna?

45:31.920 --> 45:41.120
Yeah, I mean, more of the same. You know where to get that content, that sweet, sweet content.

45:43.120 --> 45:47.120
Reels. The year of the Reels. That's what that was really in the Reels.

45:47.920 --> 45:54.240
Definitely. Nine by 16 is what's in the shoe. Hell yeah. I think maybe I'll just plug like

45:54.240 --> 46:00.960
tearing down your following light now. No, I mean, you know, definitely follow Merke on

46:00.960 --> 46:06.640
Letterbox definitely followed any on Instagram and Twitter. But I don't know. Maybe see if there's like any

46:08.160 --> 46:12.560
any mock, any mud, anything that you want to like get that dirt off your shoulder in a way. Like

46:13.440 --> 46:19.920
maybe Amirna's taking him too much space. I'm a problem. It's me.

46:24.640 --> 46:26.240
He's a problem.

46:44.640 --> 46:46.240
That was a hit gum original.

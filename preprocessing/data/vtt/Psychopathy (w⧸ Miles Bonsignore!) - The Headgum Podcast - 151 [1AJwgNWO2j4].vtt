00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head gum original.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
First time as a father on the show, right?

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Yes.

00:42.000 --> 00:49.000
And how does that spark joy to you to have?

00:49.000 --> 00:57.000
I mean, it sparks joy for me to be a daddy, but I don't know that it sparks joy to be to you to me a daddy.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
You're not understanding the question.

01:00.000 --> 01:09.000
How does it spark joy for you to be a father for me to have?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
That's exactly what he answered.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
I think I did answer, and I think you're confused.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
We've got miles bouncing your eye on the fucking show.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
You've got Marieka Brownlee and Amir kind of filling out the rest.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Forget bringing up the rear.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
It's like we need to create an environment or all or otherwise of sort of the air of formality.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
The air of this being a show about the company.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Like what even is this anymore?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
All of the rice?

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Like that says nothing to do with the interworkings of the network.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
It's not like a company happy hour.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I mean, I don't just speak on formality.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
You canceled the show for 10 minutes over Instagram.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
And then I said, no, I'm still down to do it.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I said, I would yesterday.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
And you DMed me the Zoom link, which was really intervening.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
I had to email myself to link to get in.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
But it was on part.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Because I just read through the conversation.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Yeah.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
No, this is going to piss me off.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
No.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Well, maybe well.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
That's a good thing.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Puzzle week.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Uh, today at 135 p.m.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Jeff going to reschedule this record.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Amir.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Whoa.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Something I said.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
This is 135.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
We're recording it too.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
So in 25 minutes we're supposed to record.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
Jeff says, I need to reschedule after we already got an email that said recording is cancelled.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Yeah.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
He says our friend.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
I said, well, like, I wanted to ask why?

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
I'm like, what caused this thing 25 minutes beforehand to just get cancelled?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Not even like rescheduled or pushed.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Like we're canceling.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Yeah.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Because me and Maria and like we're waiting to go.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
I'm granted.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
I was asked yesterday in the middle of a nap.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
I responded.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Yeah.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Jeff says our fourth gas hasn't confirmed.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
And I haven't heard from him.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
And the segments are contingent on him.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
The sea's miles.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Sorry.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
You asked me yesterday.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
No.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
No.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
I asked you like four days ago.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I sent a cow in my yesterday.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
And you didn't confirm.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
So I woke up today.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
And it was like, everything's good.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
We're not that.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
We're fault.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Mild.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Sorry.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Okay.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
I understand that you're worried because I didn't confirm.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
I'm a good Google.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Yeah.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Even though I confirmed to you via text,

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
didn't go.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
So he sent you an email.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
You didn't respond.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
And he's like, okay.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Show's canceled.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Show's canceled.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
I said.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
First I said how the tables turn.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
And I said, I mean, did you text him?

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Which I thought was a stupid question because it's obvious.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Texted him.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Like, he's not responsive.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
And that's why we're canceling.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
No.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Mariko is right to ask.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Because Jeff didn't back enough.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Mild.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Did respond to an email.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Show episode cancer.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
I got to continue.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
And I said, I would check in for his.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
What if he just didn't accept the invite by accident?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Of course.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
Following string of texts from Jeff comes in in the span of a.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Let's see.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
One minute period.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
What?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Copy.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Good point.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Here we go.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
He confirmed.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Never mind.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
We are good to go.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Sorry.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Hello.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
So he did confirm the email after all.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Like, that whole thing wasn't necessary.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
He didn't confirm.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
No, you didn't.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
I just didn't.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Mild to see if he was still good.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
And I responded immediately.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
And he said, yeah, of course.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Like, why wouldn't I be?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Which is funny.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Because like, all of the sudden, you're being very organized about the calendar invite.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
Which is like, impressive to me because the last several times we've conferred.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
It's sort of been just, you know, the wild west of this issue.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Yeah.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
But now that I didn't confirm the email, cancel the record.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Like, if Mariko is going to say text them.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
We just wouldn't record it.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
And then I do want to say that was going to the end of the big thing.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
And Mariko was like, I might be five minutes late now.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
I said, it's at 230 EST, right?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
And Jeff said it was at 2 p.m.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
And I screenshot it.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
The canceled invite that says 230 to 330 p.m.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
That was an issue of me kind of clicking on the calendar.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Making a time block and being like, that's 11 a.m.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Yeah.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
And it was when there was 11 30.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Yeah.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Is that a 30 added value?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Yeah.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Is that a value to the 11.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Not only 11 11 11 30.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Yeah.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Exactly right.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Because actually being later is more wisdom.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Right.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
But then I said, we're 11.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Third, you're like, no, actually has closed 11,

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
8k to eastern is possible.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
So not only were you going off of miles,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
not responding to the calendar invited at all,

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
but the calendar invited was wrong.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
And you can go off of the period.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
And then continue the transcript.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Oh.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Because I have an excuse.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yes.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Right.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Mercury is in retroically.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Yeah.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Starting today.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Starting today.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
So that's actually really.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
It doesn't really matter.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Because you did send all the invites yesterday.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Not today.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Yeah.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Sure.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Doesn't matter.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Really?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Perfect.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Not decision to cancel the record.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
Like I said, most of the episode is contingent on miles.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
All right.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
So reach out and be like, are you still down?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Because he did text and say he was.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
And then he didn't respond to a calendar in the bite,

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
which looks like spam.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
And then you're like, all right.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Cancel.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
It's not happening.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Sorry.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
There was a warning on the email.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Yeah.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Said something along the lines of like,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
first and isn't like, don't trust this.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Right.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
It's a virus.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Yeah.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm a viral man.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Yes.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
You issue is.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I've only gone viral in terms of load.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
In terms of like, having COVID three times.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
In terms of like, souring people's day.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I haven't gone viral by the way of like,

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Internet sensational.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Damn.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
I thought you had to take to act the popped off.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
So my reason.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
I, not even.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I had a TikTok that you saw,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
which is like, you follow me.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
So it's not even like, it's not that viral.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
It's one healthy going viral.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
I can help you.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
I, I, well,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
you know, I haven't done anything worth it.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I would say all of the rice should go viral.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
We should.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
We can clip.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
TikTok that out.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Yeah.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
I mean, the the other one went.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Delia.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
I know.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Sage doesn't.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
I'm sorry to sage.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
But she didn't know when to clip things out

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
unless told.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
And I feel like she should have a sort of sixth sense about this.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
It feels so internal.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
It was never supposed to be the internal workings of the network.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Really.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Also, Sage has done a great job for our podcast and the podcast.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
No, and I agree.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Yeah.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Ultimately, I agree.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
I'm just trying to start some beef to try and get her on the show.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Because she deserves it.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
And spar.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
With you.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
That you will see spar.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Um.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Let's talk about the most important thing.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Let's say at the same time.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Three, two, one.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
You can't do the job for no reason.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Fatherhood.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Yeah.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
Miles, you're significantly younger than a mere.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Like you're still in your prime.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
He's over the hill.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Yeah.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
I'm 29.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I believe I'm here is 40.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Yeah.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
40.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
40.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
The big 40.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Yeah.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
How does it feel to not only be doing better than him career wise,

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
but also personally.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
So like you have a wife and an and a kid.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
He only has a wife.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
He's not even in a TV.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Yeah.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
He's ending his podcast.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Exactly.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Rice.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Yeah.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
You're decade.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Literally.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Behind and younger than me.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
You'll have lived me by 10 years.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
On average.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Maybe even more.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Yeah.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
I mean, good although recently I was talking to a mirror and he said, I have so much

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
free time.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
I'm just trying to fill the day.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
And I thought that that was kind of cool.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Is that true, man?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
On a perfect person pod.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
We were sort of talking about what my typical day is.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
And how sometimes I do find myself like at four or five six.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah.

09:48.000 --> 09:56.000
I'm wondering, like, okay, now what I've sort of done what I need to do and without like a family and without like a typical nine to six.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
I struggle to fill my.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Afternoons into evenings.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Not knowing exactly what to do.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
You should start filling your holes.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
Just in terms of like you said, you have you struggled to fill your time, but maybe you

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
should start struggling to fill your holes.

10:14.000 --> 10:21.000
It's like a normal training sizing up the gauge of the plugs and just see how far you

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
could get plugs.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Yeah.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
But miles, let's get back to the, you know, again, the most important thing which is father

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
it.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Definitely quickly.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
I'm sorry, but I do want to say to mirror, it feels like you just need other hobbies.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Yeah.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
My hobby is watching basketball, which right now takes a lot of time because there's the playoffs.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
I don't come July.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
I'll be like, oh, I don't like baseball and that's pretty much it.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
I don't really watch a lot of television or movies either.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
So I need to find a way to fill my six to make what about cooking.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
I feel like you'd be good at like cooking.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Yeah.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Yeah.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
I mean, y'all.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
I've gotten a little bit better during the pandemic for sure, but I haven't like really stretched my limits.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
I'm not making like too much complicated things.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
Baking slash cast iron skilleting meat, putting vegetables, either in that pan or in the oven.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Yeah.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I got to sort of kick that up a notch.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
What about I guess seems hard?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
You should get good at just baking.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Like a flan.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Oh, flan is not really telling you big, isn't it?

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Well, if you want to make it in the best fashion, right?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Right.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Yeah.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Yeah.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
I was going to say like cookies just sort of easy.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Right.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Yes.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
I've been layer bar.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Maybe I love.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
I love cookies, but I don't want to have like the problem with baking is like you have so many of them around.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
And then you're just eating them all yourself.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
It's it's a little one.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
It's a little one.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Infected full.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Bring them in the office.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Yeah.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
It'll be nice.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
I do.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
I mean, yeah.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
I'm sort of a cook.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
I made a steak and eggs the other day and that was kind of good.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Steak and eggs is not a good meal.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
I would say.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Really?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
I think it's good.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
It's too much animal.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Really?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Wow.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Same more.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Okay.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
How do you cook both the steak and the eggs?

12:21.000 --> 12:28.000
Well, I've been freezing meats for a while because my mother not cooking.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
So it gets to cook.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
That's the opposite.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Yeah.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
She took us to Costco and she said we're really good steaks there.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
So we she kind of bought us a bunch of steaks.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
I sliced them all up.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Put them in the freezer.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
And six and a half months later.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
I mean, it's taken eggs.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
And it also freeze the eggs.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
The eggs are of course frozen.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
It's an egg custard cold.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Yeah.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
A savory egg custard.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
A savory egg ice.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
Like a like a like a like a slurpy.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Like a Luigi's Italian.

13:04.000 --> 13:11.000
That's in the plastic cup.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Yeah.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Yeah.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
You've said nothing of fatherhood other than.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Well, I don't know.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Yeah.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
You haven't asked me anything of substance.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
But I'm a dad and you find yourself sighing when you sit down.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Is that fair to ask?

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
I very tired obviously because why is that obvious?

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
Because the baby.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Okay.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
So he sort of has trouble sleeping.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Listen, you know, do you want some unsolicited advice?

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
You want to let me finish?

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
Some like every lover I've ever had.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Didn't you?

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
Oh, yeah.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
But yeah, no.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
It's really good.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
He's really chunky and cute.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
He's been learning to laugh recently, which is good.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
We're sort of running a little circus here doing anything we can to sort of sing a song.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
That's going to make him laugh or shake a toy at him.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
And he thinks that's funny.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Yeah.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
But it's going good.

14:14.000 --> 14:21.000
I think we're sort of slowly lifting from the fog that is the first couple months.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
Jeff, you aren't paying attention.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
This was the segment you plant.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Yeah.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Well, that's how it happens so fast.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Yeah.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
I think he's editing it.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Well, is that it was for the editor?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I don't know.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
We're only 14 minutes into this.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
So we wouldn't be ready for an ad break.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Great question.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
I guess.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
I mean, it was sort of podcast.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Yeah, it's in the zone.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
But I was also sort of joking.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
He was kind of giving around.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Have you named the guy yet?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Of course.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Yeah.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Why is that of course happens instantly?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I didn't get my name till I was nine.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
What do they call you?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
What do they call you?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
A lot.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Untitled.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I don't know.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I'm entitled Liz James Project.

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
We have named him.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
You ready for the name?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Yep.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Jeff, free, Marika, a mirror.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Not sponsor your.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Blumen league.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Oh my god.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Blumen league.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
You're named him after an app you wanted to design.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Blumen league.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Yeah.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Lower app.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Or you take a picture.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
It's like he was only bouncing your.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
No, his name is Julian.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
And right now we call him Baby JJ.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Baby JJ.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Baby JJ.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Do you say, hey, you're to him?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Because of Julian.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Let it.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
We don't.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
But we faster.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
We respond faster for the pacing of the show, right?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
You kind of took a.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Oh.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Yeah.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
Sorry.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
John Melaney's new Netflix comedy special.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
It's called Baby JJ.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
It doesn't matter.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Because he's on that day.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
No, because his whole thing is the same stick over and over again.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Right?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Like you have to reinvent yourself.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
Like all of the rights that took a whole reinvention personally.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
I had to go.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
I was not going to.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I think it's like going to rehab.

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
And then having a child isn't reinventing himself enough.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
I guess we should have gotten him then for the fatherhood thing.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Because then it could have been miles and landing.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I mean, that'd be huge for me.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
I could go.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
But I will say.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
When Sarah was pregnant to amp myself up for parenthood.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
I would sometimes look at Olivia Monson's Instagram.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Why?

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Yeah, I'd love.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
I'd love a little more.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
She's a mother.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Because she's a mother.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
And she would have pictures of John Melaney.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Because John Melaney is too cool to kind of post.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
Like parenting photos, but Olivia Monson's post.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
And it's like them watching Bosch.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
And that was cool.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
I was like, they're cool people who are parents.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
And I want to be that.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
I don't want to be like somebody who's just like a parent.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
And that's kind of the thing.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Yeah.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
On that subject.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
On that subject.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I had a question.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
It's a little mean.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
My god.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
You're so mean to me.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Yeah.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
You're so great.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
What is Jennifer Coolidge say to that?

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Forch and telly?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Oh yeah.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
I'll be told this the other day.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
There's snow.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Negative.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I'm not good about it.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
I'm used to this.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
You're so naked.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I'll put it in right here.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Okay.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
No.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Do you want someone's lucid parenting advice miles?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
And I know I'm not a new.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
No.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
I know I'm not a parent.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
And that is a parent.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
But I just want to.

17:52.000 --> 18:00.000
Sometimes it's like good to get that like new perspective, right?

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Just like in relationships, right?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
In relationships.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
You don't want to meet the other person.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
But you should deeply want the other person.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
That's where romance comes in.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
That's where codependence is impossible, right?

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
So I'm just fearing because it sounds like you've been spending a lot of the time.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Maybe most of your time with a little soccer.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Yeah.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
That maybe you should foster your other hobbies.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
Maybe you should go out to the club.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Have a table.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Have some bottles.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
And let him do his thing.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
Just so that he's not dependent on you.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Does that make sense?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Well, I like where this is headed.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
Because I do think it's important to have a sense of identity.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Outside of your relationship outside of your child.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Exactly, right.

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
But I think the part that it's curious to me is that are you going to the club.

18:50.000 --> 18:57.000
And getting bottles and grinding and working and having that experience.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Because that does not seem appealing to me.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
I don't do that.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
No, that's not fun to me.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
What would be fun to you going to sort of a local hotspot.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
And just a dinner would be good.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
Yeah, dinner oysters with an agrony and maybe like steak freets with some friends.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Honestly, though, does sound really good.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
I just got excited.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Yeah.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Right up my alley and agronies my favorite drink.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Oh, yeah.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Yeah.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
My favorite soup.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
And steak freets is basically steak at eggs.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
But, you know, minus one.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
I.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Yeah.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Yeah.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
I, when I, I just, I love, you know, it's nice to do a dinner with like eight friends.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
And you're all cracking up.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
You're getting a little tipsy.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
But you get to get you're in bed by midnight.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Oh, my God.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
Waking it absolutely jack in it.

19:46.000 --> 19:52.000
What kind of search terms are you up to?

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
Miles Bunsen, your A feet.

19:58.000 --> 20:07.000
Oh.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Guys, this show is sponsored by Better Help.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Getting to know yourself, guys, can be a lifelong process.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Especially because we're always growing and changing, right?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
I'm not the same person I was a year ago.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Hell, I'm not even the same person I was yesterday.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
All right, I've changed my entire personality for the better.

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
And that's because therapy is about deepening yourself awareness and understanding of yourself.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Because sometimes we don't know what we want, right?

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Or why we react the way we do until we talk things through.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
And that's where Better Help can come in because Better Help connects you with a license therapist

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
who can take you on that journey of self discovery from wherever you are.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
I'm in therapy every week.

20:44.000 --> 20:50.000
I have my session tomorrow around this time that I'm recording this, uh, when the time you guys are hearing

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
this, I've already had this session, right?

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
As I'm recording this now, I'm about a week passed my last session.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
That's why I look really dry and bad.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
It has a really positive impact on my life.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
Of course, it helps me become the best version of myself.

21:08.000 --> 21:14.000
And it helps me deal with things as they come up along that journey of self discovery.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
Because the more you know about yourself, the more you learn about yourself through therapy,

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
the better you can show up for those around you as the best version of yourself.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
So if you're thinking of starting therapy, give Better Help a try.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
It's entirely online designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Thanks Better Help.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
I have to put new batteries in my system.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
So use it or lose it, I guess.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
No, no wallpower at all.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
He'll never know.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
All right, let's do it.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Just a little curious.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Let's do that.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Use your speed power on this device.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
All right, by a wall, definitely.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Early.

22:11.000 --> 22:19.000
On to the week, who do you guys got?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Sadie Sink.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
Isn't she awful in the whale?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Are you fucking dumb?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Sorry.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
That's he was great in the whale, and she's great in Stranger Thing.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
And I think that she's going to be the next part.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I think she's going to be huge.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
Now that she's has, you know,

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
well, what's his name on her side?

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Who?

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Randon.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
You think you think anytime that someone

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
would like start it, maybe someone else.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
They're like on their side.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I kind of think that yeah, they're a team up.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
Like a celebrity team up when Loki sort of did.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Thor.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Jeff, you hear?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Sipping from a cup.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
And I'm just a little curious about it.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
So what time do you went to blue bottle?

23:11.000 --> 23:20.000
And you sort of got what this morning before returning to your girlfriend's home to record this.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Right.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
A cold brew bright blend.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
16 ounce.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
And it wasn't.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I didn't walk to blue bottle.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
It was in the fridge from a previous time.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Oh, what?

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
No, it's good.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
They old cold brew in a paper cup.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
Oh, Bruce, like, why, man?

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
Yeah, it would erode paper.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Really?

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Yeah.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
My bond of the week is Sandy.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Success.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Sandy from Succession.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Bruce.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
I watch the show.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
I can't think.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
I mean, maybe a Larry.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Pime.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
He tried to stage the hostile takeover in season two.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Right.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Right.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Pime.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
What?

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I think he'd be kind of interested.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
Sandy is the old guy.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Yes.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Yeah.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Maria.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Like, let's keep shit going.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Let's not let him ears fuck up.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Change the pace.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Yeah.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Yeah.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
I guess mine's going to be.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
And that same vein.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Um.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Sorry.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Amir's doing some sort of performance.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Yeah.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Where there's lights right now.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
It's a little striped.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Yeah.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Shadow.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Shadow puppets.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Yeah.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Actually, you know, I'm going to change it.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
My bond of the week is going to be the shadow puppet.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
It's a mirrored justice.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
It's good.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
It's time to get in here.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
You don't mess.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Okay.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Let's move on.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Twitter verification went the way of Rosam and Pike.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
It's gone, girl.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Yeah.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Yep.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
We loved.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Yeah.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
Do we comment on that like, do we give?

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
Is that our opportunity to sort of chime in or is that our opportunity to give notes?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Either, I think.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Yeah.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Either, I guess.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Yeah.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Ideally, praise.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
But yeah.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
To me, like, Rosam and Pike is not viral.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
You talked about going viral.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
Rosam and Pike is not going viral right now.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
And I kind of think that it's a dated reference for something that just happened.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Yeah.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Yeah.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
I think that's a good note.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Um.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
It could be like, you know, it's going like, like, it would turn times in nighttime.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
It could be like.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Addison rays of sun.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Yeah.

26:07.000 --> 26:17.000
It could be like, um.

26:17.000 --> 26:24.000
It could be like the stanky leg.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Yeah.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Do the stanky leg.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
That's a little more recent.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
I don't think it is.

26:33.000 --> 26:38.000
Are you guys going to pay for Twitter verification?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
No, because I think I'd be shamed for it.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Yeah.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
It's now sort of a scarlet letter, a badge of dishonor.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Sure.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
It's been eight dollars a month.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
Cause I would say me and Riley's Patreon, which is still going.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Yeah.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Yes.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
That smiles was Patreon.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
That's right.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
You could pop in there.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Perfect person premium.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Perfect person platinum.

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
You could also probably pay for like Hulu with ads, which I just kind of think is a bit of a service.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
But um, I think it's probably worth the $7.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
Go further back from your camera.

27:15.000 --> 27:15.500
Yeah.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.500
I didn't like that at all.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.500
That's so much better.

27:19.500 --> 27:22.500
This is just a funny headline.

27:22.500 --> 27:25.500
The Starship Rocket exploded.

27:25.500 --> 27:28.500
So why did SpaceX cheer?

27:28.500 --> 27:31.500
Did they?

27:31.500 --> 27:34.500
I didn't read the article.

27:34.500 --> 27:37.500
I will say that one of my favorite things is

27:37.500 --> 27:39.500
that Andrew Pile,

27:39.500 --> 27:43.500
our CTO often posts video footage of

27:43.500 --> 27:45.500
rocket launches and like,

27:45.500 --> 27:47.500
is excited in our Slack.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.500
He's like the biggest rocket ever is about

27:49.500 --> 27:50.500
to launch.

27:50.500 --> 27:51.500
And he did that with this one.

27:51.500 --> 27:54.500
And then 15 minutes later said,

27:54.500 --> 27:55.500
it blew up.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.500
Wow.

27:57.500 --> 28:00.500
And that's really just how I get my rocket news.

28:00.500 --> 28:04.500
For the day,

28:04.500 --> 28:07.500
where do the goddamn days pack?

28:07.500 --> 28:09.500
What was it?

28:09.500 --> 28:12.500
I, I definitely said that before.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.500
I didn't hear it.

28:14.500 --> 28:15.500
And not at the right time.

28:15.500 --> 28:16.500
Not at the right time.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.500
We're at my ears.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.500
We're ready to hear the eye word.

28:20.500 --> 28:22.500
Uh-huh.

28:32.500 --> 28:33.500
All right.

28:33.500 --> 28:34.500
Here we go.

28:34.500 --> 28:38.500
I recently found IDR labs.

28:38.500 --> 28:39.500
Right?

28:39.500 --> 28:41.500
Which is individual differences

28:41.500 --> 28:43.500
research.

28:43.500 --> 28:47.500
And they have various tests.

28:47.500 --> 28:50.500
Uh, they have this drama test,

28:50.500 --> 28:53.500
which is about how we all play victim rescue

28:53.500 --> 28:56.500
or a persecutor in regard to human drama.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.500
And then there's like marines test,

28:58.500 --> 28:59.500
which is like,

28:59.500 --> 29:02.500
could you figure shit out in the marines?

29:02.500 --> 29:03.500
There's also the anger test,

29:03.500 --> 29:06.500
which I think would be good for Marika.

29:06.500 --> 29:08.500
So,

29:09.500 --> 29:10.500
yeah.

29:10.500 --> 29:11.500
Okay.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.500
It's loud about.

29:12.500 --> 29:13.500
Uh,

29:13.500 --> 29:15.500
which it's just going to match your personality with a winning

29:15.500 --> 29:16.500
to poo character,

29:16.500 --> 29:18.500
which is a borrel and Buzzfeed article.

29:18.500 --> 29:22.500
I want to y'all to pick out one of these,

29:22.500 --> 29:23.500
and we'll just do it.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.500
And then the right question.

29:24.500 --> 29:25.500
I have a question first.

29:25.500 --> 29:26.500
Are you?

29:26.500 --> 29:28.500
Do you have IMDB Pro bookmark?

29:28.500 --> 29:30.500
Because you're sort of seeing if your credits have updated?

29:30.500 --> 29:32.500
Or is it?

29:32.500 --> 29:36.500
Are you just going their cart blanche to kind of see who is who is he?

29:36.500 --> 29:37.500
I like to keep up with the star meter.

29:37.500 --> 29:40.500
I like to see who's the most famous people in Hollywood.

29:40.500 --> 29:41.500
Mm-hmm.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.500
And yeah, you made a Rosemann Pike rep.

29:43.500 --> 29:47.500
What I like to keep up with between 50,000 and 100,000.

29:47.500 --> 29:52.500
You should try to keep it a hunted.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.500
That's really funny.

29:54.500 --> 29:55.500
No, it's not.

29:55.500 --> 29:56.500
Because it doesn't mean anything.

29:56.500 --> 29:57.500
Like, what did you mean, Amir?

29:57.500 --> 29:58.500
I love it.

29:58.500 --> 30:02.500
Like, you said you like to keep it between 50,000 and 100,000.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.500
And I was like, you should try to keep it a hunted.

30:04.500 --> 30:05.500
So it was like joke.

30:05.500 --> 30:06.500
Yeah.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.500
Yeah.

30:07.500 --> 30:08.500
Keep it a bean.

30:08.500 --> 30:14.500
Um, let's, let's, let's, let's do this shit.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.500
What are you going to do?

30:16.500 --> 30:17.500
I guess the Nazi one.

30:17.500 --> 30:18.500
Let's do the Nazi one.

30:18.500 --> 30:19.500
Let's not do that.

30:19.500 --> 30:20.500
Let's not do that.

30:20.500 --> 30:21.500
Let's not do that.

30:21.500 --> 30:22.500
Let's do this.

30:22.500 --> 30:26.500
Should we do the, um, I feel you scrolled by a bunch of good.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.500
Well, it will you do the South Park test.

30:27.500 --> 30:28.500
Uh, that's funny.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.500
How big of a beef cake are you?

30:30.500 --> 30:31.500
That's not funny.

30:31.500 --> 30:34.500
We are wondering the psychopath test.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.500
Well, that's kind of cool.

30:35.500 --> 30:39.500
Um, sort of uncovered what Jeff's kind of interworking is.

30:39.500 --> 30:40.500
That's cool.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.500
Okay.

30:41.500 --> 30:42.500
That's a good way.

30:42.500 --> 30:45.500
We, you couldn't do this episode without miles, but it seems like pretty generic.

30:45.500 --> 30:46.500
But all right.

30:46.500 --> 30:47.500
Let's see.

30:47.500 --> 30:48.500
Yeah.

30:48.500 --> 30:49.500
I'm a little confused about that.

30:49.500 --> 30:50.500
Parents test right at the top.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.500
Yeah.

30:51.500 --> 30:52.500
That's why you went to this.

30:52.500 --> 30:53.500
Yeah.

30:53.500 --> 30:54.500
I.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.500
Okay.

30:55.500 --> 30:56.500
Here.

30:56.500 --> 30:57.500
Why don't you guys do this for me?

30:57.500 --> 30:58.500
Okay.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.500
I want to assess someone I know.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.500
Yeah.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.500
Personal is a grandiose sense of self worth.

31:04.500 --> 31:05.500
I mean, yeah.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.500
Yeah.

31:06.500 --> 31:07.500
Yeah.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.500
I think that's pretty well.

31:09.500 --> 31:12.500
I think the IMDV pro on the bookmark tab sort of.

31:12.500 --> 31:13.500
Yeah.

31:13.500 --> 31:14.500
Answers that.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.500
Right.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.500
Easier.

31:16.500 --> 31:17.500
Unconstrained.

31:17.500 --> 31:21.500
So I feel like those are kind of opposite things to me.

31:21.500 --> 31:22.500
But yeah.

31:22.500 --> 31:26.500
He's not like he's very like purposeful and like trying to do stuff.

31:26.500 --> 31:28.500
So it doesn't seem like easy.

31:28.500 --> 31:29.500
It seems like he's like sort of.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.500
But unkindly trained.

31:31.500 --> 31:32.500
Just watching it.

31:32.500 --> 31:37.500
That unconstrained feels like he makes plans and then drops them.

31:37.500 --> 31:38.500
Right.

31:38.500 --> 31:39.500
Which one is the?

31:39.500 --> 31:40.500
Which one is bad?

31:40.500 --> 31:42.500
Should we just not apply or apply for it?

31:42.500 --> 31:46.500
Well, I basically want to be like he's not easy or unconstrained.

31:46.500 --> 31:47.500
It does not apply.

31:47.500 --> 31:48.500
I think.

31:48.500 --> 31:49.500
Yeah.

31:49.500 --> 31:50.500
This is so fucked up.

31:50.500 --> 31:51.500
Pathological liar.

31:51.500 --> 31:53.500
I mean, he did cancel the show and he said that he texted me and stuff.

31:53.500 --> 31:54.500
Yeah.

31:54.500 --> 31:55.500
I didn't say that I texted you.

31:55.500 --> 31:56.500
I said I hadn't texted you.

31:56.500 --> 31:57.500
I was honest.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.500
Smart about it.

31:59.500 --> 32:00.500
Yeah.

32:00.500 --> 32:03.500
I'd say it does not apply.

32:03.500 --> 32:04.500
Yeah.

32:04.500 --> 32:05.500
I think logically.

32:05.500 --> 32:06.500
Yeah.

32:10.500 --> 32:11.500
It's personal.

32:11.500 --> 32:12.500
It's like a parasite on other.

32:12.500 --> 32:13.500
Really.

32:13.500 --> 32:14.500
They never pay back.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.500
Sandically splitting others for favors.

32:16.500 --> 32:17.500
I mean, I would say.

32:17.500 --> 32:18.500
Yeah.

32:18.500 --> 32:19.500
Yeah.

32:19.500 --> 32:21.500
He does sort of do social mind games.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.500
So you think I'm like a cancer.

32:23.500 --> 32:24.500
Yeah.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.500
I'm not a cancer.

32:25.500 --> 32:26.500
No.

32:26.500 --> 32:27.500
I'm a parasite.

32:27.500 --> 32:28.500
You're right enough.

32:28.500 --> 32:29.500
Yeah.

32:29.500 --> 32:30.500
A leech.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.500
She's here.

32:31.500 --> 32:32.500
Yeah.

32:32.500 --> 32:36.500
This person has poor behavioral controls and finds it hard to keep their impulses and check.

32:36.500 --> 32:37.500
I mean, that feels so bad.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.500
I say a place partially.

32:39.500 --> 32:40.500
Yeah.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.500
All right.

32:41.500 --> 32:43.500
I'd say this does not apply.

32:43.500 --> 32:44.500
All right.

32:44.500 --> 32:49.500
This person has a history juvenile juvenile of the league with the and or crime.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.500
Have you ever been arrested?

32:51.500 --> 32:55.500
Uh, I got a ticket for drinking in public and Williamsburg.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.500
Let's go.

32:57.500 --> 32:58.500
Let's see.

32:58.500 --> 32:59.500
I'm part of it.

32:59.500 --> 33:08.500
The person has had many serious romantic relationships that have fallen apart after a short time.

33:08.500 --> 33:10.500
I don't know if you guys know me well enough to answer this question.

33:10.500 --> 33:11.500
Yeah.

33:11.500 --> 33:12.500
What's the answer here?

33:12.500 --> 33:13.500
Um, no.

33:13.500 --> 33:14.500
Yeah.

33:14.500 --> 33:15.500
I was in the same.

33:15.500 --> 33:16.500
No.

33:16.500 --> 33:19.500
But what does that say about you that the people who are closest to you that you work with?

33:19.500 --> 33:20.500
Exactly.

33:20.500 --> 33:21.500
No.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.500
You well enough.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.500
Yeah.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.500
I don't know.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.500
I wouldn't say you guys are like my closest friends.

33:27.500 --> 33:28.500
Wow.

33:28.500 --> 33:34.500
I love all you guys except for a mirror, but like I want to, uh, I like to keep things separate.

33:34.500 --> 33:35.500
What does that mean?

33:35.500 --> 33:39.500
Like do you know that means I'm a Scorpio moon.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.500
Let's do a place partially.

33:41.500 --> 33:44.500
Are you Scorpio sun and moon?

33:44.500 --> 33:45.500
No.

33:45.500 --> 33:46.500
I'm a sad sun.

33:46.500 --> 33:47.500
Scorpio moon.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.500
I'd like to come myself a Trojan horse.

33:49.500 --> 33:50.500
I'm sad.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.500
I'm sad.

33:51.500 --> 33:53.500
I'm sad of you rising.

33:53.500 --> 33:59.500
So the more somebody has it of blaming others for their own problem.

33:59.500 --> 34:00.500
Obviously.

34:00.500 --> 34:07.500
He just blamed Mercury on the fact that you just didn't read your own calendar invite.

34:07.500 --> 34:15.500
This person is at some point in their life in a given a mild reprimand or warning by the authorities on the condition that they'd not repeat their offense.

34:15.500 --> 34:17.500
If they ended up repeating the offense anyway.

34:17.500 --> 34:20.500
I mean, I think the scheduling thing.

34:21.500 --> 34:23.500
You try to come to court.

34:23.500 --> 34:24.500
Yeah.

34:24.500 --> 34:25.500
Yeah.

34:25.500 --> 34:26.500
You go to court.

34:26.500 --> 34:28.500
I was very well moving on.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.500
Realism.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.500
I think Jeff has goals.

34:34.500 --> 34:35.500
No.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.500
It was a very well.

34:37.500 --> 34:38.500
Absolutely.

34:38.500 --> 34:39.500
I keep getting.

34:39.500 --> 34:43.500
I keep getting Instagram recommendations for Rodney's closet.

34:43.500 --> 34:46.500
Wait, but that means that it has realistic.

34:46.500 --> 34:47.500
Oh, realistic, I see.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.500
I think Jeff has long-term goals.

34:50.500 --> 34:51.500
They're just not realistic.

34:51.500 --> 34:52.500
That's right.

34:52.500 --> 34:53.500
Yeah.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.500
Some of those goals, Jeff.

34:54.500 --> 34:55.500
I guess I'm curious.

34:55.500 --> 34:58.500
Maybe this is a situation where we can deepen our relationship.

34:58.500 --> 34:59.500
I don't think so.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.500
Because I think they're embarrassing to talk about.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.500
And I like to move in silence.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.500
Like, let's on.

35:03.500 --> 35:04.500
What?

35:04.500 --> 35:05.500
Like, you wanted to.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.500
I mean, the CBS, you were sort of on a CBS thing.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.500
Sure.

35:08.500 --> 35:09.500
But that's what?

35:09.500 --> 35:10.500
That's a one-off.

35:10.500 --> 35:11.500
We live in a gig economy.

35:11.500 --> 35:14.500
So it's like, just because you do that doesn't mean anything else that we're going to happen.

35:14.500 --> 35:16.500
You got hired through lift to do that.

35:16.500 --> 35:18.500
I got hired in a lift to do that.

35:22.500 --> 35:25.500
The person has an excessive need for stimulation is prone to boredom.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.500
Applies very well.

35:27.500 --> 35:28.500
Yeah.

35:28.500 --> 35:31.500
The person has often tricked cond or manipulated people.

35:31.500 --> 35:32.500
Applies very well.

35:32.500 --> 35:33.500
I don't know.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.500
I'd say it does not apply.

35:35.500 --> 35:38.500
I mean, getting people on this show, then minding their money, asking the money back.

35:38.500 --> 35:39.500
It's all disorder.

35:39.500 --> 35:40.500
Yeah.

35:40.500 --> 35:41.500
Let's do it.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.500
Applies partially.

35:43.500 --> 35:44.500
Yeah.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.500
That's so really impulsive.

35:46.500 --> 35:49.500
I'd say it plays very well.

35:49.500 --> 35:54.500
The person generally evades responsibility and does not answer to anyone in their life.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.500
Hmm.

35:55.500 --> 35:57.500
That's probably the most right.

35:57.500 --> 36:01.500
The person is characterized by shallow emotional responses.

36:01.500 --> 36:02.500
Yep.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.500
I'd say, I don't know.

36:04.500 --> 36:06.500
I think that doesn't apply.

36:06.500 --> 36:09.500
Well, the fact that he doesn't like when I answer any serious questions on the show.

36:09.500 --> 36:10.500
But we'll ask.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.500
But that's because it's in public.

36:12.500 --> 36:13.500
Yeah.

36:13.500 --> 36:14.500
You're trying to keep it.

36:14.500 --> 36:15.500
You said you want to keep the things separate.

36:15.500 --> 36:16.500
You're trying to do rail the show.

36:16.500 --> 36:17.500
Don't you stop.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.500
They don't need a relevant question.

36:20.500 --> 36:21.500
Yeah.

36:21.500 --> 36:24.500
The person displays a lack of remorse or guilt.

36:24.500 --> 36:25.500
Yeah.

36:25.500 --> 36:28.500
You didn't say sorry earlier, so.

36:28.500 --> 36:30.500
The person has a history.

36:30.500 --> 36:33.500
He says he does not apply.

36:33.500 --> 36:34.500
A lack of remorse.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.500
You said I did say sorry.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.500
Oh, God.

36:37.500 --> 36:38.500
I don't know.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.500
Double neck.

36:40.500 --> 36:41.500
Oh, God.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.500
I don't know.

36:42.500 --> 36:43.500
Double neck.

36:43.500 --> 36:46.500
The person has a history of promiscuous sexual behavior.

36:46.500 --> 36:47.500
Yeah.

36:47.500 --> 36:54.500
Well, you told me you're at birds trying to pick up every night.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.500
Maybe you can say anything.

36:56.500 --> 36:57.500
Yeah.

36:57.500 --> 37:00.500
Yeah.

37:00.500 --> 37:01.500
What is that?

37:01.500 --> 37:03.500
I was definitely going to boombox.

37:03.500 --> 37:04.500
Yeah.

37:04.500 --> 37:05.500
Yeah.

37:05.500 --> 37:06.500
Nice.

37:06.500 --> 37:07.500
Again.

37:08.500 --> 37:09.500
Ah.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.500
Click objects here.

37:11.500 --> 37:12.500
Click objects here.

37:12.500 --> 37:13.500
It is better to beat the guy from now on.

37:13.500 --> 37:14.500
You gottaust.

37:14.500 --> 37:15.500
You should keep the scene.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.500
Check the media while we get it done.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.500
Uh, I know.

37:19.500 --> 37:20.500
Got the question?

37:20.500 --> 37:21.500
Great.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.500
Nice.

37:23.500 --> 37:26.500
Now, now we can see if we can just do it.

37:26.500 --> 37:27.500
What.

37:27.500 --> 37:28.500
More tips.

37:28.500 --> 37:29.500
You know.

37:29.500 --> 37:33.500
We can just hold a table bit about it ET I talk on it.

37:33.500 --> 37:34.500
You know.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.500
We can just hold off it.

37:36.500 --> 37:43.860
for what or what. I mean, you seem like every time I've seen you, I haven't really witnessed

37:43.860 --> 37:49.460
you doing anything cruel necessarily. It does not apply. The person has broken many different

37:49.460 --> 38:02.420
types of law. That's not, this I'll say it does not apply. Yeah, I'll say it. Let's see. Whoa. This

38:02.420 --> 38:10.340
makes the person you rated 48% more psychopathic than the average person. That being said,

38:10.340 --> 38:19.940
he does not qualify as a psychopath on the psychopathy checklist. And honestly, your highest one is

38:20.980 --> 38:29.060
just lifestyle. Oh, wait. Sorry. Yeah. And you're at it all. By the way, you're definitely a lot closer.

38:32.740 --> 38:38.420
That was really close to the threshold and really above average. Well, that's because half of those

38:38.420 --> 38:48.260
jokes, you guys skewed the answers. I'm not promiscuous. I made for life. Like a penguin.

38:49.700 --> 38:51.380
It doesn't mean anything.

38:51.380 --> 39:14.820
Yeah, I'm curious about that. You guys want to do another test? I don't know. It's your deal.

39:15.380 --> 39:22.900
It's my deal. Yeah. Yeah. I did. This was the one that I can tell you on miles. Okay. Oh,

39:22.900 --> 39:31.220
this is the one. Welcome to miles, smiles. Is there more? Is it just that?

39:32.260 --> 39:37.220
It is basically going to be we're going to go one by one and see who can make a genuine smile

39:37.780 --> 39:45.460
crawl across your visage. Can you can't play into it? Like truly we have to make you experience

39:45.460 --> 39:51.060
adopamine release. Got it. Okay. Cool. Does that make sense? That's really nice, man.

39:51.060 --> 40:06.740
Let's start with Marie. That's cruel. I don't know if I need to go with genuinely nice or funny,

40:06.740 --> 40:13.380
but I'll go with genuinely nice, which is that every time one of miles is TikToks pops up on my

40:13.380 --> 40:22.020
feed. Oh, no. She's doing really well. He's smiling. That's really nice. That's very nice of you.

40:22.020 --> 40:33.460
I appreciate that. You're welcome. Miles, I will hang on. Let me, I have to wash off the joy

40:33.540 --> 40:39.300
that Marie could give you. Yeah, you did like a pallet plunger. Think of like a sad animal or something.

40:39.300 --> 40:50.180
Yeah, like my dog is like pissed. Okay. Yeah. All right. Miles, I think I'd like to take you out

40:50.180 --> 40:58.020
for the aforementioned friends dinner where we go to Elini Oysterbar. We both get in a

40:58.020 --> 41:02.660
room. And maybe some of our other friends are there. Maybe you need some new faces. I'm not sure

41:02.660 --> 41:06.180
you seem like an extra birded guy. Maybe you meet some new friends. People you would vibe with.

41:07.460 --> 41:13.060
We're getting the fries. We're dipping them in mayo and then ketchup. We're getting the lobster rolls.

41:13.060 --> 41:18.900
You get the hot. I get the cold. We split them and we have half of each, right?

41:20.020 --> 41:27.700
And to wash it all down. Not on the menu, but we asked them to blend ice cream into a milkshake.

41:27.780 --> 41:32.420
And we also bring our own melted milk powder. So you're going to get fucking diarrhea.

41:32.980 --> 41:38.020
You're eating hot lobster and a milkshake that you made them make with milk powder.

41:38.580 --> 41:46.500
And cold lobster apparently. Hot and cold and we split them. You almost got a smile.

41:46.500 --> 41:53.140
A lot of them and let it quickly turn to discuss. I know I was kind of like psyched at first to be honest

41:53.220 --> 41:56.820
and then I think that they were. I started panicking. But I got to deserve.

41:58.340 --> 42:07.700
It was long before. Let's just go to La Poubelle. All right, Franklin Village. And let's get a

42:07.700 --> 42:14.660
key Royale and then a giraffe of wine. And let's toast to all the good times we've had and to all the

42:14.660 --> 42:23.460
bad times we've had. To all the wait, what was it? We've had a logger drink. We've had another.

42:23.460 --> 42:29.060
What's that fucking song? I fucked this up. We had a whiskey drink. We had a logger drink. We had a

42:29.060 --> 42:34.660
vodka drink. We had another drink. So we'll have an old fashioned or rather a bold fashioned.

42:34.660 --> 42:38.900
Because it's going to be made with way. And then we're going to have a beer. And then we're going to have

42:40.260 --> 42:43.540
I don't know. I guess a martini and then we're going to have another drink with that when you

42:43.540 --> 42:46.820
just kind of a flex spot. You can have whatever you want. At this point, we'll be drunk and we'll be

42:46.820 --> 42:52.260
dancing. We're just going to be dancing, shaking our asses like that one viral dog. I fucked this up.

42:52.260 --> 42:56.820
I panicked again because you're not showing any signs of life, any signs of joy. I feel like I did

42:56.820 --> 43:04.580
smile a couple times in there. But then you described us getting blacked out like on like some sort of

43:04.580 --> 43:12.020
weekday after a shrimp and lobster buffet, which I like again, like I do want to hang out at

43:12.500 --> 43:20.660
you don't want to take a risk after drinking a bist. I mean, I preferably we don't like to have

43:20.660 --> 43:27.300
bist before I have a martini. But I guess we could. I'm saying you're spurping made out of way.

43:29.460 --> 43:32.180
Yeah, that was an attempt to make you smile.

43:33.700 --> 43:39.140
Yeah, the whole fucking game is an attempt to make a smile. You're not going to explain why you did it.

43:39.140 --> 43:45.380
I mean, let's hear from you. I'm clearly Marieka's in first place. Did you ever know that

43:45.380 --> 43:59.540
you're my old? You're everything I would want to see in your, if I could have my old than a

43:59.540 --> 44:14.100
birdie, you know, then I would be ponds to me or today. Sorry, so not me. Yeah, it got me.

44:14.100 --> 44:21.460
Yeah, you didn't have it first. Or even at the end. I think Marieka won by a land slide. And I don't

44:21.460 --> 44:26.420
even remember what she said. Yeah, Marieka did just a nice. She just said a nice compliment.

44:27.380 --> 44:37.620
Oh, yeah, I like your fucking TikToks or whatever. I will say that miles your segment on the

44:37.620 --> 44:42.660
24 hour livestream was the funniest segment, not only of the livestream, but of the month.

44:42.660 --> 44:48.100
Oh, wow. That's really nice. Honestly, is there a place that I can watch that? I thought that the footage was lost.

44:56.980 --> 45:04.740
Well, what do you guys have going on? What do you want to point the people towards? Let's

45:04.740 --> 45:13.140
start with miles because he's our guest. Yeah, let's hear what he says. My show perfect

45:13.140 --> 45:18.740
person. It's calling advice show and they're going to work. There's a lot of fun episodes. And

45:18.740 --> 45:23.460
if you like the show, I have a Patreon where I do bonus episodes. And I just did the 420

45:23.460 --> 45:33.540
bomb cast where I got a little stone and I took calls from stoners on 420's Eve. And they had sort of

45:33.540 --> 45:39.700
stoner conundrums that I saw on the show. So check out perfect person. I guess make TikToks too.

45:39.700 --> 45:42.660
I've gotten a lot of names say today. So we can take that out too.

45:43.700 --> 45:48.740
Yes, did you get high yesterday on 420? I don't do drugs. Is that true?

45:48.980 --> 45:55.780
I just don't want to influence anybody. You think that this show is so clean that you're

45:55.780 --> 46:01.060
such a good influence like cart blocks, but you who say you do drugs would be surprising to people?

46:02.660 --> 46:07.700
What is it about me that makes people think I do drugs? By the man bun in the sunglasses.

46:08.660 --> 46:13.700
What about my ears? You're what? The ears that I put on like my general ear.

46:13.860 --> 46:19.860
I think, do you, sorry shut the fuck up. Do you think I'm a shesher man?

46:22.260 --> 46:24.740
Yes. It's like treasure cat.

46:25.940 --> 46:26.340
Yeah.

46:28.820 --> 46:30.340
American, did you get high last night?

46:31.620 --> 46:33.220
Uh, no.

46:36.340 --> 46:42.020
And I want to be clear, I don't always get stoned. It's just that no, I mean you've made your point. Like

46:42.100 --> 46:46.740
everyone should do every single drug. They can get their fucking three little drivers on and they should treat

46:46.740 --> 46:52.340
weed as much as, you know, the same as vet and all recreation. Do not say that. Whoa, I didn't see that,

46:52.340 --> 46:58.820
but I think that it can be sometimes a good way to relax. But I have a baby so I can't really like

46:58.820 --> 47:04.020
it all tristoned anymore because even if I have the evening to myself, I often have to have the next

47:04.020 --> 47:10.100
morning care for my skin. So I wasn't going to say anything, but yeah, that's a good, it's good that you brought that up.

47:10.180 --> 47:10.660
Absolutely.

47:15.700 --> 47:18.500
I did have CBD to go to sleep.

47:19.220 --> 47:23.940
We got a figure to shut out. We got to wrap this up. We got to make next week feel different

47:23.940 --> 47:28.340
even this because the last thing I wanted to do here is on this Friday was Marie can be like,

47:28.340 --> 47:29.700
I did have CBD.

47:40.100 --> 47:50.180
At Jeffrey James on Instagram, at Jeffway already on Twitter. And yeah, that's it.

47:50.180 --> 47:50.900
Amir, what do you got?

47:52.900 --> 47:53.620
Actually.

47:56.900 --> 47:57.700
Sorry, continue.

48:10.100 --> 48:24.660
If I could have miles in a buried hole, then you I would be bone senior today.

48:26.660 --> 48:33.460
Fly, what's your plug? Oh, plugs. I'm on TikTok. Okay, that's there.

48:40.100 --> 48:57.460
That was a hit-dum original.

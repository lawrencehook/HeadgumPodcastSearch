00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:02.000 --> 00:30.000
I mean, I feel at home at this point.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
I'm sorry.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
What was that?

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
I was just saying I'm happy that you feel at home here.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
In your mad at that?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
She's a green woman.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
I'm in a living one.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
I think you're not having your outwardly up some valid to have any emotion.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I have.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Everybody's emotional experiences valid.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
But mine, my gladness, isn't it?

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
You're experiencing october gladness.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
I really do feel at home.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I don't know what else to say.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
I mean, this is the third record in this studio.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Yeah.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I don't even know if we recorded an LA this much.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
It's your second day and you feel at home?

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Joel?

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
I think you feel at home too.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Yeah, I just feel like everybody's coming.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Oh.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
It's literally quite the opposite.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
What did you say?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
You said that you were pissed that I'm here?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
No.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
I said I'm so glad you feel that way.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
And that was genuine.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
It was genuine.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
I appreciate that.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
This studio is my favorite color.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Does particular green or does green in general?

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
This particular green.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
It does a really nice green.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
What adjective would you put before it to describe it?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
British racing green.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Hmm.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
As to Martin.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Really nice green.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Yeah.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Think of fours.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Johnny, your shirt matches.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Got this in a Orlando gift shop.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Nice.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Very golf-esque.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I guess I got to start the show.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
I'm going to keep all this in, but the energy is sour.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
What?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Lips sour.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Lips sour.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Behind you.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Yeah.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Don't live strong.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Okay.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
I think I'm not crazy.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I mean, didn't everyone.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah, but I like, we're going to feel a little bit more.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
I love her too.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah.

02:49.000 --> 02:57.000
I feel like every episode there's like a dance.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
You know what I mean?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
And it changes every time for sure.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
So this is how you want to start the episode.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Well, I'm just saying, like, who do we think the dance is going to be?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
I mean, we could play as our bets.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
And then by the end, we can come back and be like, actually, I think it was, I think it was Joel.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I think it's going to be you.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Why?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
I feel like everyone was going to say that.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
And so for you to say, it's so fast.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Confirms my deepest fears.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Well, was you just right today?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
This one episode.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Every every episode.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
The comments are.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Oh, Jeff made me have a stroke today.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
Oh, you had some boy really should read the comments.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
We could read the comments of today's episode.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Yeah.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Which when they're listening to this was three weeks ago.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah, we could.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
The stroke one was from today.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Yeah.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
I don't know what else to say.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I don't know anything therapy to twice a week.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
You just comment back.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Condolences.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
It's become sort of a bit to really just rag on both the podcasts.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
But particularly you.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
Which I will say one one comment today got me.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Okay.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
I'll explain that it was just a, it was a time stamp comment.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
And it said the part at 4557 made my fucking year.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
And I clicked on it.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
And to the podcast.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
And the play.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
T he he did.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
We did a long bit in each cue about what would happen if I died.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
And my funeral became the final episode of the show.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Should I pull?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
I think that that was everybody.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Everybody chimed in with a funny.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Like.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Yeah.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Lime.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
One of the moments I felt most like this company was a community that I've joined.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Like we all do things together.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Right.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
And it's not that people are like sharing any condolences.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
It was like more celebration.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
But not a celebration of the life having passed.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
The life having been ended.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
And then I just chuckled like.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
It was an into a preacher.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Amen.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Amen.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
What was the.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Oh.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I remember.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Okay.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Do you want to just read the entire transcript.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
I want people to feel how long this went on.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
So the basic concept is that it started with.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Playing.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
A rendition of the head compot podcast theme at your funeral.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
Um, Mike said it's missing a she at the end.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Good so far.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Brad.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
That was easy listening.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Um.

05:37.000 --> 05:44.000
And then you said if I die young would work wonders for the head compods numbers.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Episode 189.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Jeff's actual funeral, which is like pretty soon.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
That's any.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
You didn't give yourself much time.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Um.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
Dibs on running the soundboard for the ulogy.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Wow.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Oh shit.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Oh shit.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Um.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Um.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
Kayla said who will sing amazing grace.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
Heart felt ulogy from Jeff's father.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
Daddy chill.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Congregation and tears.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
She.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Um.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Riley said somber.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Amazing.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Amazing.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Amazing.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Grace.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
She.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
The sound.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
The casket lowers down.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
That was easy.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
Poppers entered to the too long game show sound.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Ryan Galberg's was a punch up of that from Brad.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Um.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
This is less funny than I remember.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Yeah.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
In the moment it was really fun.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Yeah.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
It's probably because I'm reading it in full.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Um.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I'll find some.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
You did say your funeral would be open casket slash lakes.

07:06.000 --> 07:16.000
I'm just I'm trying to find any anything that had a lot to share.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Like reactions on slack.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Um.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
I said that your wake border otherwise is just an excuse for Jake to go surfing.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Riley said crowd surfing.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
He'll take what he can get and I said crowd.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Um.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Sorry.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
What do you mean?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
They're won't be any worse there.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
The wagon.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
And that's it.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
That's pretty good.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Um.

07:42.000 --> 07:51.000
I thought the week is no me fry.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
She in the Charlie's Angels movie.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
No, she's like a writer for the New Yorker.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Oh yeah.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
A cultural icon.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
Well, not really obviously because I can remember.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
She was.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
I do know who you're talking about.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
I really want to have her on the show.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
She follows me on Instagram and Twitter.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
So I think we can make it out later.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Yeah.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
I don't think she listens to the show though.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
I mean, she shouldn't.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
It's almost better that she doesn't.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Agreed.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
I think she listens.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
And she wouldn't respect you.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Probably.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
She comes on the show.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Oh, yeah.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I followed you on a dare.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I was out with Marika.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Micah.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
But we talked about getting a guest for this episode or one of them.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
And I, and today, realize I should have invited her on.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Yeah.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Yeah.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
We should get some more podcast guests on.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
And really just.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
I do want to have Hayes and Sean on from Hollywood handbook.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
I'd be fun.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
You should go on Hollywood handbook.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
I love that show.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
We're going to get miles miles.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Yeah.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Yeah.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
I was trying to get miles on an August.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Yeah.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
That was egg and podcast.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
So it's even better.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
You guys have a segment plan for later.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
We should say.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
And I feel like you guys are just like, yeah.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
I get all this shit out of the way until we get to our segment.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Do you want to have a set of anything?

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
My bond of the week is going to be.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Dave Bird, Lil Dickie.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
It's time for a curly-haired bond.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Yeah.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
David Blaine.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
We need an illusionist as a bond.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Just.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Besting villains.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Yeah.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Through.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Slide and hand.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Exactly.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Close up magic.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Do you say this?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Being the world from bondage.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
It's the ball torture scene.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
We talked about last week.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
But on the first hit, he disagrees with the cast.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
He's like,

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Round two round of the David's.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
I guess I'll go.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Right.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Or for the Atlantic.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
David Simms.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
So the blank track podcast.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
That's good.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
We get David that and bro.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
He's a British right.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Yeah.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
That would be good.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
David Sedaris.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
We need a cool audit bond.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Yeah.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
David Sedacus.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Is that?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
A plumber.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
In Burlington.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Local reference.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Yeah.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
I love it.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
David Sedacus.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Yeah.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I'm not going to speak in Jason's name.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
I know.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
I don't know.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
I don't know.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Ah.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Hopefully.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Wait a second.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
David Sedacus.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
We'll not the tongue though.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
David Sedacus.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
It only goes off the tongue because it's a two-cyn and a syllable name.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
And then Sedacus.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
It's Jason also is.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
David Sedacus.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
David Sedacus.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Pervox.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Pete Buttigieg knows EV range anxiety is a thing.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
What's EV range anxiety?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Electric vehicle range anxiety.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Got it.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
He knows it's a thing.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
You know it's a thing?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
I didn't know.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
I didn't know.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
What's he going to do about it?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Nothing.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
He just knows it's real.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
He knows that if you have an EV, you're probably a little nervous.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
So you're wanted to the next charge port.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Is he pro or anti EV?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
He's neutral on it.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
It like doesn't ultimately stick.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
I think.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Yeah.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
I don't think.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
He's not right.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Pete.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
I think the reason he didn't end up being on the ticket.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
In 2020 was that he didn't have that bootage edge to him.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
You know, by sort of has the aviators.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
He has the beers.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
He has the cream.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Yeah.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
The cream.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I scream edge.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
He sort of looks like he was like right for the part of top gun.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
But like 40 years too early.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
I had it this time in that specific regard.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
That flight jacket quality.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Yeah.

11:38.000 --> 11:38.500
Yeah.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.500
Yeah.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.500
I would hate to see bootage edge coming out of a Air Force one.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.500
In a pair of Air Force ones.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.500
What are you trying to do?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.500
Yeah.

11:50.500 --> 11:56.500
The EV thing is how I feel about peeing on road trips.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.500
Anxiety or that you don't think you'll make it to the next.

11:59.500 --> 12:02.500
I don't think I'll make it to the next stop.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.500
You guys never done road trip diapers?

12:05.500 --> 12:06.500
Road trip diapers?

12:06.500 --> 12:07.500
Yeah.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.500
I don't speak on this.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.500
I said my fees.

12:10.500 --> 12:14.500
I know that never got normal hands in a quiet place.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.500
Because yeah.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.500
It's like what if you don't be in a bottle.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.500
That's weird to shit too.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.500
Okay.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.500
I don't think so.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.500
I don't think so.

12:21.500 --> 12:25.500
I've never had an emergency on a road trip.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.500
And you don't even just mean with the bathroom.

12:28.500 --> 12:32.500
Every trip you've taken cross country otherwise has gone smoothly.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.500
Yeah.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.500
Yeah.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.500
Yeah.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.500
Yeah.

12:37.500 --> 12:42.500
I think the worst thing that'll happen is like a car spun on ice.

12:42.500 --> 12:45.500
But it was pretty.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.500
It was pretty.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.500
That is kind of an emergency.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.500
That's pretty bad.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.500
It's not a smart thing.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.500
No.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.500
It all will drive kicked in and it was fine.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.500
Yeah.

12:53.500 --> 12:54.500
Yeah.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.500
Yeah.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.500
That's what I was thinking.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.500
It's a kind of swurled a little bit or spun.

12:57.500 --> 12:58.500
Because spinning is really bad.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.500
It spun once.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.500
Well, you were also doing like a style swirf.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.500
I think you were wearing a Jesus piece on your way to Tucson.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.500
Yeah.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.500
She said so many words.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.500
The A-B-A gave me I-B-A.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.500
I should have been on the rest of the trip.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.500
It was on my way to visit Cornell.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.500
Potential school.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.500
Yeah.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.500
It's called car swirf.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.500
Not quisp.

13:23.500 --> 13:24.500
I believe her.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.500
That is an Ivy League school.

13:26.500 --> 13:27.500
No, but you didn't get it.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.500
I did get it.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.500
I just got it.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.500
It's only Ivy League.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.500
That's actually really cool.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.500
Yeah.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.500
You went to a better school.

13:36.500 --> 13:37.500
Yeah.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.500
It's just not in the league.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.500
Yeah.

13:39.500 --> 13:40.500
You didn't go to that.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.500
You didn't go to any Ivy League school.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.500
I can't speak on this.

13:44.500 --> 13:45.500
Well, you know, we can talk about it.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.500
I'm not speaking on it.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.500
I'm surrounding it, circling it.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.500
Mmm.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.500
So.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.500
Did you wish you could have gone to an Ivy League?

13:52.500 --> 13:53.500
No.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.500
I actually went to the hardest professional school to get into in the country.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.500
Mmm.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.500
That one wasn't even funny.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.500
That was just me being an asshole.

14:05.500 --> 14:06.500
Mmm.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.500
Grace cut that out.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.500
Um, I want to start making plans for the six.

14:10.500 --> 14:11.500
What are you guys doing?

14:11.500 --> 14:13.500
You're going down to DC or for the six.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.500
January.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.500
No.

14:15.500 --> 14:16.500
No.

14:16.500 --> 14:17.500
Which isn't.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.500
Isn't.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.500
Is that election day or so date?

14:20.500 --> 14:22.500
I don't know.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.500
Primary elections.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.500
Is it.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.500
No.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.500
Between the day.

14:26.500 --> 14:27.500
November.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.500
When this comes out.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.500
Yeah.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.500
Oh, okay.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.500
And also a cast.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.500
I guess.

14:33.500 --> 14:34.500
Yeah.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.500
Yeah.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.500
I don't know.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.500
You know.

14:37.500 --> 14:38.500
Uh.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.500
I'll probably be home.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.500
And not in Washington, DC.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.500
Mmm.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.500
The six.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.500
If you catch my drift.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.500
If you catch her six.

14:51.500 --> 14:52.500
Anywho.

14:52.500 --> 14:57.500
You asked.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.500
What are you guys doing?

14:59.500 --> 15:01.500
I got some buddies and DCs.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.500
That's where I went to school.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.500
Towards town.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.500
Yeah.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.500
So some of them were trying to plan some stuff.

15:07.500 --> 15:08.500
We'll see what comes together.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.500
Yeah.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.500
Plan some stuff.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.500
What do you mean kicked off the first app.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.500
We were using to message each other and plan it.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.500
Okay.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.500
Telegram.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.500
Yeah.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.500
Got ban.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.500
We sure.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.500
We're trying to find a new platform.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.500
Yeah.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.500
True social.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.500
Yeah.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.500
I'm sorry.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.500
Right.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.500
Yeah.

15:28.500 --> 15:29.500
And the adults in the US are on.

15:29.500 --> 15:30.500
True social.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.500
Kind of a lot.

15:31.500 --> 15:32.500
Yeah.

15:32.500 --> 15:33.500
Yeah.

15:33.500 --> 15:37.500
A lot for a very deep dark web.

15:37.500 --> 15:41.500
CR of this, apparently.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.500
Trump isn't really a big fan of.

15:43.500 --> 15:44.500
Of truth social.

15:44.500 --> 15:49.500
Because there's no, there's not truth social spaces.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.500
Yeah.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.500
You wanted to be.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.500
True social rules.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.500
Um.

15:57.500 --> 16:01.740
Just checking. You're not time. We've got four minutes to kill. I mean, what do you guys want to talk about?

16:01.740 --> 16:04.300
I never give you guys the floor and I really am sorry about that

16:05.500 --> 16:11.340
I'm smiling like doing like doing great like really though. How are you doing still great? No really how are you doing?

16:11.580 --> 16:13.580
So the only acceptance

16:15.180 --> 16:21.980
I'm looking at I'm looking at a dig deep and get somewhere like really dark for you. Yeah, yeah, it's really like biggest insecurity about your body

16:21.980 --> 16:28.540
I'm just really quick. Honestly, I just stick with the the peeing thing comes up a lot more than you'd think

16:28.540 --> 16:33.100
You're small about a really small bladder and drink a lot of water. Okay, so that's good

16:34.140 --> 16:36.540
No, because it's like look

16:37.340 --> 16:40.940
I'm there with you brother on the drink a lot of water the small bladder both

16:41.180 --> 16:46.380
I don't drink a lot of water, but I have a very small bladder. Yeah, constantly dehydrated. Yeah, it's just dehydrated

16:46.620 --> 16:49.340
But I feel like saying you have a small bladder is like oh, I'm so skinny

16:49.820 --> 16:55.580
No, it's not really because you're because if you have big organs, you won't get that like thin paper

16:55.580 --> 16:59.420
Are you like more in the side for me now that I've said that I have a small bladder?

17:00.220 --> 17:06.540
You kind of like looking right underneath this little microphone look are you quitting skininess with a track? I'm not

17:07.740 --> 17:09.740
I'm not I'm just saying it's a vibe

17:09.740 --> 17:16.700
You're saying that it's a vibe. Yeah, you know those like lanky fuckers on the subway with the you know the fucking scoop neck tees and the you know the book

17:17.260 --> 17:24.060
Mm-hmm. That's a look. Yeah, that's a look. That's a loop. It's a loop. Yeah, and it's lucrative

17:25.420 --> 17:29.820
I tried to model and they said that I was too big bone as they put it

17:31.980 --> 17:37.660
Did you try the bladder thing on them my bladder is fucking huge? I even peed in a year

17:39.020 --> 17:41.020
I'm a cactus

17:41.420 --> 17:43.420
Do you think it's genetic your bladder?

17:43.820 --> 17:50.300
Is your dad use a bath of a lot neither of my parents drink a lot of water. Okay, so they drink a lot of coffee

17:51.020 --> 17:55.660
No, okay, yeah, and then how are you circumcised and then if so how far down does it go?

17:58.940 --> 18:00.940
Yes, and the normal amount

18:02.220 --> 18:04.220
Wow, so

18:05.740 --> 18:11.580
I'm very good. What's on your mind? I'm now I'm just thinking about bladder. I'm glad that's where you're thinking about yeah

18:12.540 --> 18:14.540
I

18:14.540 --> 18:21.020
Sometimes don't pee for an entire work day. That's fine. Don't listen

18:21.740 --> 18:23.740
Don't let these small bladder

18:24.380 --> 18:27.900
Dying pieces make us feel bad about never

18:29.100 --> 18:30.380
But then sometimes like if I'm

18:31.580 --> 18:36.300
asleep sometimes I wake up once twice in the middle for night. Yeah, I can go to the bathroom

18:36.300 --> 18:40.620
So I get it. That's the only time that you have to pee is the time you really don't want to yeah

18:41.580 --> 18:44.540
That's why again. I think we should normalize sleep diapers

18:46.380 --> 18:51.340
I'm kind of well that I also wake up three a

18:52.220 --> 18:57.500
I got to go pee yeah, and that's the product of the small bladder. I would like that sun's

18:58.060 --> 19:00.060
Torturous to just be laying there

19:02.620 --> 19:06.620
I don't think I don't think I'd be able to do it because I pee anxiety when I'm alone

19:06.780 --> 19:08.780
Yeah

19:10.460 --> 19:12.460
That's why you never pee

19:12.460 --> 19:14.460
I'm so nervous

19:19.260 --> 19:21.900
It's a valid concern. Patrick have you ever peed crazy?

19:23.580 --> 19:27.580
Yeah, definitely for sure. Peed crazy. Does that mean to you?

19:30.380 --> 19:34.700
There I don't know there was a time when I was really drunk in college that I thought my

19:35.660 --> 19:38.300
The floor of my bedroom was a urinal

19:39.580 --> 19:44.060
And I don't just mean that I like peed in my standing up in my room, which is what happened

19:44.060 --> 19:49.180
But it was that I like in my head had a memory of standing in front of a urinal that wasn't there

19:49.180 --> 19:53.820
Yeah, I think I was like sleep paralysis just memory. Yeah, yeah, it was a core memory

19:56.220 --> 20:00.140
One of the touchstones of my life. Yeah, there's the live show at Grammar Sea and bat

20:02.060 --> 20:04.060
Have you guys ever been mistreated in a relationship

20:05.180 --> 20:07.180
I

20:08.940 --> 20:15.980
Don't think so. That's great Joel. I don't think so either. This is amazing. Brought me

20:19.420 --> 20:21.740
And if it's not overwhelmingly positive then

20:22.620 --> 20:28.540
We might as well as how you're really feeling yeah, yeah, uh I feel like

20:29.900 --> 20:31.900
probably had some like bad

20:32.860 --> 20:37.420
Friendship moments when I felt I was mistreated, you know what I mean?

20:39.900 --> 20:43.980
Is it when I forgot to record the head-compact has like four weeks in a row last year?

20:46.620 --> 20:49.980
I wouldn't know that's not let's not you mistreating me

20:50.700 --> 20:52.700
Let's miss me mistreating commerce

20:54.300 --> 20:57.500
I'm sorry, man. Yeah, that's an interesting point

20:57.980 --> 20:59.980
I

21:01.580 --> 21:05.340
Been mistreated in a relationship. Okay, so you were fishing

21:07.420 --> 21:09.420
Let's get into it. It asked him. Yeah

21:10.860 --> 21:18.620
You want to get into it. No, you just said let's get into it. The goof. It's like, you know, we put on like we put on a character for these things

21:18.620 --> 21:20.780
All right. It's like this isn't really how we are we hang out

21:23.020 --> 21:25.020
Kind of as yeah

21:25.020 --> 21:27.020
To say it wow

21:29.100 --> 21:31.740
Now, you know who you're real friends are Tom York style

21:34.780 --> 21:39.020
No radio head fans in the room. I'm not even a fan, but I knew that song

21:40.860 --> 21:43.020
Should we sing the little ditty that we came up with last night?

21:44.060 --> 21:49.100
Yeah, we should please one two three that Jeff is talks

21:55.420 --> 21:59.420
This show is sponsored by better help

22:00.460 --> 22:07.660
Guys, I sometimes wish that life just came with a user manual a rulebook a a pathway forward

22:08.220 --> 22:11.420
So that you know you don't have to question your decisions

22:11.420 --> 22:14.140
You don't have to question whether or not you're doing the right thing

22:14.140 --> 22:20.140
But unfortunately it doesn't and that's where therapy can step in and be the next best thing

22:21.020 --> 22:24.700
Because life doesn't come with a user manual, right? So when it's not working for you

22:24.700 --> 22:29.660
It's normal to feel stuck and navigating any of life's challenges can make you feel unsure

22:29.660 --> 22:33.180
Whether it's a career change a new relationship or becoming a parent and

22:33.660 --> 22:39.180
Therapists are trained to help you figure out the cause of challenging emotions and learn productive coping skills

22:39.420 --> 22:43.660
Which makes therapy the closest thing to a guided tour the complex engine called

22:44.460 --> 22:49.580
You I'm in therapy every week or at least I try to be recently

22:49.580 --> 22:55.580
I haven't been had to cancel on her for a couple sessions and you can see it in my eyes

22:56.700 --> 23:02.540
I'm better when I'm getting help in therapy every week and I say this every week, but

23:03.900 --> 23:06.540
You kind of if you have the access to it financially

23:07.100 --> 23:09.100
Which better help makes it easier for?

23:09.100 --> 23:14.940
You kind of owe it to yourself to be in therapy and you also owe it to the people around you to be the most

23:15.020 --> 23:17.020
Evolved per version of yourself

23:17.900 --> 23:19.500
in dealing with life's

23:20.060 --> 23:25.340
Challenges being the best version of yourself being the kindest version of yourself knowing yourself better

23:25.660 --> 23:30.060
I really think that the most vibrant people in the world are the people who know themselves the best and

23:30.860 --> 23:34.860
We're all trying to learn how to do that as the world's largest therapy service

Holy

24:11.500 --> 24:13.500
You

24:13.500 --> 24:15.500
We're gonna back on that. This is crazy

24:17.820 --> 24:20.940
We should say that that was in reference to the fact that Emma and

24:22.140 --> 24:27.820
Maria had not even two just bone broth for lunch, which yeah, that's not enough

24:28.860 --> 24:30.860
And I had a rice and chicken bowl

24:31.580 --> 24:35.580
Okay, with the side of bra. I was just worried about you guys. I appreciate that

24:37.820 --> 24:41.020
Johnny and Joel prepare to segment and Maria and me

24:41.500 --> 24:44.700
Part of this it was also a big part. I don't know what it is

24:45.340 --> 24:50.460
Okay, clearly yeah, well, yeah, let's get right up a little nervous about it. I mean

24:51.020 --> 24:54.700
Look Jeff this quarter Q4 2022

24:54.940 --> 24:57.660
It's a very very big quarter financially for head gum

24:58.380 --> 25:02.060
I spoke with Ryan for the listener. This is our new VP of sales

25:02.620 --> 25:06.060
We're talking about monetization strategies and how to bolster up

25:06.860 --> 25:10.300
Just branded content to sponsorship in general

25:10.940 --> 25:12.940
and

25:13.660 --> 25:17.900
Just looking at the finances and what's coming in what's coming out we realized oh

25:18.460 --> 25:25.580
This show is kind of in the red with all the production costs and I think we need to do just a few more ads that are baked in

25:25.980 --> 25:27.420
within this episode. They paid

25:28.380 --> 25:34.140
Top dollar to do it. Why and also we're very excited to work with you specifically actually. There's no way

25:34.700 --> 25:38.940
These brands wanted to work with me specifically. Yeah, what are the brands?

25:39.500 --> 25:47.260
We'll get to it. But yeah, they're super excited to work with you and we have the ad copy and we want you to read it right now

25:48.060 --> 25:53.100
Okay, it's hard because sometimes I don't like to do a cold read, but yeah, I mean we'll

25:53.820 --> 25:57.580
We'll have it in our hands and we'll be reading along so if you do need to do another take

25:58.060 --> 26:03.900
Okay, yeah, if you have trouble like if you need to answer. Oh, I know I have some questions no

26:04.060 --> 26:09.500
Looks double on something you can just repeat it or okay, and we can just get a clean yeah, you get a clean and all right

26:09.500 --> 26:11.500
Yeah, you'll want to go one at a time on those

26:12.300 --> 26:18.940
Okay, so give space in between each line no like between each page. Okay. I got that we'll take a break after

26:19.980 --> 26:22.300
Nobody wants for three ads right after

26:23.340 --> 26:26.700
It's kind of crazy that everyone knew about this and you're bringing this to me

26:26.940 --> 26:30.380
During a record you could have said hey, we're gonna do some ad copy before this

26:30.380 --> 26:33.340
I mean you could have told us about every segment on the show ever

26:34.380 --> 26:38.780
Those goals that hit me came out of nowhere jol's I almost did jol's goals again

26:39.420 --> 26:43.660
Maybe we'll round it out with that if we have some time all right here we go this is the first ad

26:43.660 --> 26:45.660
I don't know what brand it is

26:49.420 --> 26:51.820
My flat ass has caused me nothing but trouble

26:53.020 --> 26:55.020
Is it certainly true

26:55.020 --> 27:01.500
Is this speak of recent airplane butt pain or how your Twitter campaign to bear ass for 10,000 has been less than fruitful

27:01.580 --> 27:08.140
Yeah, I this is barely true, but I was on a jet blue flight yesterday and the seat was the issue

27:08.140 --> 27:13.340
It wasn't my seat that was the issue is the plane seat one half it had a cushion the other was hard metal

27:13.340 --> 27:16.220
So my ass was asleep for five hours. This is so fucked up

27:16.780 --> 27:20.780

Fucked

28:27.180 --> 28:30.780
This is for ass replacements and you can't say anything about sex

28:31.100 --> 28:33.100
butt lift center

28:33.100 --> 28:36.540
Ass lifts center. Okay, I guess what I would do with it is I would do less squats

28:36.860 --> 28:40.780
All right, I just wouldn't do that anymore because I got the first procedure done how much does this cost even?

28:40.780 --> 28:45.740
Let's get this fucking over the vacuum at vacuum butt lift center and absolutely dumpers not a typical outcome

28:45.980 --> 28:47.980
But it is an attainable outcome

28:48.060 --> 28:54.300
Thank you vacuum butt lift center for sponsoring this episode so at ends by saying you're not even a guarantee that you get the ass not a guarantee

28:54.300 --> 28:55.340
But it's possible

28:55.340 --> 29:01.100
So how much does it cost? Didn't say anything there's not even a URL the point them two is not a fun good to pencil the starting but

29:03.500 --> 29:09.020
My ass is very good. Okay, it has a shapelyness to it

29:09.580 --> 29:14.860
It has a nice blend of firmness and jiggle. We're gonna have to cut this out. Yeah, you can tell us

29:14.860 --> 29:20.460
No, this is just you you said baked in ads is after the ad so I'm saying, but right, but that it completely

29:20.460 --> 29:25.020
You know, yeah, it's just nice to have no experience of the ad read that you just did

29:25.020 --> 29:29.180
Exactly, okay, I had by the way, I had a meeting with Connie. This is real

29:29.500 --> 29:33.900
Where she was talking about integrating showing off the product on camera for video ads

29:35.900 --> 29:37.900
Well

29:39.740 --> 29:43.340
That was there's so many there's like 18 words behind just the well

29:44.940 --> 29:53.500
Next one. This is so fucked. Yeah, yeah, yeah, overall good job with the read yeah, I mean, I don't read the red text because those are

29:53.660 --> 29:57.500
Instructions it just feels like I want to explain it a little bit because

29:58.060 --> 30:02.620
Yeah, it doesn't feel true to my experience. Yeah, hey listeners. I want to get serious. It's no secret

30:02.620 --> 30:06.300
That's what I'm sorry. Let's make this really really serious, please

30:07.340 --> 30:13.500
Hey listeners. I want to get serious. It's no secret that our country is in disarray. I agree

30:14.140 --> 30:18.540
It feels like at any time we scroll through social media. We're doomed scrolling

30:20.220 --> 30:25.260
It's time we take a stand behind a candidate who truly cares about making a difference. Dock

30:28.460 --> 30:33.100
Dr. Oz is running to put America first and empower the American people

30:33.980 --> 30:35.980
Rush your support now

30:35.980 --> 30:37.980
That's bad coffee

30:37.980 --> 30:42.540
That's bad coffee. Oh, great. It's bad copywriting by my mom. We didn't do it. Yeah, this is from

30:42.700 --> 30:46.540
We'll send that back to the doctor as people. This is so fucked up

30:47.420 --> 30:53.820
Behind Oz we will take down the radical socialist left. I'm in I'm a registered member of the DSA

30:55.900 --> 31:02.140
Oz will help defeat the woke mob and I will finally be able to truly say what I feel on this podcast

31:04.460 --> 31:09.260
Oz will allow every law abiding American senator citizen to buy the gun of their desire

31:10.060 --> 31:16.060
His strongest memories of fatherhood are teaching his son how to shoot before handing him his lunch and putting him on the bus to school

31:16.140 --> 31:25.100
That's really early to shoot a gun. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine. Yeah, yeah, I'm like I'm not going to say that we agree with this

31:25.100 --> 31:26.460
But no, we

31:26.460 --> 31:31.580
We're not the ones putting our voice behind it. Well, it is like usually if there's any kind of controversial ad

31:31.820 --> 31:35.340
Somebody from the sales team will email the host and be like do you feel comfortable advertising?

31:35.980 --> 31:41.180
You know, tell me with your amount of money that they're giving us. I think it just how much money did Oz give you that

31:41.820 --> 31:44.460
There's campaign finance laws. I'd rather keep that confidential

31:46.300 --> 31:48.300
I love the joys of hunting

31:49.020 --> 31:51.020
The feeling it elicits is good

31:52.300 --> 31:55.500
I think you should be stronger. Yeah, I've never shot a gun. I've never hunted

31:57.740 --> 32:03.340
Well, how would you raise it? I guess you could talk about how you would give your kids shooting training

32:03.420 --> 32:14.300
I would never do that. Well, it's I don't have kids. It's really good. I'm sure he'd love if I gendered it if I have a son

32:14.300 --> 32:18.620
I'm gonna put a gun in his hands before print pre-k

32:21.100 --> 32:28.220
Like that Oz is running for U.S. Senate to reignite our divine spark bravely fight for freedom and finally tell it like it is

32:29.020 --> 32:31.020
I I'm not going to say this. This is

32:31.500 --> 32:33.500
I

32:33.900 --> 32:36.300
Don't care if the other guy ever leaves his basement. That's fine

32:40.140 --> 32:42.140
Can I use a different name?

32:43.340 --> 32:45.980
Yeah, what do you think? Did you just go back into your nickname? I

32:46.940 --> 32:52.780
Desmond James fully endorsed Dr. Oz for PA Senate this ad was paid for by Oz for Senate

32:53.420 --> 32:58.220
Great. Yeah, nice this easy no you cornered me now you have me on record and

32:58.700 --> 33:04.700
Your fucking buddy runs the fucking out of context had gunpockets. They're gonna fucking tweet me endorsing Oz

33:05.980 --> 33:11.020
By the way, perfect metaphor anyone who votes for him thinking he is has the keys to the city of emerald

33:19.340 --> 33:22.700
I'm rummished because I just endorsed a fucking bad

33:28.780 --> 33:30.780
Oh

33:32.780 --> 33:35.260
Number three yeah, I'm not doing this

33:37.500 --> 33:41.260
I guess we yeah, we can just splice around it. Yeah, we'll be fine. So make it all

33:41.660 --> 33:43.660
So sing

33:45.180 --> 33:48.300
You said you had a segment to right we are just give me a fucking second

33:58.860 --> 34:05.980
Well, come to Jeffordy New York City edition part two did it. Wow, we did this

What is a bar you frequently when you lived in Williamsburg? I'll give it to Joel the correct answer

37:27.500 --> 37:32.380
We were looking for was where in Williamsburg did Jeff get an open container ticket to brown bag

37:32.380 --> 37:34.380
You beer this is culture to you

37:35.820 --> 37:37.820

Joel controls the board

37:45.100 --> 37:47.660
Okay, the Jordan that's Joel in board

37:48.460 --> 37:53.420
Let's finish it out with culture for 300 culture for 300 this one's a gimmie Madison Square Park

37:53.900 --> 37:55.660
What is where the first shake shack is?

37:57.420 --> 37:59.420
Don't give that to him

38:02.140 --> 38:03.820
No

38:03.820 --> 38:08.060
Do you know where he could now? I just didn't want Joel to have it for that fact

38:12.540 --> 38:14.540
Where is the flat iron district?

38:16.940 --> 38:20.380
That's incorrect, okay. I think it. Yeah

38:23.180 --> 38:25.180
Think 2015

38:28.300 --> 38:30.300
2015

38:30.700 --> 38:37.340
Correct answer was where did Jeff have a full body nervous breakdown in high school? I thought there was a union square

38:37.340 --> 38:42.860
That was I was incorrect about units where it ultimately was Madison Square happened

38:43.900 --> 38:46.860
But I'll give it to Marika for thinking about me

38:47.980 --> 38:51.580
Break it controls the board. That's also not what I meant to say

38:52.620 --> 38:56.380
Let's go upstate nonsense for 300

39:01.180 --> 39:04.620
What is our video producer in New York?

39:05.740 --> 39:09.420

It's gonna dox him

39:25.100 --> 39:27.100

39:27.100 --> 39:29.340
Is it? Marika controls the board

39:30.620 --> 39:33.260
I'll take upstate nonsense for 200

39:33.260 --> 39:35.900
Upstate nonsense for 200 bearsville in New York

39:38.060 --> 39:42.620
What is where Jeff got arrested for public nudity?

39:44.780 --> 39:47.340
Where is Jeff's dream place to live?

39:49.180 --> 39:51.340
I want to give it to Joel, but it was private nudity

39:52.940 --> 39:54.060
You got arrested for this?

39:55.580 --> 39:57.260
My body went into a state of arrest

39:57.820 --> 40:01.660
Because the last time I had sex in Ulster County was in Bearsville

40:03.500 --> 40:06.860
Joel controls the board. I didn't think that was going to happen again

40:08.620 --> 40:10.940
Yeah, why didn't you think that was going to happen again?

40:11.660 --> 40:13.660
I meant to kick that internal

40:15.580 --> 40:18.540
Let's finish off upstate nonsense 100

40:40.940 --> 40:41.740
Joel controls the board

40:42.700 --> 40:45.100

40:53.740 --> 40:57.580
Oh, no friend what are raccoons?

41:05.580 --> 41:07.580
Any time there's a lengthy pause

41:07.580 --> 41:09.180
I know that it's wrong

41:09.180 --> 41:11.500
You almost don't have to hit the button, right

41:13.740 --> 41:14.940
Pleature creatures

41:15.980 --> 41:17.980

41:24.540 --> 41:27.580
Yeah, I'd love to phone in Patrick. What do you got for bleacher creatures?

41:28.860 --> 41:31.100
I'm assuming it's the band that's said in the bleacher.

41:33.100 --> 41:35.900
The correct answer was what group of fans needs to calm down?

41:35.900 --> 41:36.940
Oh, he was right

41:37.900 --> 41:39.500
That's true. You were right, though.

41:39.500 --> 41:43.100
All right, Joel just pulled a head by phoning a friend that doesn't feel fair, but he controls the board

41:44.060 --> 41:46.140

43:09.020 --> 43:11.020

43:15.020 --> 43:23.020
Yeah, what is the factory production owned by Carnegie?

43:23.740 --> 43:25.740
Johnny

43:26.540 --> 43:30.140
What Carnegie Hall steel girders are made of?

43:30.940 --> 43:35.420
The answer we were looking for is what was Andrew Carnegie's favorite metal

43:36.700 --> 43:39.580
Oh, say good one. Marika was closest

43:40.300 --> 43:44.620
I'm gonna give it to her and she controls the board. We're just gonna give it to people who are close. No

43:45.420 --> 43:48.780
Yeah, yeah, so well some more importantly, but that's close

43:50.380 --> 43:54.380

Marie can controls the board yet again. No, take all things Carnegie for 300

44:16.860 --> 44:20.700
You got Marie can first at 900 Joel and second at 800 Johnny and said it started. It's sort of

44:20.700 --> 44:24.780
You noted that I haven't lost any points for getting things wrong. Nobody has. Yeah

44:25.500 --> 44:33.420

45:02.940 --> 45:04.940
It's what did Andrew Carnegie have

45:07.980 --> 45:09.980

Couple

45:32.860 --> 45:34.860
You said who owns yeah

45:36.700 --> 45:38.700

45:39.100 --> 45:41.100
the sponsors for

45:42.700 --> 45:45.500
Public Broadcasting station

45:46.380 --> 45:48.380
Johnny

45:48.380 --> 45:52.620
A family who liked to attend Yankees games

45:53.260 --> 45:56.460
That's basically exactly right who loves the Yankees

45:57.820 --> 45:58.780
Crazy

45:58.780 --> 46:04.300
That isn't saying all right Johnny controls the board. We it's it's it's not anybody's game necessarily

46:04.300 --> 46:05.820
Joel can't win but he can

46:06.540 --> 46:11.020
tie which would be really frustrating okay that's never happened in Jeferty history before

46:11.740 --> 46:15.660
That means her first Johnny and Marie could tie for first Joel

46:17.420 --> 46:19.420
In third actually

46:19.420 --> 46:22.780
Trick question nobody has ever had their last name on the back of a Yankees jersey

46:28.700 --> 46:31.340
Nobody has ever had their last name on the back

46:32.220 --> 46:35.100
What is there is no player name to nobody?

46:39.420 --> 46:43.180
What did you say I didn't say anything you said a rod yeah okay

46:45.500 --> 46:47.500
phrase it as a question who is a rod

46:50.380 --> 46:52.380
Nobody's in your heart

46:54.380 --> 46:56.380
This is the easiest one

46:56.940 --> 46:59.980
I also think you showed us the answer to this one before we started

46:59.980 --> 47:02.860
He didn't get it he know it was just just the question

47:02.860 --> 47:04.860
uh

47:06.620 --> 47:10.860
Trick question nobody's ever had their last engineer you're an engineer reverse engineer

47:11.580 --> 47:13.580
The sentence into a question

47:16.460 --> 47:19.020
What is what is on the back of

47:19.340 --> 47:21.740
Jersey who has had

47:23.740 --> 47:27.980
Absolutely correct although that was your second guess so

47:30.380 --> 47:33.660
I get it because they don't have names on the back

47:33.660 --> 47:38.060
Yeah, we're looking for who's the only player to ever have their name on the grace of the back of Yankees costume

47:38.060 --> 47:40.060
Yeah, what

47:41.980 --> 47:47.900
All about the name on the front of the jersey Marie. Okay, and watch baseball baseball sucks. Sorry

47:49.100 --> 47:51.100

47:51.100 --> 47:54.860
Hating and baseball. I think I'll give it I'll give 50 to Johnny because you you guess twice

47:55.820 --> 47:58.220
So yeah Johnny wins

48:02.780 --> 48:04.780

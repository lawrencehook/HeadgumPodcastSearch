00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:05.000 --> 00:32.000
In studio, everything's clean. That I can assure you.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.000
Yeah. How does everybody feel? I feel a little frazzled after which has happened.

00:39.000 --> 00:49.000
I don't know what you were doing right beforehand, but basically what's that face?

00:49.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah, you kind of suddenly just stipulated and slapped your pint glass of cold brew onto the ground onto the sandbags onto your tote bag onto the camera onto the cord loop.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
My phone. Yeah, I'm sure you spent the better part of five minutes cleaning that up.

01:14.000 --> 01:21.000
Casey, a frazzled, because you've been in this position before, if we were to call when you used to.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Yeah, you spray it on. Champagne everywhere.

01:24.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah. So, repeat event slightly less sticky. Fortunately, didn't get on any equipment, but it was a pint glass, which is very big.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
It was filled up right now. It was filled to the brim with cold brew concentrate.

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
The caffeine equivalent of five coffees just filled everywhere at the tip of the glass over. That was full to the brim.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Yeah, it was probably at the logo. Yeah.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
Dame Lillard style. Nice.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
Thursday, July 21st.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
What?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
The fact that it's not really playing.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Yeah.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
But in the end.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
It was also just like you, it didn't look like you were doing anything.

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
So, it just kind of, almost felt like Casey was the one that clapped.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
We tried to get a producer camera on Casey for this episode, but we're going to have to do it next time.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
I could hold up my iPhone and film him in the entire time.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
You run out of storage in five minutes.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
But what a way to go.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
We have in studio. I should have started with this. Two New Yorkers. We've got Kayla.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
More reality on the horn.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
And Marieka Brown, I think, bringing up the rear.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Interesting.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
And so where do I go?

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Here is here the middle cog.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
It's a machine.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
It'll be nice.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm a middle child.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Are you?

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Was your experience to a text book or was it better than that?

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
To text back.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
What is the middle child known for?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Being overlooked.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Because it's all about the extremes, the youngest and the oldest.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Which of your brothers is overlooked?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Because you're the youngest, right?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Yeah.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
The middle child, you know, graphic designer.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
I don't know if he was overlooked.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Seems like he was properly looked.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
But I'd have to ask him for his own personal.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Oh, coffee almost filled me.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Oh, God.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Yeah.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
That's good.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I don't want to call him right now.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Do you text?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
All right.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Hey, were you overlooked growing up?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
It's kind of like the text that we almost made.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Jeff sent.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Right.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
I did send the text.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Not the one you.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
If you wanted me to send my ex-girlfriend, we're on good terms, right?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Yeah.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
And I couldn't do that.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Interesting.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Because even if you're on good terms, that's not a good text.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Because it means I'm about to say something that might put us on bad terms.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Right.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
How is Los Angeles treating you guys?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
You were just here.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
I was just here.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Yeah.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Since 2019.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Right.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
How's it changed?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
There's putting stores.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Hmm.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Have a notice.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Well, it's been pretty much the same.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Oh, certainly.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
She has brought up multiple times at the noodle places gone.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
But that was even before the pandemic.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
There was a place very close by here called We Have Noodles.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
So it was my favorite restaurant in LA.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
And it's gone.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
But you have noodle.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
It feels like a cardboard sign.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
So it was really like one of the best deals I've ever eaten in my life.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
It was like Suvee Chicken breast soup.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Pickled long beans.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
I'll never forget it.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
And I'll never be able to read it.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I'll be chicken breast.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
And long bean long beans.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
It's for 81.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Where's your noodles?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Yeah.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
There are noodles.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
You bet there in noodles.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
How did you even find that place?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
My friend.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I was one of my friends.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
I think it was like on this block on the corner.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Like it was very close here.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Yeah.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Because there's, there is a noodle place.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
And it's called Needle.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Yeah.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
I think it was in that building.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Yeah.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
I think it did the giant Isaac bread cone next door.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Oscar Isaac.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
And his brother got into the bakery.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Yeah.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Giant.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Ryan?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
No.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
C-I-A-N.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
The Dean's Ryan.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
It's J-Y-A-N.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Which does feel like Jean Ryan.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Casey, did you ever go to this noodle place?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Have you heard of it?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I've never heard of this place.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
No.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Now I feel like I'm being gas-lit.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Like, oh, is it real?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
I can't.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I know what I'm saying.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
I assure you.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Everywhere I liked in New York, you were like, okay.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
That's the place.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Well, because you got really into Z-Bars.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Like, a month and a year trip.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
I discovered that.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Well, I know that everybody loves Z-Bars.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
But I emerged out of the subway station.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Whatever the fucking thing is.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
The L.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Not the L. The, the six.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah, sure.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
The red one.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
No.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
No. That's the 123.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
123.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Yeah.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
In the upper west.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Amsterdam.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Yeah.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
And I was like, where have you been all my life?

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
It was love at first flight of stairs.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
I was like, I'm gonna say a flight of cheese.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
The architecture is unbelievable.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
I mean, the fucking, where did Jean-Leaning get shot?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Yeah, the Dakota.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Yeah, the Dakota.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I would kill to live there.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Sure.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Yeah.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I used to work at a hospital in New York City.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
And our claim to fame was that that's the hospital where Jean-Leaning died.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Yeah.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
That's all we learned.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Every day.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Great.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Let's, let's keep it going.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
I do want to hear more about you guys.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Jean-Leaning, but that's everybody's.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Save.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
I know.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
I know.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I actually have.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
I actually have.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
I actually have.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
I actually have.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I have.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I have a great answer for this.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
I have.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Craig.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
What's his name?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Daniel Craig.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Daniel Craig.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
What sucks is for you is that you just did this 48 hours.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Okay.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
I don't remember what I said.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Things have changed for me.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
In the landscape of James Bond.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
And obviously this will come out way later than this.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
But Joe Pera did announce that he is the new James Bond on Seth Meyers.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Last night.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
That's your.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
That's so that's my bond of the week.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Okay.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
He said we needed James Bond who knows a lot about trees and beans.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
And I agree with that.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
It's going on with you and beans today.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Yeah.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
It's going on with you and beans.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
It's going on with you and beans.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
I was quoting Joe Pera.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
You're not.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Very nice.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Why not a celibate.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Jane American James Bond.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
You said.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Why not a celibate American James Bond.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Hmm.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Okay.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
So that's my pick.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Joe Pera is great.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Sure.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
I'll stick with the Joe's and I'll go.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Joe Biden.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Hmm.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Come on man.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
What is that?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
That's why.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
That's a bunch of malarkey.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Wow.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Yes, go.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
It's a prayer.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Why won't you die?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Wow.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Yeah.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
That's my vote.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I'm talking about beans more.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
That's okay.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Bond the week.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
I'm going to go with my boy.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Who's new show I love Nathan Filder.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
I've heard it's good.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I haven't seen it.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
So good.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
That would be very funny.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
My friend used to live right next door to Nathan.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Really?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Right.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Like two bucks that way.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Hmm.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Casey.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Have a DJ quals.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Oh.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
He's golden shin.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Explained, please.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Yeah.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Who's DJ glam?

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
He's the guy from Road Trip.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Oh.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
He's, uh, I don't think he's been in a movie in 15 years.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
At least.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
What a comeback.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
That's what I'm saying.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
You may see it, man.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
You know, I had a different one written down.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
But I might change mine to Brandon Frazier for similar reason.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Brandon or Brendan.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Brandon.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Brandon.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Bro.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Different guy.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Yeah.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
He's the name sake of Frazier National Park.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Hmm.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
What?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
It's like glacier.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
But you're a little frozen.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
You just think.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
How many scrambled eggs and toss salads can you get there?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Um.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Well, none because it's a nation.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Great.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Cut this out.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Oh.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Creason.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Don't listen to it.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
You must not know about something.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
No.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
I stopped doing that.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Why?

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Why is that?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
I didn't like.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
It became not fun for me.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Uh, my pick this week is Prince Harry.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Because he needs.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
First of all, he needs to ingratiate himself back within like the classic UK culture.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Also.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
What is he, he's not doing anything.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
And he's living in here, I think.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Yeah.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Yeah.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
He can take a meeting at MGM like that.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
And, uh, I think it'd be interesting to see a royal bond.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
I'm sorry.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Did you think that was a pun?

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I thought that was sort of a bomb drop.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I thought that was interesting to you guys.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
That's some way.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
Fond is kind of like royalty almost to the culture.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Right.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Yeah.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
He's going.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Okay.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Okay.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Checking the levels or maybe we haven't recorded.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Grace and keep that in.

10:42.000 --> 10:48.000
I'm worried about the sound effects playing in the room and then hitting KC's mic.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I'm worried about it hitting my ear.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Yeah.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Definitely.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
You really are.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Make sure killer those.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Yeah.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Make sure that everything works a second time.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
So I don't even know if it worked on the Tuesday episode.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
We did the same thing.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
But uh, there was some issues for sure.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Hmm.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Like echo.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Yeah.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
I wasn't there.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I didn't hear that.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Yeah.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
The ash thing or the echo.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Be echo.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
And here's a gash thing.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Oh, the gash thing was a hit.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
That doesn't come out yet, right?

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
It comes out tomorrow morning, but I know it's going to be a hit.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Right.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Okay.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Just you.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
You.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
You.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Yeah.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
That'll be a hit.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
The core four.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Yeah.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Let's take it back to.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Kaelen.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Maria.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Good.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Los Angeles.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Um.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
How long are you here?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Uh, till Monday.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Okay.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
So that's enough time to maybe have a little wrong day boo.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Let's talk about dating an LA.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Yeah.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Uh.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Are you curious?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
No.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
What the scene is like here compared to New York.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Not really.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Really.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Yeah.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
But what about like, yeah.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Cause I was thinking we could go to the.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
That's a good idea.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Yeah.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
I don't know.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I really like the wingman you.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Yeah.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
That's cool.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
That's nice of you.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Um.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I don't think I need to go to Cebiland then.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Have you been?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
No.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I ran into the last time Jake was in town.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
I think you weren't there, but I ran into Jake and Marty at Cebiland.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
And I just surf with Jake that morning.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Do you go off?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
What's that?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Do you go off?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Or was that just a coincidence?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Well, it's kind of interesting actually.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Because like, Cebiland was like the bar last year.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Yeah.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Okay.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
So what?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Are you like meeting me where I'm at?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
I don't think so.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
I.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
That was every weekend we were going.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
I was interested.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
And then this year it hasn't been.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
It's interesting.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
It's been.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Yeah.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I've maybe gone twice since I got back from New York which.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Uh, for those who aren't familiar.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
This is like a fine bar in Los Angeles.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
But uh, something we're placed at like 4,100 bar.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
You're going there every weekend.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Almost every weekend.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Wow.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Interesting.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
That's crazy to me because.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
That was like a spot like a decade ago.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Right.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
And then it was in cycling.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
And now it's back.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Yeah.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
That's become cool and then overcrowded.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
And then it becomes boring again.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
And then it becomes cool again.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
100%.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
There was uh, what was the old place?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Uh, ten saddle trees.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Oh, yes.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
The saddle.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
It was the spot 2019.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
It was.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Covid.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Yeah.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
That's a real bummer.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Uh, there was a dance party there every Saturday called Dancer Self Clean.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
That was a lot.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
That's fun.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Yeah.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Um, but we're not here to talk about fucking this satellite.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
But you.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Right.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Right.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
That clubs in L.A.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
We're here to talk about L.A.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Rex.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
What's that?

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
It's, uh, you know, Rex Orange County.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Yeah.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
This is Rex Los Angeles County.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
So do you guys need any Rex?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Like.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Oh, Rex.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Yeah.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Uh.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Where did you guys eat dinner last night?

13:59.000 --> 13:59.500
Yeah.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.500
Um, some semi-trap.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.500
semi-trapic.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.500
With Martian Cohen.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.500
Marti loves me.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.500
Yeah.

14:05.500 --> 14:06.500
Yeah.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.500
But they're with him.

14:07.500 --> 14:08.500
He was waxing politically about it.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.500
And they don't have much food.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.500
They don't get off.

14:10.500 --> 14:11.500
No.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.500
If one popcorn's on your menu.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.500
Oh, no.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.500
Oh, no.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.500
On the menu.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.500
Hot.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.500
Do you want?

14:19.500 --> 14:20.500
No.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.500
That'll be 11.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.500
Why?

14:23.500 --> 14:24.500
L.A.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.500
L.A. Oyster Bar.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.500
I love that place.

14:26.500 --> 14:27.500
Yeah.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.500
A highly recommend.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.500
You don't like the marinated shrimp cocktail.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.500
Uh.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.500
Thoughts?

14:33.500 --> 14:36.500
Didn't know they had that.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.500
You don't really recommend you.

14:38.500 --> 14:42.500
Oyster's Rockefeller clams casino.

14:42.500 --> 14:43.500
Oh, god.

14:43.500 --> 14:44.500
And a fuzz and roast.

14:44.500 --> 14:48.500
That's a fuzzy fuzz and roast on the side.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.500
What's the only steak you can have as a side?

14:51.500 --> 14:52.500
This is a riddle.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.500
What do we say?

14:53.500 --> 14:54.500
What?

14:55.500 --> 14:58.500
Namely, only steak you can have on the side.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.500
Yeah.

14:59.500 --> 15:00.500
A side steak.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.500
Flank steak.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.500
Oh, wow.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.500
Is that enough?

15:04.500 --> 15:06.500
Because you're flank.

15:06.500 --> 15:07.500
Okay.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.500
I was thinking like hanging on a hanger on.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.500
Yeah.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.500
It's got on the side too, right?

15:11.500 --> 15:12.500
Yeah.

15:12.500 --> 15:13.500
Yeah.

15:13.500 --> 15:14.500
Don't worry.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.500
And steak, those.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.500
That could be the answer to your riddle.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.500
Yeah.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.500
What's going to steak you can have on the side?

15:18.500 --> 15:19.500
No.

15:19.500 --> 15:20.500
Because steak for eyes.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.500
Hmm.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.500
Better than yours.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.500
Or is it flank steak?

15:23.500 --> 15:25.500
Flank steak's really funny.

15:25.500 --> 15:26.500
Flank is a side.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.500
I think steak rises a better punch line to that.

15:28.500 --> 15:29.500
I don't think so.

15:29.500 --> 15:30.500
Casey.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.500
Neither are you saying marriage to another.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.500
We have a little bit more time.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.500
Let's talk about this.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.500
Upcoming imminent formula one podcast.

15:45.500 --> 15:46.500
Wow.

15:46.500 --> 15:47.500
Can we?

15:47.500 --> 15:48.500
Should we?

15:48.500 --> 15:49.500
It's very.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.500
We've been talking about it.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.500
I don't think it's a secret.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.500
Yeah.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.500
I mean, we want to make.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.500
We want to do a formula on podcast.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.500
Basically, we have a meeting.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.500
The truth for August 4th.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.500
How do you win?

16:00.500 --> 16:01.500
23.

16:01.500 --> 16:02.500
Yeah.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.500
Um.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.500
I'm excited.

16:05.500 --> 16:06.500
Are you?

16:06.500 --> 16:07.500
Yeah.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.500
Okay.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.500
That meeting can be the first episode.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.500
I don't think so.

16:10.500 --> 16:11.500
Because we have to do it about.

16:11.500 --> 16:12.500
What is it?

16:12.500 --> 16:13.500
The.

16:13.500 --> 16:14.500
The.

16:14.500 --> 16:15.500
The Italian one is this weekend.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.500
Nope.

16:16.500 --> 16:17.500
The fucking.

16:17.500 --> 16:18.500
Yeah.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.500
The Austrian.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.500
It's French.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.500
No.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.500
I'm 100%.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.500
Circuit.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.500
Polary card.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.500
This is why you can never read on the podcast.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.500
Yeah.

16:27.500 --> 16:28.500
You just don't know your shit.

16:28.500 --> 16:29.500
Yeah.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.500
And it's.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.500
He's a fish now.

16:37.500 --> 16:42.500
I do think that something that I don't respect about myself is that I feel like I

16:42.500 --> 16:43.500
Dabble in a lot.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.500
Yeah.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.500
And I don't dive into any one thing.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.500
Well, you do dive in.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.500
We just dive out really fast.

16:49.500 --> 16:50.500
Yeah.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.500
Yeah.

16:51.500 --> 16:52.500
Even that hat you want to be a hockey fan.

16:52.500 --> 16:53.500
Yeah.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.500
Yeah.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.500
Yeah.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.500
Oh.

16:57.500 --> 16:58.500
You're being read to films.

16:58.500 --> 16:59.500
I know.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.500
Yeah.

17:00.500 --> 17:03.500
You're like a lot of no trades in a master of even less than.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.500
Yeah.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.500
Black of all trades.

17:06.500 --> 17:10.500
You know, little about everything and nothing about all.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.500
I know a lot about 60s rock.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.500
But even that is like new.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.500
It's like four years.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.500
Right.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.500
Yeah.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.500
But that's still new.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.500
I mean, it's like.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.500
Yeah.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.500
I had a conversation.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.500
What trivia category would you know the most about?

17:26.500 --> 17:27.500
Music.

17:27.500 --> 17:28.500
Music.

17:28.500 --> 17:29.500
Yeah.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.500
But it's specifically what kind of music.

17:30.500 --> 17:33.500
Any music, but mostly for 60, 70s.

17:33.500 --> 17:34.500
Interesting.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.500
I had a conversation on Saturday night from.

17:36.500 --> 17:40.500
I think two, 30 in the morning to five, 30 in the morning on somebody's soup.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.500
And we were talking about music because they were on musicians.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.500
And I was talking about the, this is not interesting.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.500
No.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.500
You guys have nothing to add.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.500
I can ask you a trivia question.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.500
Yeah.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.500
That way.

17:52.500 --> 17:53.500
Okay.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.500
Exactly how much he knows about music.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.500
This is a softball question.

17:55.500 --> 17:56.500
You don't get it.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.500
You are a disgrace.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.500
Well, again, I know music.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.500
I don't really know sport.

17:59.500 --> 18:00.500
It's a music question.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.500
You said it.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.500
Yeah.

18:02.500 --> 18:03.500
Like you're playing softball.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.500
What?

18:04.500 --> 18:08.500
Musician has affiliation with the Manson family.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.500
Oh, Brian Wilson.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.500
Good job.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.500
And how did he die?

18:13.500 --> 18:15.500
Uh, or not Brian Wilson.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.500
Uh, starts with an R.

18:17.500 --> 18:18.500
There Wilson brother.

18:18.500 --> 18:19.500
In correct.

18:19.500 --> 18:20.500
It was Brian Wilson.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.500
I'm pretty sure.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.500
Oh, I think it was Dennis.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.500
Dennis.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.500
Dennis.

18:25.500 --> 18:26.500
Kevin.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.500
That's the most.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.500
Okay.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.500
How did Dennis Wilson die?

18:29.500 --> 18:30.500
I don't know.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.500
Okay.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.500
He drowned.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.500
That sucks.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.500
All right.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.500
Who's in the band fun with a period?

18:36.500 --> 18:37.500
Oh, Nate Rus.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.500
Jack Antonov and then the third guy that nobody cares about.

18:40.500 --> 18:43.500
Did you know that Adam was in the format with the Nate?

18:43.500 --> 18:44.500
Yeah.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.500
Yeah.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.500
Yeah.

18:47.500 --> 18:48.500
Yeah.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.500
Yeah.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.500
Yes, baby.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.500
I loved the format.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.500
What the fuck?

18:53.500 --> 18:54.500
I know.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.500
I know.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.500
We all learned this on the on the retreat.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.500
I was there.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.500
I didn't hear that.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.500
I don't really know what that is.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.500
Really.

19:02.500 --> 19:03.500
Yeah.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.500
Adam's such a sick guy.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.500
He was in the format and then he worked at kink.com.

19:07.500 --> 19:08.500
Yeah.

19:08.500 --> 19:09.500
That's awesome.

19:09.500 --> 19:10.500
What a cool trajectory.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.500
And now he works at head go interesting.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.500
You should have a month.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.500
It's a downward trajectory.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.500
Yeah.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.500
In a way.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.500
Yeah.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.500
In terms of notoriety.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.500
Although more people know headgun than the format.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.500
I was obsessed with the format.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.500
Yeah.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.500
I went to every single show in the New England area.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.500
So you told him that.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.500
Oh, yeah.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.500
And then I made him get on a zoom with my best friend.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.500
And I thought we could be like, oh my god.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.500
That's crazy.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.500
Shout out the format for those who know.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.500
Dog problems.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.500
Yeah.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.500
Format played at.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.500
Universal Studios.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.500
2006.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.500
I was better.

19:46.500 --> 19:47.500
What was that?

19:47.500 --> 19:48.500
Elvis.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.500
Yes.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.500
Don't say that.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.500
But that's cool Casey.

19:51.500 --> 19:52.500
That was really cool.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.500
Who else played there?

19:54.500 --> 19:56.500
The format ceiling when I remember.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.500
Wow.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.500
Everyone knows this band.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.500
I've never even heard of it.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.500
Can we go around really quick and say our favorite song?

20:01.500 --> 20:02.500
Never mind.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.500
And we're back.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.500
You know Kevin loves uncle is in the beach voice.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.500
Yeah.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.500
Okay.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.500
Um.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.500
Sorry.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.500
It's he's frazzled.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.500
Have you guys seen this show Beach, Fizam?

20:22.500 --> 20:23.500
Beach?

20:23.500 --> 20:25.500
Shazam?

20:25.500 --> 20:26.500
Shazam.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.500
Oh, my god.

20:27.500 --> 20:28.500
Is that tune?

20:28.500 --> 20:29.500
Yes.

20:29.500 --> 20:30.500
I haven't seen it.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.500
Hosted by Jamie Fox.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.500
I believe on CBS.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.500
Sure.

20:36.500 --> 20:41.500
Basically, it's just can you name this song before the app Shazam does.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.500
Okay.

20:42.500 --> 20:43.500
So I thought we could play that.

20:43.500 --> 20:44.500
There's no twist to it.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.500
It's just I thought that'd be fun.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.500
Okay.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.500
Are you guys ready?

20:48.500 --> 20:49.500
Sure.

20:49.500 --> 20:50.500
Yeah.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.500
I'll tell you this at the same time.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.500
One at a time.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.500
I think in the show, they elect someone.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.500
So just for every round.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.500
Okay.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.500
Whoever does the fastest on this, right?

21:01.500 --> 21:02.500
Yeah.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.500
Okay. So that's the name of the game.

21:03.500 --> 21:04.500
Beach Shazam.

21:04.500 --> 21:05.500
Okay.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.500
Casey also feel free to play along.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.500
But you guys have to elect someone.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.500
There's six songs.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.500
Okay.

21:11.500 --> 21:12.500
So.

21:12.500 --> 21:13.500
Okay.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.500
Just isn't the show.

21:14.500 --> 21:15.500
You guys ready?

21:15.500 --> 21:16.500
Yeah.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.500
All right.

21:17.500 --> 21:20.500
Classic music.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.500
I don't know.

21:21.500 --> 21:26.500
What am I able to name what this is?

21:26.500 --> 21:27.500
You guys lost.

21:27.500 --> 21:31.500
That was a hit tempo by Edwin Rutton.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.500
Yeah.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.500
Are they all obscure?

21:33.500 --> 21:34.500
Yeah.

21:34.500 --> 21:35.500
Real songs I wonder.

21:35.500 --> 21:36.500
I just was like, what, you know.

21:36.500 --> 21:37.500
Yeah.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.500
What popular songs are there in the 17th century?

21:39.500 --> 21:40.500
Right.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.500
Yeah.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.500
Here we go.

21:42.500 --> 21:43.500
You guys lost that one.

21:43.500 --> 21:46.500
Here we go.

21:46.500 --> 21:54.500
Just going well.

21:54.500 --> 21:57.500
The nutcrackers theme.

21:58.500 --> 22:12.500
So I'm just so slow and quiet.

22:12.500 --> 22:16.500
This is fantastic.

22:16.500 --> 22:20.500
You guys are getting more time because Shazam can't hear it.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.500
Okay.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.500
That's fair.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.500
Did it just stop?

22:23.500 --> 22:25.500
It was a short song.

22:26.500 --> 22:30.500
Like the background to a Disney cartoon.

22:30.500 --> 22:31.500
I know.

22:31.500 --> 22:34.500
All right.

22:34.500 --> 22:35.500
That's a failed round.

22:35.500 --> 22:36.500
Okay.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.500
Shazam can't recognize it.

22:38.500 --> 22:41.500
That one was Symphony number six.

22:41.500 --> 22:42.500
Shikovsky.

22:42.500 --> 22:43.500
Oh.

22:43.500 --> 22:44.500
Shaz's pretty famous.

22:44.500 --> 22:45.500
Yeah.

22:45.500 --> 22:46.500
Next one is Mambo number five.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.500
Flight of the Bumblebee.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.500
Nope.

22:52.500 --> 22:53.500
That's not a song.

22:54.500 --> 23:00.500
It sounds like the beginning of it's all coming back to me now.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.500
Shazam doesn't work.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.500
I don't think these are songs.

23:04.500 --> 23:05.500
Moller.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.500
Symphony number two.

23:07.500 --> 23:08.500
Sure.

23:08.500 --> 23:09.500
Okay.

23:09.500 --> 23:11.500
I wonder if the other three are going to be symphonies.

23:11.500 --> 23:14.500
I mean, would be fun if they were real songs.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.500
Really?

23:15.500 --> 23:16.500
Yeah.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.500
Then people can play it off.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.500
Right.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.500
I don't think people listen to this to play along.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.500
It's really torture.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.500
Right.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.500
I don't know.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.500
So the worst.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.500
The episode.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.500
The better.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.500
All right.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.500
So then you're nailing it.

23:30.500 --> 23:31.500
Mollers.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.500
Everybody's talking.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.500
Save Casey.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.500
I can't remember.

23:39.500 --> 23:40.500
Oh.

23:40.500 --> 23:41.500
That's that.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.500
I won't be able to go the name.

23:43.500 --> 23:44.500
I have no idea.

23:44.500 --> 23:48.500
Shazam does not work.

23:48.500 --> 23:50.500
That was a man without love by English.

23:50.500 --> 23:51.500
Engel.

23:51.500 --> 23:52.500
Engel, Bert, Humper, Dink.

23:52.500 --> 23:53.500
Uh.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.500
Try the Siri one because maybe Shazam is.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.500
All right.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.500
Here we go.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.500
Here.

23:58.500 --> 23:59.500
I'll do it on my phone and see it.

23:59.500 --> 24:00.500
Right.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.500
This is not seamless.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.500
In my head, this was going to kill.

24:04.500 --> 24:05.500
Interesting.

24:05.500 --> 24:06.500
Interesting.

24:06.500 --> 24:07.500
You did say that.

24:07.500 --> 24:08.500
You want to?

24:08.500 --> 24:09.500
Yeah.

24:09.500 --> 24:10.500
You want to hit play?

24:10.500 --> 24:11.500
Yep.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.500
We're back.

24:21.500 --> 24:35.500
Not able to find anything.

24:35.500 --> 24:38.500
Beethoven, Gross, Fuge.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.500
And it was Gross.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.500
Fuge.

24:41.500 --> 24:44.500
Oh, it was fun.

24:44.500 --> 24:45.500
Really quick.

24:45.500 --> 24:46.500
Okay.

24:46.500 --> 24:47.500
So it's over.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.500
Oh.

24:48.500 --> 24:49.500
I mean.

24:49.500 --> 24:50.500
Okay.

24:50.500 --> 24:51.500
No, you know what?

24:51.500 --> 24:52.500
That's good.

24:52.500 --> 24:53.500
Thank you.

24:53.500 --> 24:54.500
That was over.

24:54.500 --> 24:55.500
Let's get it started.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.500
Oh, like a piece.

24:56.500 --> 24:57.500
Oh.

24:57.500 --> 24:58.500
Oh.

24:58.500 --> 24:59.500
Oh.

24:59.500 --> 25:02.500
There you go.

25:02.500 --> 25:03.500
Um.

25:03.500 --> 25:04.500
L.A. bucket list.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.500
L.A. bucket list.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.500
What?

25:06.500 --> 25:07.500
To be L.A.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.500
Well, you know, that's why there.

25:09.500 --> 25:10.500
Where we are.

25:10.500 --> 25:11.500
Yeah.

25:11.500 --> 25:12.500
I wish I had time to see some of my friends.

25:12.500 --> 25:13.500
Probably don't.

25:13.500 --> 25:15.500
So that's kind of a bummer.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.500
We're here for Comic-Con.

25:18.500 --> 25:19.500
Yeah.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.500
Yeah.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.500
You want to talk about that a little bit?

25:22.500 --> 25:25.500
I mean, I'll probably have more to say when I get back.

25:25.500 --> 25:27.500
Obviously.

25:27.500 --> 25:28.500
Yeah.

25:28.500 --> 25:29.500
Sorry.

25:29.500 --> 25:30.500
It's trick money.

25:30.500 --> 25:31.500
No.

25:31.500 --> 25:33.500
Yeah.

25:33.500 --> 25:34.500
So.

25:34.500 --> 25:35.500
We might.

25:35.500 --> 25:36.500
Actually.

25:36.500 --> 25:39.500
Well, Jake mentioned that we might do another festival.

25:39.500 --> 25:40.500
Is that what you're trying to do?

25:40.500 --> 25:41.500
Had gum lights.

25:41.500 --> 25:42.500
Yeah.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.500
We're working on it.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.500
Where do you want to see it?

25:45.500 --> 25:46.500
Uh.

25:47.500 --> 25:48.500
I don't know.

25:48.500 --> 25:50.500
I think we're we're talking about.

25:50.500 --> 25:51.500
Port.

25:51.500 --> 25:52.500
Portland.

25:52.500 --> 25:53.500
Yeah.

25:53.500 --> 25:54.500
Portland.

25:54.500 --> 25:55.500
Yeah.

25:55.500 --> 25:56.500
Oh, yeah.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.500
Any time you talk.

25:58.500 --> 25:59.500
Any time I talk.

25:59.500 --> 26:01.500
You were just taking your email.

26:01.500 --> 26:02.500
Well, now I'm listening.

26:02.500 --> 26:03.500
Portland.

26:03.500 --> 26:04.500
Yeah.

26:04.500 --> 26:05.500
Sure.

26:05.500 --> 26:06.500
Portland.

26:06.500 --> 26:07.500
Seattle.

26:07.500 --> 26:08.500
Southwest.

26:08.500 --> 26:09.500
Why?

26:09.500 --> 26:10.500
London.

26:10.500 --> 26:11.500
I'd love to go.

26:11.500 --> 26:12.500
I'd love to go.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.500
I'd love to go.

26:14.500 --> 26:15.500
I'd love to go.

26:15.500 --> 26:16.500
OK.

26:16.500 --> 26:17.500
We can just join the London podcast festival.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.500
Also Tokyo.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.500
I'll be next.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.500
Australia, New Zealand.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.500
It's a lot of Australia.

26:23.500 --> 26:24.500
Have you been?

26:24.500 --> 26:25.500
No.

26:25.500 --> 26:26.500
I've ever been to with Lotho.

26:26.500 --> 26:27.500
What's the really happen there?

26:27.500 --> 26:30.500
What's the thing for data of like,

26:30.500 --> 26:31.500
most listenership?

26:31.500 --> 26:33.500
What's it called DMX or something?

26:33.500 --> 26:35.500
DMX is dead.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.500
Right, well, that's, like the demographics.

26:38.500 --> 26:41.500
DMMA district, metropolitan area.

26:41.500 --> 26:42.500
That's exactly right.

26:42.500 --> 26:43.500
Yeah.

26:43.500 --> 26:51.660
where are our biggest cities? New York for sure. Toronto I think. Great. No, I mean it's usually like

26:52.300 --> 27:00.620
New York LA, Boston, Austin, Chicago, Cleveland, Atlanta. Very coastal, very urban. Yeah.

27:02.620 --> 27:09.100
Which do you know? We can do Parfait. Pari? Pari? Yeah. It doesn't really do well in a non-English speaking

27:09.820 --> 27:20.940
Yeah. Romani, Romania. I have the hiccups. Because you guys were housing cake before this.

27:22.380 --> 27:29.820
You forced fed everyone at the office. Yeah, he's been talking about it. Yeah. I had half a cake left over.

27:29.820 --> 27:35.980
You're cousin baked and you cousin baked the cake for obviously tells birth day. We finished half of it.

27:36.620 --> 27:41.660
Brought in the other half. And then everybody here got together eight a lot of cake and they're still

27:42.300 --> 27:47.340
half of that half left. Can I actually bring something up? Oh, I think I'm just starting talking.

27:47.340 --> 27:53.340
So why am I even here? Please continue. I was just going to say, I feel like this is a good place to

27:53.340 --> 27:57.500
address what I think is some tension between us and me. Oh, I mean you. Yeah, because you asked me

27:57.500 --> 28:01.900
if I want to cake and I said no thank you and the look I got. Because I'm trying to, I'm trying to

28:01.900 --> 28:06.780
hoard this cake. I like hoard really. I'm trying to come home with an empty tray. Oh, I see.

28:07.500 --> 28:10.380
Well, I just felt like you were really mad at me and I just want to make sure we're okay.

28:10.380 --> 28:14.540
Because I feel like everyone should be doing their part to finish the cake. It doesn't matter. It doesn't

28:14.540 --> 28:17.180
doesn't matter. I just, I don't really like desserts. Yeah. Interesting.

28:18.220 --> 28:23.420
Except like sour patch kids. Yeah. Or sour punch straw, sour belt. I mean,

28:23.420 --> 28:26.940
like pastries and I don't like candy. Uh, well, it looks old.

28:26.940 --> 28:32.540
Oh, sweet. Anyway, it's just want to say I'm so sorry if I'm going to do. So you would never have

28:32.540 --> 28:38.460
any cake or cookie? Not never, but not often. Fresh baked chocolate chip cookies in the kitchen.

28:38.460 --> 28:43.260
Are you having one? Probably not. Wow. They were brown butter chocolate. I mean, I try when I had

28:43.260 --> 28:48.460
a little piece of cookie at Mike's birthday when we got him living cookies. Oh, those are, and you're

28:48.460 --> 28:53.660
not even into that. No. Interesting. Why do you think that is? I don't know. Those are like the easiest

28:54.620 --> 28:57.740
thing. Yeah. It's not about the difficulty of eating the dessert. It's about her not having

28:57.740 --> 29:02.540
a big sweet tooth. Yeah, but you can have not a big sweet tooth. It's still on a cookie. No, I don't.

29:02.540 --> 29:07.660
I would rather have a cheese plate than any dessert any day. Ice cream couldn't make me. No,

29:07.660 --> 29:14.380
no ice cream for me. I'll skip the tart and get in a maro, no need. Oh, yeah. I mean, I drink my desserts.

29:14.380 --> 29:20.300
Yeah. It's a digestive. Yeah. What's the deal with almonds as like a pastry? Like I accidentally

29:20.380 --> 29:26.700
got like an almond croissant. Yeah. Marzipan is like my favorite almond. How do you make that?

29:26.700 --> 29:30.860
It's not just almonds, right? Yes. Yeah. But they make it sweet in a way.

29:30.860 --> 29:36.060
Almond's our sweet. That's what cyanide tastes like. Oh, really? It's almost like alcohol.

29:36.060 --> 29:38.940
Yeah. So if I, yeah, never mind. No, he's right. Plants I've seen.

29:39.740 --> 29:45.100
Welcome to the price all right.

29:50.220 --> 29:57.020
So the name of the game is the price all right. Basically what I'm going to do with all the talk of the

29:57.500 --> 30:04.620
did you just get Photoshop? Because you've been Photoshop more recently. The gash cab, the price all right.

30:04.700 --> 30:09.340
The Instagram posts. It's all, yeah, the Instagram. That's all new. Try to put some more effort into

30:09.340 --> 30:16.940
the show. I love it. Yeah. Um, the, it's called the prices all right. Yeah. It's nice. But the output doesn't

30:16.940 --> 30:24.220
seem more of it. It's funny that the CBS look good. It's nice that you're trying, but it's a big CBS

30:24.220 --> 30:30.300
stay on the podcast. We're really celebrating it. Yeah. The eye. Then the eyes have it. CBS gave

30:30.300 --> 30:36.540
paid me the most in my life ever. So I, I feel brand-loiled. And you've worked ever many years.

30:36.540 --> 30:44.620
Well, yeah. Anyway, price all right. The price all right. The idea is there's been a lot of

30:44.620 --> 30:51.580
talk in the news recently about, you know, the more higher ups that were involved in that fault

30:51.580 --> 30:58.540
for the January 6th insurrection and attempted coup. But what about all the people that were there,

30:58.620 --> 31:06.300
the writers who are currently in jail, which I'll remind everyone does not mean like you tried to say

31:06.300 --> 31:11.740
on a previous episode. Well, I wouldn't talk with too much freedom about it because you might end

31:11.740 --> 31:23.340
up locked into litigation. Here we go. I'm going to present you a writer. I'm going to tell you

31:23.340 --> 31:29.020
what they did. And then prices right rules. You have to tell me how many how long their sentences

31:29.020 --> 31:33.660
in months. Okay. This is for actual cash. Are we calling them writers or patriots?

31:35.340 --> 31:51.340
Oh my god. Holy shit. I'm just kidding. Nice. Here we go. Our first contest in a way. This is Robert Scott

31:51.420 --> 32:01.260
Palmer. He hurled wooden boards in an extinguisher at police officers. What do you think this

32:01.260 --> 32:13.100
sentence is? Is this a sentence served in jail? Or is that something else? Jail. Okay. Nine months. Nine

32:13.260 --> 32:19.580
months. One month. Okay. Fourteen months. All right.

32:27.420 --> 32:38.940
I had like a good case he gets. Yeah, Casey. Twenty months. Casey takes the cake without one so to speak.

32:39.020 --> 32:44.300
He got sixty three months. Wow. Yeah. He's still in prison. Here we go.

32:46.860 --> 32:56.060
This is going to be Devlin Thompson. Devlin has salted up Devlin himself. Devlin has salted

32:56.060 --> 33:01.260
a police officer with a metal baton. And he also tried to throw a speaker at the police but missed

33:01.260 --> 33:08.860
and ended up injuring another writer. So does that take months off? I think it's still

33:09.180 --> 33:17.900
violent in a crime. He threw a speaker or the speaker that he's a little antsy guy.

33:18.940 --> 33:27.340
She's petite. Spaker of the house. Yeah, he looks like an extra from news. You mentally cut off so fast.

33:28.460 --> 33:35.100
You're like, I'll try this. I felt so small in that moment. Yeah. You know, I got it though.

33:35.180 --> 33:45.900
Labos. Okay. I'm going to say 16 months. 16 months. 70. 70 months. Give me 30 months. 30 months.

33:45.900 --> 33:54.700
Casey 45. Casey is once again correct. 46 months. Wow. I can't afford to see what's there.

33:55.900 --> 34:04.780
As I was just watching. I was taking note of what Devlin was up to. That looks like a Rosenberg

34:04.940 --> 34:17.180
brother. Oh my god. Lani Leroy. Comments. Lani drove to the capital from Alabama and a pickup

34:17.180 --> 34:23.580
truck loaded with a small arsenal of Molotov cocktails, a nine millimeter handgun, a rifle, a

34:23.580 --> 34:30.140
shotgun, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, large capacity ammunition feeding devices across

34:30.140 --> 34:36.940
bow with bolts, machetes, camouflage smoke detectors, and gas filled machine jars used to make

34:36.940 --> 34:45.820
napalm. Damn. But then he got sleepy and ended up crashing and charlet. I would also like to

34:45.820 --> 34:52.620
mention that he was 72 at the time. Wow. Sentences and carrying two handguns at the time of

34:52.700 --> 34:59.820
arrest. Jesus. Hmm. I could feel bad for this guy. Am I boring you? Yeah, a little bit.

35:00.620 --> 35:14.220
She had really. 71 months. Let's give him the chair. The judge did say I'd never seen a homemade

35:14.220 --> 35:21.420
batch of weaponry to the scale. Wow. Yeah. I mean whatever five years is in months,

35:21.900 --> 35:27.900
five times 12. You're on top of the math stuff pretty well. Yeah. 60. 60. I don't know.

35:29.580 --> 35:39.260
40. Okay. I'm going to say community service. He just has to work at a preschool for a year.

35:39.260 --> 35:47.980
Kayla takes it with 40. He got 46 months, which less than devil in. Yeah. We're looking through a wood.

35:47.980 --> 35:53.500
Yeah. I don't get how the first guy got the most. It seemed like his wasn't as bad as the other two.

35:53.500 --> 35:59.020
I think different juries, different judges. Yeah. Different executions.

36:01.820 --> 36:08.460
Nicholas. Is that a hand? What's that? Is that just him at a bills game?

36:10.460 --> 36:17.260
No way. That's the front camera on an iPhone. Like that. I feel like he either turned his phone around.

36:17.340 --> 36:22.300
Or it's a can't like a legit camera. He looks a little bit like one of my childhood best friends.

36:22.300 --> 36:28.140
Oh, yeah. This guy could be like a nice guy. Yeah. He threw various objects at police

36:29.500 --> 36:34.060
and including an orange traffic barrier and two stick-like objects.

36:35.340 --> 36:40.380
Prosecutors claimed the items were capable of inflicting serious bodily injury, but they didn't.

36:40.860 --> 36:47.820
Which I don't like his politics, but I'm a little bit like how did you go to jail for that? Yeah.

36:50.220 --> 36:52.140
Let's hear your guys' guesses.

36:54.140 --> 36:55.820
30? 30?

36:56.780 --> 36:57.260
One year.

37:00.540 --> 37:01.580
14 months.

37:02.540 --> 37:09.900
Murdie could take it 44 months. Only two months less than the guy who basically had an entire like third-world

37:09.900 --> 37:16.140
country's army arsenal in his fucking dodge. We should want to get this man out of prison. He's a hero.

37:16.140 --> 37:22.380
Oh my god. We do nothing for Britney Gardner or Brian Erwin. We do everything for Jake. Nicholas

37:22.460 --> 37:30.140
Languaren, Jacob, Anthony, Chan's Lee, aka the QAnon Shaman.

37:34.220 --> 37:38.940
All he really did was dress like a shaman and then like kind of waltz around. But what the

37:39.660 --> 37:45.100
prosecutor said was, what you did was terrible. You made yourself the epitome of the riot.

37:45.100 --> 37:49.340
You didn't slug anybody but what you did here was actually obstruct the functioning of the entire

37:49.340 --> 37:53.500
government, which is a serious crime.

37:56.140 --> 37:57.260
70 months.

37:59.980 --> 38:04.860
36. Everything seems to be in the 40s, so maybe there's some sort of precedent there.

38:05.500 --> 38:08.140
40 months. Okay. 15 months.

38:08.860 --> 38:17.660
I'm here as correct 41 months. Greg Rubenacker. This guy just vaped on a tour of the oval office.

38:17.740 --> 38:24.380
That's exactly right. All he did was smoke weed, but on Capitol grounds. And on live, it looks like.

38:24.380 --> 38:30.700
Yeah. That's his own inspiration. That's snapchat. Yeah. 10 months.

38:31.420 --> 38:35.420
Is that yellow facial hair? Yeah, it's what I'm trying to figure out. What's happening?

38:35.420 --> 38:37.180
Because that was his car for something. Yeah.

38:37.180 --> 38:39.580
Yeah. That's his weird like fur.

38:40.940 --> 38:46.300
Okay. Like it's under under chin beard situation. I think it's like an animal or a collar.

38:46.380 --> 38:49.020
Are we far in Egypt? Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.

38:49.820 --> 38:53.500
Everyone's yawning. Faster would be a little bit of a sign of a great thought.

38:54.700 --> 38:59.820
We're all groggy for meeting sandwiches. This dude smoked out the Capitol.

39:00.220 --> 39:05.340
So he hotboxed the Capitol. Yeah. That's a toned ugly. 20 months. Okay.

39:06.060 --> 39:10.380
I said 10. 18. Okay. Casey. 24.

39:12.220 --> 39:15.420
Casey takes it. 41 months. The same as the shot.

39:16.380 --> 39:20.220
Here we go. The thing is in the 40s. It's the same. Cleveland Meredith Jr.

39:20.780 --> 39:24.940
That's good. It seems kind of nice. Yes, seems good. He's also doing like motocross.

39:24.940 --> 39:29.420
It's just it's just like when our younger mirrors like this guy is good. Can you imagine

39:29.420 --> 39:35.580
describing like a sweet sort of nature enthusiast a little bit? I could see him being fine.

39:35.580 --> 39:39.340
And then when he's like drunk at the local dive, he starts saying racist thing.

39:39.340 --> 39:45.180
I know at a base level, I'm not going to trust anyone. He's he's sorry. He gives

39:45.180 --> 39:50.460
cuck energy. I he wishes he gives cuck energy. You're saying he's not even confident enough

39:50.460 --> 39:55.500
in his sexuality that he can't present that to his partner. No. Yeah. No. Not even. That's

39:55.500 --> 40:00.860
40 months. 40. Well, what did you say what he did? I mean, everyone. Okay. 41.

40:01.260 --> 40:06.700
Traveled from Colorado 41. Travel from Colorado to attend the riot, but later told investigators

40:06.700 --> 40:13.660
that he arrived too late in the air. He was helping a family of ducklings across a road in Missouri.

40:13.660 --> 40:17.980
The day after he sent a family member in Georgia, a text message threatening the kill

40:17.980 --> 40:25.740
Nancy Pelosi. So his mother contacted the FBI. I love that. He all love that energy.

40:25.740 --> 40:30.300
Yeah. Also Colorado. I love to see. Shut up for a second. I don't I never understand

40:30.300 --> 40:35.420
Colorado Republicans. Like that's I mean, there's there's a lot of them, but I feel like Colorado

40:35.420 --> 40:39.980
such a blue state. There's a lot of Republicans in California too. Yeah, everywhere. Yeah.

40:39.980 --> 40:45.900
Whatever. Um, so 41. 35. 35. Okay.

40:47.340 --> 40:54.140
Okay. So he just text it. He wasn't even there. I mean, he sent the text. Yeah. Well, he was there.

40:54.140 --> 40:59.500
He rightly. So he got there day later on the 9th. That was time. Let's just borrow.

40:59.500 --> 41:05.180
But but he wasn't there insurrecting it. No. Um,

41:06.140 --> 41:13.180
a verbal warning anybody. I'm almost ain't nobody was 28 months.

41:13.180 --> 41:18.780
So this guy's in prison. Robert Chapman. Oh,

41:18.780 --> 41:21.820
Martin Chaps. Martin Chapman seems like a nice guy.

41:23.500 --> 41:29.020
One week after January six, Chapman told someone on bumble that he took part in the riot.

41:29.020 --> 41:34.060
I did sort of the capital he wrote in a message. I made it all the way to station. Statuary hall.

41:34.540 --> 41:42.060
The person Chapman confessed to then replied, we are not a match ordered three months home. Oh, sorry three months.

41:42.060 --> 41:47.100
They went through tension and then there's a and then on top of that. He got this other sentence.

41:48.140 --> 41:54.780
Life. The chair for the fucking beard. I kind of fucked it up. 18 months probation.

41:56.060 --> 42:00.380
This has been the price. All right.

42:05.020 --> 42:19.580
Question. Yep. Take us through the thought process of making this second.

42:20.620 --> 42:26.540
Do you have a Google Doc going with a bunch of possibilities? Did you say this once in a joke slash

42:26.540 --> 42:32.380
tweet and you said, oh, this could be good for a segment one day and then you backed into the rules of the game?

42:32.860 --> 42:40.620
I have found that game show parodies do well on the show both with the audience and sometimes you guys have fun.

42:40.620 --> 42:45.180
So I was like, what do you think went wrong this time?

42:47.180 --> 42:53.180
Can we open up for feedback? Yeah, let's spend the next five minutes auditing me a little bit.

42:53.180 --> 42:57.340
I have a title first, right? I thought of, um,

42:57.500 --> 43:03.980
by the way, it's a really great title. The title is right. It's correct. Yeah. And then you backed into the game based on the time.

43:03.980 --> 43:09.260
Well, I was reading the news because I also come up with segments based on news and it was like an article about

43:09.980 --> 43:16.220
all the people who had been sentenced from the January 6 riots and I was like, oh, there'd be funny to guess.

43:16.220 --> 43:21.420
It could be funny to guess what their sentences are based on these things because a lot of these are ridiculous. They're all really ugly.

43:21.980 --> 43:26.620
Um, and then I backed my way into the the price-alt, right?

43:26.620 --> 43:31.660
Beach is in. I was like, that's a game show. I haven't parody yet. How do I make it frustrating to play?

43:31.660 --> 43:37.180
Yeah. It's not like early obscure classical music. Well, really famous classical music, but you guys are,

43:37.180 --> 43:39.820
well, I'm cultured. Yeah. So I'll sign.

43:41.180 --> 43:46.460
Well, I will say I preferred this to the game that you had us play one time of just watching you scroll through deadline.

43:47.420 --> 43:52.300
So this is this was much better than that. I'm not saying it. Well, it's like game gold.

43:53.180 --> 44:01.020
Jeff was unprepared today. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think that just in general game show parodies. I mean,

44:01.020 --> 44:08.460
I, this isn't really even a game show parody. I, it just is like the the rules kind of of one part of the

44:08.460 --> 44:13.340
prices, right? But I actually had went over pretty well because I did one to one. Well, that hasn't come out yet.

44:13.340 --> 44:18.540
So we don't know how it went. Yeah. And it sound incredibly offensive. Well, it's just in that of me.

44:21.740 --> 44:26.780
Looking at me. I didn't come up with that. Bodies are weird, man.

44:26.780 --> 44:30.300
Bodies are very weird. What's the, what's the gash equivalent for penis?

44:34.460 --> 44:36.940
Long bean. Pickled long bean.

44:37.500 --> 44:39.100
Oh, you're so bad.

44:40.140 --> 44:42.140
Men, we have members.

44:44.700 --> 44:49.420
Plogs. What do you guys have going on when you want to point the people to the floor's cases first? Wow.

44:51.260 --> 44:56.060
Follow me on Twitter at Casey Doniew and also later box. Why not? Yeah.

44:58.940 --> 45:03.340
Where do you go? Follow me on Twitter, Instagram and letter box.

45:03.340 --> 45:09.900
Statmer in Galon any more letter box followers, guys. How many letter box followers do you like 500 something?

45:10.460 --> 45:17.180
Can you like people's reviews or yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm here.

45:18.780 --> 45:20.780
I'll take it.

45:21.420 --> 45:23.420
TikTok okay, Blummer.

45:23.420 --> 45:41.340
I feel so unwelcome here. If you're a comic book, go to the newcomers panel, fear and

45:41.340 --> 45:47.740
Montreal go to Jake and a new show. Yeah. I don't think so. Come out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

45:47.740 --> 45:55.340
We both want to. Oh, yeah. Wow. Well, I hope we saw you there then. Yeah.

45:55.340 --> 46:00.780
Me too. Come to us. I don't know what else we're up to. There's so many things. We have a lot of things

46:00.780 --> 46:06.380
cooking at Jeff Way already on Twitter. Still nearing 10,000, 300 more to go. I think.

46:07.500 --> 46:15.100
And we'll have a company happy hour. If I make it. Well, that's nice. Oh, yeah. That's nice. I won't be here.

46:16.060 --> 46:20.540
No, you're going in New York. What's that? Oh, yeah. You're going in New York. I go to New York tomorrow.

46:20.540 --> 46:25.820
Oh, how long are you there for my mom's birthday? Oh, and it's nice. Yeah. We'll see you guys again next week.

46:26.620 --> 46:28.380
That's does.

46:29.980 --> 46:31.420
It really is does, but

46:45.100 --> 46:55.020
that was a hit dumb original.

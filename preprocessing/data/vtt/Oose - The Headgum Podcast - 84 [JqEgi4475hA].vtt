00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head gum original.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
That's a sinister dance.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
This is a head gum original.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
We'll steam it into the new year.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
2022.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
You shouldn't have the face of a guy that was like performing that song.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Like you are sort of like into it.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Like you had anything to do with it.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
We just hit a button.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
So like I guess removed the pride slash enjoy from your eyes.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
That had nothing to do with it.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
New yee.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Nice.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
No, it's a new year.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
We're going into come March the second year of the show,

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
which is fucking bonkers, Johnny.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
There's no way we started with a March of 2020.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
And it doesn't matter if the day we're spreading joy and liable.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
And that's what it's become about.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
And what has also come about is a cold following.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
And I think we owe it to our listeners to make the best product.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
All phones considered.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I'm through a great start.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
We have a lot to get to today.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
And I hope that that exhaust you.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
The idea of having activities multiple segments to get to.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
How are you guys?

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
New Year's Eve.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Let's start off with waxing.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
We've got Johnnyville on the sex.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Make a round the end of the facts.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
And a mirror blue and felt bringing up the rear.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Or we should say the New York Times is New York.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
I'm your blue.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Thank you.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Appreciate that.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Do you want to speak to that?

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
I was in an op-ed quoted in the lead paragraph of a pretty interesting.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
Peace with regards to the recent Omicron search in cases.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
And how.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
The idea of purchasing someone a test or say it faster.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
In this will be gone.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
The era is actually up to three.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
It's so self-serious.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Secrets say it to slash.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Birthday or anniversary gift.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
It was a white out of a white elephant gift.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
Because you are a white elephant.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Yeah.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Okay.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
That's one way to look at it.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Not necessarily.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
How I did.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Don't be sad.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
You like to stick around.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
And then that makes the sound effective mean.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Actually, I might change my name in here to the New York Times as a mirror.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
That's a good idea.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
It doesn't show up on the video.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yeah.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
But we'll now.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
All right.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
It'll boost us self esteem after you call them an elephant and said you wanted to die.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
He's gone.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
He obviously left.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Perfect.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Johnny, how is your music?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
What'd you do?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Uh, my New Jersey was fine.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Uh, we celebrated it together, Jeffrey.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
All right.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
It was fine.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
We got tested right before I walked into the party.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Correct.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Which actually does kill the energy, like walking in.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
You know, you're walking in like, oh, excited.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Going into a party.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
But you can't even walk inside like the actual place because you need to get tested.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
Wait outside for 15 minutes while the rapid test displays its results.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
And by that point, you really don't want to go in, but it's nice.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Did anybody?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
What is that?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
What are we looking at there?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
That's Johnny doing his rapid test.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Did anybody fail that test on the way into the party and just have to like turn around

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
and go home?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Nobody did.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Everybody was negative?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Yeah.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Flying colors.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
According to an at home rapid test.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Correct.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Yes.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
I got an oops all negative rapid.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Done in a stairwell.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
Where everyone is unmasked still.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
And so what was the one?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
My buddy, he was in that.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
We've already had it.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Sorry, don't talk over me.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Don't talk over me, my show.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
I wouldn't do that on fire.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
It sucks to know that I wasn't invited to this party.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
I'm just going to throw that out there immediately.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Would you have come?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
No.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
But I should have been invited.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
I'm sorry.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Next time I'll invite you to an event.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
No, it's fine.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
It's fine.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
I haven't seen Jeff the entire time he's been here.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Yeah.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
We're going on two months.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
How long?

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
You chose probably the worst two months in human history to live in New York.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
But yeah.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
It's Vincent's.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Can I move to celebrate all the room?

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Do you think Oma Kron would have hit New York as hard in the universe

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
that I don't move to New York for these months?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
No.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
That's what I was worried about.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
No.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Yeah.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Yeah.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
It's cool you guys had fun together though.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
I'm glad.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
I'm glad you were able to do stuff.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I feel like I'm in a bad position.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
It feels like you're putting me on the spot.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
No.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
I just stayed home in my house alone because I was scared to go outside.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
But, you know, it's cool.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Yeah.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Did you watch the ball drop or?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
No.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
I didn't.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
I watched the movie.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Abiza.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Right before midnight.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Is that the movie about?

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
How have you choose that?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I'm here to do that.

06:38.000 --> 06:48.000
I watched the film about Abiza to show a VCI was dead.

06:48.000 --> 06:55.000
But then I did, I did see all of the clips of Anderson Cooper and what's this face?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Andy Cohen.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Yeah.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Just being drunk is fuck.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
She was pretty great.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Have you seen this?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Yeah.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
I guess that's a new thing.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
People just get hammered on camera, on new years.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Like a bunch of channels had just like drunken hosts.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
I guess they all took it from what CNN's been doing for whatever reason.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Yeah.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Yeah.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
He really called out some people.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Mark Zuckerberg.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
That part.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
That part.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Oh my gosh.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Highly wreck.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Finding this clip.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
This wouldn't have happened.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
This was Dick Clark's New Year's Rock and Eve.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
There's a lot more over back then.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah.

07:38.000 --> 07:45.000
I made a joke about in 2018 about that show being called Dick Clark's New Year's Rock and Ass.

07:45.000 --> 07:53.000
And then Rajat Suresh tweeted New Year's New Year's New Year's Eve Rock and Bob.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
And it went viral.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
I like this year.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
That was this year.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
And I think it's a punch down.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
It's a first draft of mine.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
No, I'm so rocking ass.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Yeah.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Yeah.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
I'll see you don't have the built-in cloud slash credibility to go viral on Twitter.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Really?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Regardless of what you say.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Okay.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
Because I'm going viral is more than just coming up with a quippy one liner.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
It's about knowing enough people that follow you that can signal boost.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Yeah.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Your thoughts.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Yeah.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
And a mirror understands this because he's actually New York Times is a mirror.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Obviously.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I was in an up pretty interesting op-ed.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
I was quoted in the lead of a Times piece.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
A couple of things.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Exactly.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
About all that.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
About five minutes ago.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Baratum.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Like you had this reverse.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Because you kept talking about it the past two and a half weeks.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
It's pretty exciting.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Yeah.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I didn't do anything nearly as exciting.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
It's a big fucking deal, man.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
I've been in the crossword before.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
That's more of a big deal.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
The crossword was fun.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
The Jeopardy clue was a moment.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
But that awkward moment when you're quoted in the lead.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Was it?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Times piece.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Hit different.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Was it college?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Shepherdy.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Let's just go to the next segment.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
We are of his lovers.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Our Jeopardy is Jeopardy.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Are you guys doing a wordle?

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Have you seen the new trend?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
What's the word?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
It was a word game.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Wait, tell me first.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Don't tell Johnny and Jeffrey.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
I want to be like kind of ahead of the camera.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
How am I going to do that?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
It's not possible.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Yeah.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Just a quick run down and I can be like, oh yeah.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
I know that.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
And then we can figure it out.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
You've already exposed yourself.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
It's way too late.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Well, it's a word game.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
But people have like moved like posting their results to social media and the form

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
of this like weird color grid.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
And it's really pissing me off.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
But I didn't play the game today and I won.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
But I didn't post my results because I'm not.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Not what you just mentioned.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Didn't on a podcast that gets blasted out to like 40,000 people.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
So that's worse than posting it to social media.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Because the audience is bigger.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Public law.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
That's not the point.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
I'm not like clogging my Twitter feed with just

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
colored blocks.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Yeah.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
But it's cool.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
It's fun.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
It's like a daily puzzle.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
Or you just like have to guess a word in six tries.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Mm-hmm.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Thought I thought someone would have seen this.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
But I guess I'm on a different side of Twitter.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Yeah.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
You're by yourself on this.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
You're on a different path entirely.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
And it's actually something I wanted to sit you down and talk about is that I

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
fear for you.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
And what a trajectory that you're on.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Mm-hmm.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
In terms of is it heading to our success?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Or at least my vision of success for you.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Mm-hmm.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Or is it?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Which is?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
What's that?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
What's your vision of success for me?

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
Honestly, broadway producer and star.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
What are you doing to our generation?

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Yeah.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
Forget it.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Forget it.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
I'm here.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
What did you do for New Year's Eve?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
I also stayed at home.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
I just didn't want to be around too many people.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
So we sort of hunkered in.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Stayed healthy.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Stayed happy.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
And watched a few episodes of.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
The Hulu original.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
The Great.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Nice.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Great show.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
It is a great show.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
I mean, it's already watched it.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
And she liked it so much that she's watching it again with me.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
It is the Great Show.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
What's that?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
It is the Great Show.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I still need to start season.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
No.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
But it's called Great.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Yeah.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
What do you do all day, Jeff?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Me?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Yeah.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
I sit down.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
I try to write.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
It doesn't happen.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Then I do a podcast or two.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I may be edit it.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
And then I try to find.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Different avenues of joy.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Whether it's sexual.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Whether it's chemical.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Whether it's digital.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Remember that joke in a mirror?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Why did you text me?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Why does nobody friggin like me at 11.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
18 a.m.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Pacific.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
So what was going on at two in the afternoon?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
It just feels like you had nobody.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
You had lunch or something.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I had lunch.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Would you get?

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Well, everybody else walked to Las Superior.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
And then they didn't invite me.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
So I went to a Delhi office.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Yeah.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
You mean.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
It's a fucking party.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
It's been awesome.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I was there.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
My name's there.

13:02.000 --> 13:08.000
It's not everyone who matters is in the office right now.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Interesting.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Did you do?

13:11.000 --> 13:20.000
That's cool.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
The clapping.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Was it that you wanted to be safe?

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
Or did you get the invite to the party to be?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Yeah.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
So rehashing this.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
And re-talk it to.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
A view.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Me?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
No.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Me or said that he stayed any hunker down and that he watched the great.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
I'm wondering if that was a conscious decision because of COVID or if it was because

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
you didn't get the invite to the party.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I got in a fucking invite.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Don't even worry about that.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
You better believe I got the invite.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Really?

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
I opted not to attend because this thing's going ham.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
It's absolutely going ham.

14:05.000 --> 14:12.000
It's trying to stay outside of mass indoor masclos gathering.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Of course.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Yeah.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Jeffordio.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
What's next?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Very entwines.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Anything else on the horizon?

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
I feel like we ought to be looking at Europe to see if they've found anything post

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
on the ground.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
They're sort of living in a world six to eight weeks out.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Yeah.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Let's talk about something else.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Pretty good idea about what's coming up.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
I'm not going to realize that.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Let's talk about something else.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Let's talk about something else.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Oh yeah.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Here's something.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Something more light hard to get.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
We talked about COVID all the fucking time.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
January 6th.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
The anniversary is coming up.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
What?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
The insurrection.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
The riot.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
That's more light-hearted.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I, a fucking spoon.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
I was throwing around a thought experiment.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Okay.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
What if on January 6th, 2021?

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
It hadn't been white supremacists proud boys storming in the capital.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
It had been the Sith.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
The what?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
From Star Wars?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Yeah.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
The Sith.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
The Sith.

15:21.000 --> 15:28.000
Because then it could have been called January Sith.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
January the Sith be with you.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
That's a gun punch up.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Thank you.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Let me.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
It's a good ladder.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Yeah.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Yeah.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Yeah.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
And I want everybody sort of re-tweeting, shiming and coming.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
Also original sort of twists and turns on this.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Golden nugget of a tweet.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
January the Sith.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Be with you.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
It's a gun.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
It's perfect.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
Johnny just laughed again like he heard it for the first time.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Yeah.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
It is pretty novel.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
It tickles me.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Yeah.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
No way.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Tickles you.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
In the way.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Same joke that I said.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
And everybody didn't laugh.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Well, there's this kind of this really long while.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Yeah.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
You can see the setup.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Yeah.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Yeah.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
You kind of say it from like a place of hate.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
But like a mirror sitting in front of place of light-heartedness.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
And you can really tell.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
And it bleeds into the night itself.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Yeah.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
It's really.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
It's funny.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
It's funny.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
You're not.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
You're an artist.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
Man, you should be able to hear like fucking feedback like this without getting so

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Dispondent.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
You can't have it in skin and like put stuff out there.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
That's not how it works.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Like I should be able to tell you that your shit sucks.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Like you should.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
You should.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
You should be looking forward to that kind of feedback.

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
Do you have to have like crits in film school where you like sit in a room for hours

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
and your peers ridicule your work?

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Mm-hmm.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
And you're not allowed to say anything.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Yeah.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Yeah.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
You're just wondering.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Yeah.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
That was cool thing for sure.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
That was cool.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
This is the real room.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Yeah.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
Your life should be that your life should be strangers coming up to you on the

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
thing.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Like, I wouldn't wear that.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
I wouldn't do that with your hair.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Mm-hmm.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Don't frown as you walk down the street.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
You're not, you know.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Dressed appropriately.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
Sounds like the experience of a woman.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Oh.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Thank you.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
And that's what I wanted to talk about because it shouldn't be up to

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Marie could have bring this shit up.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Thank you.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Yes.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
You never really have to be up.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
What's that?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
What's that?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
What'd you say?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
I never bring shit up.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
You never bring anything up.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
So don't say, don't scold me in Johnny for not bringing it up.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
I'm not scolding anyone.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I'm not scolding anyone.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
I'm just presenting it out there.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
I'm sort of speaking truth to power, not unlike the piece that was written about me

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
for me in the NY Times, which is pretty important.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Yeah.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
We should do another advice.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Yeah.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Yeah.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
That was pretty impressive.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Thank you.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Oh my gosh.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Thank you.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
Your killer hypocrisy is the enemy of democracy.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
How?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
What do you mean?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Explain.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Explain.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Explain.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Explain.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
I'm happy.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
It sounds like it just rhymes, but nothing else.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Yeah.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
It's everything and nothing at the same time.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
Listen, what people fail to realize in this country is that voting is only something

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
you do every four years.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
You know, two years if you vote in the midterms, but who gives a shit about those?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
People fail to realize that.

18:39.000 --> 18:46.000
It's like definitely vote in the midterms.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
Good job.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Awesome.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
Boom.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Guys, a lot of people don't like me as resolutions, right?

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
But that doesn't mean you can't shake things up, whether it's switching up your work

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
out routine or going someplace new.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
Whatever way you choose to challenge yourself this year, there's no better way to do it than with a pair of

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
Raycon wireless earbuds in your ears.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
Raycon wireless earbuds are the best way to bring audio with you because no matter how you shake things

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
mode for when you need to listen to your surroundings so you can take Raycon's with you wherever

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000

And they also have optimized gel tips for the perfect in your fit.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
I mean, they're so comfortable.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Trust me.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
I've used the other leading earbuds that are wireless that put in your ear.

19:40.000 --> 19:46.000
And it's no contest, which one fit better, which ones won't fall out.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Go back to you.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Yeah.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
I think that's right.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
And we're back.

22:37.000 --> 22:52.000
Welcome to headgum drama.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
Great.

22:55.000 --> 23:01.000
We're going to talk about not only the T, but also drama series.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Okay.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Fine.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
I'm in.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
All right.

23:07.000 --> 23:16.000
Part of the fun of working at a company as close knit as headgum is that you kind of know everybody.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Right.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
And along with that is working in the office.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
You know, on the other side, it's kind of a full house every day.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
And you're bound to hear about gossip.

23:29.000 --> 23:35.000
Also, there are often series that are drama.

23:35.000 --> 23:43.000
So I just thought we could talk about some T and then also some like headgum branded drama series pitches at the same time.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Okay.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
And not just not existing television.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Yeah.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Ideally not.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
So the first one is.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
I hear this trouble in paradise with Mike and his girlfriend.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
No.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Really.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
It's none of our business.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
One and I highly doubt that there's any kind of trouble.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Yeah.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
That's true.

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
And Mike didn't have like a really nice New Year's post saying love you.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
So her.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Yeah.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
I love her.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
It's great.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
You know.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Yeah.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Shit.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
I don't know if you're.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Were you trying to stir something in sight?

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Some it will like to be.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Is.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
No.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
I just thought I heard Jake some say something.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
You know, a lot of this is keeping your ear to the ground.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Let's do the next.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Yeah.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Let's go to the next.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
We're trying to talk about people that don't work at headgum.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Yeah.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Right.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Well, that's why I didn't mention her by name.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
So I'm a good guy.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Move on.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
And then what about this is like a drama pitch, right?

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
Winter is coming.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
I came of thrones.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
Ask epic that follows Andrew Pile as he prepares for the harsh.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
Find back winter.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
I think he's in Florida.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Yeah.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
What?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Yeah.

25:07.000 --> 25:14.000
He's sort of got out of upstate New York because it was cold and desolate.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
And he's down in Florida where it's really nice and warm.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Yeah.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
So there's that a no in the room.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Yeah.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Yeah.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Unequivically.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
No.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Okay.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
That sucks.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
All right.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
Johnny has a heart date next week.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Maybe.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
It's nobody's business.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Is it true, though?

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Now I feel like I'm put on the spot by you.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Maybe.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Maybe.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Yeah.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
You're going to easily lie.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
I good.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
But what would that mean for the headgum listeners?

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
You know?

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
I don't know.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Yeah.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
I don't want to be seen as someone who lies all the time.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
I mean, they wouldn't have known.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Oh, sure.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Yeah.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Interesting.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
I'm sorry.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Just like you've that in mind for the next time I have to lie.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
At least I have a hot day over a week in advance too.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
It's like a hot day scheduled for like 90s.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
That was.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
How do you say this far in advance?

26:11.000 --> 26:21.000
Are you going to do a at home test right before you enter wherever the status?

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
I wasn't considering it, but now I am.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I have a test if you need it.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
I'll take it.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Yeah.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Good luck finding them.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Yes.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
How do you get one, Jeff?

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Roger.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Help.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
What's that?

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Roman.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Help.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
I don't know.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
I used to cut the online one.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Yep.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Or did online test.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Why are you so bad?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Bad?

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
I said mad, but it doesn't sound like it's a bad again.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Why are we so bad?

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
What about sad men?

26:59.000 --> 27:05.000
Alpha male Marty Michael is at the top of his game in the high pressure world of the podcasting industry.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
However, he secretly devastated.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Didn't.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
A awful bitch.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
So, however he secretly devastated the idea.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
That's just madmen, right?

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
That's sad men.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
The television show.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
No.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
Isn't that a guy in the 1950s in the advertising industry?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Yeah.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
But he said to a podcasting.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Really?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Pretty sure.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
I kind of had it all in terms of like the job and the corner office.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
I haven't watched madmen other than like one episode.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
But I feel like it's safe to say he's not the happiest.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
I just think it could be fun to see Marty go ham.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Yeah.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
Of course.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
The process was good.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
But I think I'm going to have to do a hard pass on this.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Yeah, it's a pass for me.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Awesome.

28:05.000 --> 28:11.000
What about the fact that Maria has boarded up her apartment windows to hibernate?

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
Obviously not true. You can see it.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
You can see her windows.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
It's gossip. It doesn't have to be true.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
It just has to be fun.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
How is that fun?

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
Yeah.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Like what are you of it?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
The what are you?

28:29.000 --> 28:35.000
What's that so rude to me as a person?

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
And you think saying that there's trouble in paradise is fun gossip.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
And a loving relationship, trouble in paradise.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
So when people break up, it's sort of interesting.

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000
And gossip shouldn't be made up on the spot for a joke.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
It should be real.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
And that's what makes it fun.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
These are real.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Yeah.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
So they're not fun.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
All right. What about compression?

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
It follows the familial drama of the herwitz family as siblings fight and

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
scrape their way to become the heir to the patriarch's old bike shorts.

29:13.000 --> 29:20.000
The worst part about this is that you fucking planned ahead.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
And this is what.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Yeah.

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
It took work to do it like that.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
And it's still.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
It's like bad improv somehow.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Yeah.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
You're a.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
And make money that way.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Yeah.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
I'm actually I'm going to start taking these pictures from.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
The perspective of a Broadway producer since that's what you want me to do.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
And I'm still going to start.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Yeah.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
I'm still going to say no.

29:53.000 --> 29:58.000
But I think you're getting closer in terms of what would work on Broadway.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Mm-hmm.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Okay.

30:00.000 --> 30:08.000
And then this is to trouble in paradise with Angie and her husband.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
No idea.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
I don't know what to do with that.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
I don't know.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
I don't know.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
I don't know.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
So you don't know.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
These people are.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
They're married.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Right.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
You don't.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
So don't like make up rumors about shit.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Yeah.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
All right.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Yeah.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
All right.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
All right.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
All right.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
All right.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
You're feeling like you've been reprimanded right now.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
We want you to stop doing this.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
I mean, he sensitized.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
You're going to put half of this shit.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
I'm so bad.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
I'm so bad for this.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Sometimes I say good shit and I still get predated.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
So why should I even try?

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
Terrible mindset to have with this move on.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Breaking rad.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
I had Nick Rad makes that.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I feel like this is going to be the next one.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
That one's actually pretty good.

31:04.000 --> 31:04.500
Yeah.

31:04.500 --> 31:05.500
Yeah.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.500
I had to watch it for sure.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.500
Yeah.

31:08.500 --> 31:09.500
That was it.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.500
That was it for the heck.

31:11.500 --> 31:12.500
I'm drama.

31:12.500 --> 31:13.500
You're going to get more.

31:13.500 --> 31:16.500
It's crazy that the least developed idea.

31:16.500 --> 31:20.500
Like a Nick or breaking rad was the most well received.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.500
So Jeffrey.

31:21.500 --> 31:22.500
Probably.

31:22.500 --> 31:23.500
That's true.

31:23.500 --> 31:24.500
That's true.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.500
That's true.

31:25.500 --> 31:26.500
That's true.

31:26.500 --> 31:27.500
That's true.

31:27.500 --> 31:28.500
That's true.

31:28.500 --> 31:30.500
That's true.

31:30.500 --> 31:31.500
That's true.

31:31.500 --> 31:32.500
That's true.

31:32.500 --> 31:33.500
That's true.

31:33.500 --> 31:34.500
Yeah.

31:34.500 --> 31:35.500
It does.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.500
You guys might like this one.

31:43.500 --> 31:44.500
It's a game.

31:44.500 --> 31:46.500
I don't really like it.

31:46.500 --> 31:47.500
I like it.

31:47.500 --> 31:50.500
Welcome to Fictionary.

31:50.500 --> 31:51.500
What?

31:53.500 --> 31:54.500
What did you say?

31:54.500 --> 31:56.500
The music was a music.

31:56.500 --> 31:57.500
Yeah.

31:57.500 --> 32:00.500
Did you say Fictionary or Pictionary?

32:00.500 --> 32:01.500
Fictionary.

32:01.500 --> 32:02.500
Dick.

32:02.500 --> 32:03.500
Fictionary.

32:03.500 --> 32:04.500
Fictionary.

32:04.500 --> 32:05.500
Okay.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.500
It's like sick, but with enough.

32:07.500 --> 32:08.500
Okay.

32:08.500 --> 32:09.500
Fictionary.

32:09.500 --> 32:12.500
Which makes less sense.

32:12.500 --> 32:20.500
This is a 19th century era Victorian parlor game.

32:20.500 --> 32:21.500
I doubt it, but go.

32:21.500 --> 32:22.500
Go on.

32:22.500 --> 32:23.500
Explain.

32:23.500 --> 32:24.500
Fictionary.

32:24.500 --> 32:28.500
What they would do is they would gather in the parlor.

32:28.500 --> 32:29.500
Okay.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.500
Take a Bictionary off the shelf.

32:32.500 --> 32:33.500
Open it up.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.500
Find an obscure word.

32:35.500 --> 32:36.500
Say the word.

32:36.500 --> 32:41.500
All the party guests would then come up with their definition of this obscure word.

32:41.500 --> 32:42.500
What do they think it means?

32:42.500 --> 32:44.500
They've never heard it before.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.500
And then everybody goes around and shares their thing.

32:46.500 --> 32:47.500
It could be funny.

32:47.500 --> 32:48.500
It could be a serious guess.

32:48.500 --> 32:53.500
And then at the end, you say the real definition whoever was closest to it wins.

32:53.500 --> 32:54.500
Okay.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.500
You guys ready?

32:56.500 --> 32:57.500
This is like a file.

32:57.500 --> 33:00.500
A game I used to play called Boulder Dash, but it was like an axe.

33:00.500 --> 33:01.500
Oh yeah.

33:01.500 --> 33:02.500
Yeah.

33:02.500 --> 33:03.500
It's a couple of rules.

33:03.500 --> 33:04.500
Well, this is funny.

33:04.500 --> 33:06.500
It had like real words and definitions.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.500
Oh, that's just when I just grab it.

33:08.500 --> 33:10.500
But if I don't find a word that's hard to understand.

33:10.500 --> 33:11.500
No, no, no, no.

33:11.500 --> 33:12.500
I have all of them.

33:12.500 --> 33:13.500
I have all of them.

33:13.500 --> 33:14.500
Okay.

33:14.500 --> 33:15.500
Pelical.

33:15.500 --> 33:16.500
What?

33:16.500 --> 33:17.500
Pelical!

33:23.500 --> 33:24.500
Wow.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.500
Do not impose your voice at me again.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.500
You don't know how terrifying that is.

33:29.500 --> 33:32.500
Being next to him in the studio.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.500
Because you know.

33:33.500 --> 33:34.500
Yeah.

33:34.500 --> 33:35.500
He's like terrible.

33:35.500 --> 33:36.500
Yeah.

33:36.500 --> 33:39.500
He's the only hurdle close.

33:39.500 --> 33:42.500
I've never done anything to hurt anyone physically.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.500
Every.

33:44.500 --> 33:45.500
Okay.

33:45.500 --> 33:48.500
The fact that you have to say it is not a good sign, but.

33:48.500 --> 33:49.500
Yeah.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.500
In terms of my personality.

33:51.500 --> 33:52.500
Yeah.

33:53.500 --> 33:54.500
Pelical.

33:54.500 --> 33:55.500
Let's start with Marika.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.500
Is it Marika?

33:57.500 --> 33:58.500
Yeah.

33:58.500 --> 33:59.500
Okay.

33:59.500 --> 34:00.500
Man.

34:00.500 --> 34:02.500
I couldn't tell if you were Marissa Milnick.

34:02.500 --> 34:06.500
How far are we into this episode?

34:06.500 --> 34:08.500
And you thought she was a certain person.

34:08.500 --> 34:09.500
There's a very minute.

34:09.500 --> 34:10.500
Yeah.

34:10.500 --> 34:11.500
Yeah.

34:11.500 --> 34:15.500
Pelical of or pertaining to.

34:15.500 --> 34:17.500
Pelican.

34:18.500 --> 34:22.500
Jonny.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.500
Oh.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.500
I'm thinking.

34:25.500 --> 34:27.500
It sounds like jellicle.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.500
Like in cats.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.500
But I also don't know what jellicle means.

34:32.500 --> 34:33.500
So.

34:33.500 --> 34:34.500
It's a man.

34:34.500 --> 34:35.500
I think he's a nonsense word.

34:35.500 --> 34:36.500
Okay.

34:36.500 --> 34:37.500
So it is a nonsense word.

34:37.500 --> 34:38.500
Peloton.

34:38.500 --> 34:41.500
I think it has something to do with.

34:41.500 --> 34:45.500
So Pelical has to do with something related to.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.500
Flying.

34:47.500 --> 34:50.500
Palea.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.500
Is that.

34:52.500 --> 34:53.500
Go on.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.500
Never.

34:54.500 --> 34:55.500
I'm here.

34:55.500 --> 34:57.500
Pelical has dry course.

34:57.500 --> 35:00.500
Almost like rough to the touch.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.500
Amir was the closest.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.500
The definition is.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.500
Actually pretty fitting.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.500
For.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.500
Amir.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.500
Fin Skin or film.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.500
I don't know the closest.

35:19.500 --> 35:22.500
You said course.

35:22.500 --> 35:24.500
Of course.

35:24.500 --> 35:25.500
Of course.

35:25.500 --> 35:26.500
She said course.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.500
She said course.

35:28.500 --> 35:30.500
Should I also admit it to you?

35:30.500 --> 35:32.500
And then we guess which one is right.

35:32.500 --> 35:34.500
We're now we're just sort of trying out.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.500
Really good.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.500
Why don't we do that.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.500
Because.

35:39.500 --> 35:42.500
Because we didn't plan it.

35:42.500 --> 35:44.500
Because we didn't plan it.

35:44.500 --> 35:45.500
Here we go.

35:46.500 --> 35:50.500
Manus.

35:50.500 --> 35:53.500
Manus separation.

35:53.500 --> 35:54.500
Okay.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.500
So here's what we should do.

35:55.500 --> 35:58.500
Everyone should DM him in the Zoom.

35:58.500 --> 35:59.500
Okay.

35:59.500 --> 36:00.500
We want people to guess.

36:00.500 --> 36:01.500
It's the actual definition of.

36:01.500 --> 36:02.500
What is it?

36:02.500 --> 36:03.500
Manus.

36:03.500 --> 36:04.500
Can you.

36:04.500 --> 36:05.500
Oh, there we go.

36:05.500 --> 36:06.500
Manus.

36:06.500 --> 36:07.500
Depression.

36:07.500 --> 36:08.500
Manus.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.500
So everyone sort of DM Jeff.

36:09.500 --> 36:10.500
Direct.

36:10.500 --> 36:11.500
Not to every day.

36:11.500 --> 36:12.500
Yeah.

36:12.500 --> 36:13.500
Just directly to Jeff.

36:13.500 --> 36:16.500
And then Jeff will read all of them, including the real one.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.500
And we'll have to guess.

36:18.500 --> 36:21.500
It's kind of like that.

36:21.500 --> 36:22.500
That game we play.

36:22.500 --> 36:23.500
Just a jackbox game.

36:23.500 --> 36:26.500
Yeah.

36:26.500 --> 36:27.500
Just play.

36:27.500 --> 36:28.500
Okay.

36:28.500 --> 36:30.500
I sent over over my.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.500
Direct message to Jeff.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.500
Um.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.500
Okay.

36:35.500 --> 36:37.500
This sucks.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.500
You thought of the game, man.

36:39.500 --> 36:40.500
No.

36:40.500 --> 36:41.500
He said the way this idea was.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.500
You said this idea was.

36:43.500 --> 36:44.500
Yeah.

36:44.500 --> 36:45.500
I'm not talking about the game.

36:45.500 --> 36:46.500
I'm talking about the way this is going.

36:46.500 --> 36:47.500
The energy in the room.

36:47.500 --> 36:48.500
Well.

36:48.500 --> 36:51.500
I don't know what you expect from us.

36:51.500 --> 36:54.500
You were making us do a lot of thinking and like,

36:54.500 --> 36:56.500
create a work.

36:56.500 --> 36:57.500
Yeah.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.500
And on the same time.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.500
Yep.

37:00.500 --> 37:01.500
On the fly.

37:01.500 --> 37:02.500
Everything.

37:02.500 --> 37:03.500
You guys are professionals.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.500
Been in this for a year and a half.

37:05.500 --> 37:06.500
Real little test.

37:06.500 --> 37:07.500
Can you do it?

37:07.500 --> 37:09.500
It's not because professionals.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.500
Can you listen to music and sleep?

37:12.500 --> 37:13.500
No.

37:13.500 --> 37:14.500
Really?

37:14.500 --> 37:15.500
Yeah.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.500
All right.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.500
Your options are.

37:18.500 --> 37:22.500
A bloodletting or bio removal.

37:22.500 --> 37:25.500
You specifically on smallpox in the 18th century.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.500
B.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.500
The act of tearing something off.

37:29.500 --> 37:31.500
C.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.500
Mastervation.

37:33.500 --> 37:34.500
D.

37:34.500 --> 37:37.500
A fancy word for writing.

37:37.500 --> 37:40.500
I'm going to go with C.

37:41.500 --> 37:43.500
Mastervation.

37:43.500 --> 37:44.500
That's correct.

37:44.500 --> 37:45.500
It is.

37:45.500 --> 37:46.500
Honestly.

37:46.500 --> 37:48.500
Wack in it.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.500
You didn't want to wait for me.

37:50.500 --> 37:51.500
Johnny to guess.

37:51.500 --> 37:52.500
Yeah.

37:52.500 --> 37:53.500
No.

37:53.500 --> 37:54.500
Because you got it.

37:54.500 --> 37:55.500
Yeah.

37:55.500 --> 37:56.500
But like we could have also gotten.

37:56.500 --> 37:57.500
All right.

37:57.500 --> 37:58.500
Yeah.

37:58.500 --> 37:59.500
Okay.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.500
Then why don't you host the show.

38:01.500 --> 38:02.500
Actually.

38:02.500 --> 38:04.500
I was kind of into say.

38:04.500 --> 38:05.500
Do you get?

38:05.500 --> 38:07.500
D is a fancy word for writing.

38:07.500 --> 38:08.500
Yeah.

38:08.500 --> 38:09.500
I'll go with D.

38:10.500 --> 38:11.500
It's fascinating.

38:11.500 --> 38:12.500
It was mine.

38:12.500 --> 38:15.500
So now Marie could get double credit because I guessed her.

38:15.500 --> 38:16.500
Yeah.

38:16.500 --> 38:17.500
All right.

38:17.500 --> 38:20.500
Pid uncle.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.500
Pett on whittle.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.500
Ped uncle.

38:24.500 --> 38:26.500
Ped uncle.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.500
Hmm.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.500
I don't.

38:34.500 --> 38:37.500
I don't like the data that we have to.

38:37.500 --> 38:40.500
Oh, a lot for this segment.

38:40.500 --> 38:41.500
Say.

38:41.500 --> 38:42.500
Got a good one.

38:42.500 --> 38:43.500
I am.

38:43.500 --> 38:46.500
Really think you guys will guess what mine is.

38:46.500 --> 38:48.500
Let's just put it that way.

38:48.500 --> 38:52.500
It's probably borderline what it actually.

38:52.500 --> 38:53.500
Yeah.

38:53.500 --> 38:56.500
Sometimes it's okay to just let silence be.

38:56.500 --> 39:00.500
Not necessarily on a podcast, of course.

39:00.500 --> 39:03.500
Yep.

39:03.500 --> 39:04.500
Oh yeah.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.500
This is great.

39:07.500 --> 39:08.500
Okay.

39:08.500 --> 39:09.500
I sent over.

39:09.500 --> 39:10.500
All right.

39:10.500 --> 39:11.500
Here we go.

39:11.500 --> 39:14.500
A relative of a different ethnic background.

39:14.500 --> 39:15.500
All right.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.500
B.

39:17.500 --> 39:19.500
Sorry.

39:19.500 --> 39:20.500
What did you write?

39:20.500 --> 39:22.500
I mean, what did I write?

39:22.500 --> 39:24.500
B.

39:24.500 --> 39:27.500
The stock of a flower.

39:27.500 --> 39:28.500
C.

39:28.500 --> 39:33.500
Terrain that is walkable or navigable on foot.

39:33.500 --> 39:37.500
D. A person or animal that walks on the heels of their foot.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.500
Oh.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.500
Two feet related ones.

39:41.500 --> 39:42.500
Yeah.

39:42.500 --> 39:43.500
Nice.

39:43.500 --> 39:46.500
Don't say nice.

39:46.500 --> 39:52.500
I think I'm going to go with D because Ped means leg or foot.

39:52.500 --> 39:55.500
And that's the one that stood out to me.

39:55.500 --> 39:56.500
All right.

39:56.500 --> 40:01.500
I'm going to go with the flower one because I think you changed it to the correct answer.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.500
Once you made that.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.500
And I was thinking that too.

40:05.500 --> 40:06.500
Yeah.

40:06.500 --> 40:08.500
Kind of predictable in a way.

40:08.500 --> 40:09.500
Yeah.

40:09.500 --> 40:12.500
I just was looking extra concerned.

40:12.500 --> 40:17.500
So I guess what Marie can set to because he does seem to.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.500
Yeah.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.500
Yeah.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.500
And socks.

40:22.500 --> 40:23.500
And D was mine.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.500
So again, I get double points.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.500
Oh my God.

40:27.500 --> 40:28.500
That's true.

40:28.500 --> 40:29.500
So unfair.

40:29.500 --> 40:30.500
All right.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.500
Blattner phone.

40:32.500 --> 40:33.500
Blattner phone.

40:33.500 --> 40:35.500
Yes.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.500
Can you spell that?

40:37.500 --> 40:39.500
You should spell it out loud.

40:39.500 --> 40:41.500
All right.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.500
BL.

40:43.500 --> 40:44.500
ATT.

40:44.500 --> 40:45.500
N-E-R.

40:45.500 --> 40:47.500
Phone.

40:47.500 --> 40:49.500
Blattner phone.

40:49.500 --> 40:55.500
A Blattner phone.

40:55.500 --> 40:57.500
Or to Blattner phone.

40:57.500 --> 41:00.500
Hmm.

41:00.500 --> 41:03.500
These are the things we have to consider.

41:03.500 --> 41:04.500
Blattner phone.

41:04.500 --> 41:06.500
I hardly know her phone.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.500
William Blattner.

41:12.500 --> 41:13.500
That's good.

41:13.500 --> 41:15.500
That's really good.

41:15.500 --> 41:16.500
That's good.

41:16.500 --> 41:17.500
That's the first one.

41:17.500 --> 41:19.500
I honestly just rubbed me the wrong way.

41:19.500 --> 41:20.500
Like.

41:20.500 --> 41:21.500
Yeah.

41:21.500 --> 41:22.500
Yeah.

41:22.500 --> 41:23.500
On the show.

41:23.500 --> 41:24.500
Today.

41:24.500 --> 41:25.500
Nope.

41:25.500 --> 41:27.500
Nothing.

41:27.500 --> 41:29.500
This is also sort of the ulcer line up.

41:29.500 --> 41:31.500
And you're.

41:31.500 --> 41:32.500
Nothing.

41:32.500 --> 41:33.500
Yeah.

41:33.500 --> 41:34.500
Yes.

41:34.500 --> 41:35.500
On the show.

41:35.500 --> 41:36.500
Today.

41:36.500 --> 41:37.500
Nope.

41:37.500 --> 41:39.500
Nothing.

41:39.500 --> 41:42.500
This is also sort of the ulcer line up.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.500
And you're.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.500
I don't know.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.500
I'm all for a laugh.

41:48.500 --> 41:49.500
Let's.

41:49.500 --> 41:53.500
What's the last move everybody watched?

41:53.500 --> 41:54.500
I watched.

41:54.500 --> 41:55.500
Thank you.

41:55.500 --> 41:56.500
Six last night.

41:56.500 --> 41:58.500
Oh, that's a good one.

41:58.500 --> 41:59.500
It was fine.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.500
Is the new Spider-Man supposed to be good?

42:01.500 --> 42:02.500
Yeah.

42:02.500 --> 42:03.500
It's good.

42:03.500 --> 42:04.500
You watched it.

42:04.500 --> 42:05.500
Yeah.

42:05.500 --> 42:08.500
Day of release.

42:08.500 --> 42:11.500
Trying to decide if I should go to a.

42:11.500 --> 42:14.500
Empty theater to watch it.

42:14.500 --> 42:15.500
Yeah.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.500
I also want to do that again.

42:17.500 --> 42:22.500
My friends and I are like, when can we find an empty theater in the city?

42:22.500 --> 42:25.500
Would you say it's worth it for the empty theater?

42:25.500 --> 42:26.500
Um.

42:26.500 --> 42:27.500
All right.

42:27.500 --> 42:28.500
I mean, I think it's good.

42:28.500 --> 42:31.500
I think if you don't carry, you could easily just wait.

42:31.500 --> 42:33.500
Ready months until it's released.

42:33.500 --> 42:34.500
Yeah.

42:34.500 --> 42:35.500
Mm-hmm.

42:35.500 --> 42:36.500
Yeah.

42:36.500 --> 42:37.500
Um.

42:37.500 --> 42:39.500
Blattner phone.

42:39.500 --> 42:40.500
Blattner phone.

42:40.500 --> 42:41.500
Hey.

42:42.500 --> 42:46.500
Instrument used to record sound on magnetic tape.

42:46.500 --> 42:49.500
B.

42:49.500 --> 42:52.500
The sound of chicken.

42:52.500 --> 42:55.500
C.

42:55.500 --> 43:00.500
A musical instrument in the horn family known for its three parts spiral body.

43:00.500 --> 43:06.500
Or D. A word that contains three successive hard consonants, which is not a definition.

43:07.500 --> 43:09.500
Sorry.

43:09.500 --> 43:12.500
I was really racking my brain over that one.

43:12.500 --> 43:13.500
Sorry.

43:13.500 --> 43:15.500
There's three options.

43:15.500 --> 43:17.500
But you had it.

43:17.500 --> 43:21.500
If you hadn't said that's not a definition, I would have chosen.

43:21.500 --> 43:22.500
Yeah.

43:22.500 --> 43:23.500
That one's not as obvious.

43:23.500 --> 43:24.500
Yeah.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.500
Although actually, you know, I guess it is a definition.

43:28.500 --> 43:30.500
Because it would be like, oh, that's a blattner phone.

43:30.500 --> 43:31.500
Oh.

43:31.500 --> 43:32.500
Yeah.

43:32.500 --> 43:33.500
Bucky.

43:33.500 --> 43:35.500
That was Johnny's.

43:35.500 --> 43:36.500
All right.

43:36.500 --> 43:37.500
Yeah.

43:37.500 --> 43:38.500
Yeah.

43:38.500 --> 43:41.500
We already said them.

43:41.500 --> 43:42.500
Now.

43:42.500 --> 43:43.500
We're here.

43:43.500 --> 43:45.500
The first instrument.

43:45.500 --> 43:46.500
A.

43:46.500 --> 43:50.500
An instrument used to record sound on magnetic tape.

43:50.500 --> 43:51.500
B.

43:51.500 --> 43:53.500
The sound of chicken.

43:53.500 --> 43:54.500
Or C.

43:54.500 --> 44:00.500
A musical instrument in the horn family known for its three parts spiral body.

44:00.500 --> 44:02.500
I'm going to go on magnetic tape.

44:02.500 --> 44:03.500
Yeah.

44:03.500 --> 44:06.500
I've never heard of a blattner phone instrument.

44:06.500 --> 44:07.500
Yeah.

44:07.500 --> 44:09.500
I'm going to go.

44:09.500 --> 44:10.500
Correct.

44:10.500 --> 44:13.500
It is instrument used to record sound on magnetic tape.

44:13.500 --> 44:14.500
Here we go.

44:14.500 --> 44:15.500
And I get 10 points.

44:15.500 --> 44:19.500
Because I was like, people wanted to answer D.

44:19.500 --> 44:20.500
10 per a.

44:20.500 --> 44:21.500
Okay.

44:21.500 --> 44:23.500
You kind of sound the one that you were familiar with.

44:23.500 --> 44:25.500
T-E-M-P-E-R-A.

44:25.500 --> 44:26.500
Tempera.

44:26.500 --> 44:27.500
Sure.

44:27.500 --> 44:29.500
Shrimp Tempera.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.500
Wow.

44:33.500 --> 44:34.500
Yeah.

44:35.500 --> 44:36.500
Left.

44:36.500 --> 44:37.500
C's why.

44:37.500 --> 44:38.500
Open the title.

44:43.500 --> 44:44.500
6.

44:50.500 --> 44:55.500
Johnny, how many times have you seen West Side Story Now?

44:55.500 --> 44:58.500
I've seen it twice.

44:58.500 --> 45:00.500
I was about to see it a third time with my mom.

45:00.500 --> 45:01.500
my mom.

45:01.500 --> 45:05.500
Don't talk to Johnny when he's writing his definition because he's there is.

45:05.500 --> 45:06.500
Yeah.

45:06.500 --> 45:08.500
Excuse you.

45:08.500 --> 45:09.500
Blattner.

45:09.500 --> 45:10.500
You can't you can't fault me.

45:10.500 --> 45:13.500
Blattner phone was a very strange sounding word.

45:13.500 --> 45:14.500
Tempera.

45:14.500 --> 45:15.500
Tempera.

45:15.500 --> 45:16.500
Whatever.

45:16.500 --> 45:17.500
A.

45:17.500 --> 45:20.500
It's a type of paint you fuck.

45:20.500 --> 45:21.500
And I don't know.

45:21.500 --> 45:24.500
That's comma you fuck or that you fuck.

45:24.500 --> 45:29.500
The timing and rhythm of an opera.

45:30.500 --> 45:31.500
I'm rocking in my opera.

45:31.500 --> 45:44.500
See painting using white of eggs instead of oil or the process of slowing down time.

45:44.500 --> 45:47.500
It's see.

45:47.500 --> 45:54.500
I have the right answer and you had it as a definition.

45:54.500 --> 45:57.500
What even you have the right answer and you have the type of paint.

45:57.500 --> 46:03.500
He made on egg and so it shouldn't tool them.

46:03.500 --> 46:05.500
Be that then.

46:05.500 --> 46:10.500
And there you sure come on this sucks.

46:10.500 --> 46:12.500
So I guess I'll send you.

46:12.500 --> 46:15.500
He has been entering.

46:15.500 --> 46:17.500
What's your answer?

46:17.500 --> 46:26.500
I said see because my answer was a obviously because I knew what tempera is.

46:26.500 --> 46:35.500
The game is awful. This game is drawful. Part of me want to see as well.

46:35.500 --> 46:41.500
I'll go A, American man. A must be the American.

46:41.500 --> 46:43.500
John, I are absolutely right.

46:43.500 --> 46:47.500
It is a painting using egg whites. Here we go.

46:47.500 --> 46:50.500
What?

46:51.500 --> 46:53.500
Sorry.

46:53.500 --> 46:55.500
O, O, S, E.

46:55.500 --> 46:59.500
O, O, S, E.

46:59.500 --> 47:03.500
Hang on, O, O, S, E.

47:03.500 --> 47:08.500
Hang on, O, O, S, E.

47:08.500 --> 47:14.500
I'm going to need to stop doing that so I can write the difference.

47:14.500 --> 47:17.500
It's too distracting because I also can't listen to the musical.

47:17.500 --> 47:18.500
I'm working.

47:18.500 --> 47:19.500
Yeah.

47:19.500 --> 47:22.500
In a podcast, it feels with low lights.

47:22.500 --> 47:25.500
That I think was the worst thing I've ever heard.

47:25.500 --> 47:32.500
Hang on, O, S, E.

47:32.500 --> 47:37.500
Damn, that was terrible.

47:37.500 --> 47:40.500
That was so fucked up.

47:40.500 --> 47:44.500
All I'm asking is for a little ooze when you get home.

47:44.500 --> 47:48.500
O, S, baby, when you get home.

47:48.500 --> 47:53.500
O, O, S, E.

47:53.500 --> 47:56.500
Find out what it means to us.

47:56.500 --> 48:00.500
O, S, E.

48:00.500 --> 48:03.500
This sucks.

48:03.500 --> 48:05.500
You're coming up.

48:05.500 --> 48:07.500
We're playing your game.

48:07.500 --> 48:09.500
And then the second we get into it.

48:09.500 --> 48:11.500
You made it even more.

48:11.500 --> 48:15.500
This is probably the best part of the episode.

48:15.500 --> 48:17.500
And you made it.

48:17.500 --> 48:19.500
All right.

48:19.500 --> 48:21.500
A, for ooze.

48:21.500 --> 48:23.500
O, S, E.

48:23.500 --> 48:27.500
Very dust that gathers under beds.

48:27.500 --> 48:31.500
B, the bottom of a ship.

48:32.500 --> 48:36.500
C, cellular sludge or experiment.

48:36.500 --> 48:38.500
Or D, slang for liquor.

48:38.500 --> 48:47.500
As in, hey, baby, pour me some of that sweet sweet ooze.

48:47.500 --> 48:49.500
What was the third one?

48:49.500 --> 48:50.500
That was third one.

48:50.500 --> 48:55.500
Was cellular sludge or experiment?

48:55.500 --> 48:56.500
I guess.

48:56.500 --> 49:00.500
A, A.

49:00.500 --> 49:01.500
What was A?

49:01.500 --> 49:04.500
Then A was very dust that gathers under beds.

49:04.500 --> 49:07.500
I think it's experiment.

49:07.500 --> 49:15.500
And I'll say the bottom of a boat.

49:15.500 --> 49:17.500
Marika was right.

49:17.500 --> 49:20.500
It is furry dust that gathers under beds.

49:20.500 --> 49:22.500
Wow.

49:22.500 --> 49:24.500
Good job, everybody.

49:24.500 --> 49:26.500
Stoss.

49:26.500 --> 49:27.500
Stoss.

49:27.500 --> 49:28.500
What's that?

49:28.500 --> 49:30.500
STOSS.

49:30.500 --> 49:32.500
It all sounds like same.

49:32.500 --> 49:34.500
I think Stoss is your one.

49:34.500 --> 49:36.500
Stoss.

49:36.500 --> 49:38.500
Stoss.

49:38.500 --> 49:40.500
Stacey Moss.

49:40.500 --> 49:46.500
Stoss's Moss has got it going.

49:46.500 --> 49:47.500
Stoss.

49:47.500 --> 49:50.500
Stoss.

49:50.500 --> 49:52.500
Stoss.

49:52.500 --> 49:54.500
Stoss.

49:54.500 --> 49:56.500
Stoss.

49:56.500 --> 50:05.500
Stoss.

50:05.500 --> 50:06.500
Stoss.

50:06.500 --> 50:09.500
You guys think it's hard to have a ton of fun?

50:09.500 --> 50:10.500
On here?

50:10.500 --> 50:11.500
Yeah.

50:11.500 --> 50:12.500
Stoss.

50:12.500 --> 50:13.500
Stoss.

50:13.500 --> 50:14.500
Stoss.

50:14.500 --> 50:17.500
I think it depends on what your definition of fun is.

50:21.500 --> 50:22.500
Alright, here we go.

50:22.500 --> 50:25.500
A, an impending storm.

50:26.500 --> 50:30.500
B, side of a hill, facing upstream.

50:31.500 --> 50:37.500
B, the neck of champagne bottles primarily before the 1800s.

50:38.500 --> 50:42.500
Or D, medieval, pillured walls.

50:45.500 --> 50:47.500
Say the first one.

50:47.500 --> 50:50.500
The first one is an impending storm.

50:50.500 --> 50:51.500
Second length.

50:51.500 --> 50:54.500
There'd be a stoss of ruin.

50:55.500 --> 50:56.500
Second one.

50:56.500 --> 50:59.500
The second one is going to be, what was B?

50:59.500 --> 51:03.500
Oh, the side of a hill, facing upstream.

51:04.500 --> 51:07.500
I'm going to go with that one, B.

51:07.500 --> 51:10.500
I'll go with medieval, pillured walls.

51:10.500 --> 51:12.500
I'm going to go with A.

51:12.500 --> 51:14.500
The storm.

51:14.500 --> 51:15.500
Rico is right.

51:15.500 --> 51:20.500
Also, Amir was as wrong as one could be because he guessed his own guess.

51:20.500 --> 51:23.500
I sort of was trying to start a movement.

51:23.500 --> 51:26.500
You were the last one, but you're guessing.

51:26.500 --> 51:28.500
In a way.

51:28.500 --> 51:29.500
All right.

51:29.500 --> 51:31.500
Jounce.

51:31.500 --> 51:34.500
Let it all out.

51:35.500 --> 51:40.500
These are the things I can do without.

51:40.500 --> 51:42.500
So nice.

51:42.500 --> 51:46.500
Oh, I'm glad you wrote that because I did not hear what you said.

51:46.500 --> 51:48.500
He said, chounce.

51:48.500 --> 51:49.500
It's like juicy.

51:49.500 --> 51:50.500
Jounce.

52:00.500 --> 52:01.500
Jounce.

52:01.500 --> 52:03.500
Jounce.

52:04.500 --> 52:05.500
Jounce.

52:07.500 --> 52:09.500
Yeah, this does suck, yeah.

52:11.500 --> 52:13.500
If it sucks, it's because you suck.

52:17.500 --> 52:18.500
All right.

52:18.500 --> 52:19.500
A.

52:19.500 --> 52:20.500
Jeanne Ouse.

52:20.500 --> 52:21.500
The bottom.

52:21.500 --> 52:22.500
Janne Ouse.

52:22.500 --> 52:23.500
I'm a bow.

52:28.500 --> 52:30.500
Can be B.

52:31.500 --> 52:33.500
To bump or jolt.

52:34.500 --> 52:36.500
C.

52:36.500 --> 52:38.500
Bouncy jeans.

52:38.500 --> 52:40.500
Denom material.

52:40.500 --> 52:42.500
Or D.

52:42.500 --> 52:44.500
Bouncing but in jeans.

52:46.500 --> 52:48.500
It's obviously not.

52:48.500 --> 52:50.500
C or D.

52:50.500 --> 52:52.500
Take her thing.

52:52.500 --> 52:54.500
Denom bottom.

52:54.500 --> 52:55.500
Of course.

52:55.500 --> 52:57.500
Interesting.

52:57.500 --> 52:59.500
Interesting.

52:59.500 --> 53:00.500
Denom bottom.

53:00.500 --> 53:01.500
Of course.

53:01.500 --> 53:02.500
Denom bottom.

53:02.500 --> 53:05.500
And we established that Ouse is not the bottom of the boat.

53:05.500 --> 53:06.500
Yeah.

53:06.500 --> 53:08.500
That's right.

53:08.500 --> 53:09.500
That's right.

53:09.500 --> 53:12.500
I've been put there just to, you know, trip aside.

53:12.500 --> 53:15.500
To start a movement, even.

53:15.500 --> 53:17.500
Okay.

53:17.500 --> 53:19.500
So I think we're all in agreement.

53:19.500 --> 53:21.500
We would all vote for B.

53:21.500 --> 53:22.500
Yeah.

53:22.500 --> 53:23.500
Yeah.

53:23.500 --> 53:24.500
To bump or jolt.

53:24.500 --> 53:25.500
That's exactly right.

53:25.500 --> 53:26.500
Yeah.

53:26.500 --> 53:27.500
It's my chance.

53:27.500 --> 53:28.500
Of course.

53:28.500 --> 53:29.500
All right.

53:29.500 --> 53:30.500
Here we go.

53:30.500 --> 53:32.500
This is the last one.

53:32.500 --> 53:35.500
Do you don't have it ready?

53:35.500 --> 53:36.500
Fair.

53:36.500 --> 53:37.500
Fair.

53:37.500 --> 53:38.500
Here.

53:38.500 --> 53:39.500
Fair.

53:39.500 --> 53:40.500
Yeah.

53:40.500 --> 53:41.500
Fair.

53:41.500 --> 53:42.500
Yeah.

53:50.500 --> 53:52.500
Fair.

53:52.500 --> 53:59.500
Fair.

53:59.500 --> 54:02.500
Fair.

54:02.500 --> 54:05.500
Okay.

54:05.500 --> 54:09.500
Do you guys like the skin?

54:09.500 --> 54:10.500
No.

54:10.500 --> 54:11.500
Yeah.

54:11.500 --> 54:12.500
Oh.

54:12.500 --> 54:13.500
All right.

54:13.500 --> 54:14.500
Kind of like it.

54:14.500 --> 54:15.500
Honestly.

54:15.500 --> 54:16.500
No.

54:16.500 --> 54:17.500
Johnny.

54:17.500 --> 54:20.500
That's fair.

54:21.500 --> 54:23.500
Oh, god.

54:29.500 --> 54:32.500
There's this bit of dramatic irony going on.

54:32.500 --> 54:35.500
Jeff is seeing all the definitions we sent.

54:41.500 --> 54:42.500
Okay.

54:45.500 --> 54:46.500
I think he's going to cry.

54:46.500 --> 54:48.500
I don't think he's going to get through them all.

54:48.500 --> 54:49.500
Yeah.

54:50.500 --> 54:51.500
I think it was really interesting.

54:51.500 --> 54:54.500
How we all said jeans for the previous one.

54:54.500 --> 54:55.500
All right.

54:55.500 --> 54:57.500
That makes us more selfish.

54:57.500 --> 54:58.500
Okay.

54:58.500 --> 55:04.500
The platform that emerges from a grandfather clock when the chicken walks out and

55:04.500 --> 55:05.500
clocks.

55:05.500 --> 55:07.500
B.

55:07.500 --> 55:10.500
Blue gray squirrel fur.

55:10.500 --> 55:11.500
C.

55:11.500 --> 55:13.500
Very fair.

55:13.500 --> 55:15.500
Or D.

55:15.500 --> 55:17.500
To start a movement.

55:18.500 --> 55:20.500
I think it's the chicken one.

55:20.500 --> 55:23.500
That's a crazy thing that I think it's going to work.

55:23.500 --> 55:25.500
Where do you want to start a chicken one too?

55:25.500 --> 55:26.500
Interesting.

55:26.500 --> 55:27.500
I'm going to go squirrel.

55:27.500 --> 55:28.500
I'm.

55:28.500 --> 55:30.500
America got all of these correct.

55:30.500 --> 55:31.500
It is a blue gray squirrel.

55:31.500 --> 55:32.500
There.

55:32.500 --> 55:34.500
To start a movement is so.

55:34.500 --> 55:35.500
I'm going to go squirrel.

55:35.500 --> 55:39.500
I'm going to go squirrel.

55:39.500 --> 55:42.500
America got all of these correct.

55:42.500 --> 55:44.500
It is blue gray squirrel.

55:44.500 --> 55:45.500
There.

55:46.500 --> 55:49.500
To start a movement is so fucking fun.

55:49.500 --> 55:51.500
Yeah.

55:51.500 --> 55:54.500
I mean, it was trying to bear.

55:54.500 --> 55:59.500
Yeah.

55:59.500 --> 56:00.500
No.

56:00.500 --> 56:01.500
No.

56:01.500 --> 56:02.500
No.

56:02.500 --> 56:03.500
No.

56:03.500 --> 56:04.500
No.

56:04.500 --> 56:05.500
Nice.

56:11.500 --> 56:12.500
That was easy.

56:16.500 --> 56:18.500
Yeah.

56:18.500 --> 56:23.500
What a ride.

56:23.500 --> 56:25.500
It's hand.

56:25.500 --> 56:27.500
It's what?

56:27.500 --> 56:29.500
There.

56:29.500 --> 56:34.500
This can't be the new word of 20 20.

56:34.500 --> 56:42.500
I wish it meant something different than squirrel fur.

56:42.500 --> 56:43.500
Plugs.

56:43.500 --> 56:45.500
First episode of the year in the bag.

56:45.500 --> 56:46.500
Yeah.

56:46.500 --> 56:47.500
Great.

56:47.500 --> 56:48.500
What's that?

56:48.500 --> 56:49.500
It's a very ooze episode.

56:49.500 --> 56:52.500
You can follow me on Instagram at Johnny V.

56:52.500 --> 56:54.500

56:58.500 --> 56:59.500

57:08.500 --> 57:11.500

57:11.500 --> 57:13.500

57:13.500 --> 57:15.500
I'm here with a film.

57:15.500 --> 57:17.500
I'm on black and her phone.

57:17.500 --> 57:19.500
Um.

57:19.500 --> 57:20.500
Okay.

57:20.500 --> 57:22.500
Blue and brown.

57:22.500 --> 57:23.500
Yeah.

57:23.500 --> 57:25.500
And I have a.

57:25.500 --> 57:28.500
Beta invite to ooze, which is a pretty.

57:28.500 --> 57:29.500
We have three app.

57:29.500 --> 57:31.500
So let me up on that as well.

57:31.500 --> 57:33.500
That's funny.

57:33.500 --> 57:34.500
That's what?

57:34.500 --> 57:36.500
You should change.

57:36.500 --> 57:37.500
You should change.

57:37.500 --> 57:39.500
Riot to ooze.

57:40.500 --> 57:43.500
O.O.S.

57:43.500 --> 57:44.500
Yeah.

57:44.500 --> 57:46.500
We never want to start with two bells.

57:46.500 --> 57:48.500
That's what you got to ooze.

57:48.500 --> 57:53.500
Who do you know that works on Stoss?

57:53.500 --> 57:58.500
I sold all my stoss.

57:58.500 --> 58:01.500
Oh.

58:01.500 --> 58:02.500
Good.

58:02.500 --> 58:03.500
Stoss.

58:03.500 --> 58:04.500
Everybody.

58:04.500 --> 58:05.500
Good.

58:05.500 --> 58:06.500
Stoss.

58:06.500 --> 58:07.500
Bear.

58:07.500 --> 58:08.500
Well, that's fair.

58:08.500 --> 58:09.500
It was a good episode.

58:09.500 --> 58:10.500
You know.

58:10.500 --> 58:11.500
But.

58:11.500 --> 58:13.500
I'm going to go.

58:13.500 --> 58:15.500
Man has to pray.

58:15.500 --> 58:17.500
I got a chance.

58:17.500 --> 58:18.500
I got a.

58:18.500 --> 58:19.500
That's.

58:19.500 --> 58:21.500
Gene and bounce.

58:21.500 --> 58:23.500
We'll see you guys again next week.

58:23.500 --> 58:25.500
Thanks for watching this episode of the head gun podcast.

58:25.500 --> 58:28.500
Check out the new punch up the jam.

58:28.500 --> 58:31.500
And we'll see you guys again next week.

58:31.500 --> 58:32.500
Gears.

58:32.500 --> 58:33.500
Everybody.

58:33.500 --> 58:51.500
That was a head gun original.

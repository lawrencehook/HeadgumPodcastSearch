00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
I just have to queue it up.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
It's not used to this.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
Here we go.

00:30.000 --> 00:44.000
That was easy.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Well, could you do another dish for that head-gum?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Yes.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Monday, October 4th.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
This episode will be up in four days.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Uh, with us as always, Grace and Wise.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Mereka Brownlee on the sex and a mere blue and fell on the facts.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
Actually, it's a mere Wise.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Really bad name, yeah.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Wise.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Wisdom is kind of the best thing you can have.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
And if it's in your literally in your name, that's the best you can be.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I think that was an interesting alert.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
Help me, Grace and me.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Wisdom is the best thing you can have.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Ultimately, good if it's in your best.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Right.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Yes, right.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
And then call me Grace and...

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Great.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Thank you.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
Uneditable, so that'll be on your left forever.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
I'll find a way to make that edible because for some reason I didn't chime in when I should have...

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
For some reason.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I couldn't make it happen.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I couldn't make it so.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
I couldn't make it.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
That's a stage fright.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
Last week, you guys told me to kind of take it easy.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Get more rest.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
And I have not done that.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
I'm so sleep deprived.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Why?

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
What's that?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Why?

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Ha ha ha ha.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
I had a couple birthdays this weekend.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
A couple late nights.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
I had a couple stage fright.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
I did an open mic where they kind of hoisted me onto what I thought was a throne.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
But ended up being kind of a...

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
That's a nice place.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Yes, sirs.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Toilet.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
I was here for aint to stand up going.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
It's actually a lot of fun.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
And I'm not super good at it yet, but hopefully someday.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
This is so fucked up.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
The video aspect of this makes me so self-conscious these days.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Because we can't edit out the pauses.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
We can't have any missteps.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
And I am cracking under the pressure.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I don't know what else to do.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I prepared a couple segments today.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
And I think they're going to be really good.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
But until then, how do we wax in a way that's listenable and now watchable?

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
Jeff, I think we can cut more than you think we can cut the video.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah, Grayson is the one who's doing the editing.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Yeah, we should say that.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
If you make a mistake, we can get rid of it.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Okay.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
The rush of the mistakes are the funniest part of the show.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
We should probably keep it in.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah, the show is mostly mistakes.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Well.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Well, what?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
I don't know.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
I don't think it's right.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
I don't know.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
I thought you guys would bring something in the table in terms of something that happened

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
this weekend.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
This is Monday at noon.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Sorry one second.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
Yep.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
That's probably the worst sound, right?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
It's got to be the worst sound.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
That's the sound of the sound of something interrupting you.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
That you control.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
It sucks.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
Do you have the sound of a trough idling and writh backing up in the distance?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
No.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
No.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I was going to see the searching for it again.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I think I was four minutes.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
It's going to be editing it live.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Wow.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
That wasn't long enough.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
The bad thing is this is just the sound effects that I get from my own neighborhood

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
that Jeff is willingly putting into the show.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Right.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
This is just like an AC unit.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
It's 10 hours of a diesel truck idling.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Grayson, you had COVID the last time we talked to you.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Now you look kind of healthy.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Thank you.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I feel kind of healthy.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
What have you done since COVID have you had a new lease on life?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Yeah.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I mean, I still have one symptom.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
I still can't smell anything.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
I don't know.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Wow.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Did you ever lose your smell?

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
I lost smell and taste, but they came back after like a week.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Okay.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
So hopefully soon then.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
It is really weird.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
And I read something on the internet that says, like,

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
as your note, what it,

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
it's not nose buds.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
What's the word for the equivalent of that?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Your buds.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Yeah.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Taste buds in your nose.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
You're like your sense of whatever.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Yeah.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
As those come back, you just like start to smell really bad smells all the time apparently.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Really interesting.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Looking forward to that.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
So what, what, when does that become most noticeable?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Because a sense of smell is something that I have.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
But I don't really, you know, have conscious appreciation for.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
So like, yeah.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
What can you not smell where you like that's weird?

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
It's, it's most noticeable when I check whether or not I can smell again.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Yeah.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
And I just can't smell.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Yeah.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
It's not like holding like fish to your face.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
And you're like, this is nothing.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Yeah.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
What?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I want to find a way to use it, you know,

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
it's like for good.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
I think it could be some sort of superpower.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
But I haven't figured it out yet.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Yeah.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
Like a room of stinky farmers doing a contest as to who can handle it the longest and you're

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
fine about it.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Yeah.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
You figured it out.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
What have you been testing?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
What have you been testing?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
What have you been testing?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
The two examples of that?

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
Let's say it was holding fish to your face smelling it and saying that's fine.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Yeah.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
What was a stinky farmer's contest?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Yes.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
So like, it's like, how many times can you fart before you tap out?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Because it smells too much.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Does that exist?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
What do you know?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Well, we can discuss later.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
It's all in my squid game spec script that I'm writing.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
What have you tried to smell that didn't work?

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Um, I've tried to smell coffee a number of times.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
Um, you know, obviously just like deodorant in the morning.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Um, classic.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
I might just be walking around smelling like shit now.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
And you don't know.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
And I don't know.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Yeah.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
So, oh, yeah.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
That's interesting.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
What about taste?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
I still have taste.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
I never lost my sense of taste.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Interesting.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
That was my fear.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Because I lost both.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
And I was like, I can, I can make do without taste.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Like, I love food and drink.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
But smell.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
I would never know if you smell bad.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Sex is different.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
And God, what's the other one?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Nature.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
Wait, you're saying that you, you would be more okay not being able to taste.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Then not being able to smell.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
That's entirely backwards.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Yeah.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
That's right.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Yeah.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
You're, it's usually an opinion.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
But that one's wrong.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
Most people would definitely take the sense of what was the first reason again.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Sex is different.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
No, it was the second one.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Nature.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Not said.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Third one.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Oh, you don't know if you smell bad.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Right.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Okay.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
All in, all in saying reasons.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
I didn't say.

08:33.000 --> 08:40.000
And comparison to being able to eat food, which you, like he said.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
I'm surprised that you didn't have your, all right.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Sure.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
That I didn't have what?

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
I was saying to grace, and I'm surprised that you didn't lose your sense of taste.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Yeah.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I thought always thought that those were connected in sex.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Yeah.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Really, really, they're not.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
My friend hasn't been able to smell her whole life.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
My friend Hanna.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
She's going to be, yeah.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I guess that happens.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
And yeah.

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
But that's like you never know a good thing till it's gone, but it's like they didn't even have the good thing before it was gone.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Yeah.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Everybody.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Everybody.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Can't monetize this.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Anywhere.

09:20.000 --> 09:33.000
Yeah.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Let's get it started.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I need to get the energy up a little bit.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
I got a cold brew specifically for this.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
It's a recollect to do, where she checks it on how much caffeine I've had.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Uh-huh.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
First one of the day.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
This will be the third.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Early.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
1215.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
What's wax?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
So she is for a spell.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Do you guys know Celsius?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
The temperature measurement?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
No.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
The energy drink.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Energy drink.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Yeah.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
I don't actually.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
It's a fitness energy drink.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
They say live fit on the side of it.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Nice.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Thanks.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
I never even heard of that.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
What is it?

10:15.000 --> 10:21.000
It's an energy drink with only natural ingredients.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
And 200 milligrams of caffeine, which is basically two cups of coffee.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
The CDC doesn't recommend that you have more than 400 grams in a day.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
So two Celsius is, you got to call it a day.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Okay.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Is it like red bull or monster energy or something?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
No.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
It sounds like a caffeinated energy drink.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
It's like that, but it's Celsius.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
So seven different flavors.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
One happy feeling.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
But are you on their website right now?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Wait.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
No.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
But you do end up.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
It ends up drying out everything.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
My lips are cracked.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
My eyes are even dry.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
So great.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Yeah.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Great for your chronic dry eye that you just got.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Yeah.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Yeah.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Yeah.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Sounds like you took liquid acutain or something.

11:17.000 --> 11:26.000
Something really invasive and terrible for you.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
I hated to see that.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
That's the kind of shit we didn't need to.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
How long did you?

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
The train in full steam ahead.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
To what?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
You said you had birthday parties.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
How are those?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
They were really fun.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
That's a great anywhere exciting where they just had people's houses.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Or anybody we know?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I was at my friend's house.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
One of them was at my friend's house.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
And that one just all my friends showed up too.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Trying to think of who you guys would know, George Sabba.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Billy Brick was there.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Sessley Bro was there.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
She's guessed it on a couple shows.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
That's probably it.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
But Grayson, you might know.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Do you know Max Maca Vetsky?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
That's crazy.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
What are the odds?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Generally can't tell if that's true or not.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
Let's go to our first segment.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
I just wanted it on record.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
But I went out of my way to ask Jeff about his day.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
And he didn't return it.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
The favor to anyone else.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Well, I'll get around to that kind of bullshit.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
Depending on how this goes.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
And I just saw someone in the mirror.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
He's hard.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
It's him.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
He's leaving.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
I see the car, boy.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Welcome to Bond of the Week.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Or Bond.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Someone's at my house.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Play without.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
No.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Welcome to Bond of the Week.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Oh, my God.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
This is fine.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Great.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
So how's your day?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
It's good.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
I just told Marieka before we started officially recording though.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
I am dog sitting for my roommate.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
And the dog has now thrown up four times.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Yeah.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Once on my comforter and once on my carpet.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
So.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
We lost.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
That sucks.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Does your roommate feel bad at all?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
He's currently in London.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
So I think he's just having a great time.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Right.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
You're cleaning up dog.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
And I'm happy.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
And I'm happy for him.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Good for you.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Does the dog?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
You can throw up forms.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Pretty quickly when you roommate's home.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Or is it just like a separation anxiety?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Yeah.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
That's what I'm going to say.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
It sounds like separation anxiety.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Yeah.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
I think it's just that.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
Also because if she is sick.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
I haven't taken her to the vet.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
So I wouldn't really know what to do if this became like a dire situation.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Yeah.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
It's a killer.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
Never do a favor for a friend because if the favor goes sour.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
Then it's going to cause tension between you and them.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
Versus if you just kind of say no up front.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
How could there be tension?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
So true because I am moving out now.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Yeah.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
And that's a bad thing.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
That's a bad thing.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Yeah.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
Actually, I didn't sign an NDA so I can talk about this.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
These are some checks that I got for.

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
Playing resweather spoon and ashton cutters best friend in a movie.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
But it was it was still photos.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Photo still photos.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
So it's like, oh, these are photos from when they were in college and friends with these people.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
So they dressed them to like look like they were in their 20s.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
And then they were going to bunch of other people in their 20s.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Yeah.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
I think they looked young.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Especially in photos where they can be edited.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
So that's how I spent last Tuesday was I was just in a living room in West

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
Hollywood acting like I was playing poker with them.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
And I got paid basically nothing.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
One of these checks is for 82 dollars.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Wow.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Well, you just posed for photos.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Yeah.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
But it was sad.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Like I would have loved 500 at least.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
And I didn't get that.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
And I was four days too because I had to do a COVID test and then a fitting and another

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
COVID test and then the shoot.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
That should be $500.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Know yourself.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
Know your worth, Grayson.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Was that four days of activities?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Where did the fucking week?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Where did they got them week?

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Four.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I don't have $1,000.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Yeah.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
That's clear.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Cause you're doing the plan here.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
You got to check about for $82.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Meryka.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
What's up, man?

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
What's absolutely up, dude?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
I love it.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Goodness.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Um,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I know this weekend.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
I was the Broadway flea market, which is fun for me personally.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
Um, spot a bunch of Broadway shirts and stuff.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Walked around the theater district.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Good times.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
That's awesome.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I'll send them to this weekend.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Also great for me.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
As I love the first Venom film.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
It was highly anticipated this year.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
And I think it was a point.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Yeah.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
It's really fun.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
I love story between a sweaty man and a goof monster.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I don't know.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
It's good.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
That's a really easy time.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Yeah.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Is that what you said on Letterbox?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
That's a really good review.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Letterbox.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
What did I say?

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
I mean, I said something to the extent of this is a rom-com.

16:51.000 --> 17:01.000
I hope that Eddie and Venom on their be Chinese moon carve a heart and a palm tree together.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
It's great time.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Go see it.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
That's fun.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Well, look.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
We got to do this segment.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Even though Blumen felt not back.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
This is bond to the week.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
All right.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Yeah.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Basically.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Wow.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
There he is.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
Bond to the week is a segment where every week from now until the next James Bond movie.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
So Friday.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
It comes out Friday.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Oh.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Okay.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Then just this episode.

17:26.000 --> 17:35.000
Bond of the week is a serial weekly segment that where we all kind of take our pick of who the next James Bond should be.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
This week.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
My bond of the week is Jillian Anderson.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
Because Daniel Craig talked about the next one being a woman and she's the mom and sex education.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
And I'd love to see her just like battling.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
I mean, doing absolute spy work.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
You're not wondering where I went.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Where'd you go?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I kind of left pretty abruptly.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Saw people walking in the background.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
And then I came back and it was just right into bond of the week.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
I guess we could discuss Jillian Anderson being the next Bond.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
But in case anybody's curious,

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
maybe you can guide the conversation towards where I was, what happened and stuff like that.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Where were you, what happened, stuff like that?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
It's actually none of your business.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
But I owed some cash to certain people and I'll give it to that.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
They came to collect.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Yeah.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I don't feel comfortable discussing it on the show.

18:28.000 --> 18:35.000
But at the same time, I do think it's your obligation as a host to sort of ask the questions.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
The audience might have towards me.

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
So at this point, you can either press on and inquire further or try to shift the conversation.

18:44.000 --> 18:51.000
But shift the conversation back to the bond thing.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
All right.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Might be Jordan.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
That'd be good.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
What's that?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Yeah.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Bond has to be British though.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
I did some, I had some extra gardening work done,

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
because there's a lot of dry leaves in the back of the yard.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
And this is not a third place.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
And why Michael B.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
I mean, why not, Michael B?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
He'd be awesome.

19:12.000 --> 19:18.000
He would be so short fire management.

19:18.000 --> 19:25.000
Requires that you maintain your yard in the way that you basically have to serve you as a British person.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
I know.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
I'm sorry.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
I'm literally looking at a list of British people that I have on my phone.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Yeah.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
And then you don't just chime in with like, oh, like, you know, you got to get dust removal.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
You have to get all the stuff.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Nobody cares about what you do with your yard.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Your yard is a piece of shit I've seen it in person.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
It's flat.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
It's short.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
There's no real grass.

19:48.000 --> 19:54.000
I mean, I feel like Aaron Taylor Johnson could be an interesting one.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
All right.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
He's a, he's an tenant.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
He's in kick ass.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Yeah.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
He was quick silver in the MCU.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Oh, yeah.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
I don't know.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
What about a mirror playing?

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
The.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Yeah.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
The white.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
What?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
I'm here.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
The auction.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
That's cool.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
This sort of like the.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Sorry.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
The nerd in the fans.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Shut up for a second.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
It could be cool for you to be.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Yeah.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
The nerd in the game.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
But I'm wondering if you're a bond guy.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
If Jillian Anderson is bond.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
That's fun.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
And so you're like at the bar in like a.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
Kind of racially clad.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
A little black suit.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
And every boy needs a little black suit.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
I'm.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
I'm near your bond of the week.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
Let me have to fucking move on.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Um.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Should I go like a standard one.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
I see Idris elbow being thrashed out a lot.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
What I was going to say could be interesting.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
Well, we have LeBron James is starting to make his foyer into acting.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Yeah.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Again.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Imagine if you get it.

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
It has to be British.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
And then Ferris and I will cut this out.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
But just for the latter half because it's kind of the midway point.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Let's actually bring the energy up.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Let's actually have a lot of fun.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Instead of what we've been doing so far.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Which is outer worship.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Because if you had a tubes.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
You guys have brought the show.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Grayson.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
You're doing great.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Everyone else is fucking garbage.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000

Check out better help.com slash.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
What's that?

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Life is full of stressors.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Right?

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
It doesn't matter who you are or what you have.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Life is probably stressful.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
For me, it's time management.

21:51.000 --> 21:57.000
You know, making sure that I get everything done just so.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
You may not be feeling totally down and out and depressed.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Or like you're at a total loss.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
But if your stress is high, your temper is shorter than usual.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
Or even if you're just starting to feel strain in any of your relationships.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
You could probably use the chance to unload.

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
Unload the stress and get it out by talking to somebody who's completely unbiased about your life.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
Someone who isn't going to judge you or take sides on anything.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
When there's things you can't tell anyone.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
Or if you feel like you can't unload to family and friends.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
And you need to unload it.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
That's what therapy can be.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
Better help is customized online therapy.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
That offers video, phone, and even live chat sessions.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
So you don't have to actually see anybody on camera if you don't want to.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
It's much more affordable than in person therapy.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
And you can start communicating with a therapist in under 48 hours.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
Unload the stressors and get some unbiased feedback.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
You'd be pretty surprised what you might learn.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
See if it's for you.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Therapy's for me.

Thanks, Better Help.

23:00.000 --> 23:11.000
Thank you to honey for sponsoring this episode of our show.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Guys, we all shop online.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Right?

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
I got this robot online.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
I've also seen that promo code field taunt is a checkout.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Right?

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
It bullies us, frankly, but thanks to honey.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
Manually searching for coupon codes is a thing of the past.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Honey is the free browser extension.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
And scours the internet for promo codes and applies the best one it finds to your cart.

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
Honey supports over 30,000 stores online that range from sites that have tech and gaming

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
products to popular fashion brands, even food delivery apps.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
And it basically imagine you're shopping on one of your favorite sites.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Right?

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Go leave her a second.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
When you check out the honey button drops down.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
And all you have to do is click a pike.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
All you have to do is click apply coupons.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
Wait a few seconds, as honey searches for a coupon.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
I can find for that site.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
And if it finds a working coupon, you'll watch the prices drop.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
Honey saved me $5 off of the $25 pair of jeans.

24:07.000 --> 24:13.000
It also helped me knock a little blood of money off of headphones.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
It actually helped me knock a little bit of money off of headphones.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
Honey has found it's over 17 million members over two billion dollars in savings.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Right?

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
So if you don't already have honey, you're missing out on free cash.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Thanks, honey.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
All right, here we go.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
This is impression of doing.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
I have two generators up right now.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
Celebrity and random word.

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
So basically, I'm going to generate a select.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
I don't know.

25:04.000 --> 25:19.000
And you guys have to do an impression of that celebrity talking.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
Or doing the word or action that I'm going to talk about.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
That I'm going to say.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
That makes sense.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Doing the edges.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
Like if it's like Jenna Jennifer,

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
I've got what's a cool edge doing gardening.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
She'd be like,

25:37.000 --> 25:45.000
I can't wait to have a hole in my hand for the seeds this season.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Who was that?

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
That was Jennifer's.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
And I thought it was pretty good.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
All right, Jason.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Oh, God.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Oh, no.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
Wes Anderson in a swamp.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
And also, I should have mentioned.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Who knows what he looks like.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
What he sounds like.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Yeah.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
Well, that's not doing.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Right?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
That's what you got.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
All right, Wes Anderson in a swamp.

26:19.000 --> 26:24.000
And I have two full minutes.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
Go for it.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
Yeah, just the only thing I know about Wes Anderson is that he's a director.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
So I'll start my impression now.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Oh, wait.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Actually, you know.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Okay, cool.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Action.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Oh, I didn't need that.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
That was happening in front of the camera.

26:43.000 --> 26:49.000
But again, he's just the director.

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
So I think it's a great impression.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I guess at the end of two minutes, I'll just yell cut.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
And then we'll cut this entire part out of the video.

26:59.000 --> 27:05.000
I saw also this week of the day.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
Oh, Wes Anderson film at MoMA, which was fun.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
And it had a little intro from Wes Anderson.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
But I couldn't tell you.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I think he is a pretty regular voice.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
I'd say.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Yeah.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
You can't really do an impression.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Which one of them did I see?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
The Darjeeling Limited.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Uh, I think that's his worst movie.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
It's one of my favorites, I think.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
Actually, I think bottle rockets are worse.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I also of bottle rocket.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
The short film or bottle rocket.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
The feature film.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
The feature film.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Right.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
I also snuck into MoMA after I saw that, which was pretty fun.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
A little heist.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
It was really Jesse.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
Jeff, you have also made it impossible to edit this now,

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
because there's a running clock on the screen.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
So everything you were worried about before is coming through because of you.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
This is still.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
We should say that this is still Wes Anderson in a swamp.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
This is what this is.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
No.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Well, it's not, man.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
I had to admit that he did it quickly.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
You restarted it by the way.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
You started it again.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Because great.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
And you said, I'm going to start now.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
So yeah, you said it.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
That's totally fair.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
I'm still.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
If you could just let me finish my impression.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
I'm still doing it.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
I'm still on the clock.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Exactly.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
Y'all going to see the French dispatch when it comes out.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
It comes out.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
It comes out my birthday, actually.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Can all go forward.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
I'm glad.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
I'm glad.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
And cut.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
That was really good.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
That was really good, Wes.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Thanks.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
All right.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Now it's Marieka's turn.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Here we go.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
It's not.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
PT Barnum.

28:49.000 --> 28:54.000
At an assassination.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Again.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
These are not.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Doing.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
The entire game is the impression of doing.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Yeah.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
And it's just people at places.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
You can be doing it.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
What are these generators?

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
And start moving the clock so much.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
It's so erratic.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
What's on his shoulders?

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
You can see all your shots.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Yeah.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
It sucks.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Oh my god.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I got a question to be clear.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
I am at a assassination right now.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
First and foremost.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Yeah.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Which is like something you pay tickets for.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Okay.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Yeah.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
I'm assuming.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
PT Barnum.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
Is, of course, me who is the circus man.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Yeah.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
The wild west showman.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Right.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
So I'm assuming I'm at the circus.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Because I am.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
And.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
You know, there's an assassination.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Is about to occur.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Yeah.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Which is great.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
This is a lot of doing.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Yeah.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
No.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Not about to go into.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Currently I'm in.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
This sucks.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
This fucking sucks.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
What did you think would happen?

30:04.000 --> 30:12.000
I thought I did this to put you make you guys uncomfortable and get out of your comfort zone.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Yeah.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
That was never going to happen.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Yeah.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
You're just not giving people that it's possible.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
I'll do it.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I'm going to pressure it up.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
And they're not.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Again, they're not doing anything.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Yeah.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Yeah.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Yeah.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
But he's just there.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Yes.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
He can be talking about anything.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
I guess the assassination.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Let's say it happened right now.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Oh, what?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Notification.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Did you just get.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Grailed.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Now live.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Design a week.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Um.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Yeah.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
The assassination happened.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
Everyone around me is panicking.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
I'm fine, though.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Why are you?

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
No.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
It's going to happen.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
What?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Because I'm.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
He orchestrated the entire thing.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
All right.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
It's a mirror's turn.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
I swear to God, if you don't bring this home,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
I'm going to be mad.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
All right.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Rain Wilson.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Okay.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Being lonely.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Uh, all right.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Uh, I'm rain Wilson.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
And where is everybody?

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
I'm all by myself.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Yeah.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
We can read your email.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Gmail's.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
What do you have?

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
And about the Texas governor.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
If you donate to act blue even one time.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Yeah.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Yeah.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Yeah.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Um, I'm.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
I'm.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
I wonder if I should do a crossword puzzle.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Oh, here's a clue about me.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
It's saying, uh, actor.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
From actor Dwight from now.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
You know what?

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Fuck this.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
What?

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
That was.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Fuck this.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Oh, you're not going to say what you're doing.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
Everybody else did worse than me.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
By the way, rain Wilson being lonely.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Again, not doing anything.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
It's, it's the absence of doing.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
I'm very good every time.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
I thought that was a pretty good fucking game.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
That was easy.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Why?

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Why?

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
Have you guys seen Taskmaster?

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Yes.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Yeah.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
What?

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
What is that?

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
I don't know.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Why would you watch Taskmaster?

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Yes.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Correct.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Correct.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Correct.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
Will you just carry us or are you setting up a segment?

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
I am setting up a segment and I'm curious.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
All right.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
This is, well, that's Taskmaster.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
You say this is well-bathed Taskmaster.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Is that all right?

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Just, yeah.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
How, how's the copy doing?

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
It's all right.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Welcome to...

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
RASH Master.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
No.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
No.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
He'll flots.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
So, I still haven't seen Taskmaster.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
But this is RASH Master.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
This is part of the RASH.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Is the name of the game.

33:40.000 --> 33:48.000
I'll let's like Rose, the touch, taskmaster for inspiration for the show from people that do things like this professionally.

33:48.000 --> 33:54.000
Amir was exactly right and he hasn't even heard the game yet.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
So, this is RASH.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
RASH.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
You guessed the RASH.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Yeah.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
And let me say that.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
Let me say that.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
And I won't be looking at this screen.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
All right.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Amir got Rosace.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
That's $100 to Amir.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
$100 owed to me for every wrong answer we should say.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Is Rosace a type of RASH?

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
In a way.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Is that Lyme's disease?

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Oh my god.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
We would felt cleaning out.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
That's $200 to Amir's name.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
I'm an amateur dermatologist of sorts.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
I literally...

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
That looks like ASMR.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
That looks like ASMR.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
So much.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
I was looking at skin issues.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Poison Oak.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Oh, that's good.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Poison Ivy.

34:37.000 --> 34:43.000
I'm not going to guess.

34:43.000 --> 34:51.000
I have the screen so small that I can barely see it.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
All so easy.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
Stop saying what it's fucking is.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
This one's Hepatitis C.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
Hepatitis D all of the above.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
All right.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Next one.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
That looks like Poison Oak.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Or Poison Ivy.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
Poison Zoomack.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
It was Poison Ivy.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Amir's exactly ready.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
He's up $300.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
Diper RASH.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
I should have done Diper RASH.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
I just didn't like kids with the only people who were Diper,

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
so I didn't want to show a photo of like a kid's ass.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
That was a good idea.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
I didn't know where you'd draw the line.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Yes, of course.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Is that a butt or a boobs?

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
That's going to be a butt.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
And adult butt.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Is it back knee?

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Meryka?

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
I'm literally not looking at it.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Why?

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
Let's see how wise you are to RASH's.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Is it Diper RASH?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
That was already yesterday.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
What is that little extra box that keeps coming up?

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
That's got to be a bad move on your part.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
Oh, wait, really?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
What happens?

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
When I do that, there's like no,

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
there's just like a little preview of the same image,

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
but a slut.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Yeah, like it keeps.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Yeah.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
What is this?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
That it keeps moving.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Yeah.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I can't see what you guys are actually seeing.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
This is going to be a yeast image.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Why?

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Why did you do this?

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Because I'm taking YouTube video.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
You can tell.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Because I wanted to raise.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
It's raised.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
What'd you say?

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Yeah, it's a mirror.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
It's exima.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Yeah, it's raised and dry.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Recials.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Recials.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Oh, mary.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Not even looking at it.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Not even looking at it.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Not even looking at it.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
All right.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
This one should be, yeah.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Give me.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Let's see how wise grace can be.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
This one feels like back knee.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Yeah.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Up.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Come here.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Down.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Back acne.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Which is different from back.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Okay, I guess it could be chicken box, but.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Correct.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
I'm here for $400.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Let's see what this is.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
Well, those little legs are this spider.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Spider eggs are something.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
That extra box.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Is there, is there a world where this is back knee?

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
And it's just so easy.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Interesting.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
How many different rashes do you think the average person knows?

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
The perfect out of context had gone.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Half of these aren't rashes.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Yeah.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
That's true.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
More than half.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Probably.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
I don't think we've seen one rash.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Yeah.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
Yeah, we heard you play the wrong song for that.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
That was easy.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
This was shingles.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Yeah.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
This one's kind of sad.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Yeah.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
This one's going to be scarlet fever.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
And I think we should just move on.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Oh, my god.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
That's it.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Are they gone?

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Can I move my screen back?

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Don't look disappointed.

38:31.000 --> 38:37.000
Why is it, by the way, that every time I actually put time and thought into the episode,

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
it turns out to be horseshit.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
And then the time and thought you put was impression of doing.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
And guess that rash.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Round to that one's take to.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
It's hour.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
That was an hour of crap.

38:51.000 --> 38:56.000
It shouldn't have made a game called rashmaster.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
That we have to put on YouTube now.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
And I'm going to get in the diseases to people.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Are we going to get a flag for nudity for the butt?

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
Probably.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Maybe.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
I think this should be a by week.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
I think we didn't release this episode.

39:15.000 --> 39:20.000
But why are we here talking?

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
What can you possibly be talking about?

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Let's get into it.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
We're almost at the 40 minute mark here.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
I feel like we didn't talk enough about your guys.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
What do you guys do this weekend?

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Let's go ahead.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Pretty eventful weekend.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
I went to my niece's bot mitzvah.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
A Jewish kind of age ceremony.

39:41.000 --> 39:46.000
So it's a dinner or a party either before or after.

39:46.000 --> 39:55.000
And then a service where the young lady reads from the Torah based on what portion is being read that we know.

39:55.000 --> 40:00.000
The Torah.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
We've all been to a party in that spot.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
I've been to a ribbon to us.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
Really?

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
Yeah.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
I'm too new.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Sorry, I'm here.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
I mean, I know what they are.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
I'm just saying.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
So since the Jewish New Year just started, her Torah portion was

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
Brashit aka the first one.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
That's right.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
God creating the world can enable the Garden of Eden.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
Some pretty important shit was discussed.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
Red, chanted, and prayed upon.

40:29.000 --> 40:34.000
So I guess show some respect towards the liturgy.

40:34.000 --> 40:46.000
Genesis, as you Christians may call it, is a pretty important chapter in the Tanakh.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
Why is that funny?

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
I'm just an awe.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
Oh, it's these are the days of awe.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
The Yamim nor Aim.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
What?

41:00.000 --> 41:05.000
Talk in not riddles for once in your goddamn life.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
I went through my nieces, but mits.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Good.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
Good.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
She's 13 already?

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
Is this the niece I met at the Hibium office once?

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
Yeah, well, there's a 16 year old in a 12 year old.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
That's a crazy world.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Congratulations.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Yeah.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
Yeah.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Congratulations.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
That's all you did this weekend?

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
You didn't.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
All I did, that's a pretty big fucking deal.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
What do you love?

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
She went to fucking Zebulon.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
No, I didn't go to Zebulon.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
I'm not going to like crowded dark bar parties.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Yeah.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
It's a pretty dangerous right now.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Yeah.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
All right.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Well, I had COVID.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
So I'm going to go to the parties.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Right.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Exactly why I'm not going to the parties.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
All right.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Yeah.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
You got COVID.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Both, right?

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
LAs numbers are going way, way, way, way.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Are they?

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
Hmm.

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
They have to be.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Yeah.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
So you're not checking.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Not recently.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
Of course.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
Let's do Marika.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
What'd you do this weekend?

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
I think I really explained every single thing that I did this weekend.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
To recap, I saw Wes Anderson film at the moment.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
And I came to the moment the next day.

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
I went to the Broadway flea market and bought a bunch of stuff.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
And then I fried a, I saw Venom.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
I'm sorry.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
There's a lot of Venom.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
Let there be carnage.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
Mmm.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
Mmm.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
So rude.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
Yeah.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
So we did that weekend.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
They say it.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
No, no.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
You go.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
Wow.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
It's so rude.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Yeah.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Yeah.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
And it was.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
Yeah.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
And it was.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Yeah.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
And it was.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
On to the next, right?

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
To down one to the other.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
It's so rude.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Like we have to have a guest on.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I want to have a guest on next week.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Because I want to be.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
I want to be really rude to a stranger.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
I should get Dan.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
You can switch on the show.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Sure.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
I'm sure he would love it.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
Grayson.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
If I tell you, are you going to play the wow sound effect after?

43:35.000 --> 43:40.000
No, because I've already, I already like, which isn't good for audio or video.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
I already kind of made myself laugh at it.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
And none of you did.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
So that's not good.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
Yeah.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
Yeah.

43:46.000 --> 43:52.000
I took a train up to New Haven, Connecticut to visit my friend for her birthday.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
Mmm.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Yeah.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Very exciting.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
Train travel is the way of the future.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Set about the Metro Norris.

44:01.000 --> 44:08.000
I really hope we get like that light speed rail or whatever it's called.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
Yeah.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
That's called infrastructure.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
I'm here.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
That's called job variation.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
What's that?

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
So what?

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
I don't know.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
That's all the centers Democrats are always talking about.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Infrastructure jobs.

44:24.000 --> 44:29.000
Let's just all do nonsense and call it a life.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
That's sort of what you're doing.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
Yes.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Yes.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Yes.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
I'm a beacon of the prime example.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
I'm a beacon of nonsense.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
Are you happy?

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
Yeah.

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
Because like, I don't sleep a lot.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Because it sounds a lot.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
I haven't slept here.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
I haven't.

44:53.000 --> 44:58.000
I get so much joy out of what I do on a weekly basis on a daily basis.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Gross.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Major killer.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
Be joy.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
What?

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
Be joy.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Is what I said.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
And it's a major killer to send us off into the night.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Not generally.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
Do not go gently into the good night.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
It's not the reference.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
Dunn.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Daniel.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Plugs.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
What do you guys have going on?

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
What do you want to point the people to?

45:33.000 --> 45:37.000
For some reason, the floor is all of ours at the same time.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Let's all say it once.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Three, two, one.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Head got.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
Head got.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
Head got.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
Head got.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Yeah.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
Head got.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
Head got.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Head got.

45:49.300 --> 45:51.000
I knew myself.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
I knew something it's available to that show and the high and mighty power hour.

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
It is a power hour podcast and then every place.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
You should've raised some plug your shit as well.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
I'll tell you you're talking.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Yeah.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
So if you want to be a part of that and go brings as yesterday,

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
treat us together.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
The people around us go to Computer nessa.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
It just gets, we all that a message done.

46:12.000 --> 46:17.000
Engineer company that's going for 40 years.

46:17.000 --> 46:23.000
There's a lot of space for no reason, even though you want to pretend to hold out, everybody's going to be there in the game.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Not just since before.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
After.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
It's going to be fleeting, but also recorded.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
80 tickets left.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
80 tickets left for the entire thing.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
So if you want to do that, you got to get in on it now.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Is my whole thing.

46:37.000 --> 46:42.000
By the time this comes out, probably looking more at 60 tickets, if I had to guess.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
And I have 10 plus ones on your left.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I actually have 12 plus ones now.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
So there's only 68 tickets or seats.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
Let's say.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
Grayson, anything more to plug that you didn't get out?

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
You know, gray KY's.

47:00.000 --> 47:05.000
That's me on if you want to follow me on Instagram, Twitter, Spotify, any of the big three.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Is that a J-made playlist?

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
Reference.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Or is that just gray KY's?

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
No, that's just my name.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
I know.

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
But I also wondered if you were like trying to do like a J-K Rowling thing.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
I think that would have been.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
That would have been like a fun reference like 10 years ago.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
But I've everything she's done.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Yeah, but maybe it's subversive.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
Yeah.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
I don't know.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
Maybe.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
But it's not.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
Brownlee.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
I really, I said all my stuff during the massive.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
All right.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
All right.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Calm down.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
I just, this didn't go how I wanted to.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Really?

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Video aspects make me nervous.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Yeah.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
I mean, I think that's fair for us all.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
I thought it was video until we start open to the zoom.

47:54.000 --> 47:58.000
And I was like, I should have worn something more interesting.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
The best part of podcasting as you don't have to worry about.

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
You forgot that it was video, but you planned a video-based segment

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
where people had to look at rashes.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
That's also true.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
At Jeffrey James Lennon's Instagram.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
At Jeff Boyhardy on Twitter.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
And he had gone podcast live October 22nd, 7pm.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
Get him before they're gone.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
I do think this is going to sell out.

48:20.000 --> 48:24.000
So if you've been waiting, but you know you want to go, get him this week.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
And until next week, that's Dodds folks.

48:39.000 --> 48:47.000
That was a hit dumb original.

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:02.000 --> 00:28.780
We're here to

00:28.780 --> 00:31.280
write it at some read.

00:31.280 --> 00:38.480
We're banking episodes, we've got another episode where nobody who works

00:38.480 --> 00:39.640
then I work as on the episode.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.640
Great.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.320
Casey, are you on a voice of God, Mike though?

00:42.320 --> 00:43.320
Yes, I am.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.320
You're our anchor.

00:44.320 --> 00:47.720
We've got, welcome back to the show.

00:47.720 --> 00:53.320
We've never had this combination of guests, but we've got William Nicola's brick.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.320
Hello.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.320
Hello.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.320
Your last name's brick?

00:56.320 --> 00:57.320
It is.

00:57.320 --> 00:58.320
My first name.

00:58.320 --> 00:59.320
Billy.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.320
Billy, brick.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.320
William, brick.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.320
Sessily, bro.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.320
Lucy.

01:04.320 --> 01:05.320
Hi.

01:05.320 --> 01:06.320
Thank you.

01:06.320 --> 01:10.320
Coming at you live from Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.320
Houston, Texas.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.320
Yeah.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.320
Pittsburgh.

01:14.320 --> 01:15.320
Sorry.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.320
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

01:16.320 --> 01:17.320
Oh, my God.

01:17.320 --> 01:18.320
God.

01:18.320 --> 01:19.320
I watch you work on it.

01:19.320 --> 01:20.320
Oh, okay.

01:20.320 --> 01:21.320
You're referencing my content.

01:21.320 --> 01:22.320
I am.

01:22.320 --> 01:23.320
I will say that.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.320
So, Lucy's from Pittsburgh.

01:25.320 --> 01:29.320
And you posted a TikTok and or real of how you'll say that.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.320
And the people will be like, oh, my God.

01:31.320 --> 01:32.320
I love Philadelphia.

01:32.320 --> 01:33.320
Immediately.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.320
And some of my best friends that I've known for years.

01:35.320 --> 01:39.000
I mean, I'm certain that you have been like, are you going back to Philly for the

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
holiday?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.320
I don't think I've said that once, actually.

01:41.320 --> 01:44.320
Well, it must have been Mary.

01:44.320 --> 01:48.320
Is that why is that a thing that people get confused?

01:48.320 --> 01:49.320
Beats me.

01:49.320 --> 01:50.320
Beats me.

01:50.320 --> 01:51.320
They're different enough.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.320
I guess they're both Pennsylvania cities that start with a P.

01:54.320 --> 01:55.320
Right.

01:55.320 --> 01:58.320
George Saba said that you're from Philadelphia.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.320
Like a week ago.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.320
Wow.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.320
Okay.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.320
Call him out.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.320
I'm going to need his contact information.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.320
I have to be texting him.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.320
The fact that you don't have his number.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.320
And he doesn't have yours as punishment enough.

02:07.320 --> 02:08.320
Yeah.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.320
That's true.

02:09.320 --> 02:10.320
He can never reach me.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.320
It's true.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.320
Like your pillow situation.

02:12.320 --> 02:13.320
This is good.

02:13.320 --> 02:14.320
Yeah.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.320
I tried to put it on the ground.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.320
And then Billy was like, oh, I'm going to put it back.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.320
Are you guys afraid of intimacy?

02:19.320 --> 02:20.320
Emotional or physical?

02:20.320 --> 02:21.320
Both.

02:21.320 --> 02:22.320
Neither.

02:22.320 --> 02:23.320
What about you, Billy?

02:23.320 --> 02:24.320
What about this?

02:24.320 --> 02:25.320
You're comfortable.

02:25.320 --> 02:26.320
I can't take it off.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.320
I took it off.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.320
I took it off.

02:28.320 --> 02:30.320
He said he wanted me to feel as uncomfortable as possible.

02:30.320 --> 02:31.320
Yeah.

02:31.320 --> 02:35.320
I'll certainly think he charges by just dying.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.320
Just a deep sigh.

02:36.320 --> 02:37.320
Well, you know.

02:37.320 --> 02:38.320
Really nice.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.320
That felt great for me.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.320
I'm wasting Casey's time.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.320
Okay.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.320
Casey produces like nine shows.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.320
All right.

02:44.320 --> 02:45.320
Casey.

02:45.320 --> 02:49.320
And we're trying to bank and put 10 episodes that we can take the time off for the holidays.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.320
No.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.320
It's hard for you.

02:52.320 --> 02:55.320
You shouldn't have accepted the job if you couldn't handle it.

02:55.320 --> 02:56.320
Yeah.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.320
No.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.320
I can handle it.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.320
I just can't handle it without sign.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.320
Mm-hmm.

03:00.320 --> 03:01.320
Let's get to know each other a little bit.

03:01.320 --> 03:04.320
Let's play some ice breakers because I know you too very well.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.320
You specifically very well.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.320
And I know you separately pretty well.

03:08.320 --> 03:11.320
I'm creating a sliding skill because I've known

03:11.320 --> 03:12.320
Sessley since I was 17.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.320
Yeah.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.320
Why don't you guys all share your like ice breaker fact?

03:16.320 --> 03:17.320
No.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.320
I can tell you.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.320
You can.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.320
Yeah.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.320
I can't.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.320
I can't.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.320
I cannot solve it.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.320
I can't solve it.

03:24.320 --> 03:25.320
No.

03:25.320 --> 03:26.320
I can solve it.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.320
How fast?

03:27.320 --> 03:29.320
You used to be able to do it in under a minute.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.320
But I would need to brush up my skills.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.320
Yeah.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.320
Damn.

03:33.320 --> 03:34.320
But we'll wait.

03:34.320 --> 03:36.320
Well, I didn't bring it.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.320
I think we do have one.

03:38.320 --> 03:39.320
Okay.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.320
I could just take an hour or two to refresh.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.320
And then I can come back and then solve it for you guys.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.320
We're recording again at noon if either.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.320
Okay.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.320
Come back.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.320
How long to take to learn to solve.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.320
You don't know.

03:49.320 --> 03:54.320
It probably took me like a couple days of there's like these algorithms you can memorize.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.320
Oh.

03:55.320 --> 03:56.320
And it took me a couple days of memorizing those.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.320
And then I would just be like.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.320
So I had a lot of friends.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.320
I was wondering.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.320
I was cool.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.320
Yeah.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.320
Yeah.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.320
But good for you.

04:04.320 --> 04:05.320
I want to get like an all diamond ruby cube.

04:05.320 --> 04:06.320
So it's all the same.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.320
I'll learn on every side.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.320
No matter what.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.320
Yeah.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.320
Yeah.

04:10.320 --> 04:14.320
I feel like you and I had the same trajectory of like into things that the people

04:14.320 --> 04:15.320
don't care about.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.320
Yeah.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.320
Now we're just like very sexual.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.320
Yeah.

04:19.320 --> 04:20.320
Now we're like.

04:20.320 --> 04:23.320
Which by the way, you've been really calling me out on Twitter for me.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.320
Because you've been learning.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.320
So horny on me.

04:25.320 --> 04:26.320
Let's say more about that.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.320
Can't.

04:27.320 --> 04:28.320
So you can't.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.320
It's just novel to me.

04:29.320 --> 04:31.320
What's so horny about what I'm doing on Twitter?

04:31.320 --> 04:32.320

04:33.320 --> 04:36.320
What's so horny about what I've been doing on Twitter?

04:36.320 --> 04:37.320
Followers.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.320
Billy, are you still on a gamefully employed relationship?

04:40.320 --> 04:41.320
Nine hours ago.

04:41.320 --> 04:42.320
You.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.320
I want 30 in the morning.

04:43.320 --> 04:45.320
You tweeted a grown divorce man.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.320
That's accurate.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.320
Oh, yeah.

04:49.320 --> 04:50.320
My God.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.320
It is that hand.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.320
I need to delete that.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.320
Question marks.

04:53.320 --> 04:54.320
Question marks.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.320
Question marks are sexy.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.320
You like that?

04:57.320 --> 04:58.320
Yeah, you do.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.320
What's horny about that?

05:00.320 --> 05:02.320
Not going to horny about a simple question.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.320
I were a work in stocks and I fuck.

05:04.320 --> 05:08.320
Can people please stop thinking they're mutually exclusive?

05:08.320 --> 05:13.320
I mean, that's just.

05:13.320 --> 05:14.320
I think that's back.

05:14.320 --> 05:17.320
The hottest men have nightis terrors.

05:17.320 --> 05:18.320
Yeah.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.320
The hottest men have the nightis terrors.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.320
Yeah.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.320
That sounds like something you would have tweeted.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.320
Well, that's right.

05:23.320 --> 05:24.320
Yeah.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.320
Exactly.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.320
You also tweeted a picture of your ass.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.320
Yeah.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.320
What did you guys think of that?

05:29.320 --> 05:31.320
I got your opinion on it, but I think.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.320
Did you send it to me?

05:32.320 --> 05:34.320
I might have showed it to you in person.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.320
I don't think I got my eyes on it.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.320
I'm not really on Twitter.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.320
On a daybed reading book.

05:39.320 --> 05:40.320
Oh, wait.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.320
I did.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.320
Yeah.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.320
That's all.

05:43.320 --> 05:48.320
Well, you wanted to see if there was a hole.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.320
Yeah.

05:49.320 --> 05:51.320
Sometimes I'm like, is it just a candle?

05:51.320 --> 05:52.320
Yeah.

05:52.320 --> 05:53.320
We kind of see hole.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.320
It's almost 2023.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.320
Show hole.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.320
When we were shooting that.

05:56.320 --> 05:59.320
We were doing me.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.320
What?

06:00.320 --> 06:01.320
What's that?

06:01.320 --> 06:02.320
What?

06:02.320 --> 06:06.320
When we were on that shirt on that day.

06:06.320 --> 06:11.320
It was me, the photographer, and then like sort of my closest confidant.

06:11.320 --> 06:14.320
And George.

06:14.320 --> 06:17.320
We had sort of my closest confidant.

06:17.320 --> 06:22.320
We didn't have an intimacy coordinator, so it was like any time I took the trunk

06:22.320 --> 06:23.320
off, right?

06:23.320 --> 06:25.320
It would have to be like balls.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.320
And then the photographer returned around.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.320
And then I would say set.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.320
Once like my dick was set.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.320
Up and under me.

06:32.320 --> 06:33.320
Up and under.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.320
So did you like talk it up towards your belly?

06:35.320 --> 06:36.320
Yeah.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.320
It was exciting.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.320
You're lying face down.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.320
Why did you have to tuck your dick?

06:39.320 --> 06:40.320
Because I was like.

06:40.320 --> 06:41.320
How do you want me a little bit?

06:41.320 --> 06:42.320
Where?

06:42.320 --> 06:43.320
Where?

06:43.320 --> 06:44.320
Where?

06:44.320 --> 06:45.320
Why?

06:45.320 --> 06:48.320
You just read my Twitter and he couldn't help it again.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.320
Yeah.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.320
I mean emotional abstinence.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.320
Is there anything hotter?

06:53.320 --> 06:54.320
JK.

06:54.320 --> 06:55.320
I'm anti-avoidant now.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.320
No more.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.320
No more.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.320
I'm all for avoidance and emotional abstinence.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.320
I think you should abstain from all emotion.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.320
It will set you free.

07:03.320 --> 07:07.320
How's your emotional body?

07:07.320 --> 07:08.320
And how's your physical body?

07:08.320 --> 07:10.320
Let's hear about that guy.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.320
She's nice.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.320
I developed a wool allergy.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.320
Oh, what?

07:15.320 --> 07:16.320
Yeah.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.320
I, you, yeah.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.320
My eyes get all fucked up.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.320
You can relate.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.320
I'm sure.

07:21.320 --> 07:22.320
Not even in a, you know, mean way.

07:22.320 --> 07:24.320
I feel like that bonds us.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.320
But yeah.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.320
I can, I can no longer wear wool.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.320
Um, on my body, because I'm my throat swells up.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.320
And my eyes get bloodshot red.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.320
Oh.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.320
That does suck for you.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.320
Because I feel like you're a big wool sweater head.

07:36.320 --> 07:37.320
I was.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.320
Yeah.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.320
I gave all my sweaters to my brother.

07:39.320 --> 07:40.320
Like a hero.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.320
Dead sea.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.320
Yeah.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.320
Demsea.

07:43.320 --> 07:44.320
We should do the all brick up.

07:44.320 --> 07:45.320
Yeah.

07:45.320 --> 07:46.320
You, Demsea, and what's your sister's name?

07:46.320 --> 07:47.320
Ella.

07:47.320 --> 07:48.320
Ella.

07:48.320 --> 07:49.320
Cute.

07:49.320 --> 07:50.320
Yeah.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.320
Ella's a heartbreaker name.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.320
Yeah.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.320
She'd love this show.

07:53.320 --> 07:54.320
I love her.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.320
I love her.

07:55.320 --> 07:56.320
Well, she's, she's an adult.

07:56.320 --> 07:57.320
Yeah.

07:57.320 --> 07:58.320
Okay, great.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.320
I think you have to be 18 to guess from the show.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.320
Yeah.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.320
The subject matters pretty.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.320
I would say yeah.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.320
Yeah.

08:05.320 --> 08:06.320
But let's stop talking about the underage ones.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.320
You know?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.320
But if you could get trauma, you wouldn't.

08:09.320 --> 08:13.320
I would corner trauma into saying something cancelable on the show.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.320
Hmm.

08:14.320 --> 08:15.320
Um.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.320
That'd be fun.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.320
What the fuck was I about to say?

08:18.320 --> 08:19.320
Are you still dead?

08:19.320 --> 08:20.320
I am.

08:20.320 --> 08:21.320
Can we get into it?

08:21.320 --> 08:22.320
Thanks for asking now.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.320
Um.

08:24.320 --> 08:25.320
Yeah.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.320
You can get into it long distance.

08:27.320 --> 08:28.320
Yep.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.320
Yep.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.320
So has that cyber ring?

08:31.320 --> 08:32.320
We can't get into it.

08:32.320 --> 08:33.320
Yeah.

08:33.320 --> 08:35.320
Because this person is your partner lives in.

08:35.320 --> 08:37.320
She lives in New York.

08:37.320 --> 08:38.320
Um.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.320
So I'm trying to.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.320
Yes.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.320
New York City.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.320
Uh.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.320
So she goes to the shrine.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.320
Well, no.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.320
She goes.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.320
She goes to the school that my old school.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.320
By stealing it and it's based off.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.320
Wow.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.320
How'd you all meet?

08:50.320 --> 08:51.320
Uh, through friends.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.320
We met through a friend.

08:52.320 --> 08:55.320
Is there anything we're going to be dating through a friend?

08:56.320 --> 08:57.320
Exactly.

08:57.320 --> 08:58.320
What?

08:58.320 --> 08:59.320
I'm sorry.

08:59.320 --> 09:00.320
That's why I met Jeff.

09:00.320 --> 09:01.320
Hey.

09:01.320 --> 09:02.320
Oh.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.320
Jeff and I are dating.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.320
I just want to thank that clear.

09:06.320 --> 09:07.320
It's that.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.320
People don't say that because people are going to DM you a lot.

09:09.320 --> 09:10.320
It's a joke.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.320
Um, I would never.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.320
I wouldn't be.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.320
I would never.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.320
Oh, let's hang on a minute.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.320
I would never.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.320
There could be like a twin flame situation going on.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.320
No.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.320
I'm over it.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.320
Next question on a moving on.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.320
Um.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.320
Do you guys want to talk about your loves lives?

09:25.320 --> 09:26.320
Sure.

09:26.320 --> 09:29.320
I just got out of relationship.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.320
Baby.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.320
Oh.

09:32.320 --> 09:35.320
Are you going to make us out of the fact?

09:35.320 --> 09:36.320
Yeah.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.320
Yeah.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.320
Where's one sound effects for that?

09:39.320 --> 09:40.320
Play like.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.320
Okay.

09:41.320 --> 09:42.320
Yeah.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.320
That feels good.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.320
Um.

09:44.320 --> 09:47.320
I want to act surprised, but I did hear about that.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.320
Of course.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.320
Of course.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.320
We run in the same circle, friend.

09:50.320 --> 09:51.320
Yeah.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.320
It's.

09:52.320 --> 09:53.320
Just the season.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.320
Coff don't.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.320
Right.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.320
Coff don't.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.320
Coff don't.

09:58.320 --> 10:01.320
So Lucy and Cecilia were dating two men and lived together.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.320
We were dating roommates.

10:02.320 --> 10:03.320
Yeah.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.320
And now they're both gone.

10:05.320 --> 10:06.320
Yeah.

10:06.320 --> 10:07.320
Yeah.

10:07.320 --> 10:08.320
They've been missing for weeks.

10:08.320 --> 10:09.320
We can't find them.

10:09.320 --> 10:14.320
So how's your like revenge era or revenge era?

10:14.320 --> 10:16.320
Uh, I'm not into revenge.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.320
I'm more of like, I'll let you go.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.320
You know what I mean?

10:19.320 --> 10:20.320
I've never been like.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.320
But if you do that, they're going to come back.

10:23.320 --> 10:25.320
No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.320
Yeah.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.320
I think the thing about my friend Cecilia's.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.320
Um.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.320
I've never met a more resilient.

10:33.320 --> 10:39.320
And also, I think that there's kind of like a no return policy.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.320
Yeah.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.320
Interesting.

10:41.320 --> 10:42.320
So you don't back slide.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.320
Oh, no.

10:43.320 --> 10:44.320
No, no, no.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.320
Well, my thing is that I'll be like, here's a million chances.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.320

10:47.320 --> 10:48.320
Chom.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.320
Chom.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.320
And then take a sip.

10:50.320 --> 10:51.320
Yeah.

10:52.320 --> 10:53.320
I'll take a sip too.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.320
Yeah.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.320
All right.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.320
Uh.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.320
Uh.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.320
Excuse me.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.320
Oh, I'll just give a million chances.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.320
And then once it's done, I'm like,

11:05.320 --> 11:07.320
it's like, okay, I tried.

11:07.320 --> 11:09.320
And I, I let it go.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.320
When I say that's enough.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.320
No more.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.320
It's like a turnoff.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.320
You know, that's honorable.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.320
Thank you.

11:14.320 --> 11:15.320
Yeah.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.320
What do you think?

11:16.320 --> 11:17.320
Yeah.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.320
What's been the hardest part of your guys is breakups.

11:19.320 --> 11:20.320
And then I'm sorry.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.320
Okay.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.320
The flavor patterns in this area.

11:32.320 --> 11:33.320
Oh, it's tough.

11:33.320 --> 11:34.320
Fuck.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.320
Okay.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.320
Can you tell me when we're clear?

11:36.320 --> 11:37.320
We're clear.

11:37.320 --> 11:38.320
Oh, my God.

11:38.320 --> 11:39.320
Um, okay.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.320
So hardest part of your breakups.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.320
Yeah.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.320
We should say,

11:43.320 --> 11:45.320
Wesley, yours is very recent.

11:45.320 --> 11:46.320
Yeah.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.320
Mine's pretty recent about a week ago.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.320
Not even.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.320
Okay.

11:49.320 --> 11:50.320
Wow.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.320
It goes tomorrow.

11:51.320 --> 11:52.320
Yeah.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.320
Wow.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.320
Okay.

11:54.320 --> 11:55.320
Everyone, keep in touch.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.320
Everyone's keep in touch.

11:56.320 --> 11:57.320
Everyone's keep in touch.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.320
I wasn't gossiping, but I heard wind.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.320
I heard wind.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.320
Yeah.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.320
Yeah.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.320
It's on the wind.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.320
Certainly.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.320
Yeah.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.320
So a week tomorrow was mine.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.320
And so far so good.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.320
What's been the hardest part?

12:10.320 --> 12:12.320
And then are you going out this week?

12:12.320 --> 12:13.320
Oh.

12:13.320 --> 12:14.320
Yeah.

12:14.320 --> 12:15.320
You're not into revenge.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.320
No.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.320
I was going out before.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.320
Like, I like to have fun, you know?

12:19.320 --> 12:20.320
That's fun.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.320
That's my thing.

12:21.320 --> 12:22.320
I want to dance.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.320
I want to thank you.

12:23.320 --> 12:26.320
I got a scholarship for wanting to have fun.

12:26.320 --> 12:27.320
Thank you.

12:27.320 --> 12:28.320
Full ride.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.320
Full ride.

12:29.320 --> 12:30.320
For most fun girl.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.320
Um.

12:31.320 --> 12:32.320
What's the question?

12:32.320 --> 12:33.320
What's the hardest part?

12:33.320 --> 12:34.320
Yeah.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.320
Well, the hardest part is like,

12:35.320 --> 12:37.320
it's kind of wild when you're with someone for a bit.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.320
And then you're like,

12:38.320 --> 12:39.320
Casey later.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.320
And then again,

12:40.320 --> 12:41.320
it's just like,

12:41.320 --> 12:43.320
I guess we'll never talk again.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.320
And I just met your family.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.320
Yeah.

12:47.320 --> 12:49.320
I wish it had happened before I went back for the holidays.

12:49.320 --> 12:50.320
That would have been sick.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.320
That would have been sick.

12:51.320 --> 12:52.320
Yeah, that was a big fumble.

12:52.320 --> 12:53.320
Yeah, that was a fumble.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.320
What I really appreciated that happening before.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.320
Having to meet everyone.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.320
Thank you.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.320
Thanks, giving.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.320
Yeah.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.320
Yeah.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.320
Tough stuff.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.320
Tough stuff.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.320
But, you know,

13:05.320 --> 13:07.320
we learned.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.320
I'm just silencing my phone.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.320
I'm sorry.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.320
It's inappropriate.

13:10.320 --> 13:11.320
Yeah.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.320
To be buzzing.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.320
Please take a moment of silence.

13:13.320 --> 13:14.320
What is your necklace, eh?

13:14.320 --> 13:15.320
Libra?

13:15.320 --> 13:15.820
Yeah.

13:16.820 --> 13:18.820
How often do you see both sides of things?

13:18.820 --> 13:20.820
Every single time I see both sides,

13:20.820 --> 13:21.820
like Chanel.

13:21.820 --> 13:22.820
Mmm.

13:22.820 --> 13:23.820
Oh, my shit.

13:23.820 --> 13:26.820
I think that's what gets me into trouble.

13:26.820 --> 13:28.820
And just to make a seamless segue,

13:28.820 --> 13:29.820
um,

13:29.820 --> 13:32.820
plays into what has been the hardest for me about my conscious

13:32.820 --> 13:33.820
on coupling.

13:33.820 --> 13:34.820
Just.

13:34.820 --> 13:36.820
You asshole.

13:36.820 --> 13:37.820
We should.

13:37.820 --> 13:38.820
We should.

13:38.820 --> 13:39.820
Coupling.

13:39.820 --> 13:40.820
I consciously encoupled,

13:40.820 --> 13:41.820
and the hardest part for me,

13:41.820 --> 13:42.820
because I'm a Libra,

13:42.820 --> 13:44.820
is like,

13:45.820 --> 13:47.820
trying to make it so fair,

13:47.820 --> 13:48.820
and be like,

13:48.820 --> 13:50.820
it's not fair for me to be angry or upset,

13:50.820 --> 13:51.820
because like,

13:51.820 --> 13:52.820
this is valid.

13:52.820 --> 13:53.820
Everything is valid.

13:53.820 --> 13:54.820
Yeah.

13:54.820 --> 13:55.820
Um,

13:55.820 --> 13:56.820
but then also just being like,

13:56.820 --> 13:57.820
oh,

13:57.820 --> 13:58.820
he was so hot.

13:58.820 --> 13:59.820
Yeah.

13:59.820 --> 14:00.820
It's such a shame.

14:00.820 --> 14:02.820
I'm a Libra moon.

14:02.820 --> 14:04.820
So I think that's what played a big part of me too.

14:04.820 --> 14:05.820
I just was like,

14:05.820 --> 14:06.820
well,

14:06.820 --> 14:07.820
yeah,

14:07.820 --> 14:08.820
let's be fair about this.

14:08.820 --> 14:09.820
Like,

14:09.820 --> 14:10.820
yeah,

14:10.820 --> 14:11.820
maybe I'm not happy,

14:11.820 --> 14:12.820
but maybe I will be like,

14:12.820 --> 14:13.820
let's just see it through,

14:13.820 --> 14:14.820
you know,

14:14.820 --> 14:16.820
I'll give you a fair shake.

14:16.820 --> 14:18.820
I can think of one thing that's not valid,

14:18.820 --> 14:19.820
if that would help you guys

14:19.820 --> 14:20.820
as Libra moon and Libra sun.

14:20.820 --> 14:21.820
Yeah, tell us.

14:21.820 --> 14:22.820
Speak on it.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.820
Lucy's beetle juice looking at us.

14:24.820 --> 14:25.820
I'll say it right now.

14:25.820 --> 14:26.820
Yeah.

14:26.820 --> 14:27.820
Yeah.

14:27.820 --> 14:28.820
You look happy.

14:28.820 --> 14:29.820
Just looking at us.

14:29.820 --> 14:31.820
Cause you had a bad day.

14:31.820 --> 14:32.820
You take the one down.

14:32.820 --> 14:34.820
If you save us,

14:34.820 --> 14:36.820
I saw you call me daddy.

14:36.820 --> 14:37.820
Oh.

14:37.820 --> 14:38.820
Yeah, you can.

14:38.820 --> 14:39.820
I'm proud of my look today.

14:39.820 --> 14:40.820
Billy,

14:40.820 --> 14:41.820
you're Scorpio.

14:41.820 --> 14:42.820
There it is.

14:42.820 --> 14:43.820
Oh,

14:43.820 --> 14:44.820
you can ask,

14:44.820 --> 14:45.820
shitter,

14:45.820 --> 14:46.820
you're getting up to long distance.

14:46.820 --> 14:47.820
Why?

14:47.820 --> 14:48.820
Stop asking me that.

14:48.820 --> 14:50.820
I'm genuinely sorry.

14:50.820 --> 14:52.820
You're trying to be word the same question.

14:52.820 --> 14:54.820
My girlfriend's also a Scorpio.

14:54.820 --> 14:55.820
I don't know if that.

14:55.820 --> 14:57.820
And we have the same,

14:57.820 --> 14:58.820
uh,

14:58.820 --> 14:59.820
rising.

14:59.820 --> 15:00.820
Okay.

15:00.820 --> 15:01.820
That's good.

15:01.820 --> 15:02.820
Yeah.

15:02.820 --> 15:03.820
Yeah.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.820
What's the rising?

15:05.820 --> 15:06.820
Uh,

15:06.820 --> 15:07.820
Leo.

15:07.820 --> 15:08.820
Okay.

15:08.820 --> 15:09.820
I'm a Leo rising.

15:09.820 --> 15:10.820
Yeah.

15:10.820 --> 15:11.820
You're a double Leo?

15:11.820 --> 15:12.820
I forgot about it.

15:12.820 --> 15:13.820
She's a piscus.

15:13.820 --> 15:14.820
I'm a piscus.

15:14.820 --> 15:16.820
Um, we do have to move on.

15:16.820 --> 15:17.820
Okay.

15:17.820 --> 15:18.820
No.

15:18.820 --> 15:19.820
This was fun.

15:19.820 --> 15:21.820
Can I quickly say I'm loving Billy's outfit?

15:21.820 --> 15:22.820
Yeah.

15:22.820 --> 15:23.820
And Billy's like a style icon.

15:23.820 --> 15:24.820
Yeah.

15:24.820 --> 15:27.820
I've truly changed the way I dress because partially because I'm a Billy.

15:27.820 --> 15:29.820
I want to change the way I dress because of Billy.

15:29.820 --> 15:31.820
No, you've always had good style.

15:31.820 --> 15:32.820
I think like basics.

15:32.820 --> 15:33.820
I don't know.

15:33.820 --> 15:34.820
What's that?

15:34.820 --> 15:36.820
You're telling me I don't need to change anything.

15:36.820 --> 15:37.820
Well, there's things to change.

15:37.820 --> 15:38.820
Oh, my God.

15:38.820 --> 15:40.820
Just don't say your name three times.

15:40.820 --> 15:41.820
Yeah.

15:41.820 --> 15:42.820
I need to play another,

15:42.820 --> 15:43.820
No, I need to play another.

15:43.820 --> 15:44.820
I need to play another.

15:44.820 --> 15:45.820
Yeah, I need to play another.

15:45.820 --> 15:46.820
Yeah.

15:46.820 --> 15:47.820
I need to play another.

15:47.820 --> 15:48.820
I need to play another.

15:48.820 --> 15:49.820
Yeah.

15:49.820 --> 15:51.820
There's a lot of nice music.

15:51.820 --> 15:52.820
Oh, man.

15:52.820 --> 15:55.820
I people lambasted me last week because I were overalls on this show.

15:55.820 --> 15:56.820
Oh, yeah.

15:56.820 --> 15:57.820
You're like, what is Jeff wearing?

15:57.820 --> 15:59.820
I'm like, you guys,

15:59.820 --> 16:00.820
what's normal to you.

16:00.820 --> 16:02.820
That's pretty fucking normal to me.

16:02.820 --> 16:03.820
Overalls cute.

16:03.820 --> 16:04.820
Paddington normalized overalls.

16:04.820 --> 16:05.820
Is that what did it?

16:05.820 --> 16:06.820
I thought so.

16:06.820 --> 16:07.820
Paddington is a fashion icon.

16:07.820 --> 16:08.820
Yeah.

16:08.820 --> 16:09.820
Just Paddington.

16:09.820 --> 16:27.820
I don't know if we did this, I think we did this when you guys were on, but basically, Daniel Craig is out as double a seven and every episode.

16:27.820 --> 16:36.820
Like excuse me, every week until the next James's cast, we're going to lob up our choices bond. This week my choice is Adam de Marca.

16:37.820 --> 16:39.820
Oh my god, don't even get me started.

16:39.820 --> 16:40.820
Don't get me started.

16:40.820 --> 16:42.820
It's time for a kind bond.

16:42.820 --> 16:46.820
A kind bond who's not like, if you get with him, you're not going to die.

16:46.820 --> 16:47.820
A white sneaker bond.

16:47.820 --> 16:49.820
Oh yeah.

16:49.820 --> 16:51.820
Thank you, Moonen.

16:51.820 --> 16:53.820
It's your choice for me now.

16:53.820 --> 16:54.820
I don't know.

16:54.820 --> 16:55.820
Cody Banks return.

16:55.820 --> 16:56.820
No matter what.

16:56.820 --> 16:58.820
Cody Banks come back, Row.

16:58.820 --> 17:03.820
When I went to London when I was like eight with my family, because my parents finally had enough money

17:03.820 --> 17:04.820
to travel.

17:04.820 --> 17:06.820
I didn't want to be there.

17:06.820 --> 17:07.820
I want to be at home.

17:07.820 --> 17:10.820
But the one pull that I was like, can we please do it?

17:10.820 --> 17:13.820
Is going to that haunted house, moat thing?

17:13.820 --> 17:15.820
Because it was an Asian Cody Banks too.

17:15.820 --> 17:16.820
Oh, what?

17:16.820 --> 17:17.820
And then I chickened out.

17:17.820 --> 17:18.820
You got scared, huh?

17:18.820 --> 17:19.820
Yeah.

17:19.820 --> 17:20.820
You got scared.

17:20.820 --> 17:22.820
What does that mean?

17:22.820 --> 17:25.820
Who are your guys' bonds of the week?

17:25.820 --> 17:28.820
I'm going to have to go with Glenn Close.

17:28.820 --> 17:29.820
I like that.

17:29.820 --> 17:30.820
Glenn Close.

17:30.820 --> 17:32.820
Tell me she couldn't nail it.

17:32.820 --> 17:35.820
I heard she does her own stunts.

17:35.820 --> 17:36.820
Yeah.

17:36.820 --> 17:37.820
I'm not surprised.

17:37.820 --> 17:38.820
Yeah.

17:38.820 --> 17:39.820
Yeah.

17:39.820 --> 17:40.820
Mine's going to be Steve O.

17:40.820 --> 17:42.820
Because he does his own stunts.

17:42.820 --> 17:44.820
I think he would be really good.

17:44.820 --> 17:46.820
You're Steve O. doing bond.

17:46.820 --> 17:48.820
So just say the name is James James Bond.

17:48.820 --> 17:49.820
Oh, God.

17:49.820 --> 17:51.820
I'm trying to remember his little hive voice.

17:51.820 --> 17:52.820
It's like, kind of.

17:52.820 --> 17:53.820
It's like smokers.

17:53.820 --> 17:54.820
It's like.

17:54.820 --> 17:55.820
It's like.

17:55.820 --> 17:56.820
It's chicken.

17:56.820 --> 17:57.820
Bond.

17:57.820 --> 17:58.820
James Bond.

17:58.820 --> 18:00.820
That's pretty good.

18:00.820 --> 18:01.820
That's awesome.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.820
I'm not going to finish my Steve O.

18:04.820 --> 18:05.820
But I'm saying.

18:05.820 --> 18:06.820
Yeah.

18:06.820 --> 18:07.820
Oh, wow.

18:07.820 --> 18:08.820
That's amazing.

18:08.820 --> 18:09.820
That's incredible.

18:09.820 --> 18:10.820
Let's see.

18:10.820 --> 18:11.820
Other guy and more.

18:11.820 --> 18:12.820
That's his name.

18:12.820 --> 18:13.820
Leo James.

18:13.820 --> 18:14.820
No.

18:14.820 --> 18:15.820
Oh, you wouldn't be bad either.

18:15.820 --> 18:16.820
Theo James would be good.

18:16.820 --> 18:17.820
No.

18:17.820 --> 18:19.820
I'm talking to the young British guy.

18:19.820 --> 18:20.820
Oh, really?

18:20.820 --> 18:21.820
Yeah.

18:21.820 --> 18:22.820
I like him.

18:22.820 --> 18:23.820
Fucking deep.

18:23.820 --> 18:24.820
Isn't deep on someone?

18:24.820 --> 18:25.820
Yeah.

18:25.820 --> 18:26.820
He's doing a good job.

18:26.820 --> 18:27.820
I really like him.

18:27.820 --> 18:28.820
I think he's great.

18:28.820 --> 18:30.820
I think everybody's doing a great job.

18:30.820 --> 18:31.820
Everybody's awesome.

18:31.820 --> 18:32.820
Everybody's awesome.

18:32.820 --> 18:33.820
Everybody's awesome.

18:33.820 --> 18:35.820
A movie or show so hard.

18:35.820 --> 18:36.820
Oh, fuck.

18:36.820 --> 18:37.820
It's like.

18:37.820 --> 18:38.820
You see.

18:38.820 --> 18:39.820
Yeah.

18:39.820 --> 18:40.820
You want to talk about it.

18:40.820 --> 18:41.820
And you said not really.

18:41.820 --> 18:42.820
Say more about that.

18:42.820 --> 18:43.820
Oh, no.

18:43.820 --> 18:44.820
I.

18:44.820 --> 18:45.820
I.

18:45.820 --> 18:46.820
I think everybody's.

18:46.820 --> 18:48.820
I think everybody's so good in the white load.

18:48.820 --> 18:49.820
Yes.

18:49.820 --> 18:50.820
Please do.

18:50.820 --> 18:51.820
He's different.

18:51.820 --> 18:52.820
But I.

18:52.820 --> 18:55.820
I also heard that Aaron Taylor's Johnson is up for.

18:55.820 --> 18:56.820
James Bond potentially.

18:56.820 --> 18:57.820
I don't know.

18:57.820 --> 18:58.820
Yeah.

18:58.820 --> 18:59.820
Aaron Taylor Johnson.

19:00.820 --> 19:01.820
That's right.

19:01.820 --> 19:02.820
That would be a good too.

19:02.820 --> 19:03.820
Yeah.

19:03.820 --> 19:04.820
I think what I heard is.

19:04.820 --> 19:05.820
On your Taylor.

19:05.820 --> 19:06.820
Yeah.

19:06.820 --> 19:07.820
I don't know.

19:07.820 --> 19:09.820
Aaron Taylor Johnson.

19:09.820 --> 19:10.820
No.

19:10.820 --> 19:11.820
He'd be great.

19:11.820 --> 19:12.820
We have to move on.

19:12.820 --> 19:13.820
Okay.

19:13.820 --> 19:14.820
Copy to.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.820
What makes spinnets.

19:16.820 --> 19:17.820
Okay.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.820
What makes spinnets.

19:19.820 --> 19:20.820
For here.

19:20.820 --> 19:22.820
Different than French toast.

19:22.820 --> 19:24.820
Ask the tasting table.

19:24.820 --> 19:27.820
It's all about the frying.

19:28.820 --> 19:30.820
They're typically frying olive oil instead of butter.

19:30.820 --> 19:31.820
I don't understand.

19:31.820 --> 19:32.820
Let's go.

19:32.820 --> 19:33.820
Hi.

19:33.820 --> 19:34.820
I'm disco.

19:34.820 --> 19:35.820
Spanish.

19:35.820 --> 19:36.820
Tortillas.

19:36.820 --> 19:37.820
Tortillas.

19:37.820 --> 19:38.820
Tortillas.

19:38.820 --> 19:39.820
Or are you trying to say tortillas?

19:39.820 --> 19:40.820
Tortillas.

19:40.820 --> 19:41.820
Tortillas with a jet.

19:41.820 --> 19:42.820
It's like a French toast.

19:42.820 --> 19:43.820
Okay.

19:43.820 --> 19:45.820
But it's more of a Spanish toast.

19:45.820 --> 19:46.820
Okay.

19:46.820 --> 19:47.820
Fried in olive oil instead of butter.

19:47.820 --> 19:48.820
Yum.

19:48.820 --> 19:50.820
And there's tons of variations on the shit.

19:50.820 --> 19:51.820
Okay.

19:51.820 --> 19:52.820
Discuss.

19:52.820 --> 19:54.820
What do you mean asks the tasting table?

19:54.820 --> 19:55.820
Yeah.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.820
Oh, it's like, you know, per the tasting table.

19:57.820 --> 19:59.820
It's like the peanut gallery.

19:59.820 --> 20:00.820
Yeah.

20:00.820 --> 20:02.820
Not what not food.

20:02.820 --> 20:04.820
Are you going home for Pittsburgh?

20:04.820 --> 20:06.820
I'm going home for Christmas to Pittsburgh.

20:06.820 --> 20:07.820
I am.

20:07.820 --> 20:08.820
Okay.

20:08.820 --> 20:09.820
You have a brother.

20:09.820 --> 20:10.820
I do.

20:10.820 --> 20:11.820
And I know.

20:11.820 --> 20:12.820
Yeah, you do.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.820
You have a bunch of time.

20:14.820 --> 20:16.820
I got you have a brother, right?

20:16.820 --> 20:17.820
Yeah.

20:17.820 --> 20:19.820
Back to the Tortilla because I'm just trying to keep us on track.

20:19.820 --> 20:20.820
You guys.

20:20.820 --> 20:21.820
Right.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.820
If I may digress for just a spell.

20:23.820 --> 20:27.820
Um, I'd love a big sis could be like the house band for the show for an episode.

20:27.820 --> 20:28.820
Don't play with me.

20:28.820 --> 20:29.820
I'm not.

20:29.820 --> 20:31.820
I'll sign a contract right now.

20:31.820 --> 20:32.820
We don't need you to do that.

20:32.820 --> 20:33.820
We just need your show.

20:33.820 --> 20:34.820
I agree to do it.

20:34.820 --> 20:35.820
I ask you to.

20:35.820 --> 20:37.820
Oh, my God.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.820
Per the Wall Street Journal.

20:39.820 --> 20:42.820
Tensions grew at Salesforce.

20:42.820 --> 20:44.820
Between cozy E.O.s.

20:44.820 --> 20:47.820
Benioff and Taylor ahead of leadership change.

20:47.820 --> 20:48.820
What do we think?

20:48.820 --> 20:49.820
Repeat that?

20:49.820 --> 20:50.820
Yeah.

20:50.820 --> 20:51.820
Tensions grew.

20:51.820 --> 20:54.820
And this is the only one I'm going to repeat.

20:54.820 --> 20:55.820
Oh, okay.

20:55.820 --> 20:57.820
Tensions grew at Salesforce.

20:57.820 --> 20:58.820
Between cozy E.O.s.

20:58.820 --> 21:00.820
Benioff and Taylor ahead of leadership change.

21:00.820 --> 21:01.820
Right.

21:01.820 --> 21:06.820
So cozy E.O. Brett Taylor announced his exit from the publicly traded software company last week.

21:06.820 --> 21:09.820
And I want to know what you guys think.

21:09.820 --> 21:11.820
Are you guys reading the trades?

21:11.820 --> 21:12.820
No.

21:14.820 --> 21:15.820
Casey.

21:18.820 --> 21:19.820
It's a tragedy.

21:19.820 --> 21:20.820
Yeah.

21:21.820 --> 21:22.820
Yeah.

21:23.820 --> 21:26.820
Benioff has a son who writes novels.

21:26.820 --> 21:27.820
Is that true?

21:27.820 --> 21:28.820
Yeah.

21:28.820 --> 21:29.820
You actually knew that?

21:29.820 --> 21:30.820
Yeah.

21:30.820 --> 21:31.820
What kind of novel?

21:31.820 --> 21:32.820
And I read one.

21:32.820 --> 21:33.820
It was good.

21:33.820 --> 21:34.820
No, I wish he wrote erotica.

21:34.820 --> 21:37.820
But I think that's all I have to say about it.

21:37.820 --> 21:38.820
You know, follow your passions.

21:38.820 --> 21:39.820
Follow your dreams.

21:39.820 --> 21:40.820
Why not?

21:40.820 --> 21:41.820
Billy?

21:41.820 --> 21:42.820
I think they could work it out.

21:42.820 --> 21:44.820
Because it's a Tensions grow.

21:44.820 --> 21:45.820
Or did it grow?

21:45.820 --> 21:46.820
Oh, oh.

21:46.820 --> 21:47.820
Oh, he didn't agree.

21:47.820 --> 21:48.820
Sorry.

21:49.820 --> 21:50.820
He's already gone.

21:50.820 --> 21:51.820
Oh.

21:51.820 --> 21:52.820
Yes.

21:52.820 --> 21:53.820
It's true.

21:53.820 --> 21:54.820
Really.

21:54.820 --> 21:55.820
What is just coming up?

21:55.820 --> 21:57.820
He's not going to be yes.

21:57.820 --> 21:59.820
This is all truly yesterday's news.

21:59.820 --> 22:01.820
And this is coming up next Friday.

22:01.820 --> 22:02.820
Okay.

22:02.820 --> 22:04.820
It's a shame.

22:04.820 --> 22:05.820
I wish.

22:05.820 --> 22:06.820
It's a real shame.

22:06.820 --> 22:07.820
It's a real shame.

22:07.820 --> 22:11.820
More grown men in positions of power could work out there.

22:11.820 --> 22:12.820
Yeah.

22:12.820 --> 22:14.820
Issues in a safe and vulnerable setting.

22:14.820 --> 22:15.820
I'm worried about them.

22:15.820 --> 22:16.820
It's really hard for them.

22:16.820 --> 22:17.820
It's hard for them.

22:17.820 --> 22:19.820
I'm worried about grown men in power as well.

22:19.820 --> 22:20.820
Yeah.

22:20.820 --> 22:21.820
Yeah.

22:21.820 --> 22:22.820
Yeah.

22:22.820 --> 22:23.820
That's awesome.

22:23.820 --> 22:24.820
Right.

22:24.820 --> 22:26.820
Oh, my God.

22:26.820 --> 22:30.820
According to people magazine Beverly D'Angelo's ex has been gladly divorced

22:30.820 --> 22:32.820
her so she could be without the China.

22:32.820 --> 22:33.820
Sorry.

22:33.820 --> 22:34.820
It's been gladly divorced her.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.820
It's gladly divorced her.

22:36.820 --> 22:37.820
It's a divorced her.

22:42.820 --> 22:43.820
Nothing but air.

22:43.820 --> 22:44.820
You.

22:44.820 --> 22:45.820
Are we supposed to say something about that?

22:45.820 --> 22:46.820
About the divorce?

22:46.820 --> 22:47.820
Yes.

22:47.820 --> 22:51.820
This is Charlize Tharen says her kids are not exactly sure what she does for a living.

22:51.820 --> 22:52.820
Wait.

22:52.820 --> 22:53.820
I didn't be able to put you down.

22:53.820 --> 22:54.820
Things funny.

22:54.820 --> 22:55.820
Yeah.

22:55.820 --> 22:58.820
What would you get gladly broken up with slash divorced in order for a year?

22:58.820 --> 22:59.820
Oh, that's really important.

22:59.820 --> 23:01.820
That's a great question.

23:01.820 --> 23:03.820
Uh, probably Nicholas Brown.

23:03.820 --> 23:04.820
Really?

23:04.820 --> 23:05.820
Yeah.

23:05.820 --> 23:08.820
Because this guy said quote, he's fantastic because he was an Italian man.

23:08.820 --> 23:12.820
I think if the person I was dating wanted to marry.

23:12.820 --> 23:13.820
It had to be.

23:13.820 --> 23:14.820
It has to be endgame though.

23:14.820 --> 23:15.820
Oh yeah.

23:15.820 --> 23:16.820
I'd be like 100%.

23:16.820 --> 23:17.820
Of course you should.

23:17.820 --> 23:18.820
Yeah.

23:18.820 --> 23:19.820
You get succession money.

23:19.820 --> 23:20.820
You get his apartment.

23:20.820 --> 23:21.820
Yeah.

23:21.820 --> 23:22.820
I think it's house.

23:22.820 --> 23:23.820
You get that sky high money.

23:23.820 --> 23:24.820
Yes.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.820
Which pays not only dividends, but also residual.

23:27.820 --> 23:28.820
Usually.

23:28.820 --> 23:31.820
Because this guy was Italian, like Al Pacino was his wife.

23:31.820 --> 23:32.820
He was the ultimate friend.

23:32.820 --> 23:34.820
But why are you a Nicholas Brown in the same category?

23:34.820 --> 23:35.820
Because I'm a white.

23:35.820 --> 23:37.820
Long list.

23:37.820 --> 23:38.820
Long list.

23:38.820 --> 23:39.820
You could have been.

23:39.820 --> 23:40.820
Nicholas Brown.

23:40.820 --> 23:44.820
You tried to combine you and Brown and thought you'd get away with it.

23:45.820 --> 23:46.820
I had to say.

23:46.820 --> 23:50.820
Julian Moore actually was one of my I was going to pitch for James Bond, but that would be

23:50.820 --> 23:53.820
someone of the person who's like, look, Julian Moore is it for me.

23:53.820 --> 23:54.820
I'd be like, well of course.

23:54.820 --> 23:55.820
Of course.

23:55.820 --> 23:57.820
Like, she's a treasure.

23:57.820 --> 23:59.820
She's one of the best actors around.

23:59.820 --> 24:00.820
And hot.

24:00.820 --> 24:01.820
Timeless.

24:01.820 --> 24:05.820
I think I would kill my partner before I let anyone else have them.

24:05.820 --> 24:06.820
Are you jealous?

24:06.820 --> 24:07.820
No.

24:07.820 --> 24:08.820
I would.

24:08.820 --> 24:10.820
No.

24:10.820 --> 24:11.820
I think I would.

24:11.820 --> 24:13.820
It would be a Glenn close once again.

24:13.820 --> 24:14.820
Glenn close always.

24:14.820 --> 24:17.820
I'm having a big Glenn close moment.

24:17.820 --> 24:23.820
I'm trying to think there's definitely somebody that I would not be mad about.

24:23.820 --> 24:27.820
Somebody likes so much, but you'll have to get back to me on that.

24:27.820 --> 24:28.820
Okay.

24:28.820 --> 24:29.820
We'll check that out.

24:29.820 --> 24:31.820
We are going to circle back because I want to know.

24:31.820 --> 24:32.820
Yeah.

24:32.820 --> 24:33.820
I got to know.

24:33.820 --> 24:34.820
I feel.

24:34.820 --> 24:37.820
I think I would be upset if they didn't have charm.

24:37.820 --> 24:38.820
You know what I mean?

24:38.820 --> 24:41.820
Like they need a personality too because otherwise I'm like.

24:41.820 --> 24:45.820
Yeah, they're like a dime, but I'm like funnier than them.

24:45.820 --> 24:48.820
So they would have to have it all.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.820
I'd much rather the other way.

24:50.820 --> 24:52.820
Just than be like a basic like not funny person.

24:52.820 --> 24:53.820
You would not be jealous.

24:53.820 --> 24:54.820
Yeah.

24:54.820 --> 24:55.820
No.

24:55.820 --> 24:56.820
No.

24:56.820 --> 24:57.820
Sorry.

24:57.820 --> 24:59.820
The exact thing that you were saying.

24:59.820 --> 25:02.820
All right.

25:02.820 --> 25:04.820
We do have to take a quick break.

25:04.820 --> 25:08.820
And we'll be right back after we think some sponsors.

25:09.820 --> 25:13.820
Simply say, your home can be secure as fuck.

25:13.820 --> 25:16.820
Thank you to Fairety for sponsoring this episode of our show.

25:16.820 --> 25:20.820
Guys, Fairety is a family brand that was founded by Alex.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.820
His wife, Carrie, and his twin brother, Mike.

25:22.820 --> 25:28.820
That channels their love of beach lifestyle into clothing for life's greatest moments.

25:28.820 --> 25:32.820
I've owned a couple of Fairety pieces of clothing.

25:32.820 --> 25:35.820
Some of them have been deeply reversible.

25:35.820 --> 25:40.820
These clothes are highly wearable, extremely versatile.

25:40.820 --> 25:42.820
And extremely high quality.

25:42.820 --> 25:45.820
One of the shirts I've had since 2017.

25:45.820 --> 25:48.820
What five years before they started advertising on the show.

25:48.820 --> 25:50.820
So I am a genuine fan of Fairety.

25:50.820 --> 25:51.820
They make great clothes.

25:51.820 --> 25:53.820
I could not recommend their brand.

25:53.820 --> 25:54.820
More.

25:54.820 --> 25:58.820
Fairety's passionate about craftsmanship, comfort, and sustainability.

They're ongoing partnership with native designers,

26:00.820 --> 26:04.820

No matter what, so these clothes are truly made for longevity.

26:15.820 --> 26:18.820
Nothing has happened to mind, but if anything ends up happening,

26:18.820 --> 26:20.820
I'm sending it to Fairety.

27:07.820 --> 27:12.820
Charlize Theron says that her kids are not exactly sure what she does for a living.

27:12.820 --> 27:16.820
I mean, she's not exactly booking.

27:16.820 --> 27:19.820
Whoa, I think she's booked in Blast.

27:19.820 --> 27:21.820
She's got Jador or whatever.

27:21.820 --> 27:22.820
That's for sure.

27:22.820 --> 27:23.820
She's got Jador.

27:23.820 --> 27:24.820
Remember that commercial?

27:24.820 --> 27:25.820
She did walking in Deo.

27:25.820 --> 27:27.820
She's like walking in gold.

27:27.820 --> 27:28.820
Done.

27:29.820 --> 27:30.820
You don't like her.

27:30.820 --> 27:31.820
You don't like her.

27:31.820 --> 27:32.820
She's cool as hell.

27:32.820 --> 27:34.820
No, I like her.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.820
One of the most successful actors on the planet.

27:36.820 --> 27:37.820
Yeah, I'm not sure.

27:37.820 --> 27:38.820
Remember her in monster?

27:38.820 --> 27:39.820
I do.

27:39.820 --> 27:41.820
It was so brave of her to gain 30 pounds for that.

27:41.820 --> 27:42.820
I know.

27:42.820 --> 27:43.820
Let's talk.

27:43.820 --> 27:45.820
I'm waiting for the second someone told me I need to do that.

27:45.820 --> 27:49.820
The rapper DJ Coward was bold over her.

27:49.820 --> 27:50.820
It's good.

27:50.820 --> 27:51.820
Toilet bold over her.

27:51.820 --> 27:53.820
The birthday gift, Drake Senate.

27:53.820 --> 27:55.820
Drake, thank you for this gift.

27:55.820 --> 27:57.820
This is the most amazing toilet bowl I've seen in my life.

27:58.820 --> 27:59.820
Oh, my God.

27:59.820 --> 28:00.820
The match will wait.

28:00.820 --> 28:02.820
He can't stop playing with the lead.

28:02.820 --> 28:04.820
Raving about the future with the land.

28:04.820 --> 28:05.820
Melissa.

28:05.820 --> 28:06.820
With some of the features.

28:06.820 --> 28:09.820
There's a UV-like clean system.

28:09.820 --> 28:11.820
It got a UV-like cleaning system.

28:11.820 --> 28:12.820
It's remote control operated.

28:12.820 --> 28:14.820
This top of the line.

28:14.820 --> 28:18.820
The total toilet retails for just over 20 pounds.

28:18.820 --> 28:19.820
Oh.

28:19.820 --> 28:20.820
Oh.

28:20.820 --> 28:21.820
Each.

28:21.820 --> 28:23.820
It's called the Neo-Rest NX2.

28:23.820 --> 28:26.820
That's like an empty horse called you.

28:26.820 --> 28:27.820
You don't have a bag.

28:27.820 --> 28:28.820
Actually, you don't have a bag.

28:28.820 --> 28:29.820
You're sitting on it.

28:29.820 --> 28:32.820
Apparently Drake is a toilet connoisseur.

28:32.820 --> 28:33.820
Oh.

28:33.820 --> 28:34.820
Everybody drinks out.

28:34.820 --> 28:36.820
These toilet bowls are incredible.

28:36.820 --> 28:38.820
Another rapper recorded this one.

28:38.820 --> 28:41.820
It Drake's operated by a touch pad.

28:41.820 --> 28:42.820
Huh?

28:42.820 --> 28:43.820
And Drake himself wants to say that.

28:43.820 --> 28:48.820
I don't know if you guys went to the toilet.

28:48.820 --> 28:50.820
Yeah, but you know, the toilet plays park.

28:50.820 --> 28:51.820
Toilet.

28:51.820 --> 28:52.820
They look dry.

28:52.820 --> 28:55.820
So they even have a toilet called the Drake.

28:56.820 --> 28:58.820
This feels like a rust 600 box.

28:58.820 --> 28:59.820
Yeah.

28:59.820 --> 29:00.820
This is a rust.

29:00.820 --> 29:01.820
I can keep for you guys.

29:01.820 --> 29:02.820
Yes.

29:02.820 --> 29:03.820
Yes.

29:03.820 --> 29:04.820
It is our work horse.

29:04.820 --> 29:06.820
And this Drake.

29:06.820 --> 29:07.820
This Drake.

29:07.820 --> 29:10.820
Next time Drake comes to visit DJ Coward.

29:10.820 --> 29:13.820
At least he'll have a nice place to sit.

29:13.820 --> 29:14.820
Oh, nice place to sit.

29:14.820 --> 29:15.820
Nice place to sit.

29:15.820 --> 29:16.820
Yeah.

29:16.820 --> 29:17.820
Ginny moats.

29:17.820 --> 29:18.820
See you next.

29:18.820 --> 29:19.820
See you next.

29:19.820 --> 29:20.820
Two.

29:23.820 --> 29:24.820
Oh my god.

29:24.820 --> 29:28.820
I think it's so sick that he won't go down on a woman, but he'll touch a toilet for

29:28.820 --> 29:29.820
fucking ever.

29:29.820 --> 29:30.820
Yeah.

29:30.820 --> 29:31.820
That's sick.

29:31.820 --> 29:32.820
That's.

29:32.820 --> 29:33.820
It's the enthusiasm for me.

29:33.820 --> 29:34.820
Yeah.

29:34.820 --> 29:38.820
DJ Coward is always so enthusiastic about everything he's doing.

29:38.820 --> 29:39.820
Yeah.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.820
And he knows that we the best music.

29:41.820 --> 29:42.820
We have the sick.

29:42.820 --> 29:43.820
Oh, shit.

29:43.820 --> 29:44.820
Oh, shit.

29:44.820 --> 29:45.820
Um.

29:45.820 --> 29:47.820
Well, I guess, yeah, we have to move on anyways.

29:47.820 --> 29:48.820
Um.

29:48.820 --> 29:49.820
We already played that game.

29:51.820 --> 29:53.820
Welcome to.

29:54.820 --> 29:56.820
Too many squats to handle.

29:56.820 --> 29:57.820
Oh.

29:57.820 --> 30:00.820
So the name of the game is too many squats to handle.

30:00.820 --> 30:04.820
It's vaguely based off the Netflix show that shares the title.

30:04.820 --> 30:05.820
Um.

30:05.820 --> 30:06.820
And.

30:06.820 --> 30:07.820
Uh.

30:07.820 --> 30:11.820
But instead of like a bunch of hotties being shoved onto a beach and not

30:11.820 --> 30:15.820
being able to hook up, it's going to be us having a squat contest.

30:15.820 --> 30:20.820
Because I feel like three out of four of us have some of the greatest ass in the game.

30:20.820 --> 30:21.820
Absolutely.

30:22.820 --> 30:23.820
We know.

30:23.820 --> 30:24.820
Yeah.

30:24.820 --> 30:25.820
This is a video part.

30:25.820 --> 30:27.820
I want to say medium.

30:27.820 --> 30:31.820
And so I thought that to be fun if we are basically.

30:31.820 --> 30:32.820
Um.

30:32.820 --> 30:34.820
One by one in the hot seat.

30:34.820 --> 30:35.820
Uh, sorry.

30:35.820 --> 30:37.820
Let me see what I wrote for this.

30:37.820 --> 30:40.820
Oh, I said, this one's a real stretch.

30:40.820 --> 30:41.820
Okay.

30:41.820 --> 30:44.820
Uh, one by one, each of us is going to be in the hot seat as we try to do as many

30:44.820 --> 30:46.820
squats as we possibly can.

30:46.820 --> 30:50.820
As you're squatting, you're going to be bombarded by as many deeply personal questions as

30:50.820 --> 30:52.820
the others can muster for you.

30:52.820 --> 30:53.820
Okay.

30:53.820 --> 30:54.820
Okay.

30:54.820 --> 30:59.820
Person with the most squats and the most questions answered wins either $100

30:59.820 --> 31:02.820
cash or a dinner date with me.

31:02.820 --> 31:04.820
$100 cash.

31:04.820 --> 31:08.820
Well, if you make one or the other, you get to pick one of the other.

31:08.820 --> 31:09.820
Oh, cash.

31:09.820 --> 31:10.820
No.

31:10.820 --> 31:11.820
Dinner sounds great.

31:11.820 --> 31:12.820
Are you paying for dinner?

31:12.820 --> 31:13.820
Yeah.

31:13.820 --> 31:14.820
Yeah.

31:14.820 --> 31:15.820
Yeah.

31:15.820 --> 31:16.820
Yeah.

31:16.820 --> 31:17.820
Yeah.

31:17.820 --> 31:18.820
Yeah.

31:18.820 --> 31:19.820
Yeah.

31:19.820 --> 31:20.820
Yeah.

31:20.820 --> 31:21.820
Sure.

31:21.820 --> 31:22.820
Yeah.

31:22.820 --> 31:24.820
Okay.

31:24.820 --> 31:27.820
So is this the concept of the show or is this what you're trying to, how

31:27.820 --> 31:28.820
us do?

31:28.820 --> 31:29.820
This is what we're about to do.

31:29.820 --> 31:30.820
Okay.

31:30.820 --> 31:33.820
I'm going to go last because there's no way this last more than two people.

31:33.820 --> 31:42.820
You think it's going to fall off the rails become really, no, I think it'll be good.

31:42.820 --> 31:44.820
Serving real Scorpio energy today.

31:44.820 --> 31:45.820
I really love it.

31:45.820 --> 31:46.820
You're fucking asshole.

31:47.820 --> 31:48.820
Okay.

31:48.820 --> 31:49.820
Anybody want to go first?

31:49.820 --> 31:50.820
I can start us off.

31:50.820 --> 31:51.820
I can go first.

31:51.820 --> 31:52.820
Yeah.

31:52.820 --> 31:53.820
Yeah.

31:53.820 --> 31:58.820
The rules are you have to go for as many squads as you can handle.

31:58.820 --> 32:02.820
And then everyone else will sort of ask deeply personal questions.

32:02.820 --> 32:04.820
And for every squad is worth one point.

32:04.820 --> 32:06.820
Every personal questions were two points.

32:06.820 --> 32:07.820
Is there a time limit?

32:07.820 --> 32:08.820
No.

32:08.820 --> 32:11.820
It's for how long it's really squatting to drop.

32:11.820 --> 32:12.820
Okay.

32:12.820 --> 32:13.820
And I ask a question.

32:13.820 --> 32:17.820
How much would I derail things if I said I have to be really bad?

32:17.820 --> 32:18.820
Oh.

32:18.820 --> 32:21.820
Lucy, we took a break.

32:21.820 --> 32:23.820
We took a commercial break.

32:23.820 --> 32:24.820
Okay.

32:24.820 --> 32:27.820
Let's do the squats.

32:27.820 --> 32:30.820
I just want like, yeah.

32:30.820 --> 32:33.820
Because it's like, it's only 45 minutes.

32:33.820 --> 32:34.820
I understand.

32:34.820 --> 32:35.820
I'm sorry.

32:35.820 --> 32:36.820
I'm sorry.

32:36.820 --> 32:37.820
No.

32:37.820 --> 32:39.820
It's like, you know what I'm sorry.

32:39.820 --> 32:40.820
You know what I mean?

32:40.820 --> 32:41.820
That's fair.

32:41.820 --> 32:42.820
Let's do the squats.

32:42.820 --> 32:44.820
You're going to give her a UCI.

32:44.820 --> 32:45.820
I don't get you.

32:45.820 --> 32:47.820
I'm cranberry juice from the fruit.

32:47.820 --> 32:49.820
Yeah, there's a reason why we got it.

32:49.820 --> 32:50.820
This is happened before.

32:50.820 --> 32:52.820
I'm going to go to you.

32:52.820 --> 32:53.820
Okay.

32:53.820 --> 32:54.820
Oh.

32:54.820 --> 32:55.820
Whatever.

32:55.820 --> 32:56.820
See you.

32:56.820 --> 32:57.820
Well, I was going to cut this out.

32:57.820 --> 32:58.820
But now that it's just the board.

32:58.820 --> 32:59.820
Yeah.

32:59.820 --> 33:00.820
Kind of a, yeah.

33:00.820 --> 33:01.820
Cool.

33:01.820 --> 33:02.820
Side.

33:02.820 --> 33:03.820
Oh my god.

33:03.820 --> 33:04.820
All right.

33:04.820 --> 33:05.820
I'm going to start.

33:05.820 --> 33:06.820
Okay.

33:06.820 --> 33:07.820
Very good.

33:07.820 --> 33:08.820
All right.

33:08.820 --> 33:09.820
I'm going to start.

33:10.820 --> 33:11.820
Okay.

33:11.820 --> 33:12.820
Oh my god.

33:12.820 --> 33:13.820
Like do the squats.

33:13.820 --> 33:14.820
All right.

33:14.820 --> 33:15.820
All right.

33:15.820 --> 33:17.820
Do you guys have personal questions lined up?

33:17.820 --> 33:18.820
No.

33:18.820 --> 33:19.820
Actually.

33:19.820 --> 33:20.820
You're not.

33:20.820 --> 33:21.820
You didn't prepare.

33:21.820 --> 33:23.820
I do think that we should actually keep it to a time limit.

33:23.820 --> 33:24.820
Because.

33:24.820 --> 33:25.820
Well, you said.

33:25.820 --> 33:27.820
I mean, it changed the rules now.

33:27.820 --> 33:28.820
Because I think a lot.

33:28.820 --> 33:29.820
I think I could go all day.

33:29.820 --> 33:30.820
I do.

33:30.820 --> 33:31.820
Me too.

33:31.820 --> 33:32.820
I know.

33:32.820 --> 33:33.820
And we only have like 18 more minutes.

33:33.820 --> 33:34.820
Okay.

33:34.820 --> 33:35.820
So.

33:35.820 --> 33:36.820
Okay.

33:36.820 --> 33:37.820
So we'll just.

33:37.820 --> 33:38.820
Six minutes.

33:39.820 --> 33:40.820
Okay.

33:40.820 --> 33:43.820
I will also say that I texted each of you guys individually last night being like do like egg nog.

33:43.820 --> 33:44.820
I did.

33:44.820 --> 33:46.820
And this is the healthy segment that I can't but instead.

33:46.820 --> 33:47.820
All right.

33:47.820 --> 33:48.820
This was the.

33:48.820 --> 33:49.820
Oh, this was the.

33:49.820 --> 33:50.820
Oh, this was the.

33:50.820 --> 33:51.820
What was the egg nog segment.

33:51.820 --> 33:52.820
The egg nog segment.

33:52.820 --> 33:55.820
I don't want to say because it's going to be on next week's episode.

33:55.820 --> 33:56.820
Okay.

33:56.820 --> 33:57.820
All right.

33:57.820 --> 33:58.820
All right.

33:58.820 --> 34:00.820
So should we just round robin the personal questions.

34:00.820 --> 34:01.820
So we can keep it.

34:01.820 --> 34:02.820
Yeah.

34:02.820 --> 34:03.820
I think let's just.

34:03.820 --> 34:04.820
Yeah.

34:04.820 --> 34:05.820
Don't.

34:05.820 --> 34:07.820
Let's not.

34:07.820 --> 34:10.820
Let's go for it.

34:10.820 --> 34:11.820
Okay.

34:11.820 --> 34:12.820
All right.

34:12.820 --> 34:13.820
All right.

34:13.820 --> 34:14.820
Um.

34:14.820 --> 34:15.820
What is your deepest fear?

34:15.820 --> 34:17.820
I do this fear is.

34:17.820 --> 34:18.820
Uh.

34:18.820 --> 34:21.820
Like not accomplishing the things that I want to accomplish.

34:21.820 --> 34:23.820
Or I get to start a timer.

34:23.820 --> 34:26.820
And are we supposed to be counting on my phone?

34:26.820 --> 34:29.820
Casey, are you keeping up with the points?

34:29.820 --> 34:32.820
Because I certainly am not with how many squads are being done.

34:32.820 --> 34:33.820
Sure.

34:33.820 --> 34:34.820
Yeah.

34:34.820 --> 34:35.820
Okay.

34:36.820 --> 34:37.820
No question.

34:37.820 --> 34:41.820
My deepest fear is like dying having not accomplished the things that I want to know.

34:41.820 --> 34:42.820
Um.

34:42.820 --> 34:44.820
Who broke your heart the most in your life?

34:44.820 --> 34:45.820
Oh, that's a really good question.

34:45.820 --> 34:47.820
Um, I've never been broken up with.

34:47.820 --> 34:48.820
But um.

34:48.820 --> 34:49.820
Oh, my God.

34:49.820 --> 34:51.820
I will say that my life is the rod's been breaking up with my eyes.

34:51.820 --> 34:52.820
Never been hard.

34:52.820 --> 34:54.820
It was pretty painful because it was the first time I was that set.

34:54.820 --> 34:55.820
Hmm.

34:55.820 --> 34:56.820
What's your worst childhood memory?

34:56.820 --> 34:57.820
My.

34:57.820 --> 34:58.820
I'm not going to say that.

34:58.820 --> 35:00.820
But yeah.

35:00.820 --> 35:02.820
My parents are really bad.

35:03.820 --> 35:04.820
Okay.

35:04.820 --> 35:09.820
How do you feel about the fact that your worst fear is likely to come true?

35:09.820 --> 35:12.820
I guess bad.

35:12.820 --> 35:14.820
Worst date you've ever been on.

35:14.820 --> 35:15.820
Uh.

35:15.820 --> 35:16.820
Oh, my God.

35:16.820 --> 35:18.820
I haven't answered for this.

35:18.820 --> 35:19.820
Um.

35:19.820 --> 35:20.820
I.

35:20.820 --> 35:21.820
Well, it wasn't a date.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.820
I just one time I made out with somebody in college.

35:24.820 --> 35:25.820
And it was.

35:25.820 --> 35:26.820
We were about to have sex.

35:26.820 --> 35:29.820
And then it was so bad that I actually walked her home.

35:29.820 --> 35:30.820
I think that was so bad.

35:30.820 --> 35:31.820
Okay.

35:31.820 --> 35:32.820
Good to know.

35:32.820 --> 35:33.820
Yeah.

35:33.820 --> 35:34.820
Do you think you're a good lover?

35:34.820 --> 35:35.820
Yes.

35:35.820 --> 35:37.820
Oh, my God.

35:37.820 --> 35:39.820
Okay.

35:39.820 --> 35:40.820
God.

35:40.820 --> 35:41.820
We've keep it rolling.

35:41.820 --> 35:42.820
Yeah.

35:42.820 --> 35:43.820
Oh, you're lying.

35:43.820 --> 35:44.820
This is so much.

35:44.820 --> 35:45.820
What do we act?

35:45.820 --> 35:47.820
Which family member do you dislike the most?

35:47.820 --> 35:48.820
Which.

35:48.820 --> 35:50.820
Which family member do you dislike the most?

35:50.820 --> 35:52.820
Oh, my God.

35:52.820 --> 35:53.820
Um.

35:53.820 --> 35:55.820
I guess my.

35:56.820 --> 35:57.820
Grandmother.

35:57.820 --> 35:58.820
Tame.

35:58.820 --> 35:59.820
It's thinking.

35:59.820 --> 36:00.820
It's thinking.

36:00.820 --> 36:02.820
She's really judgmental.

36:02.820 --> 36:05.820
What's the last time you felt truly insecure?

36:05.820 --> 36:07.820
That's an amazing question.

36:07.820 --> 36:09.820
Um.

36:09.820 --> 36:11.820
Huh.

36:11.820 --> 36:13.820
Jesus.

36:13.820 --> 36:14.820
To the lot.

36:14.820 --> 36:16.820
Why did I do this?

36:16.820 --> 36:18.820
I think you can't wait.

36:18.820 --> 36:19.820
I can't wait.

36:19.820 --> 36:20.820
Oh.

36:20.820 --> 36:22.820
I just shot a, well, I don't want to talk about it.

36:22.820 --> 36:24.820
There was a time recently where I was like, oh,

36:24.820 --> 36:30.100
recently where I was like oh I'm the least funny person in this room. How does it feel for that to still be true?

36:32.500 --> 36:44.180
This isn't a roast. What was your childhood fear? I'm gonna just get back to the child's house. It's not like

36:44.180 --> 36:57.460
it's just a lot. It's not like PC to say. Oh my god. Why didn't you stop? Why didn't you stop yelling?

37:00.500 --> 37:07.460
Because I kept coming in like second to last play. Nothing worse. Were you into magic as a kid?

37:08.180 --> 37:13.380
Yes. The gathering are like tricks. Tricks like tricks. Oh yeah. Yeah, that's much more time

37:13.380 --> 37:20.660
to see how. There's 18. Okay, scared for you. Okay, um what do you think is your worst quality?

37:23.700 --> 37:34.580
I think that I am a bad. I'm not the most loyal friend. Wow. Wow.

37:35.380 --> 37:40.100
Because you're just you're done. Yeah. You got nothing but the truth left.

37:40.100 --> 37:43.860
Oh, we're doing this because there's a we could all just one not do this and then you have to

37:43.860 --> 37:51.380
put that all in his own. Which I'm game for you. Sam 108. Say it again. That was a lot. All right,

37:51.380 --> 37:59.140
loose. All right, all right, here we go, timer. There we go. Go. Who would you seek revenge on?

37:59.700 --> 38:05.380
Oh, I'll believe out their name, but first of all. My eighth grade math teacher is yes. How many people have

38:05.380 --> 38:12.420
you had sex with in your life? Probably about. That's awesome. Have you been to a sex party?

38:12.420 --> 38:19.780
No. You want to go to a sex party? Yeah. Okay. That's what regretfully means, Jeff.

38:20.740 --> 38:27.060
Do more most left of center, King. Oh, what do you mean by left of center? Crazy.

38:30.020 --> 38:38.740
Oh, I think like a bunch of dudes. Yeah. Yeah, like I'm scared of it, but I also am like,

38:39.300 --> 38:43.380
what would that be like? Hmm. Was your closest friend that you want to fuck? First of

38:43.380 --> 38:51.780
my last name. Oh, shit. Oh. Yes. Yes. Where's the wildest place you've hooked up?

38:52.980 --> 38:59.940
In the NYU Law School courtyard. Oh, my God. Oh, yeah. What is your biggest insecurity?

39:02.980 --> 39:08.180
That everyone thinks I'm, I'm really scared of everyone thinks I'm really fucking annoying.

39:08.500 --> 39:15.780
Oh, I'm never sorry. Is it colored? No. Yeah, at least favorite body part.

39:15.780 --> 39:20.580
The left side of my face. It's beautiful. Okay. This is not good for me.

39:20.580 --> 39:24.180
I just have a best friend on that. Really cool. Yeah. You're so comfortable.

39:24.180 --> 39:28.180
No, I'm not. Yeah. No, left side of it. What is it? You're just met? Yeah.

39:30.180 --> 39:34.820
Would you ever straighten your hair? Oh. Yeah. Who is someone you would tell off right now?

39:34.900 --> 39:41.380
Oh, you're an expert. I really thought she was going to say me because this is about when my

39:41.380 --> 39:46.420
knees started to shake. God, there's a minute left. What's up? Yeah. You have a minute 10 seconds left.

39:47.220 --> 39:52.820
What's something you wish you could change about yourself, but you know you will never will. Whoa. Wow.

39:52.900 --> 40:05.860
Uh, uh, I wish I was more outspoken about my knees. Wow. That's, you can, you know.

40:10.020 --> 40:16.740
Fucking, uh, what's uh, guys? What's your biggest dream that you'd like to have come true?

40:16.740 --> 40:22.420
Yeah. Wait, Lotus Season 3. Nice. What's your intention for 2023?

40:23.140 --> 40:27.220
Be more luxurious. Whoa. What would you hook up with on my Lotus?

40:27.220 --> 40:33.700
Lucia, duh. Oh. And the dad. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Chris Persever. Yeah. Chris Persever. All right.

40:33.700 --> 40:39.460
20s, three seconds left. Um, what? If you could live anywhere except for LA, where'd you live?

40:39.460 --> 40:46.900
Fucking, like, oh, oh. Of course. First and last name of the best lover you've ever had.

40:47.460 --> 40:49.460
Ooh.

40:51.460 --> 40:56.660
Oh, I don't want to say no. Uh. Oh, I know who it is. No, you don't.

40:57.940 --> 40:59.940
All right. You're got, you're done. You're done. You're done. How many was that?

40:59.940 --> 41:05.140
I can see. That was 92 squats. Yeah. But how many personal questions? Yeah.

41:05.140 --> 41:10.260
I'm like, Chris. Oh, so they get it. So we got to, we got to start again. I think we got to do it.

41:10.260 --> 41:14.260
We got to do another round. There's no way. No, you didn't count the personal questions.

41:14.260 --> 41:18.500
I can do it in post. The squats and the point. Yeah.

41:18.500 --> 41:22.500
You can't. Yeah. Let me know who won in post. I don't know where I'm going to do my squats.

41:22.500 --> 41:27.460
You have to do ask camera. Coach, you're doing it. Or if you want to do it off camera,

41:27.460 --> 41:32.180
you're on my access so that you're about chasing me. Okay. What's word? Okay.

41:32.180 --> 41:36.820
Yep. No one look. I also grow all of these. I'm going to use the camera angles that don't show

41:36.820 --> 41:44.180
offer as sorry audience. All right. Three, two, one go. Who is too hot to handle amongst your

41:44.180 --> 41:50.340
friend group? Fuck. Oh, so don't fuck this. No. Too hot to handle a

41:50.580 --> 42:03.620
friend group. Oh, no. Um, who did you ever want to fuck any of your ex's close friends? Yes. Who?

42:05.620 --> 42:17.540
No, who not handle this? I want it to fuck. Oh, God. Oh, this is hard. I want it to fuck.

42:18.100 --> 42:24.660
Friend. Which makes no sense whatsoever. Not what I said. Uh, what? Who most famous person you've

42:24.660 --> 42:30.420
ever kissed? Oh, God. Um, I don't know if I've kissed anyone famous. I'm the famous one.

42:32.020 --> 42:41.300
What is your? What is your biggest insecurity? Um, that I don't go for what I want.

42:41.620 --> 42:46.820
And I hold myself back. I think you do go for what you want. Okay, thanks girl. Thanks girl.

42:46.820 --> 42:50.580
I want to be known that Billy didn't ask you any questions and he has yet to ask us like,

42:50.580 --> 42:54.260
I don't think I'm going to fall just a bit in this game. Uh,

42:54.260 --> 43:01.940
cessly, would you ever go brunette? Uh, yeah. I went. When? Uh, for a fucking role that I get an

43:01.940 --> 43:07.060
Oscar for. And then I don't know before the role went before when before the role went. Before the role

43:07.860 --> 43:13.300
went like like what like you're going brunette. I mean, we've decided it. When? Today.

43:13.300 --> 43:18.340
Got it. Where do you think you rank in the hotness of all your closest friends? That's a

43:18.340 --> 43:24.580
really good. Me. Uh, and then you have to list two your closest friends over before you do this.

43:25.460 --> 43:32.100
Oh, because it's gonna get our intimate. Um, uh, minute 10 left. Third.

43:32.500 --> 43:41.140
Behind you, behind you. Lucy. Um, no. If you, if you won the lottery, who's someone close to you

43:41.140 --> 43:45.380
that you wouldn't tell because you don't trust them. Oh, sorry. Yeah. What?

43:47.380 --> 43:54.900
Oh, have you ever had a sex room about Jeff? Yes. Sorry. It's all right. I have.

43:54.980 --> 44:02.660
We can be honest here. Uh, I deal haircut for your husband.

44:02.660 --> 44:06.980
Uh, that's not a hard day. Oh, you care about his hair. I'm just trying to do it. Oh, you

44:06.980 --> 44:12.420
guys aren't saying anything. Okay. You have a bun. Okay. You're rushing about here. What would

44:12.420 --> 44:19.140
you like to die from? Oh, um, it's a really good question. Having so much sex. Would you ever, um,

44:19.780 --> 44:28.500
if you, uh, you gave up on acting. What would you do? Die. Okay. Good. Um, and then we have one more one.

44:28.500 --> 44:33.940
One more one. Flash. Uh, if I had to. Yeah. Just right. Oh, just right. How many was that? Okay. See.

44:35.780 --> 44:42.500
98. What? Come on, man. I was going. Yeah. I'm going to have to. You guys are going to have to

44:42.500 --> 44:49.220
each pay me 33. Right. So I was hoping you'd get two more to break a hundred. Yeah. See,

44:49.220 --> 44:55.300
this is lying to me. And you're fucking lying, Casey. I know. Okay. You guys were doing full

44:55.300 --> 44:59.060
squash. Jeff was kind of doing half squash. Jeff was doing half squash. What was that? That's,

44:59.060 --> 45:04.740
that's, that's what you really score in half. In half. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I all allow it. That's hard. Yeah.

45:04.740 --> 45:10.580
Jeff. You too. And then, is it, is that tie? You tie? No, it's absolutely be me. Oh. I thought you had

45:10.660 --> 45:16.820
98, too. I think I had 92. 92. Oh, because I'm not. You just flat out. I don't know. Yeah. I don't know.

45:16.820 --> 45:24.100
It feels like, I don't know. It feels like I don't. I don't want to play this game. And I, I agree

45:24.100 --> 45:29.700
with you. It's not fun to do. But this is all going on the internet. And then if you don't do it,

45:29.700 --> 45:33.380
people are going to think you're born. I understand that it's like when Shaq did hot ones and everyone's

45:33.380 --> 45:37.780
like, oh, you, like, I'm going to do that. The thing is, like, he knew what the show was before he

45:37.780 --> 45:42.340
he signed up for. And you didn't. I did it. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well,

45:42.340 --> 45:49.300
Scorpio, very slippery to feel. To not want to share. I don't want to do either part of it.

45:49.300 --> 45:51.700
I don't want to do squats. And I don't want to answer for such a question.

45:52.900 --> 46:00.420
Did you design this game specifically for? The boy said no. Yeah. I had to outline two full episodes

46:00.420 --> 46:04.340
last night. So I was just like, yeah, we'll do that. Yeah. No, it's good. It's great. I came out with the

46:04.340 --> 46:09.140
title before people. Too many squats. I think that's a sick party game actually. I would

46:09.140 --> 46:13.060
get that. I would play that again right now. Me too. That was good. That was good. That was a great

46:13.060 --> 46:18.020
party game. Yeah. Yeah. People can make fun of me on the internet. I don't care. Wouldn't be the first time

46:19.220 --> 46:25.940
that was too many squats to handle. It's weird that I won. That doesn't really feel like

46:26.980 --> 46:33.540
fair. You were doing half squats. I have to check the video because it did not feel like that.

46:33.620 --> 46:38.500
You weren't giving. I was going to call your ankles, which is poor for him. Which is poor for him.

46:38.900 --> 46:44.900
So your form is bad. Our form good. Your ankles were bad too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The ankle to

46:44.900 --> 46:52.180
blonstone ratio. Oh my gosh, because we're like Nike with blonstone. Oh,

46:52.180 --> 46:59.620
see, he goes crazy. Oh my god. Then I got, then sesame you win. Oh, say. I'm not a

46:59.940 --> 47:03.700
good Jeff. I really needed to plug in here. Because we know you don't want to go on a date with that.

47:06.020 --> 47:10.500
I'm really strapped for cash right. It feels a Christmas shopping. And be sure. So you're already

47:10.500 --> 47:17.060
saying no to the dinner. It's like no. I can't. No, it will talk. Okay. I love how Jeff won and we're all just like

47:17.060 --> 47:23.940
no, he didn't. No, he didn't. I won. I truly currently don't have a hundred dollars in my bank account.

47:23.940 --> 47:29.300
That will venue you in the next couple of days and then I will put that Venmo transfer

47:30.340 --> 47:34.980
on the video. Yeah. Tell me more facts about it. Tell me the logistics more.

47:36.980 --> 47:42.020
Again, you design these games. You have full control over the entire show. If you didn't have

47:42.020 --> 47:45.300
a hundred dollars, you should have just made the prize less. Well, I thought I was going to win.

47:46.020 --> 47:54.500
Oh my god. You need a money. Yeah. I did it. Yeah. He was dead if you had to get you. I would just like,

47:54.500 --> 48:00.180
you know, put it on my tight. Put it on my time card and call it hosting the head

48:00.180 --> 48:05.620
gun body. You have a green phone. It's that. You have a green phone. Yeah. Can I see it?

48:06.740 --> 48:12.420
Oh, sorry. You cracked the screen on purpose. In his bare hands. Can I move this table back?

48:12.420 --> 48:17.540
Yeah. So I can put my drink down. We're about to wrap up, but yeah. Yeah. Go ahead, Billy.

48:19.380 --> 48:21.540
This can be a nightmare to edit because of all the shit.

48:24.500 --> 48:31.860
Oh, I definitely smell. Well, we did all just do a hundred squats.

48:33.860 --> 48:38.580
Guys, we've made it through another episode of the head gun podcast. Thank you so much for coming

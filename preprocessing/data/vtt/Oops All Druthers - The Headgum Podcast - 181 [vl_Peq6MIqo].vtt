00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head gum original.

00:02.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
You have to make sure that it brings to the end.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
Of course.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
I'm not going to do it.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
That's not a fun dog.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Monday, that Monday feeling.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Right?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Lots of business being handled.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
We're coming off hot off the presses of the pit wall.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Yes.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Well, I wasn't on.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
It's what might have been the show all.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
No, it was the pit wall because Ali was the guest.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Ali seems like a better host to the show than me.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
I should be the rotating occasional.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Well, don't be so quick to say.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
You're all ready.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
The rotating occasional.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
You've never not been that.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Of course.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Why do I get lambasted every time I miss every two episodes?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
You're my son, right?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
I want to make sure.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I think you're recording.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Are you sure?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Yes.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I adjusted the set up.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
All right.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
The only thing that I changed was that I'm.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
I am the captain now.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Right?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
But like the zoom is recording.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Not not.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
The zoom is recording.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
The microphone.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
The zoom of microphones is recording.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Y'all.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Okay.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Audition sessions.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Good to go on title session 14.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
The control panel is recording.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Yeah.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
And I'm sure the video files are going to be labeled for the pit wall also.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
That is true.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
That is true.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
We'll just need that.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
I had started my recording on my end.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Well, we got the backup.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
We've got the backup from the zoom.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Right?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
We're already 34 minutes late.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
I don't like that I can't see you, Jeff.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
I don't like that.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
I can't see Marieka either.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
You can.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Marieka.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
It's kind of interesting.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
If you press your button for your camera.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
She'll see you.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
If I press my button for my camera.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Yeah.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
He was doing that.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Okay.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
A second ago.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Was I?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Did you not do that on purpose?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
No, because I'm not in the zoom.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I'm not in the zoom because I walked into the pit wall.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
What's that?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
You are.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Is she seeing the live at it?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Yes.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Oh.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
That's kind of cool.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
But you can't see.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
So if you press your button for your camera.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
She'll see you.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Only when you want her to see you.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
What?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
What's with the energy shift?

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
It was the same fucking episode.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
The same setup as everything is the pit wall.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
All these pissed.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
No.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I'm not mad at you.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Everything's okay.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Four years of therapy.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
It's so cold.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
It's with one con.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
One con swoop.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
More technology back here than ever before.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Let me open up photo booth on here.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Well, actually, I'm not sure if I should.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
But I'm going to open photo booth so I can show everybody in like a...

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Yeah, now that's not going to work.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
I wanted to show everybody how many screens are here, right?

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Uh-huh.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
And so I guess I'll just take a iPhone video and I'll plop it in.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
Well, you can grab the GoPro and kind of wave it around at everything back there.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
I don't think it creates the real fish bowl effect.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Sure.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
So here's the real setup, right?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
So we have...

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
This is the control board for the video, right?

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
This is the zoom, which has to be on and recording in the audition session.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
So it's a backup, right?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Yeah.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Then we have my outline right here.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
And then we have my sound board connected to the thing that's on the zoom that is connected to

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Marika on that screen.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
So that they can see her.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
I mean, there has to be a better way than this.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
What do you say to you is all that?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
What do I...

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
I'm not the engineer?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
You are.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Right now.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Well, right now.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah, I'm at the engineer of the studio.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
You know, like you wouldn't bring me in.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
You'd bring me in as a session recorder, uh, recorded at, you know, Abbey Road.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
You wouldn't bring me in to redesign Abbey Road.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
I'm flattered that you are comparing our studio setup to Abbey Road.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Marty asked me three years ago.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
What should the studio look like?

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
That might not just make it look like Abbey Road.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
That's a story.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
And that's why the walls are white.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
That's why the panels are beige.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
And that's why there's like a red rug underneath.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
But we got that with a gift card.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
The rug was bought with a gift card.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Marika, don't just go, um, like say some shit.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Add to the fucking cultural conversation therein.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I can't really.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Ultimately.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Oh, it's such.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I was on the phone.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
This is.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
This is awful already.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
I was on the phone with my sister right before I walked in.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
She said, uh, she knew I was about to go into a record.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Because I was like, that's why I was signing off.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
And she's like, oh, is it going to be good?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
And I was like, I don't know.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
And she's like, are you nervous?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
And I'm like, I'm not, I'm not nervous.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Yeah.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
But it's not always up to me.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
It's what I told her.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Right?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
It's up to the energy that mostly marika brings.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Right.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Yeah.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Yeah.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I don't think it helps when you point it out.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
You know what I mean?

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
Like often times you, you're like, you do a little mimic of my voice.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
And like, the monotone.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
And then you're like, are you seeing the shit?

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
To who's whoever's in the room?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I don't know.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
I don't like, doesn't really, like, it kind of prolongs the moment.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
You know what I mean?

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
I got to prolongs the moment.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Are you guys kidding me?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
No, I agree. I agree.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Um, oh, this is cool.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
The Quentin time tour.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
What artist is that?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Oh, it's Zach Ryan.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
What are you looking at?

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I have an ad.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Um, what was I about to just say?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Oh, we've been banking episodes, right?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Because every year,

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
it's kind of a mad dash in December to try and like have all of us be able to take time off.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
That's happening a lot around here.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Everybody doing that?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
A lot of, a lot of banking happening around here.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
I don't know.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I think it abuses certain joy, Halley.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Sure.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Charge joy.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Charge joy.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yeah.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Um, but that being the case, these episodes are not weak to weak.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
They're back to back some days.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Yeah.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
And so, like, last week, I did an episode.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I forget who exactly was on, but a mirror was on.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And his energy was awful.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
It was sour.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
He was clearly like down or tired.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Yeah.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
And then the next day, like, same exact amount of effort that I put into the record.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
And it was a hit.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Because like, a lot of people were bringing the energy, especially a mirror.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
He was like, in a better mood.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
So that's just all I'm trying to say.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
So what, what should we be doing differently?

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
I fear y'all put everything you had into the pit wall.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Interesting.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
That's definitely true.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
This is fun.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
It's fucked up.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
What is fucked up?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I need to do in the scheduling.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Yes, Marika.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
No, go ahead.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
I want to hear that.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I'm just doing the scheduling.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
I'm trusting her to get guests that aren't going to be depleted.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Right.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Well, actually.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Totally, even further behind the curtain.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
We got a, we got a, like, a Google Doc sent to us.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Google Cal.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
No, this was a doc.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Okay.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
That was.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
We're doxing my doc for content.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
That was just asking, like, hey, add yourself to the head gum pod.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
So you're taking you more responsibility.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
I was trying to put it on on you.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
I purposely picked slots for myself to be on the show that line up with recordings of the pit wall.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Yeah, that way you don't have to keep coming in on days.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
You weren't going to come in.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yes.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Exactly right.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
I get how it all works.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
People like to think that I'm some idiot.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
I ultimately decided to come on the podcast today.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
After getting out of a doctor's appointment.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Because a mirror was supposed to be on this episode.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Five, five.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
I'm sorry.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Five room.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Alja.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Oh, the diagnostic.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Uh, five.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I'm how related.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
I got a scan of my teeth and my bone is turning to fiber.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
We got to get a shit out guys.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Because that's not good to hear about.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Like, people don't can't be on their morning commute hearing about how many

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
because bone structure is turning to fucking grains.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Yeah.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
I'm a rice of myself.

08:23.000 --> 08:30.000
What is I pay $735 today for someone to tell me?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Yeah.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
It was the full thing.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Hey.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Hey.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Here's the issue.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
This show has become us complaining about each other.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I'm wondering if we reconnect as friends.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Sure.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
I do want to say though.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
I think it would be really funny.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
If one day we had someone reading energies on the podcast.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Like in the middle of the episode.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Have you guys seen those aura photos?

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Yeah.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
What if we got someone to do that for the black magic?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Yeah.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
So I'm like cutting the alley and she needs more like loyalty in her life.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I guess I was a gambling addiction.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
No.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
I'm a very responsible gambler.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
I love to gamble.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
That's cool.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
But I can't.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
That was that.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I don't know.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
I'm just looking at you.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
I love to gamble.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
But I'm very strict with it.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
You know, I create an allowance just for gambling.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
It's pretty good.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Fine.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Are you a gambler?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
No.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
No.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
I like my money.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Yeah.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Well, we should earn money.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
The thing about gambling is you could use your money to get more.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
You can get less.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Or you can get less.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
But that's the thrill.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
On to the week.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
My bond of the week is Matthew Morrison.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Because it's time for a bond of the glee.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
I love it.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
I love it.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
I love it.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
I love it.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
But I can't see you.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
That's fair.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
I didn't laugh.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
I just kind of.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
It was like a resign sigh.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
So what can see her?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
She's not on that screen.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Oh, I'm not mirroring.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Because I don't want you to have to look at the soundboard.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Okay.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
I'm there.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Bond of the week.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
My dad.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
You.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
How so?

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I think it's time for him to break into acting.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Peter Khan.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
What's his name?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Tony.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Tony's Khan.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
I.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Casey asked how to pronounce my last name earlier.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
And I said, like, James.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Is that not hurtful to you?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
What has it been two and a half years?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
He doesn't want to say your last name.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
I wanted to make sure I was.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I was saying it correctly on a podcast record.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I think that's that's a professional courtesy.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
And you didn't let Ali speak.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
I said, I'm sorry.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I'm sorry.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
I'm sorry.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
And then you jetted it and you said how you felt.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
That's a great point.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
That's a great point.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
And I'm listening.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
And I'm here to listen.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Okay.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
And I want to hear what you have to say.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Thank you.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
You know, if the roles are ever reversed,

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
I'll ask you for confirmation before we record two.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Okay.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
So I don't say Donahoo.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
That happens.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
It doesn't.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
It doesn't.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Nobody ever doesn't know how to say Donahoo.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Oh, you'd be surprised.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
You'd be surprised when people don't know how to say Casey.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
What do you get?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Casey.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Casey.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Casey.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Donahoo.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Casey.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Casey.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Casey.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
How do you say it in like an Irish accent?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Donahoo.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
I don't know the Irish accent.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
You're adding a G in into my name there.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
I get that.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Also, the queue has gotten messed up.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
How do you feel about Casey not knowing how to pronounce your last name?

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
You know, it would be nice if he.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
It would be nice if he does.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
I do know.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
But you do know.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I think you maybe did before.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
I did.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I just wanted to make sure.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Make sure.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Make sure.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Make sure.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Yeah.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Is this about Alice last name?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
No, just what's the word.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
So let's all go down the line.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
What's the worst way somebody has like missed pronounced your name.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Oh, God.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Where to begin?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Um,

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
I get a lot of weird letters added to my name.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Okay.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I thought you met in the mail.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
I'm like.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Do you need a security detail?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I get weird letters.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Yeah.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
I'd love to get fewer mail letters.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Yeah.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
You know what I mean?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Yeah.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
And then the worst way someone's ever said your name?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Uh, I would say that.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
I would say that.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
Yeah, what did Jeff Ruben say?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Because it wasn't that bad.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
He said America.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
That's like the most common one.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
And it is ultimately annoying.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Yeah.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
And people then will use it as like a joke, which is also annoying.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Yeah.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
But I've gotten more to that.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
I've gotten Malika.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
I've gotten Malika.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I've gotten Malika.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
That's got Malika.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Barika.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Yeah.

12:55.000 --> 13:04.000
I thought that's just what they call Barista's at your coffee shop.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
At Marika's coffee shop.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
At Marika's coffee shop.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
At Marika's coffee shop.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
My friend Dom did call you Malika last week on the episode.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
So I'm sorry about that.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
I did.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Yeah.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
I met him walking out.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
I heard about that.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
I'm sorry.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
I'm sorry about him.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Use fine.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
It was just that like we got to lament about how you are kind of always running late.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I was on time that episode.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Well, you were late.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
And leaving for the airport.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
I wasn't there.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
I don't know what they're like.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
So what about Brownlee?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Anybody say Brownlee wrong?

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
Uh, no, I don't think so.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
I feel like that's kind of the easy, the easy part.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
So the worst name is maybe.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Maybe.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Sometimes.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Okay.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
So Barika Brownlee with a wise.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
The worst way somebody said something.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Your name.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Barika.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Barika.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Barika.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Okay.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
See what about you.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
My bottom of the league is John Cena.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
Because you can't see Bond.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Yeah.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
And then the worst way somebody's ever missed pronounce your first and last.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Cassie.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Um.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
Yeah.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
People at G's to my to Donna Hugh.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Donna.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Donna.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Donna.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Donna.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Donna.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Cassie.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Donna.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Donna.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Donna.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Spu.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
That feels like.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Yeah.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
That's something.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Yeah.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Yeah.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
And then.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Allie.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Let's hear it.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
I've gotten.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
I can't.

14:38.000 --> 14:44.000
But also Ali Khan K. H. N. And I plugged that into YouTube once and there is a singer named

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Ali Khan who some.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Man is somewhere in the desert Middle East area.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
I don't remember where exactly.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
And it was a music video of him on a sand June with like a lot of ladies.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Wow.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
So being on a sand dream with a lot of ladies is the equivalent of like if you're in Miami

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
right shot of Casey.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Uh, be on a yacht.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Yeah.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.440
I kind of, you know, shout out to my name Twin.

15:05.440 --> 15:07.240
I hope his career's flourishing.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.240
I have a name Twin also.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.680
That's a professional singer.

15:11.680 --> 15:12.680
Really?

15:12.680 --> 15:15.200
Casey Downey, who is a country singer, but he spells...

15:15.200 --> 15:16.200
Sorry, really.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.200
Just timing wise.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.840
He spells an HEW and I've never seen that spell anymore.

15:20.840 --> 15:24.320
Are you a millennial who misses what life was like in the 2000s?

15:24.320 --> 15:28.360
Have you had a hard time finding new or curated music?

15:28.360 --> 15:32.920
Are you interested in multiple perspectives on relationships dating and music?

15:32.920 --> 15:38.520
Then you're going to love C, the thing is, a podcast hosted by Grammy Award-winning R&B artist

15:38.520 --> 15:43.880
Bridget Kelly, and media personality and podcast trailblazer, Mandy Bee.

15:43.880 --> 15:48.360
Twice a week, Bridget and Mandy have nostalgic conversations in their grown segments, political

15:48.360 --> 15:53.120
pop culture conversations in their honest segments, and relationship hot-take conversations

15:53.120 --> 15:55.160
in the slightly toxic segment.

15:55.160 --> 15:58.760
The opinions on the show are real and brought to you by the genuine connections that the

15:58.760 --> 16:02.800
ladies have with their guests, who they like to call their friends with benefits.

16:02.800 --> 16:06.680
Which week you'll leave with some new music recommendations or a curated playlist that you

16:06.680 --> 16:10.800
didn't even know you needed in their freshly squeezed music segment.

16:10.800 --> 16:16.160
Recently the ladies have sat down with big freedia, remi ma, van lathe, and neo.

16:16.160 --> 16:21.560
So star power among them, you got to go check it out, follow and subscribe to see the

16:21.560 --> 16:25.400
thing is on Spotify, Apple podcasts, or on YouTube.

16:25.400 --> 16:29.800
New audio episodes drop every Tuesday and Friday, and visuals are available on YouTube Wednesdays

16:29.800 --> 16:30.800
and Saturdays.

16:30.800 --> 16:46.040
Check it out, and we're back, time for another edition of, so what?

16:46.040 --> 16:52.280
This is where we read headlines of the day that are neither here nor there, and wax

16:52.280 --> 16:59.640
about them, starting with more than 30,000 ancient coins found underwater in exceptional

16:59.640 --> 17:06.000
condition, so what do you guys think?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.200
I think it's interesting, really?

17:08.200 --> 17:09.840
Yeah, who found it?

17:09.840 --> 17:14.960
Do you think it's kind of funny that it's like exceptional condition, because how

17:14.960 --> 17:15.960
would we now?

17:15.960 --> 17:16.960
You know what I mean?

17:16.960 --> 17:18.960
I think it's boring.

17:18.960 --> 17:26.140
Oh, look how the coin.

17:26.140 --> 17:29.440
Killer Whales, hello, is my mic on?

17:29.440 --> 17:31.440
I can't wait.

17:31.440 --> 17:32.440
I can't wait.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.440
I don't know.

17:33.440 --> 17:34.440
I don't know if I can.

17:34.440 --> 17:38.880
I didn't click on the headline, it's about headlines, not the actual news articles.

17:38.880 --> 17:39.880
Okay, alright.

17:39.880 --> 17:43.800
CBS News found the news, I don't know who found the coins.

17:43.800 --> 17:44.800
Gotcha.

17:44.800 --> 17:51.400
Killer Whales, sink yacht in 45 minute long attack, so what?

17:51.400 --> 17:52.720
Well, no, I like that.

17:52.720 --> 17:53.720
I don't know what it is.

17:53.720 --> 17:54.720
I don't know what it is.

17:54.720 --> 17:55.720
That's a real work.

17:55.720 --> 17:56.720
Yeah.

17:56.720 --> 17:57.720
Yeah, you too.

17:57.720 --> 17:58.720
In May, Orca.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.520
I'm kind of interested in the rebellion.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.160
Yeah, that's true.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.720
It seems to be happening a little bit.

18:04.720 --> 18:05.720
It is a movement.

18:05.720 --> 18:06.720
Yeah.

18:06.720 --> 18:07.720
I think it's cool.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.800
It is the French Revolution of the OSHA.

18:09.800 --> 18:14.720
Yeah, which one is Robe Spear?

18:14.760 --> 18:19.080
Well, Killer Whales, free Willy, if you think free Willy is still alive, no, he's more

18:19.080 --> 18:25.880
of like, uh, he's like Nelson Mandela because he's on his, if he's still alive, he's

18:25.880 --> 18:28.120
on his last legs, the free Willy effect.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.120
That's pretty good.

18:29.120 --> 18:34.360
Okay, I'm going to, yeah, I'm going to move on.

18:34.360 --> 18:39.600
My boyfriend and I finally fulfilled my greatest fantasy and it was a disaster.

18:39.600 --> 18:40.600
Oh, no.

18:40.600 --> 18:41.600
That's so cool.

18:41.640 --> 18:42.600
Oh, what?

18:42.600 --> 18:43.600
It can be great.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.600
Careful at you, wish for her.

18:44.600 --> 18:45.600
Yeah.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.600
This is a headline from the news.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.600
Yeah, that one's from CBS News.

18:48.600 --> 18:49.600
What?

18:49.600 --> 18:52.600
What was the fantasy?

18:52.600 --> 18:55.600
And the segment is about, no, headline.

18:55.600 --> 18:56.600
Oh, sorry.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.600
I just feel like, okay.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.600
Okay, sorry.

18:58.600 --> 18:59.600
It was a boy or something.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.600
I didn't think the fantasy was.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.600
And it ended up being a nightmare.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.600
Yeah.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.600
Oh, I don't know.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.600
I don't want a king shame.

19:06.600 --> 19:07.600
Yeah.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.600
But try.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.600
And you don't want to do the crime.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.600
We should all shame one king right now.

19:13.600 --> 19:14.600
With one two, three go.

19:14.600 --> 19:15.600
Ah.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.600
I'll just play with Steve.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.600
Yes, tell him it leads Alex.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.600
I think Fireplay.

19:22.600 --> 19:25.640
Because ultimately, if it's not controlled, you might burn down the neighborhood and that's

19:25.640 --> 19:26.600
not fair.

19:26.600 --> 19:31.600
That is not what you consider, like, wax play.

19:31.600 --> 19:37.600
This is wax play, by the way.

19:37.600 --> 19:38.600
Yeah.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.600
Oh, I'm fired, I think.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.500
Oh, what?

19:40.500 --> 19:42.300
Burning all with wax.

19:42.300 --> 19:45.740
No wax plays like a candle.

19:45.740 --> 19:47.340
I mean more like live in Leviton.

19:47.340 --> 19:48.340
Leviton.

19:48.340 --> 19:49.340
I love it.

19:49.340 --> 19:50.340
You know what I mean?

19:50.340 --> 19:51.340
Like a good boy.

19:51.340 --> 19:52.540
It makes a good point.

19:52.540 --> 19:54.220
Maybe I'll change it to knife play.

19:54.220 --> 19:55.860
Because I think that's just pretty dangerous.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.260
I don't know how you could do that safely.

19:57.260 --> 19:58.260
You're going to shame.

19:58.260 --> 19:59.300
You're going to kink shame the knife.

19:59.300 --> 20:01.060
I'm going to shave shame.

20:01.060 --> 20:02.460
Okay, go on.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.460
I don't think we all should shave.

20:04.460 --> 20:06.920
That's true.

20:06.920 --> 20:08.920
Okay.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.180
Allie, one kink you'd love to shame.

20:10.180 --> 20:14.940
I'm scared kink.

20:14.940 --> 20:15.940
Like boo.

20:15.940 --> 20:16.940
Yeah.

20:16.940 --> 20:18.940
Like the finish.

20:18.940 --> 20:23.460
Get out of here with that.

20:23.460 --> 20:26.500
Somebody watching a listening is like.

20:26.500 --> 20:32.220
Marika or Saibarika?

20:32.220 --> 20:33.220
Baraka?

20:33.220 --> 20:34.220
Baraka.

20:34.220 --> 20:39.300
Oh, I thought I agreed with Casey.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.300
You sure.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.300
Yeah.

20:41.300 --> 20:42.980
You know what scapell is?

20:42.980 --> 20:43.980
It's like shit.

20:43.980 --> 20:44.980
Yeah.

20:44.980 --> 20:45.980
It's like boo, boo, boo, boo.

20:45.980 --> 20:46.980
But he's about.

20:46.980 --> 20:47.980
That's disgusting.

20:47.980 --> 20:48.980
That's disgusting.

20:48.980 --> 20:49.980
That's just disgusting.

20:49.980 --> 20:50.980
That's just disgusting.

20:50.980 --> 20:51.980
That's disgusting.

20:51.980 --> 20:52.980
That's disgusting.

20:52.980 --> 20:53.980
It's not an end play.

20:53.980 --> 20:54.980
Yeah, that's both of it.

20:54.980 --> 20:56.980
It's that.

20:56.980 --> 20:57.980
And your bebapu.

20:57.980 --> 20:59.740
Conyay West and daughter north.

20:59.740 --> 21:02.420
Share quality time together and do buy.

21:02.420 --> 21:03.420
So.

21:03.420 --> 21:04.420
So what?

21:04.420 --> 21:07.100
Yeah, I really don't care about that.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.100
Yeah, I don't care.

21:08.180 --> 21:15.420
The real problem with Madonna's face, our fearful, self-loathing.

21:15.420 --> 21:16.420
So what?

21:16.420 --> 21:17.420
So what?

21:17.420 --> 21:18.820
What do you guys think about that though?

21:18.820 --> 21:19.820
That's kind of interesting.

21:19.820 --> 21:24.180
People keep criticizing Madonna and they're saying that her face is different.

21:24.180 --> 21:25.620
It is different.

21:25.620 --> 21:28.820
But is it that her face is different or that we hate ourselves?

21:28.820 --> 21:29.820
No, her face is different.

21:29.820 --> 21:30.820
Her face is different.

21:30.820 --> 21:31.820
For sure.

21:31.820 --> 21:32.820
All right.

21:32.820 --> 21:33.820
We got a lot about it.

21:33.820 --> 21:35.420
I don't think it's mutually exclusive, you know.

21:35.420 --> 21:57.340
I can't shit stream shared of the frame.

21:57.340 --> 21:58.180
There it is, everyone.

21:58.180 --> 22:14.580
Yeah, what is happening?

22:14.580 --> 22:20.780
Welcome to Polywood.

22:20.780 --> 22:21.780
Keep going.

22:21.780 --> 22:25.460
I think the segment is good, but I couldn't nail down the name.

22:25.460 --> 22:26.460
Okay.

22:26.540 --> 22:29.700
Oh, that's not where I thought this was going.

22:29.700 --> 22:30.700
Yeah, I know.

22:30.700 --> 22:33.020
It sounded like Polycule.

22:33.020 --> 22:34.020
Yeah.

22:34.020 --> 22:41.020
Basically, these are all celebrities who have gotten involved in politics recently.

22:41.020 --> 22:45.900
And recently, it's actually pretty generous in the last like 10 years.

22:45.900 --> 22:49.060
But basically, I'm going to read a controversial quote.

22:49.060 --> 22:52.820
And then you guys have to match it to one of the celebrities on the board.

22:52.820 --> 22:54.660
Well, it's only these celebrities.

22:54.660 --> 22:55.660
It's only these.

22:55.740 --> 22:58.540
We've got, we've got, yeah, Casey, go ahead.

22:58.540 --> 22:59.660
We got Jade and Smith.

22:59.660 --> 23:02.220
We got Oprah Winfrey.

23:02.220 --> 23:04.420
We got Tommy Lee Jones, Emerald Lagassie.

23:04.420 --> 23:05.900
Is that Francis Ford Copeland?

23:05.900 --> 23:06.900
Yep.

23:06.900 --> 23:08.180
I don't know the blonde.

23:08.180 --> 23:10.100
Amanda, I'm in the side for you.

23:10.100 --> 23:11.340
That's right, from the movie.

23:11.340 --> 23:12.340
Wait, is it for me?

23:12.340 --> 23:13.340
I think, yeah.

23:13.340 --> 23:16.180
From left to right, bottom top, or top to bottom.

23:16.180 --> 23:21.020
Fergie Oprah, Tommy Lee Jones, Wolfgang Pock, Jade and Smith,

23:21.020 --> 23:24.820
Amanda C. Fried, Emerald Lagassie,

23:24.820 --> 23:26.620
and Francis Ford Copeland.

23:26.620 --> 23:27.220
Yeah.

23:27.220 --> 23:28.020
All got it?

23:28.020 --> 23:28.380
Yep.

23:28.380 --> 23:30.180
All right, here we go.

23:30.180 --> 23:32.020
This is some of these need context,

23:32.020 --> 23:35.420
but most of them are just straight quotes.

23:35.420 --> 23:39.380
On the topic of the 2024 California Goober National

23:39.380 --> 23:40.100
election.

23:40.100 --> 23:43.100
So this is for the governor.

23:43.100 --> 23:45.940
As long as I can still log into porn hub in my state,

23:45.940 --> 23:47.060
I'm good with either guy.

23:51.060 --> 23:52.380
This is real?

23:52.380 --> 23:54.060
These are all 100% real.

23:54.060 --> 23:55.940
Who's the third one?

23:55.940 --> 23:57.700
That's Tommy Lee Jones.

23:57.700 --> 23:59.420
I think it's Tommy Lee Jones.

23:59.420 --> 24:00.580
I think it's Wolfgang Pock.

24:00.580 --> 24:02.100
I think it's Wolfgang Pock, too.

24:05.700 --> 24:09.020
At it point, I've started doing that.

24:09.020 --> 24:10.620
Casey, what's good?

24:10.620 --> 24:11.140
It's good.

24:11.140 --> 24:12.820
So stop.

24:12.820 --> 24:13.860
That's Oprah Winfrey.

24:13.860 --> 24:14.700
What?

24:14.700 --> 24:16.060
Yeah, I don't believe that.

24:16.060 --> 24:18.900
So, what's the quote one more time?

24:18.900 --> 24:22.540
As long as I can still log into porn hub in my state,

24:22.540 --> 24:24.500
I'm good with either guy.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.380
She said this.

24:25.380 --> 24:26.220
Yeah.

24:26.220 --> 24:27.380
Okay.

24:27.380 --> 24:29.380
This is 100% straight.

24:29.380 --> 24:30.540
California.

24:30.540 --> 24:31.900
I'm on a Cito.

24:31.900 --> 24:33.060
Thank you.

24:33.060 --> 24:34.620
Which is more of a state of mind, I believe.

24:34.620 --> 24:35.620
Yeah.

24:35.620 --> 24:38.140
Adam Levine, Oprah Winfrey.

24:38.140 --> 24:38.860
Harry and Meghan.

24:38.860 --> 24:40.180
Harry and Meghan.

24:40.180 --> 24:40.940
Nebris.

24:40.940 --> 24:42.940
Larry David has a place up there.

24:42.940 --> 24:45.300
Jeff Bridges sold his spot.

24:45.300 --> 24:46.180
I love Jeff Bridges.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.100
More than a spot, really.

24:47.100 --> 24:49.540
It's got a whole estate moving on.

24:49.540 --> 24:53.860
Owning a gun is as fundamentally American as porcelain skin.

24:55.860 --> 24:56.860
Here.

24:56.860 --> 24:57.860
Okay.

24:57.860 --> 24:58.860
Fergie.

25:02.860 --> 25:03.860
I'm pretty good.

25:03.860 --> 25:06.140
So that funny did not see you.

25:06.140 --> 25:09.100
I know that, like, on this, you're on the screen behind me.

25:09.100 --> 25:09.940
And then I'm here.

25:09.940 --> 25:12.940
You might, you're, so it really does just feel like you're behind me.

25:12.940 --> 25:16.300
And I heard you just go, Fergie.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.260
Is that you?

25:18.340 --> 25:20.780
I'm going to go with Emerald Lagassie.

25:20.780 --> 25:21.780
Okay.

25:21.780 --> 25:24.500
And I'm going to go copalap.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.100
That was Amanda Saifried.

25:26.100 --> 25:30.620
I knew it was going to be, but I didn't want to put that on her.

25:30.620 --> 25:32.900
Because I said she would have said it on her.

25:32.900 --> 25:36.500
She's like surprisingly country, because she lives up state on a farm.

25:36.500 --> 25:39.260
Yeah, but not in a bad way.

25:39.260 --> 25:40.700
I don't, I mean, I don't know.

25:40.700 --> 25:43.100
I feel like she probably owns a gun in a fine way.

25:43.100 --> 25:47.380
The real issue in this quote is that she thinks being American means you have white skin.

25:48.380 --> 25:53.500
And again, what are you going to put on her?

25:53.500 --> 25:55.500
What are your sources?

25:55.500 --> 25:56.500
Yeah.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.940
The sources are CBS news.

25:58.940 --> 25:59.940
Oh, I agree.

25:59.940 --> 26:03.300
I, here we go.

26:03.300 --> 26:06.100
The nuclear family is the best form of governance.

26:06.100 --> 26:09.380
Well, so I hear my parents have never even met each other.

26:09.380 --> 26:10.380
Jaden Smith.

26:10.380 --> 26:11.380
That's absolutely correct.

26:11.380 --> 26:18.820
Nice one, Casey, all right, moving on.

26:18.820 --> 26:24.780
The opioid epidemic doesn't hold a candle to bad infrastructure.

26:24.780 --> 26:28.220
Try complaining about fentanyl on a shitty bridge.

26:28.220 --> 26:29.220
That's right.

26:29.220 --> 26:30.220
You can't.

26:30.220 --> 26:31.220
Fergie.

26:31.220 --> 26:32.220
To get each other.

26:32.220 --> 26:33.220
Fergie.

26:33.220 --> 26:34.220
Fergie.

26:34.220 --> 26:39.500
Not that, yes, is all around, but that ultimately was Wolfgang Park.

26:40.020 --> 26:44.540
Well, Fergie famously saying about that bridge.

26:44.540 --> 26:45.540
Right.

26:45.540 --> 26:49.740
You know, every time you come around, yeah, I learned a lot of French wine for that.

26:49.740 --> 26:50.740
Yeah.

26:50.740 --> 26:54.620
Well, and she's recovered, addict.

26:54.620 --> 26:55.620
Is that true?

26:55.620 --> 26:57.020
Crystal meth.

26:57.020 --> 26:58.020
Really?

26:58.020 --> 26:59.020
Yeah.

26:59.020 --> 27:01.540
If this isn't true, this is the meanest thing you've ever said.

27:01.540 --> 27:05.620
No, I'm serious.

27:05.620 --> 27:08.860
Moving on to, um, okay.

27:08.940 --> 27:13.420
I don't understand why people don't like when the price of milk goes up.

27:13.420 --> 27:16.660
Don't you want your milk to be more valuable?

27:16.660 --> 27:18.740
Francis Ford Copeland.

27:18.740 --> 27:19.740
Emerald.

27:19.740 --> 27:20.740
Emerald.

27:20.740 --> 27:23.860
That was Tommy Lee Jones.

27:23.860 --> 27:24.860
Yeah.

27:24.860 --> 27:25.860
No.

27:25.860 --> 27:26.860
Yeah.

27:26.860 --> 27:31.100
Now that you've revealed it, yeah, that's true.

27:31.100 --> 27:32.100
Here we go.

27:32.100 --> 27:36.100
When a woman's?

27:36.100 --> 27:38.820
Yeah, try again.

27:39.460 --> 27:46.740
So fucked up of him to say, oh, yeah, him to say he, what did he say?

27:46.740 --> 27:49.340
And just this is not, this is this person.

27:49.340 --> 27:49.860
Right.

27:49.860 --> 27:51.540
You got this from CBS News.

27:51.540 --> 27:52.540
CBS News.

28:03.540 --> 28:04.940
Oh, no.

28:04.940 --> 28:07.140
What did they say?

28:08.140 --> 28:09.140
Yeah.

28:09.140 --> 28:12.140
Just tell us, what did Emerald say?

28:16.140 --> 28:18.140
You guys don't think this is funny.

28:18.140 --> 28:20.140
This sucks.

28:29.140 --> 28:30.140
Well, don't worry about it.

28:30.140 --> 28:32.140
It's not like something new in the world.

28:32.140 --> 28:33.140
This is just real.

28:33.140 --> 28:34.140
This is just real.

28:34.140 --> 28:35.140
This is just real.

28:35.140 --> 28:36.140
From one of these.

28:37.140 --> 28:39.140
Just tell us.

28:39.140 --> 28:42.140
When a woman's health is most at risk,

28:42.140 --> 28:46.140
that's when abortion should be the most illegal.

28:46.140 --> 28:48.140
Because let's face it.

28:48.140 --> 28:51.140
That's got to be one hell of a kid in there.

28:51.140 --> 28:52.140
Bam.

29:06.140 --> 29:07.140
Oprah.

29:15.140 --> 29:17.140
I think it's Francis.

29:30.140 --> 29:32.140
I can't believe it.

29:37.140 --> 29:39.140
You just said, sorry.

29:42.140 --> 29:43.140
So who said it?

29:43.140 --> 29:44.140
That was Francis.

29:49.140 --> 29:51.140
We have to give that a break.

30:01.140 --> 30:02.140
Sorry, yeah.

30:02.140 --> 30:05.140
Oh, I was just going to say this is sorry to pause it.

30:05.140 --> 30:07.140
Do we ever are?

30:07.140 --> 30:09.140
You already told.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.140
Okay.

30:10.140 --> 30:12.140
That we are still in the recording.

30:12.140 --> 30:13.140
Okay, perfect.

30:13.140 --> 30:14.140
That's all I wanted to know.

30:14.140 --> 30:15.140
What?

30:15.140 --> 30:16.140
That's tomorrow.

30:16.140 --> 30:17.140
No.

30:17.140 --> 30:18.140
No.

30:18.140 --> 30:19.140
That's on the 14th.

30:19.140 --> 30:21.140
It's on December 7th.

30:21.140 --> 30:22.140
And tomorrow's November 7th.

30:22.140 --> 30:23.140
Yeah.

30:23.140 --> 30:24.140
Yes.

30:24.140 --> 30:25.140
Okay.

30:25.140 --> 30:26.140
That was all I wanted to ask.

30:26.140 --> 30:27.140
Back to the show.

30:31.140 --> 30:33.140
I'm all for a public option.

30:33.140 --> 30:35.140
But I don't think that single payer health.

30:35.140 --> 30:36.140
We're still playing the game.

30:36.140 --> 30:37.140
Yeah.

30:37.140 --> 30:38.140
Okay.

30:38.140 --> 30:40.140
I'm all for a public option.

30:40.140 --> 30:42.140
But I don't think single payer health care is realistic.

30:42.140 --> 30:46.140
I mean, even if one person did have all that cash.

30:46.140 --> 30:50.140
Do you really think they'd want to spend it on poor people's kidneys in junk?

30:50.140 --> 30:52.140
I guess it's Emma.

30:52.140 --> 30:53.140
All right.

30:53.140 --> 30:54.140
It's the last one.

30:54.140 --> 30:56.140
No ban after that, though.

30:56.140 --> 30:58.140
He wasn't kidding.

30:58.140 --> 31:01.140
Exactly right.

31:01.140 --> 31:02.140
Yeah.

31:02.140 --> 31:04.140
That was Emerald Gossie.

31:04.140 --> 31:05.140
Wow.

31:05.140 --> 31:06.140
He said that.

31:06.140 --> 31:07.140
Yeah.

31:07.140 --> 31:08.140
That was awful.

31:08.140 --> 31:12.140
And this was, it wasn't in an interview to CBS News, but CBS News just reported.

31:12.140 --> 31:13.140
Oh.

31:13.140 --> 31:14.140
Anyway.

31:19.140 --> 31:21.140
I don't eat your heroes, I guess.

31:21.140 --> 31:22.140
Yeah.

31:22.140 --> 31:24.140
Do you think people have ever thought that about you, Marika?

31:24.140 --> 31:26.140
They've met you at shows and stuff.

31:26.140 --> 31:28.140
Probably.

31:29.140 --> 31:30.140
Right.

31:30.140 --> 31:32.140
Actually, I would say definitely.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.140
Yeah.

31:34.140 --> 31:36.140
Um.

31:36.140 --> 31:39.140
That was all I had planned for the episode.

31:39.140 --> 31:40.140
Oh.

31:40.140 --> 31:41.140
What?

31:41.140 --> 31:42.140
Well, no, it's just hang out.

31:42.140 --> 31:43.140
I feel like we never.

31:43.140 --> 31:44.140
It's always the bid.

31:44.140 --> 31:45.140
It's always, oh, Jeffrey.

31:45.140 --> 31:46.140
You know, can't prepare.

31:46.140 --> 31:47.140
He's, you know, he's an asshole.

31:47.140 --> 31:49.140
But let's just be friends.

31:49.140 --> 31:50.140
Okay.

31:50.140 --> 31:53.140
What do you guys most interested in life right now about?

31:53.140 --> 31:57.140
What do you most interested in right now in life?

31:57.140 --> 31:58.140
A real topic.

31:58.140 --> 32:01.140
Something that people might find interesting.

32:01.140 --> 32:03.140
Um.

32:03.140 --> 32:06.140
I mean, that's, that's a loaded question.

32:06.140 --> 32:09.140
I think.

32:09.140 --> 32:10.140
Because of what we talked about.

32:10.140 --> 32:11.140
No matter what.

32:11.140 --> 32:12.140
No matter what.

32:12.140 --> 32:14.140
Anyone could say they're saying the wrong thing.

32:14.140 --> 32:17.140
Well, now it's turning into a Casey's druthers.

32:17.140 --> 32:18.140
Give me a second.

32:18.140 --> 32:19.140
You start.

32:19.140 --> 32:20.140
Start.

32:20.140 --> 32:21.140
Going now.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.140
Oh, I don't.

32:22.140 --> 32:26.140
I, all of my druthers, I cannot speak about.

32:26.140 --> 32:30.140
Here on this in this forum.

32:30.140 --> 32:33.140
Uh, and that's the end of my druthers.

32:33.140 --> 32:34.140
I don't know.

32:34.140 --> 32:35.140
Jeff, how are you?

32:35.140 --> 32:36.140
You're busy?

32:38.140 --> 32:41.140
Casey, two minutes and 45 seconds on the board.

32:41.140 --> 32:42.140
All right.

32:42.140 --> 32:44.140
It's too dry here in LA these days.

32:44.140 --> 32:48.140
My allergies have been going wild recently.

32:48.140 --> 32:49.140
I am waking up congested.

32:49.140 --> 32:52.140
My eyes are watering their itchy.

32:52.140 --> 32:53.140
It sucks.

32:53.140 --> 32:57.140
I should not have to live like this for two months out of the year.

32:57.140 --> 32:58.140
You know what I mean?

32:58.140 --> 33:01.140
That's the biggest thing in my life right now.

33:01.140 --> 33:06.140
Uh, that I'm dealing with physically dated and is breathing through my nose.

33:06.140 --> 33:08.140
Why is it such a challenge?

33:08.140 --> 33:18.140
Why can't the world we live in just be livable for all of us?

33:18.140 --> 33:19.140
That's it.

33:19.140 --> 33:24.140
And I think we need to change the playoff structure of the MLB.

33:24.140 --> 33:30.140
I think it's weird that the wild cards were in the world series and all the teams

33:30.140 --> 33:34.140
that won over a hundred games were more bounce pretty quickly.

33:34.140 --> 33:37.140
I think we need to do something about that.

33:37.140 --> 33:44.140
Uh, I hope that when they, when Allie takes her drivers test that,

33:45.140 --> 33:49.140
that she only has one person giving that her the test from the pit wall.

33:49.140 --> 33:50.140
Sorry, I forgot.

33:50.140 --> 33:53.140
Uh, we've been reporting for three hours now.

33:53.140 --> 33:56.140
So when you go to the movie theater,

33:56.140 --> 34:01.140
you should not be talking to anybody.

34:01.140 --> 34:04.140
It's just you and the screen.

34:04.140 --> 34:06.140
What do you have to say to your neighbor?

34:06.140 --> 34:08.140
Wait until the credits.

34:09.140 --> 34:13.140
And, and, uh, one more minute.

34:13.140 --> 34:14.140
Oh, it's perfect.

34:14.140 --> 34:15.140
It's perfect.

34:15.140 --> 34:18.140
A Halloween candy.

34:18.140 --> 34:20.140
The chocolate's got worse.

34:20.140 --> 34:21.140
Across the board.

34:21.140 --> 34:24.140
It's not true or out of the taste punch change.

34:24.140 --> 34:27.140
Maybe they maybe have become more of a grown-up.

34:27.140 --> 34:32.140
The chocolate and a Reese just doesn't hit like a used tooth.

34:32.140 --> 34:35.140
Do you think butter fingers taste different?

34:35.140 --> 34:37.140
What's that?

34:38.140 --> 34:40.140
Butter fingers, KC.

34:40.140 --> 34:41.140
Butter fingers?

34:41.140 --> 34:43.140
I like butter fingers.

34:43.140 --> 34:45.140
They taste, I think they taste great,

34:45.140 --> 34:48.140
but they get stuck in my teeth and I'm not a fan.

34:51.140 --> 34:53.140
I feel like we had a, we had a minute.

34:53.140 --> 34:54.140
A second.

34:59.140 --> 35:02.140
I'll always look out for number one.

35:04.140 --> 35:05.140
What?

35:05.140 --> 35:06.140
What?

35:08.140 --> 35:12.140
I hope that's missed exactly how I heard it.

35:12.140 --> 35:14.140
I'm planning on not touching it.

35:14.140 --> 35:16.140
I don't think it better.

35:16.140 --> 35:17.140
That was perfect.

35:17.140 --> 35:19.140
Yeah, I'm, I'm interest.

35:19.140 --> 35:22.140
Because I could barely hear KC.

35:22.140 --> 35:25.140
Always look out for number one.

35:25.140 --> 35:27.140
Yeah, and you got a KC.

35:27.140 --> 35:30.140
I also, I want to just say that every time someone else does a

35:30.140 --> 35:40.140
druthers, you love to interject, but when I do a druthers,

35:40.140 --> 35:43.140
I'm not allowed to talk to other people.

35:43.140 --> 35:45.140
It's not allowed.

35:45.140 --> 35:48.140
It's that I trust you to have druthers.

35:48.140 --> 35:50.140
KC needed training wheels.

35:50.140 --> 35:53.140
I found some, I found some druthers.

35:53.140 --> 35:55.140
Yeah, I thought he took a great job.

35:55.140 --> 35:58.140
I'm pretty proud of yourself right now.

35:59.140 --> 36:03.140
I've never seen you look that smug on the show.

36:03.140 --> 36:05.140
I got a lot of my chest.

36:05.140 --> 36:06.140
Just that.

36:06.140 --> 36:07.140
You didn't know what to say.

36:07.140 --> 36:10.140
Yeah, I've followed my heart.

36:10.140 --> 36:11.140
Yeah.

36:11.140 --> 36:13.140
This is my first druthers.

36:13.140 --> 36:14.140
Do you want to druthers?

36:14.140 --> 36:15.140
No.

36:15.140 --> 36:16.140
No, no, no, no.

36:16.140 --> 36:18.140
I think that's really a lot.

36:18.140 --> 36:21.140
Alley's druthers, man.

36:21.140 --> 36:22.140
Why didn't you do it?

36:22.140 --> 36:25.140
Did it in 35 seconds on the board?

36:25.140 --> 36:26.140
Go.

36:26.140 --> 36:29.140
Hey, why didn't everybody tell me that my hair looked bad sooner?

36:29.140 --> 36:30.140
I just told you.

36:30.140 --> 36:32.140
Not quick enough pieces.

36:32.140 --> 36:33.140
Oh, my heart hurts.

36:33.140 --> 36:35.140
I just said nothing at all.

36:35.140 --> 36:36.140
I didn't know.

36:36.140 --> 36:37.140
I'm sorry.

36:37.140 --> 36:38.140
Yeah.

36:38.140 --> 36:39.140
I don't know.

36:39.140 --> 36:41.140
I don't have a lot of issues, I guess.

36:41.140 --> 36:42.140
Right now.

36:42.140 --> 36:44.140
I wish that I had more time.

36:44.140 --> 36:47.140
I feel guilty all the time.

36:47.140 --> 36:50.140
And I think I'm bad at everything all the time.

36:50.140 --> 36:52.140
But I'm working on it.

36:52.140 --> 36:54.140
In my head right now, I'm going on.

36:54.140 --> 36:57.140
The druthers is going okay.

36:57.140 --> 36:59.140
What do everybody thinks about druthers?

36:59.140 --> 37:02.140
Is the worst druthers of the old druthers?

37:02.140 --> 37:04.140
And it was a big regret.

37:04.140 --> 37:10.140
Maybe this druthers should have just stopped what we were at.

37:10.140 --> 37:13.140
But now we're too far in and we just got to see it through.

37:13.140 --> 37:16.140
And everyone's just got to ride the ride with me.

37:16.140 --> 37:17.140
Oh, no.

37:17.140 --> 37:20.140
And I hope that my hair still looks bad.

37:20.140 --> 37:21.140
It looks good.

37:22.140 --> 37:23.140
Oh, it looks good now.

37:23.140 --> 37:24.140
It's going.

37:24.140 --> 37:25.140
It's okay.

37:25.140 --> 37:28.140
I hope that everything goes okay today.

37:28.140 --> 37:31.140
And it's an okay Monday.

37:31.140 --> 37:32.140
Something.

37:32.140 --> 37:33.140
On day, on day.

37:33.140 --> 37:34.140
On day.

37:34.140 --> 37:35.140
On day.

37:35.140 --> 37:36.140
On day.

37:36.140 --> 37:37.140
On day.

37:37.140 --> 37:38.140
On day.

37:38.140 --> 37:40.140
If I was in charge of a battleship,

37:40.140 --> 37:42.140
we would say.

37:42.140 --> 37:44.140
Oh, I got it.

37:48.140 --> 37:49.140
Pretty good.

37:49.140 --> 37:50.140
Yeah.

37:50.140 --> 37:51.140
Pretty good.

37:51.140 --> 37:52.140
Yeah.

37:52.140 --> 37:53.140
Pretty good.

37:53.140 --> 37:54.140
You want to round us out.

37:54.140 --> 37:55.140
We do have five more minutes.

37:55.140 --> 37:56.140
Pretty much.

37:56.140 --> 37:57.140
I don't want to do.

37:57.140 --> 37:58.140
I want to do five minutes.

37:58.140 --> 37:59.140
No, not the whole five minutes.

37:59.140 --> 38:02.140
But we might have to do a Marieka's druthers for sure.

38:02.140 --> 38:03.140
Here we go.

38:03.140 --> 38:05.140
Marieka's druthers.

38:05.140 --> 38:06.140
Oh, it's a more fun.

38:06.140 --> 38:07.140
I'm just kind of thinking.

38:07.140 --> 38:08.140
It's a little more grounded.

38:08.140 --> 38:09.140
Marieka.

38:09.140 --> 38:10.140
Yeah.

38:10.140 --> 38:14.140
I kind of feel like I can't match the energy of those.

38:14.140 --> 38:18.140
And I think it might be because I'm in my home.

38:18.140 --> 38:20.140
I'm not in the studio with everyone.

38:20.140 --> 38:22.140
And I feel kind of isolated.

38:22.140 --> 38:26.140
And I've had a hard time hearing everyone's out there, druthers.

38:26.140 --> 38:29.140
And it seemed like a lot of fun in there.

38:29.140 --> 38:34.140
But ultimately, like now, I don't even know if you can hear what I'm saying.

38:34.140 --> 38:38.140
So that's kind of stressful.

38:38.140 --> 38:41.140
And it's also almost 430.

38:41.140 --> 38:44.140
And I've done no work today.

38:44.140 --> 38:46.140
Except for this work.

38:46.140 --> 38:50.140
And I have to go to a live show tonight.

38:50.140 --> 38:52.140
And also do other work and eat food.

38:52.140 --> 38:54.140
And I don't know how I'm going to do all those things.

38:54.140 --> 38:56.140
So now I'm a little stressed about that.

38:56.140 --> 38:58.140
And those prospects.

38:58.140 --> 39:00.140
Ultimately.

39:00.140 --> 39:04.140
And I kind of just want to sleep for a really long time.

39:04.140 --> 39:18.140
I think that it's crazy that people can just come out and then get home.

39:18.140 --> 39:20.140
And then also like cook a full meal.

39:20.140 --> 39:24.140
And like still feel of air with their lives.

39:24.140 --> 39:28.140
Like I get home.

39:28.140 --> 39:32.140
And then I just like lay on my couch for an hour.

39:32.140 --> 39:36.140
Yeah.

39:36.140 --> 39:38.140
That was easy.

39:38.140 --> 39:40.140
Everyone got a druthers.

39:40.140 --> 39:42.140
Oh, druthers.

39:42.140 --> 39:44.140
Yeah, pretty huge.

39:44.140 --> 39:46.140
Solidette.

39:46.140 --> 39:48.140
Thank you guys for doing the episode.

39:48.140 --> 39:49.140

40:04.140 --> 40:06.140
This comes out in like a month.

40:06.140 --> 40:08.140
Ali was on the pit wall.

40:08.140 --> 40:10.140
Sometime in the past.

40:10.140 --> 40:12.140
This is coming out.

40:12.140 --> 40:14.140
November 24th.

40:14.140 --> 40:16.140
I think November 24th.

40:16.140 --> 40:18.140
So go look up.

40:18.140 --> 40:20.140
Ali's episode of the pit wall.

40:20.140 --> 40:22.140
She was great.

40:22.140 --> 40:24.140
Hope you all like Friday.

40:24.140 --> 40:26.140
I think about it.

40:26.140 --> 40:28.140
Wonderful.

40:28.140 --> 40:32.140
Just set piled.

40:32.140 --> 40:34.140
I'm talking to the pit wall.

40:34.140 --> 40:36.140
I'm talking to the pit wall.

40:36.140 --> 40:38.140
Yeah, listen to the pit wall.

40:38.140 --> 40:40.140
You have to stop.

40:40.140 --> 40:42.140
What the fuck are you talking to?

40:42.140 --> 40:44.140
Oh my god.

40:44.140 --> 40:46.140
Listen to the pit wall.

40:46.140 --> 40:48.140
I hate that one.

40:48.140 --> 40:50.140
And then stop doing this.

40:50.140 --> 40:54.140
That was all one button.

40:54.140 --> 40:56.140
Listen to the pit wall.

40:57.140 --> 40:58.140
And go to my website.

40:58.140 --> 40:59.140
Casey makes movies that come.

40:59.140 --> 41:00.140
I got a bunch of movies there.

41:00.140 --> 41:01.140
You can watch some movies I made.

41:01.140 --> 41:02.140
Oh yeah.

41:02.140 --> 41:04.140
That's a good bug.

41:04.140 --> 41:06.140
Um.

41:06.140 --> 41:08.140
Follow me on letter box.

41:08.140 --> 41:09.140
Please.

41:09.140 --> 41:10.140
At Marie Gailon.

41:10.140 --> 41:12.140
Nothing else matters.

41:12.140 --> 41:14.140
It's like I have to do something else.

41:14.140 --> 41:16.140
And I started putting together my new vacuum.

41:16.140 --> 41:20.140
Hahahaha.

41:20.140 --> 41:22.140
At every James on Instagram.

41:22.140 --> 41:23.140
Um.

41:23.140 --> 41:24.140
Show this.

41:24.140 --> 41:25.140
Show to your friends.

41:25.140 --> 41:27.140
The post-nubshell episode is a good intro.

41:27.140 --> 41:29.140
I think we need to start.

41:29.140 --> 41:31.140
I need to start promoting the shit out of this stuff.

41:31.140 --> 41:32.140
You show man.

41:32.140 --> 41:33.140
Yeah.

41:33.140 --> 41:35.140
We got to figure out a way.

41:35.140 --> 41:39.140
Like the like a guide to explaining the head gun podcast.

41:39.140 --> 41:41.140
That could be a fun video to make.

41:41.140 --> 41:42.140
That is fun.

41:42.140 --> 41:44.140
I wonder if we changed the name.

41:44.140 --> 41:45.140
To what?

41:45.140 --> 41:47.140
Jeff's witch in hour.

41:47.140 --> 41:48.140
Hahahaha.

41:48.140 --> 41:51.140
Jeff's rich field hour.

41:51.140 --> 41:52.140
Lich field.

41:52.140 --> 41:54.140
Oh, I'm aware of Lich field.

41:55.140 --> 41:56.140
Yeah.

41:56.140 --> 41:58.140
There's a famous prison.

41:58.140 --> 41:59.140
Lich field.

41:59.140 --> 42:00.140
Yeah.

42:00.140 --> 42:02.140
It's where it weren't just the new black takes place.

42:02.140 --> 42:04.140
It's also where Gilmore gross takes place.

42:04.140 --> 42:05.140
No it doesn't.

42:05.140 --> 42:06.140
It's just county.

42:06.140 --> 42:07.140
Wish Washington Depot.

42:07.140 --> 42:08.140
Okay.

42:08.140 --> 42:11.140
I lived and cannot a good.

42:11.140 --> 42:13.140
Okay.

42:13.140 --> 42:17.140
I like the target audience of that joke and it didn't really hit.

42:17.140 --> 42:18.140
So.

42:18.140 --> 42:20.140
Let's end it on this note.

42:24.140 --> 42:39.140
Thank you.

42:39.140 --> 42:41.140
That was a hit dumb original.

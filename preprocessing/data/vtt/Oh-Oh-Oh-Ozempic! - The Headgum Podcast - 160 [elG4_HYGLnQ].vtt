WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:02.000 --> 00:31.440
He is just a great and great

00:31.440 --> 00:38.000
We started met him at the scene. That's not bad. Well actually, I think that's mad

00:39.120 --> 00:41.600
Wait, that is America. Can't hear Michael's in.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.120
Rica, can you not hear the sound effects? I

00:46.240 --> 00:49.600
Don't know. You don't know. Okay, what about this? It was

00:53.840 --> 00:59.680
Yeah, kind of sounds like I'm hearing it from someone's headphones playing it early allowed

01:02.000 --> 01:05.040
That's all right. I think that's gonna have to be all right because I don't want to keep

01:05.040 --> 01:09.600
setting shut up. There's too much tech in the studio. Do you have your playing the audio off of your

01:09.600 --> 01:14.400
laptop? Yeah, and you guys are hearing it crystal. It's coming through in stereo for you. Yeah, what

01:14.400 --> 01:19.680
is that America to America? What'd you say? It's not getting to America. I know. Is your laptop

01:20.640 --> 01:26.400
are you on this Zoom call with Marieka on the laptop or just the studio? I know what to do. Audio settings

01:27.280 --> 01:33.680
Output volume all the way down. No, it's gone. Okay. Marieka? Yes. There we go. And then you can hear this.

01:33.680 --> 01:42.080
Just double checking. I sure can. It's a shame we didn't get that on video.

01:42.560 --> 01:58.960
We're a splaps I've ever seen. Out of rhythm, out of touch, 40 years old, you don't

01:58.960 --> 02:04.960
bring the heat anymore like you used to, man. Aren't you 40 and a half now? No, that was the

02:04.960 --> 02:12.000
tweet. Yeah, July 18th, I'll be for you. It was only a tweet. It was only a tweet.

02:12.400 --> 02:26.160
I'm still fucking bringing it. Are you kidding me? I'm so fucked up. It's like Marieka's a control of

02:26.160 --> 02:32.160
all of a sudden something, man. Bond of the week, let's fucking get the shit over with.

02:32.320 --> 02:42.000
I'm going to go with fucking Taylor Edward Johnson or whatever. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know who

02:42.000 --> 02:50.000
that is. Yeah. Who? Shams Charania. Okay. Maddie Mathison. Okay. Marieka, who is it? Come on.

02:50.000 --> 02:57.360
Also, the bear really did a little falter. Nice. All right. The shit is tired. All right. And so am I.

02:58.320 --> 03:05.360
Right. Yeah. Yes. We started off with strong. And then all of a sudden, there was like, by the

03:05.360 --> 03:12.160
way, how do you off strong? It's like, we're in the 83rd second of the show. This is still starting off.

03:12.160 --> 03:19.120
Also, not to not to bring it. Yes, the noise. Marieka, you can't see this, but the fucking chair is

03:19.120 --> 03:23.360
like making a squeaking sound. We're banging it against the wall. We're banging it against the wall. Okay,

03:23.520 --> 03:28.160
I'm away from the wall. We got to relate it to what I was in this wall, but from the further distance.

03:28.160 --> 03:32.160
You know what I'm saying is that this is supposed to be an audio network. We can't even get

03:32.160 --> 03:37.200
shit under wraps. This is a video studio. What's that? This is a video studio speaking and speaking

03:37.200 --> 03:45.520
of video. We, we restarted so that I could hear audio and now it's just Jeff's camera being

03:45.520 --> 03:50.960
off in the zoom. So I can't see Jeff, but in theory, I could. He just hasn't turned his camera on.

03:50.960 --> 03:57.680
Non video participants. How do you do this? Marieka, this is what you want. Yeah, there it is.

03:57.680 --> 04:00.160
Oh my god, this is so fucked up.

04:03.920 --> 04:08.640
Great outfit. Thanks. Thanks. You're the same jack. It says Jack.

04:09.200 --> 04:16.080
Okay, the same is what a mirror's coming in here with. Yeah, the tweet. Yeah, the tweet. The name's Jack.

04:16.960 --> 04:20.320
Jack shit. I like that.

04:25.680 --> 04:29.840
I want to talk about this. I don't know. Have you guys, uh, have you guys heard my name?

04:31.120 --> 04:34.240
Do you know who you're doing an impression of when you do that? Are you or it's too great?

04:34.240 --> 04:37.360
Too young. Yeah, that's why I thought it's going to no gray.

04:37.360 --> 04:46.800
Sorry, that really did you build it. I know I always say like over a pair of dials.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.560
Yeah, so I'm waiting in here. Yeah. Hey, guys, you're going to run this.

04:51.520 --> 05:01.040
Is Jay Leno? Never mind. Oh, oh, people with type two dials.

05:01.960 --> 05:02.820
Yes.

05:06.640 --> 05:12.800
Life and ZemBig. No, I wanted to talk about this in the ill order of the shit got fucked up.

05:12.800 --> 05:16.320
Is it? Was that a commercial? Was that actually what you're trying to play?

05:16.320 --> 05:17.760
I'd like to know. Okay.

05:18.880 --> 05:24.320
I think it was a real isn't big commercial, but he just took the before oh ZemBig was what it was today.

05:24.320 --> 05:28.960
I found out about this recently. They had to like advertise the shit, right?

05:28.960 --> 05:36.160
Now, everybody in their mother wants the fucking pill, right? This fucking jack pill. It's a it's a shot. Oh, we got

05:39.440 --> 05:41.440
It's been four years

05:45.760 --> 05:55.760
I'm sorry. I really am that was too much. I just I have an agenda when I come into these things and I really need a bucket. I feel as need to

05:56.720 --> 06:00.400
To push through. You know what I mean? What are you happy now?

06:02.720 --> 06:04.320
You have too many emotions.

06:05.280 --> 06:07.280
Cher squeaking at the store. Oh

06:08.560 --> 06:10.720
People with type two diabetes are excited about

06:12.720 --> 06:20.000
People with type two diabetes are excited. I don't know if you guys saw this when it was on the air

06:20.000 --> 06:24.400
But yes, before everyone in their mother wanted fucking the jab stick Maria

06:26.000 --> 06:33.200
There was a commercial where they licensed the fucking song. What is ever? Oh, oh, oh, it's magic and it was oh, oh

06:33.920 --> 06:37.760
Zambick we heard the commercial twice now

06:37.920 --> 06:39.920
Bollie

06:41.360 --> 06:47.760
We're not even what seven minutes into the shit. I can't get a one-and-one talk on this. You have to

06:47.760 --> 06:49.760
Monologue

06:49.760 --> 06:53.200
I thought the show was a dog. No, it's a monologue and then

06:53.200 --> 06:59.760
I was heard about this and you won't even let us reply right and said you're like I have to say in the commercial

06:59.760 --> 07:07.200
Yeah, there we go. I'll keep you guys sure off-key, but I hopped the fucking thing. I hopped the fucking off-doctor

07:07.200 --> 07:09.840
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh

07:11.440 --> 07:16.400
Not necessary which up-active did you hop? I don't know what key it is

07:17.200 --> 07:19.840
It's just matching whatever the fucking commercial said

07:20.400 --> 07:25.200
What you what movie do you guys think of when you hear that song because to me it it

07:25.200 --> 07:28.160
It harkens back to a movie. I watched a lot growing up

07:28.880 --> 07:32.960
Maybe cases the only one who has seen this movie though to me you harkin back

07:32.960 --> 07:40.160
Yeah, that I should probably draft a will a living will in Justin because seeing you is seeing the picture of unhealth

07:40.640 --> 07:42.640
And disorder

07:42.640 --> 07:44.640
And so for movie

07:44.880 --> 07:46.880
Happy go more

07:46.880 --> 07:49.440
Yeah, happy come on. Yeah, he's that song

07:51.120 --> 07:57.520
It's probably my favorite top the uh happy Madison. Hey, Marika over. Yeah, Marika who am I?

07:58.960 --> 08:00.960

08:09.440 --> 08:14.720
I just said I have a movie. What do you think? What's the line? Which part? Yeah, which part?

08:14.720 --> 08:19.040
Well, you know that wasn't a line, but it's like the it's the fucking thing where he hits a pot

08:19.040 --> 08:21.040
He's like

08:21.040 --> 08:24.640
It's a pot someone's at the door someone's at the door FedEx and

08:25.360 --> 08:28.160

08:39.040 --> 08:41.040
Like you're in a cage

08:41.040 --> 08:45.840
You also like don't need to look at screens. It's interesting

08:47.200 --> 08:52.320
To see from this side what what I usually look like yeah in our new setup

08:52.320 --> 08:55.440
I see this chaos. This is like no one would be fucking at ease

08:56.160 --> 09:01.920
When from this angle there's too many cords there's too much technology. I'm not a technology guy. Yeah, I kind of feel it's clear

09:01.920 --> 09:06.640
But go over there sometimes. It's yeah, it's oh oh oh

09:09.440 --> 09:12.560
No, shoot him a Gavin right? He's always like he's like

And I don't mean that we're gonna say can we quit it with the cross legs?

10:47.840 --> 10:49.840
Well, he's not in short so I think it's fine

10:50.880 --> 10:52.880

13:16.960 --> 13:22.800
But he makes the movie and we like we like looking at ourselves on screen

13:23.200 --> 13:25.200
Isn't that what they still say about Spielberg

13:27.920 --> 13:32.640
He's fine, but he makes the movies and I like to be on camera. Yeah, that's what

13:33.440 --> 13:38.960
Amir Seth Rogan said I'm doing the same thing. You guys don't see this shit the double standards that go around this office

Amir falls silent and starts staring at Marieka staring daggers is Casey said and nobody says anything

13:45.120 --> 13:47.120
Nobody says that what's wrong. I'm here

13:47.680 --> 13:50.240
I don't think you're staring at me. Fuck you guys

13:57.920 --> 14:04.160
Now you're looking at your phone. I'm pulling up a new set line that I'm just gonna cut this out. Grace cut this out

14:08.000 --> 14:17.840
Over 122 million under thick haze from Chicago to DC as Canadian wildfire smoke spreads across the US

14:18.400 --> 14:22.400
I know it. Is that happening again? Yeah, so

14:22.960 --> 14:27.920
There was like that time like three weeks ago where the sky was orange and it looked like it was raging

14:27.920 --> 14:33.760
And then it went away, but the fires were I've just still been there and the wind hasn't carried it south or something

14:34.320 --> 14:38.800
That I don't know but I did get that shit. I don't know

14:39.360 --> 14:43.200
Sorry, I was trying to hear the answer. Yeah, sorry, but I actually had a joke that Marieka stepped on

14:43.200 --> 14:45.200
I was gonna let it pass but yeah

14:46.080 --> 14:50.640
Marieka's work was fucking when you started the joke and she stepped on it

14:52.800 --> 15:04.000
Over 122 million under thick haze from Chicago. Is it bad again in New York? Is it the orange cloud? The smog is all that now. No, it's fine now my air quality alert currently

15:06.240 --> 15:08.880
Or the air quality is saying 36 which is good

15:09.680 --> 15:11.680
Really no

15:11.680 --> 15:15.840

16:32.960 --> 16:41.520
Over 122 million under thick haze from Chicago to DC as Canadian wildfire smoke spreads across U.S

16:42.640 --> 16:46.720

Let's get it started in

17:07.280 --> 17:10.160
We haven't done one of those in a long time and I thought we could get the energy up

17:10.160 --> 17:15.920
But clearly we have two old hags on the fucking thing as in what the man. Have a great summer

17:16.480 --> 17:18.480
These wildfires

An entire month

17:23.280 --> 17:27.520
It can't it on fire. That's the number one news headline from a month ago

17:29.120 --> 17:31.120
Oh, so you're a really long time

17:32.080 --> 17:37.840
No, he's just reading the news from a month ago. Oh, it's news from a month ago. No, that was actually today's top story

17:38.240 --> 17:40.240
I agree with you, but yeah

17:42.080 --> 17:44.080
Okay

17:44.560 --> 17:46.560
Do you guys see that?

17:47.440 --> 17:49.440
You guys hear about you

17:49.440 --> 17:52.880
We're still doing the monologue. This isn't a monologue. It's just interesting shit to talk

17:55.600 --> 17:58.080
No, did you see that sea crest is up the helm of wheel?

17:58.640 --> 18:01.360
Yeah, I didn't see this is news to me

18:01.440 --> 18:05.440
I feel like we didn't talk enough on yesterday's stream. Sorry if anybody missed it, but um

18:07.600 --> 18:12.320
We did like a fucking game show or whatever we did the quick flash and

18:15.920 --> 18:18.880
I thought you wanted to still talk about Ryan C.Crest

18:20.480 --> 18:22.480
And yes, too. I myself

18:23.440 --> 18:26.800
Vanna White. What's the joke? Oh, she is who?

18:27.600 --> 18:32.640
Vanna White H. So she's in the way. So the news is C.Crest is the host. Oh, yeah, we'll

18:32.640 --> 18:34.640
We'll work for you now. Yeah

18:35.920 --> 18:40.640
Also did you guys know that wheel of fortune is based off like a medieval torture device or something

18:41.440 --> 18:43.440
I think you're thinking of fire and maiden

18:43.840 --> 18:48.800
That's also a medieval tort this both you're thinking of the guillotine

18:49.760 --> 18:59.040
Catonine tales are you pulling up notes are you just scrolling on your phone now? I don't know

18:59.040 --> 19:01.040
I don't know what you guys want to fucking see for me anymore

19:03.680 --> 19:09.840
The breaking point just let me go through the shit that I get right over the fucking irons for it all right

19:11.040 --> 19:17.120
If I bring to a wax episode people are like you didn't prepare anything if I come with too much of an outline

19:17.200 --> 19:20.720
People are like we don't have any room to navigate this shit if I

19:22.400 --> 19:28.880
If I just take a backseat and let y'all go you guys are like Jeff you seem pissed. I'm sorry that my

19:29.440 --> 19:33.440
Silent speaks volumes. Is that what you want to hear? I have a

19:35.120 --> 19:41.120
Yeah, that's what I want to hear an ozampic song. Okay, so here we go nation. Oh

19:47.120 --> 19:49.120
I forgot I had to say that

19:50.480 --> 19:57.440
I hope there's at least one full out there who's watching this shit and being like wow

19:57.440 --> 19:59.440
I feel sorry for what Jeff actually asked

20:00.720 --> 20:04.240
They did say that after the live stream the 24 hour live stream a lot of people

20:06.240 --> 20:10.880
Did you get that by the way did you get the subpoena which one? I sorry. I'm suing grass

20:17.760 --> 20:19.760
That was easy

20:21.120 --> 20:24.560
Sorry, the the sounds are on the way continue, Marika

20:26.320 --> 20:28.320
Can I wet what?

20:28.640 --> 20:30.640
He said go back to the other

20:31.760 --> 20:33.760
It's hard

20:33.760 --> 20:35.760
This shit is hard

20:36.320 --> 20:41.440
Have you been like hitting any of the buttons on the switcher or are you just not doing that at all?

20:41.440 --> 20:45.920
I am but it's fucking like you know this is here goes to KC and I don't know when he's gonna stop

20:48.080 --> 20:50.080
Haha

20:50.480 --> 20:52.800
The fuck laugh was that that's not your real laugh

20:54.080 --> 20:57.920
Are you talking what you look at me? Yeah, are you looking?

21:01.040 --> 21:03.040
Here

21:06.480 --> 21:08.480
I feel

21:11.280 --> 21:15.840
Three Miami restaurants made the 50 top pizza USA 2023

21:18.000 --> 21:22.480
The 50 top pizza 2020. I read that verbatim

21:23.120 --> 21:28.080
I read that verbatim. There's a list of the top 50 pizzerias in American three of them are name

21:28.080 --> 21:34.320
So there's a list of digressions that you've scared us off course. I think that was absolutely on topic really

21:34.320 --> 21:40.880
Yeah, I was gonna say my sentence regardless of what you did right now that's sort of the crux of why you're not a good host

21:41.200 --> 21:43.200
This is interesting

21:43.520 --> 21:45.520
What

21:46.080 --> 21:48.080
Wordling

21:49.280 --> 21:56.080
Perk closer my dad bought me a new body for my 18 now addicted to surgery

21:58.000 --> 22:03.280
I do here yeah, now this is true Nicole Zavala didn't like how she looked

22:04.240 --> 22:10.160
So she sculpted a whole new body and has now spent over 160 euro on nip's tucks et cetera

22:10.480 --> 22:16.800
That's what you guys are good any little amount of money. Yeah, it's like a hundred and eighty dollars. Sorry 160,000 got it

22:18.800 --> 22:21.520
Would you guys ever do any work any any

22:23.120 --> 22:27.520
Everyone's entitled to do what they want with their own money. No, that's an opinion though. I'm saying for your ass

22:27.760 --> 22:34.880
What would you do if you were going to do anything to my ass specific two different questions one would you ever and then if so if yes, what would you do?

22:35.360 --> 22:41.200
Let's start with a mirror just because he probably has the most

22:43.040 --> 22:50.080
Well, he got LASIC LASIC is one yeah, that is elective surgery, but I don't know if it's invasive doesn't matter

22:51.680 --> 22:53.680
What do you mean it's not in face

22:55.920 --> 23:01.360
Stick like put lasers on your eyes? Well, they create a flap basically. I don't know about this what's that?

23:01.760 --> 23:08.160
Yeah, I know you get LASIC why are you right? Yeah, LASIC these are for UV blocking and blue light blocking glasses when I have

23:09.440 --> 23:13.680
Four five six screens in front of me. I don't want that all on my eyes

23:13.840 --> 23:17.920
Especially when they're extra sensitive because guess what with LASIC is is they make a small little incision

23:17.920 --> 23:21.600
And they create a flap they open up your fucking cornea and then they

23:22.960 --> 23:28.400
LASER off all the shit that's grown underneath the ocular surface that has made you sort of not

23:29.280 --> 23:31.280
C well

23:31.280 --> 23:37.120
There's a seven screen right behind you all. Yeah, but that's not going into or onto my eye

23:37.120 --> 23:41.920
But I think it might be reflecting off of the inside of your glasses into your eyes

23:44.560 --> 23:47.600
All right, you guys talk much yourselves. I have to sell something on off row

23:49.600 --> 23:54.480
What I'm trying to sell a bar. What is that man? What of so

23:54.960 --> 24:00.800
Just two dollars for a fucking six or a dial

24:01.520 --> 24:03.520
You guys talk amongst yourselves

24:04.960 --> 24:06.960
Those were my my lyrics

24:06.960 --> 24:08.320
Mika

24:08.320 --> 24:10.640
The as I'm picked song was going to be

24:13.120 --> 24:15.120
Now I can't even remember

24:17.520 --> 24:21.600
We got to figure this shit out guys. I can't put out your sauce. Yeah

24:22.240 --> 24:24.240

We've done it twice today. What'd you say? We've done it twice today. I actually have you eaten today

26:19.520 --> 26:21.520
The energy of someone is

26:21.680 --> 26:25.120
Caffeinated, but you haven't had anything in the gym carry back there

26:26.240 --> 26:28.240
He brought me closer

26:30.640 --> 26:32.640
Casey what'd you just say

26:33.200 --> 26:35.920
You're turning into Jim carry back there carry

26:37.200 --> 26:40.160
And uh, who's the carry of the four of us?

26:41.120 --> 26:43.440
What? Because I think I'm sort of a shark

26:44.480 --> 26:49.760
I've never watched an episode of the show so I don't know what their characteristics are individually

26:50.480 --> 26:56.960
Me neither, but I think you've never seen such an Andrew carry up the four of us Jeff

26:57.280 --> 27:00.080
Do you think the droop that you think Drew carry is a true carry?

27:01.120 --> 27:03.120
Yeah, a libertarian ass

27:10.160 --> 27:12.720
And the biggest dumb ass award goes to

27:13.840 --> 27:15.840
Michelle

27:16.800 --> 27:18.800
What

27:18.800 --> 27:20.800
Why

27:21.200 --> 27:27.040
What do you mean why there has to be a better way to do this right? Why are we like setting up?

27:27.040 --> 27:29.040
No, it has nothing to do with this

27:30.240 --> 27:32.240
I didn't know that

27:32.240 --> 27:34.720
What did you say that she was a dumb anything

27:34.720 --> 27:39.280
I'm sure she was a dumb ass

27:39.280 --> 27:42.480
I'm sure you were a little self-conscious because now I'm starting to look like the ass

27:42.480 --> 27:44.160
Right, right, yeah

27:44.960 --> 27:46.960
Let me ask you guys a question

27:47.360 --> 27:50.400
How much do you know like Jim carry about the old

27:50.400 --> 27:52.400
Let me tell you I taught that

27:55.680 --> 27:57.680
Somebody stop me show

27:59.920 --> 28:04.400
I don't know we have ad packages this show has to go on

28:04.480 --> 28:06.960
And I'm not saying that the show must go on, you know

28:07.520 --> 28:13.040
I'm saying the show existed at least for another half a year until we finish out the ad packages

28:13.040 --> 28:18.160
If you've got gripes with the producer's desk, you could bring it up with me and on

28:18.160 --> 28:19.520
Yeah, and leave for shell

28:19.520 --> 28:24.080
You guys out though you guys are my friends. I don't know reshell. I know reshell

28:24.880 --> 28:26.880
Yeah, okay

28:26.880 --> 28:28.880
Why do you look so solving?

28:28.880 --> 28:32.880
I don't want you making fun of freelancers either. I am a freelancer either

28:35.200 --> 28:38.560

28:47.200 --> 28:50.480
Oh, it's not that long if you make it interesting. Here we go

28:51.520 --> 28:56.800
Seven minutes. Yeah. Oh, and there's a countdown time

28:58.000 --> 29:01.600
Which is you're eating into your own time actually. I guess it's not a countdown

29:02.240 --> 29:04.240
This is this is counting up

29:05.120 --> 29:07.120
Fair enough

29:08.480 --> 29:11.200
Can you see do you want to come see Barbie with us?

There's Comic Con traffic going down and it's also during a weekday. So there's like regular regular LA to San Diego

30:34.400 --> 30:37.200
Actually, you have to drive down at 4 a.m

30:38.000 --> 30:43.680
Look, that's just a number off the top of my head. I'm in producer mode now and I want to be able to get there

Oh my god

32:55.600 --> 32:57.600

33:01.200 --> 33:03.200
There's so many questions

33:03.200 --> 33:09.360
I mean, so let's get through them all right, Marika's brothers was a failure. Let's say by the way

33:09.840 --> 33:15.200
Yeah, it's been this yeah, I mean, let's just go back and forth. I guess asking questions one

33:16.800 --> 33:18.800
Why did you do that?

33:18.800 --> 33:24.400
It was for an audition that was for an audition. Yeah, for what it's like a character thing

33:24.960 --> 33:30.880
What care was holding the audition that was a character? Yes, really but don't think of the what

33:32.240 --> 33:38.720
That was really but donka the Willy Wonka of King. Okay, so you did that for an audition and you can't tell us what it was for

33:38.800 --> 33:44.160
But you can show it to I didn't show it to you to reference the audition. I showed it to you because I was proud of it

33:44.160 --> 33:47.680
How many other characters did you do that was the only one I could figure out

33:48.240 --> 33:51.280
You your entire audition was that figure out

33:52.000 --> 33:56.960
Did you buy an outfit for that or did you piece together? That cost me like $250

33:57.520 --> 34:02.800
Were you wearing anything you return anything you can because I didn't work without yeah, yeah

34:03.040 --> 34:04.560
Underwear

34:04.560 --> 34:07.360
So you still have those clobings sure

34:09.680 --> 34:14.160
What did this have to do with you not showing up for two pit wall recordings?

34:14.160 --> 34:18.080
I thought that if I showed you guys that that you wouldn't circle back to the

34:19.040 --> 34:23.200
Is that what you were working on you did to do it circle back, so yeah

34:23.200 --> 34:26.240
Is that what you're working on that while we were recorded the pit wall?

34:26.240 --> 34:29.600
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you're also supposed to come in to record it

34:29.600 --> 34:33.200
I didn't know I deliberately missed the pit wall by accident

34:33.840 --> 34:39.360
But yeah, I would also like to say that Jeff picked the time that we would record. That's not true

34:39.920 --> 34:43.520
That I will absolutely be there. I did say I would absolutely be there, but I didn't choose the time

34:43.520 --> 34:47.760
I would never do that you agreed to the time that we said also on Monday

34:48.560 --> 34:53.600
Yeah, Monday. I was in my eye Monday in action. Yeah, so I was too busy for your you were supposed to be here

34:53.600 --> 34:57.520
We were supposed to record in studio. No, you did try to record on nobody. I was just we on zoom

34:58.000 --> 35:03.680
And you're recording this instead the video the singing repeat. I don't think I know what you're talking about

35:03.680 --> 35:07.520
You're talking about will you been on? Yeah, yeah, of course

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
The only also do you want to say that

35:10.640 --> 35:14.240
There is literally a calendar invite that Jeff you did

35:15.280 --> 35:19.120
Accept that says the had compact us recording in studio on Monday

35:20.160 --> 35:22.160
Yeah, and of America's brothers, so

35:22.240 --> 35:24.560
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

35:24.720 --> 35:28.800
I've only got a little detail though, but that's gonna be all right we're gonna write the core Smack with another

35:29.360 --> 35:32.680
Hit of right, the horse bridge stuff, which is called

35:35.440 --> 35:40.840
People with giant two diabetes are excited when do you find out about the odis lossless? I'm never gonna get the job

35:41.040 --> 35:44.000
Not gonna get it they know that you are auditioning for it

35:44.400 --> 35:48.180
They probably won't watch the audition because of the strike. I don't care

35:48.180 --> 35:54.180
You don't care that they'll watch the audition.

35:54.180 --> 35:58.180
I don't particularly care because what we just did made it all worth it to me.

35:58.180 --> 35:59.180
I said, yeah.

35:59.180 --> 36:05.180
And you did see what I was going to say before the fucking ad break is that I want to write

36:05.180 --> 36:08.180
a thesis about old Babylon or old Cairo.

36:08.180 --> 36:11.180
Basically like ancient cities and why I should have been a part of them.

36:11.180 --> 36:14.180
You want to write a thesis.

36:14.180 --> 36:19.180
Can't you guys ever just be like, oh, wow.

36:19.180 --> 36:20.180
Good idea.

36:20.180 --> 36:22.180
I like this idea.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.180
Thank you.

36:23.180 --> 36:24.180
I just want to visit good.

36:24.180 --> 36:25.180
I will say it.

36:25.180 --> 36:27.180
Like when do you go back to school?

36:27.180 --> 36:28.180
No.

36:28.180 --> 36:30.180
I want to write it and present it on this show.

36:30.180 --> 36:31.180
Okay.

36:31.180 --> 36:32.180
Then do us.

36:32.180 --> 36:33.180

36:33.180 --> 36:34.180
I'm just trying to like hold myself accountable.

36:34.180 --> 36:35.180
And you guys.

36:35.180 --> 36:36.180
What do we have to do?

36:36.180 --> 36:37.180
Good.

36:41.180 --> 36:42.180
Another is don't again.

36:42.180 --> 36:43.180
No.

36:43.180 --> 36:44.180
Let's get us out.

36:44.180 --> 36:45.180
But it's you reading your thesis.

36:45.180 --> 36:46.180
Okay.

36:46.180 --> 36:47.180
Not two months.

36:47.180 --> 36:48.180
Three.

36:48.180 --> 36:49.180
I need three because guess what?

36:49.180 --> 36:50.180
It's the fucking summer.

36:50.180 --> 36:51.180
All right.

36:51.180 --> 36:54.180
I'm not going to spend my whole summer writing and working on your thesis.

36:54.180 --> 36:55.180
Yeah.

36:55.180 --> 36:56.180
And why do you then?

36:56.180 --> 36:57.180
Why are you interested?

36:57.180 --> 36:58.180
I am interested.

36:58.180 --> 36:59.180
You don't want to do it.

36:59.180 --> 37:00.180
You want to do it in the fall semester.

37:00.180 --> 37:01.180
I would like to do it in the fall semester.

37:01.180 --> 37:02.180
The fall term.

37:02.180 --> 37:05.180
It might be good quarters.

37:05.180 --> 37:10.180
So I kind of think in like September two December.

37:11.180 --> 37:12.180
Why?

37:19.180 --> 37:20.180

37:46.180 --> 37:48.180

37:48.180 --> 37:49.180
What do you want to point the people to.

37:49.180 --> 37:53.180
Let's start with Kacy and then we'll end the show.

37:53.180 --> 37:55.180
Yeah, listen to this shit.

37:55.180 --> 37:58.180
And this fuck, we need softer chairs.

37:58.180 --> 37:59.180

It's a podcast that me and Marica do and pile as also a pretty good cohost.

38:04.180 --> 38:07.180
And Jeff never shows up and always promises that he will.

38:07.180 --> 38:09.920
That's like my mid-year resolution.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.560
One is this episode come out this week.

38:11.560 --> 38:13.700
This one might get shit canned entirely.

Okay.

38:14.700 --> 38:16.700
A week from Friday.

Great lineup.

38:26.420 --> 38:28.700
So do that.

38:28.700 --> 38:32.180
Go to the pit wall, follow me.

38:32.180 --> 38:35.740

39:16.780 --> 39:18.500
There's a lot of action on that one day.

39:18.500 --> 39:20.060
Every time I hear about something happening,

39:20.060 --> 39:20.900

39:20.900 --> 39:22.620
It's going to be a stacked day.

I'm still there at Blumenfeld.

39:48.380 --> 39:50.820

39:50.820 --> 39:54.460
I'm a white get the invite to that.

39:54.460 --> 39:57.500
And yeah,

39:57.500 --> 40:00.500
listen to the hadgum podcast on a

40:01.700 --> 40:03.500
podcast or overcaster,

40:03.500 --> 40:05.020
where we listen Spotify.

40:06.940 --> 40:08.300
Watch on YouTube.

40:08.300 --> 40:09.500
Watch this, I need to.

40:10.500 --> 40:10.900
Death.

40:16.020 --> 40:16.740
I don't know.

40:19.820 --> 40:21.180
Well, it's what's up.

40:21.180 --> 40:22.180
It's wrong.

40:22.180 --> 40:23.180
The wise.

40:23.180 --> 40:25.220
I guess I'm just am like getting a wall with the shit.

40:25.820 --> 40:30.820
He's he gets so upset when other people are talking for a while.

40:30.820 --> 40:33.020
No, it's not that you were talking.

40:33.020 --> 40:34.660
It's that like the flow isn't good.

40:34.660 --> 40:35.580
It's not fast.

40:35.580 --> 40:36.820
It's not overlapping.

40:38.820 --> 40:39.820
You think that's good.

40:39.820 --> 40:41.620
People talk over each other.

40:41.620 --> 40:42.460
It's good for audio.

40:42.460 --> 40:44.740
Thanks a lot about you.

40:44.740 --> 40:47.020
I like the tone we've taken.

40:47.020 --> 40:49.780
They kind of it's kind of drying things to a close.

40:49.780 --> 40:54.100
It feels kind of like people just kind of like catching up with each other.

40:54.100 --> 40:56.100
Yeah, it feels kind of, yeah,

40:56.100 --> 40:57.300
congenial.

40:57.300 --> 40:58.660
I think at some point, Jeff,

40:58.660 --> 41:03.100
you should try to make yourself cry on this podcast.

41:03.100 --> 41:04.100
Yeah.

41:04.100 --> 41:05.700
Let's see.

41:05.700 --> 41:08.340
You can cry on on on on on.

41:08.340 --> 41:09.700
I don't think so.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.340
Let's see if you can cry right now.

41:11.340 --> 41:12.700
Go to a really dark place, right?

41:12.700 --> 41:15.420
Yeah, should we all see if we can cry?

41:15.420 --> 41:16.420
I'm not going to be able to do it.

41:16.420 --> 41:17.500
Your eyes are too dry.

41:17.500 --> 41:18.900
Yeah, chronic condition.

41:18.900 --> 41:19.740
Yep.

41:19.740 --> 41:20.580
How are you?

41:20.580 --> 41:23.220
How are you going to be being cast in a major motion picture?

41:23.220 --> 41:24.620
If you can't cry, I can't.

41:24.620 --> 41:25.980
I don't want to do drama.

41:25.980 --> 41:27.580
I don't want to do comedy.

41:27.580 --> 41:28.420
What do you want to do?

41:28.420 --> 41:29.420
What do you want to do?

41:29.420 --> 41:30.420
Action.

41:30.420 --> 41:31.420
I want to get a bunch of money.

41:31.420 --> 41:32.420
Right.

41:32.420 --> 41:33.420
Right.

41:33.420 --> 41:35.420
This is not even about the fact of getting.

41:35.420 --> 41:37.020
It's like making the last.

41:37.020 --> 41:42.020
And the fucking episode.

41:42.020 --> 42:01.420
That was a hit dumb original.

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.960
Guys, you know what my problem with edibles is?

00:09.960 --> 00:14.560
I mean, sometimes you just get way too high, right?

00:14.560 --> 00:19.220
It could be difficult to control, to dose it right, and there's nothing worse than being

00:19.220 --> 00:22.400
baked out of your mind when you didn't plan on it.

00:22.400 --> 00:26.160
And you know, once you eat it, there's no going back.

00:26.160 --> 00:31.080
You just sit there, suffering, stoned out of your mind, and that's why when I need the

00:31.080 --> 00:38.640
perfect medium high, I hit my friends at Diet's smoke for their delicious Delta 8 THC gummies.

00:38.640 --> 00:41.160
Diet's smoke isn't light, it's just right.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.880
So what exactly is Delta 8?

00:42.880 --> 00:46.680
Well, Delta 8 is simply a less potent THC.

00:46.680 --> 00:51.040
The THC that you're probably familiar with is Delta 9, and while both are natural to

00:51.040 --> 00:55.560
the cannabis plant, Diet's smoke extracts their Delta 8 from hemp.

00:55.560 --> 00:59.760
To make all this a loophole, I call it the secret recipe to getting a smooth, stable,

00:59.760 --> 01:03.040
and most importantly, legal high.

01:03.040 --> 01:06.080
Diet's smoke is legal in most states, and it's non-prescription, just check Diet's

01:06.080 --> 01:09.920
smoke's website to see if they ship their delicious gummies to your state.

01:09.920 --> 01:13.480
Now you're probably asking yourself, does Diet's smoke really get you high?

01:13.480 --> 01:15.000
Of course!

01:15.000 --> 01:18.960
The high you get with Diet's smoke is best described as somewhere between the chillness

01:18.960 --> 01:23.320
of CBD and that classic stone feeling you get with regular weed.

01:23.320 --> 01:27.480
Plus, Diet's smoke comes in two delicious flavors, blue raspberry and watermelon.

01:27.480 --> 01:33.480
I like blue raspberry, I've always been a blue raspberry head, but Marika can't get enough

01:33.480 --> 01:34.480
of the watermelon.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.840
I say try them both.

01:35.840 --> 01:40.480
So when CBD isn't enough, and traditional THC is too much, enjoy the smooth buzz

01:40.480 --> 01:42.440
of Diet's smoke.

01:42.440 --> 01:47.720
Each gummy is infused with 10 milligrams of Delta 8 THC drive from American grown hemp,

01:47.720 --> 01:51.640
and you know what they say by American, get high with American.

01:51.640 --> 01:55.680
Delta 8 gummies are low in sugar, fat free, and delicious, and did I mention their

01:55.680 --> 01:56.680
legal?

Thanks Diet's smoke.

02:39.640 --> 02:47.240
Hearts Kindred by Zona Gail, chapter 1, a hud of bark thatched with palm leaves, a gigantic

02:47.240 --> 02:54.120
rock at whose base lay old ashes, an open grassy space bordering a narrow mountain stream,

02:54.120 --> 02:56.240
and a little garden.

02:56.240 --> 03:01.400
These made the home of the anger, where a man might live and die as a man was meant.

03:01.400 --> 03:06.160
Neither planning like a maniac nor yet idling like an idiot, but well content with what

03:06.160 --> 03:08.440
the day brought forth.

03:08.440 --> 03:12.520
Toward a June sunset, the anger sat outside his doorway, fashioning a bowl from half

03:12.520 --> 03:14.160
a turtle shell.

03:14.160 --> 03:18.120
Lower him the ground sloped to the edge of the garden, and beyond dropped to the clearing

03:18.120 --> 03:19.600
edge.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.880
When he lifted his eyes, he could look for miles along thick tops of live oaks and

03:23.880 --> 03:29.040
lurches, and beyond, to a white line of western sea.

03:29.040 --> 03:34.440
At his back rose the foothills, cleft by canyons, yet quite freshly green.

03:34.440 --> 03:38.960
Above them the monstrous mountains swept the sky, and hear their flanks were shaggy, with

03:38.960 --> 03:40.760
great pines.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.640
The whole lay now in that glory of clear yellow by which the west gives to the evening

03:44.640 --> 03:47.840
some hint of a desert ancestry.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.480
The anger worked in silence.

03:49.480 --> 03:52.880
He was not a man to sing or whistle.

03:52.880 --> 03:55.600
Those who live alone are seldom whistling men.

03:55.600 --> 04:00.840
Perhaps the silence becomes something definite, and not lightly to be shattered.

04:00.840 --> 04:06.360
A man camping alone will work away quietly day long, and his dog understands.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.800
The anger had no dog anymore.

04:08.800 --> 04:12.320
He had owned a wolf-hound whom, in a fit of passion, he had kicked so that the dog

04:12.320 --> 04:16.800
had died, and such was his remorse that he would own no other.

04:16.800 --> 04:21.440
And the sight of another man's dog pulled at him as at an old wound.

04:21.440 --> 04:25.680
It was so still that presently in that clear air, the sound of a bell in the valley came

04:25.680 --> 04:30.400
up to him with distinctness, he looked to the south, and in a deep place in the trees

04:30.400 --> 04:35.480
already lights twinkled out as if they liked the bells, would announce something.

04:35.480 --> 04:41.800
The anger remembered and understood, he said aloud, the wedding.

04:41.800 --> 04:46.000
He went on, scraping at his turtle shell, his mind on the man who would be married that

04:46.000 --> 04:50.360
night, early so that there would be ample time for much merry-making and drunkenness before

04:50.360 --> 04:52.760
the eastbound train at midnight.

04:52.760 --> 04:57.480
Bunchy Hate was the man, the owner of the rundown in in the village of Inch.

04:57.480 --> 05:01.720
The woman was the more girl, whose father abetted by the anger himself had killed a

05:01.720 --> 05:06.040
sheriff or two for interfering with his gambling place, and had gone free, because no one

05:06.040 --> 05:10.000
was sure whether it was he or the anger who did the shooting.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
Moors' promissory notes had been accumulating in the hands of Bunchy Hate for a dozen years,

05:15.000 --> 05:18.320
and it was no secret that the wedding settled the long score.

05:18.320 --> 05:22.360
And in dead good luck to get a provider like Bunchy, the morgue girl is, was the way the

05:22.360 --> 05:27.080
Inch took it, inch welcomed a wedding, and the old days it had been different and nobody

05:27.080 --> 05:29.160
cared whether anybody had a wedding or not.

05:29.160 --> 05:32.960
More than there had been a race track at Inch and a summer hotel and a fine glass front

05:32.960 --> 05:36.200
showing of saloons and other magnificence.

05:36.200 --> 05:39.640
With the passing of the California law the track had been closed, the resort keeper

05:39.640 --> 05:43.280
said moved away and the bottom had fallen from Inch.

05:43.280 --> 05:47.000
Mothers amused their children by telling of the traps and the foreign hands and the tally

05:47.000 --> 05:51.840
hose with rocking horns, and the galey dressed strangers who used to throng the town for

05:51.840 --> 05:57.680
a fortnight in spring and an autumn, when Inch knew no night and no darkness and no silence,

05:57.680 --> 05:59.680
and abundantly prospered.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.680
Now all this was changed.

06:01.680 --> 06:05.560
There were literally no excitements, saved shootings and weddings.

06:05.560 --> 06:09.600
Gemmore being supposed to have achieved to share of the former was prepared further to

06:09.600 --> 06:14.120
adorn his position by setting up drinks for the whole village and all strangers to celebrate

06:14.120 --> 06:16.440
his daughter's an uptrulde.

06:16.440 --> 06:21.320
These things the anger turned over in his mind as he scraped away at his shell, and when

06:21.320 --> 06:26.080
the dark nearly fallen he rose, shook out from the shell the last fragments polished

06:26.080 --> 06:30.840
it with his elbow, balanced it between his hands to regard it, and came to his conclusion.

06:30.840 --> 06:35.400
Oh, he said again, I'm busted if I don't go to it.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.800
The next instant he laid down the shell, slipped to his door and caught up the gun that lay

06:38.800 --> 06:41.720
inside on a shelf of the rude scantling.

06:41.720 --> 06:46.240
A wood duck had appeared over the lower treetops, flying languagely to its nest somewhere

06:46.240 --> 06:47.680
in the foothills.

06:47.680 --> 06:51.560
Long before it reached the woods edge, the anger was in his doorway.

06:51.560 --> 06:55.200
The birds have a flight ledge straight across the clearing.

06:55.200 --> 06:59.200
In moment the big body came sailing above the hut, then it seemed to go out and it doesn't

06:59.200 --> 07:02.960
ugly angles and dropped like a stone to the edge of the garden.

07:02.960 --> 07:06.000
It lay fluttering strongly when the anger reached it.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.600
He lifted and examined it approvingly.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.040
One wing was shot almost clear of the body.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.200
That was the mark he liked to make.

07:13.200 --> 07:18.320
He swung the bird under his arm, took out his jackknife, pried open the mouth, slipped the

07:18.320 --> 07:22.760
long tongue, tied the feet together, and hung it outside his door to bleed to death.

07:22.760 --> 07:26.000
His death he had heard, improved the flavor.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.600
Without washing his hands, he prepared his supper.

07:28.600 --> 07:33.760
Salt pork and bacon fried together, corn cakes soaked in the gravy and coffee.

07:33.760 --> 07:36.840
The fire glowed in the hollow of the great rock and the smell of the cooking crept

07:36.840 --> 07:37.840
about.

07:37.840 --> 07:41.160
The anger was almost ready to eat by the clear light of the transparent sky when he saw

07:41.160 --> 07:43.440
a figure coming across the clearing.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.000
He leapt for his rifle.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.760
Since the last sheriff had been shot, he was never perfectly at ease with any stranger.

07:48.760 --> 07:52.840
Up before his hand had closed, it relaxed at the sound of a triple whistle.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.680
He wheeled and looked again.

07:54.680 --> 07:57.920
The stranger had almost reached the burn of the fire light.

07:57.920 --> 08:01.240
Blast my bones and blast me, cried the anger.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.000
Dad!

08:03.000 --> 08:06.880
Something deep and big had come in his voice, as the two men met in shook hands that

08:06.880 --> 08:09.160
was a gladness in them both.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.240
They moved apart in a minute.

08:11.240 --> 08:15.360
The anger took the pack, which the older man swung off, and went about cutting more salt

08:15.360 --> 08:17.040
pork and bacon.

08:17.040 --> 08:23.800
His father found the wash basin, his father found the wash basin, and washed, breathing

08:23.800 --> 08:26.560
noisily through the water cupped in his hands.

08:26.560 --> 08:30.400
Not much was said, but anyone would have known that the two were glad of the moment.

08:30.400 --> 08:35.600
Not much grub, said his father, and grub hungry, and flung himself on the ground before

08:35.600 --> 08:36.600
the campfire.

08:36.600 --> 08:41.360
Now, I'm dead, beat, my bones ache, he added.

08:41.360 --> 08:45.480
The anger filled his father's plate and went on frying the meat, and the fire light

08:45.480 --> 08:47.360
their faces looked alike.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.680
The older man's skin was beginning to draw tightly, showing the rugged modeling of the

08:51.680 --> 08:53.040
thick bones.

08:53.040 --> 08:56.440
His huge hands looked loose and ineffectual.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.800
Something welled up and flooded the anger when he saw his father's hand tremble as he

08:59.800 --> 09:01.880
lifted his tin cup.

09:01.880 --> 09:06.440
Larger in scale, more definite and drawing, and triumphantly younger the anger was, brown

09:06.440 --> 09:09.440
skinned and leveled eye, and deep chested.

09:09.440 --> 09:13.840
His naked veined right arm grasping the handle of the skillet as if it were a battering

09:13.840 --> 09:15.240
ram.

09:15.240 --> 09:19.720
When the anger registered in the inn at inch were signed to check in his bank in the city,

09:19.720 --> 09:24.240
his pen bit through the paper like acid, because he did everything as if his tool were

09:24.240 --> 09:26.080
a battering ram.

09:26.080 --> 09:30.760
But his eyes, as they rested now on his father's hand, the tremble were soft and mute,

09:30.760 --> 09:32.640
like a dog's eyes.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.040
What kind of luck, Dad?

09:34.040 --> 09:38.800
He said, the older man looked across his wooden platter and smiled whimsically.

09:38.800 --> 09:39.960
Same kind?

09:39.960 --> 09:40.960
He answered.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.960
None, but look at here, Sonny.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.960
He added, I found out something.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.960
I bet you, Dad, said the anger.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.560
I ain't ever going to have any luck, said the old man.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.160
I'm done for.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.760
I'm done.

09:55.760 --> 09:59.160
A year or two more, and I'll be spated in.

09:59.160 --> 10:04.760
It's the darkest, funniest feeling, he said, musingly, to get onto it that you're all in.

10:04.760 --> 10:06.560
A back number.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.160
I got a quit plan in it, not on your life.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.920
The anger began, but his father roared at him and shut up.

10:11.920 --> 10:15.440
He said, fondly, you dang'd runt you.

10:15.440 --> 10:18.160
You must've noted for two years back.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.160
No nothing.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.160
I said the anger stoutly.

10:21.160 --> 10:24.840
The older man put his plate on the ground and laid down beside it, his head on his hand.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.800
And it's a devil of a feel.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.240
He said, don't feel it.

10:29.240 --> 10:30.520
Said the anger.

10:30.520 --> 10:31.520
Cut it.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.960
Said his father almost sternly.

10:32.960 --> 10:37.480
I brought you up to kill a man if you have to, but not lie to a man, eh?

10:37.480 --> 10:40.440
Well, don't you lie to me now.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.480
The anger was silent, and his father went on.

10:43.480 --> 10:48.920
I was always so dead sure, he said, that I was cut out to be rich.

10:48.920 --> 10:52.160
When I was a kid in the tainery, I was dead sure.

10:52.160 --> 10:56.120
When I hit the trail for the mines, I thought the time was right ahead, and that was

10:56.120 --> 10:58.000
50 years ago.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Quit dead.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.480
Said the anger uncomfortably.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.480
I've got it.

11:01.480 --> 11:02.480
What's the difference?

11:02.480 --> 11:06.560
The flagpole is good for all either of us that'll ever want.

11:06.560 --> 11:10.480
I forgot, though, said the older man quickly, that you banked on the flagpole, getting my

11:10.480 --> 11:11.480
advice.

11:11.480 --> 11:16.920
If you done it, as I said, you'd be grubbing yet, same as me, and it's all luck, said the

11:16.920 --> 11:17.920
anger.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.280
What can anybody tell?

11:19.280 --> 11:24.480
We're getting the stuff, and there's a long sight more than we need, ain't that enough?

11:24.480 --> 11:28.720
When you want to wear yourself out for, his father leaned against the end of the warm

11:28.720 --> 11:32.720
rock, and lighted his pipe, and did I say I wanted to?

11:32.720 --> 11:33.720
He asked.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.400
I'd done it so long, I can't help myself.

11:36.400 --> 11:41.040
I'll be scamming how deals, and being led in on the ground floor, and finding a sure

11:41.040 --> 11:45.400
thing till I croak, and getting took in, regular.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.280
He regarded his son curiously.

11:47.280 --> 11:51.080
What you're going to do with your pile, he inquired.

11:51.080 --> 11:55.120
The anger sat, clasping his knees, looking up at the height of white face, thick black

11:55.120 --> 11:57.080
in the thin darkness.

11:57.080 --> 12:01.760
His face was relaxed, and there was a boyishness, and a sweetness, and his grave mouth.

12:01.760 --> 12:02.760
Nothing.

12:02.760 --> 12:10.280
He said, till I get the pool to leave here, to leave inch, said his father incredulously,

12:10.280 --> 12:11.600
to leave here.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.480
The anger repeated, throwing out his arm to the wood.

12:14.480 --> 12:17.640
This is good enough for me for a while yet.

12:17.640 --> 12:21.160
I thought maybe the society down there said his father with a jerk of his head, the

12:21.160 --> 12:24.560
lights in the valley, was given you some call to sit by.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.480
The anger sprang up, so it is.

12:27.480 --> 12:32.040
He said, tonight, bunch is getting spliced.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.880
He was the antagonist, said the other.

12:34.880 --> 12:39.880
The more girl said the anger, lunges a fine lot to draw, he added, she's too good a hand

12:39.880 --> 12:40.880
for him.

12:40.880 --> 12:43.640
I want to go down and see if it pulled off, he asked.

12:43.640 --> 12:48.120
His father hesitated, looking down to the valley, to the humble sparkling of inch.

12:48.120 --> 12:52.720
Ah, I don't reckon I really won't get drunk tonight, he said slowly.

12:52.720 --> 12:55.960
Ah, I'll save up till I do.

12:55.960 --> 13:00.520
The anger stretched, prodigously, bunching his great shoulders, lifting his tense arms,

13:00.520 --> 13:02.520
bearing their magnificent muscles.

13:02.520 --> 13:07.720
Ah, I got it, I guess, he said, but gosh, how I hate it.

13:07.720 --> 13:12.760
He carried the remnants of the food into the hut and made a simple preparation for festivity.

13:12.760 --> 13:16.280
As he emerged, he was arrested by a faint stirring and fluttering.

13:16.280 --> 13:20.160
He listened and it was near at hand, and then he saw the wood duck, writhing at the

13:20.160 --> 13:25.040
end of the string that bound its legs, beneath it lay a little dark pool.

13:25.040 --> 13:29.520
No sense and bleedin' all the good out of you, thought the anger, and with the butt of

13:29.520 --> 13:34.320
the six shooter, he thought he was pocketing, he struck the bird a friendly blow on the head,

13:34.320 --> 13:36.600
and stilled it.

13:36.600 --> 13:40.600
The forest lay in premature night, save where a little mountain broke caught and treasure

13:40.600 --> 13:42.240
the dying daylight.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.960
It was immensely still.

13:43.960 --> 13:47.280
The anger's tread and brushing at the thickest silence would ever move men of tiny

13:47.280 --> 13:49.840
life had been stirring before him.

13:49.840 --> 13:54.720
The trail wound for half a mile down the incline, and the never broken growth.

13:54.720 --> 13:58.320
Once in the preceding winter, when the flagpole mine was at last known with certain

13:58.320 --> 14:02.560
data be the sensation of the year, the anger had soowed out a neat sum in the lining of

14:02.560 --> 14:05.800
his coat and a gondon-spec San Francisco.

14:05.800 --> 14:10.200
He had wanted to see a library, and he saw one, and stood baffled among the books of which

14:10.200 --> 14:15.240
he had never heard, stammering before a polite young woman who said, make out your card,

14:15.240 --> 14:19.800
please over there, and presented at the further desk.

14:19.800 --> 14:24.040
He had wanted to see an art gallery, and he went confused among alien shapes and nameless

14:24.040 --> 14:28.600
figures, and had obediently bought a catalog of which he made nothing.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.960
Then he had gondon dinner with the family of one of the stockholders, and had suffered

14:31.960 --> 14:35.520
anguish among slipping rugs and ambiguous silver.

14:35.520 --> 14:40.120
The next night, the new collar and Kravat discarded, he had turned up in one of his old

14:40.120 --> 14:44.760
haunts on the barbary coast, on his experience he made only one comment, and they

14:44.760 --> 14:50.200
know too damn much, and there's too damn much they don't know, he said, but the woods

14:50.200 --> 14:54.680
he understood, all that he had hoped to feel in the library and the art gallery and in

14:54.680 --> 15:00.360
that home he felt when the woods had him, out there he was his own man.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.720
As he went he shouted out a roaring music hall song.

15:03.720 --> 15:07.960
Then when he had ceased as if he became conscious of some in congruity, he stood still,

15:07.960 --> 15:11.480
perhaps with some vague idea of restoring silence.

15:11.480 --> 15:16.200
In a moment he heard something move in the tree above his head, an anxious chip chip

15:16.200 --> 15:21.000
in the leaves, as if some soft breasts were beating in fear, and an inquiring head

15:21.000 --> 15:23.320
were poised listening.

15:23.320 --> 15:27.240
Instantly he lifted his revolver and fired and fired again.

15:27.240 --> 15:28.880
He heard nothing.

15:28.880 --> 15:32.760
Had anything fallen he could certainly not have come upon it next day, it was the need to

15:32.760 --> 15:34.800
do something.

15:34.800 --> 15:39.320
As he cleared the wood, the lights of the town lay sparkling in a cup of the desert.

15:39.320 --> 15:43.000
At sight of them there was something that he wanted to do, or to be.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.200
The vastness of the sky, the nearness of the stars, the immanence of people, these possessed

15:48.200 --> 15:49.680
him.

15:49.680 --> 15:54.880
He caught off his cap and broken to a run, tossing back his hair like a man, damn that little

15:54.880 --> 16:03.040
town, damn it, damn it, he chanted, like an invocation to the desert, and to the night.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.120
Our next sponsor has a product I literally use every day.

16:06.120 --> 16:11.320
Guys, I started taking athletic greens because I was before popping a bunch of different

16:11.320 --> 16:15.480
pills and supplements, and it was really expensive, it was really inconvenient, I was

16:15.480 --> 16:19.240
at a certain point doing like 20 pills in the morning, and that's just too much, but now

16:19.240 --> 16:23.080
I get it all from AG1, the drink from athletic greens.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.440
So what is this stuff?

16:24.440 --> 16:29.320
With one delicious scoop of athletic greens, you're absorbing 75 high quality, vitamins,

16:29.320 --> 16:33.400
minerals, whole foods, or superfoods, probiotics, and adaptogens to help start your day

16:33.400 --> 16:34.400
right.

16:34.400 --> 16:38.000
This special blend of ingredients supports your gut health, your nervous system, your immune

16:38.040 --> 16:41.960
system, your energy, recovery, focus, and aging, all the things.

16:41.960 --> 16:46.320
I wake up, I have my water, you know, just a glass of water, and then I have math,

16:46.320 --> 16:49.800
let it greens, and then I wait an hour, and then I have my coffee, and it just gets me

16:49.800 --> 16:53.960
started on the day, exactly how I want to.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.680
It benefits my energy, all right?

16:55.680 --> 17:01.280
I have sleep issues, not apnea, but issues, and it helps give me, I don't know, a boost

17:01.280 --> 17:03.760
of energy that feels different than just caffeine.

17:03.760 --> 17:07.120
The taste I would say is very mild, but if anything, I think it's kind of like a bubble

17:07.120 --> 17:11.520
gum flavor, I've said this a lot, but I don't know, it tastes good, and there's no artificial

17:11.520 --> 17:12.920
anything in it.

17:12.920 --> 17:18.160
It's lifestyle friendly, whether you eat keto, paleo, vegan, dairy, flea, or gluten-free,

17:18.160 --> 17:22.640
and it contains less than 1 gram of sugar, no GMOs, no nasty chemicals, or artificial

17:22.640 --> 17:25.120
anything, while again, still tasting good.

17:25.120 --> 17:29.560
It's also supports better sleep quality and recovery, mental clarity, and alertness, and

17:29.560 --> 17:31.360
it's the one thing with the best things.

17:31.360 --> 17:34.880
Athletic greens uses the best of the best products based on the latest science with constant

17:34.880 --> 17:37.840
product iteration and third party testing.

17:37.840 --> 17:41.880
Athletic greens was created by the way, when the founder experienced a ton of gut health

17:41.880 --> 17:45.360
issues, and ended up on a complicated supplement routine to recover.

17:45.360 --> 17:49.720
That cost him over $100 a day, so he created athletic greens after experiencing how difficult

17:49.720 --> 17:52.160
it was to create an optimal nutrition routine on your own.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.160
I was in the same spot.

17:53.160 --> 17:57.120
I mean, maybe not $100 a day, but way more than I wanted to be spending, and now I get

17:57.120 --> 17:58.960
it all from athletic greens.

17:58.960 --> 18:02.400
So right now, it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient,

18:02.400 --> 18:05.400
daily nutrition, especially heading into flu and cold season.

18:05.400 --> 18:08.240
It's just one scoop in a cup of water every day.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.240
That's it.

18:09.240 --> 18:11.680

18:11.680 --> 18:15.760

I've been blessed with great skin.

18:38.200 --> 18:42.280
I don't break out easily, but when I do, it's always before something important, right?

18:42.280 --> 18:46.160
A big performance, a wedding, a date, something I care about where I have to look nice.

20:22.080 --> 20:27.200
My friends, what you've just heard is chapter one, again, of Zona Gail's Hearts Kindred,

20:27.200 --> 20:32.640
which, and a time like this for me is, well, everything.

20:32.640 --> 20:42.560
Fuck, it's hard, you know, this whole show has been my whole life for almost two years

20:42.560 --> 20:48.040
now, or for over two years now, and I can feel the opportunity slipping.

20:48.040 --> 20:51.480
There's certain historical figures that are, you know, generational talents.

20:51.480 --> 20:57.800
You're looking at Zona Gail, Frankie Gail, Wiley Vail, Elvin Bail, Edgar Dail, etc.

20:57.800 --> 21:03.400
These are people that, you know, they had their shot and they took it, and here I am

21:03.400 --> 21:05.320
hissing my shot away.

21:05.320 --> 21:14.040
So, Jake, Amir, Maria, Marty, everyone at Headgum, I hope that you hear this episode

21:14.040 --> 21:19.160
and think one or both of the following two things.

21:19.160 --> 21:25.400
One, Zona Gail was a generational talent and artist really a storyteller, rivaled only

21:25.400 --> 21:35.160
maybe by, well, me, and two, if you don't want the show to be shit like this every week,

21:35.160 --> 21:38.920
then I think you'll have me back in studio.

21:38.920 --> 21:52.760
And I think you'll re-higher my ass on air next week.

22:08.920 --> 22:13.240
That was a hit-dum original.

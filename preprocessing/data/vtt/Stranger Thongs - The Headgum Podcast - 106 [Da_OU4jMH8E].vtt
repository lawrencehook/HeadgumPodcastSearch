Up cover episode

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Monday morning

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Quarterbacking

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
What did you guys realize in hindsight you could have done better this past weekend?

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Let's start with the mirror.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
How is this a good intro for a podcast?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
What's that?

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Monday morning quarterbacking.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
It's our first sentence.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
What does that mean?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
What does that mean?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
It's like we're in a night life, obviously.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
So they know the game went a certain way.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
The jocks didn't rock it.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
But they lost.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
And so much reduced the guests on the podcast.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Fine.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Returning to the show after a month's long hiatus.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Grayson K.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Wise.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
And then there's Brad.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Okay.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Sorry.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Please welcome.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Please head-gama podcast debut as Brad Hill.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Namaste, Brad.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Do you want to tell everybody what you do at the company or not?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Yes.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Namaste.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Or not.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Or not.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
I am an account manager on the sales team.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
But what does that mean?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Like a lot of people don't work in business.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
I procure ad campaign renewals.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
And Molly.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
And Molly.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
And Molly.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
And Molly.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Forcoming.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Forcoming.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
I'm the plug.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Yes.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
And plug.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
She.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
That's cool.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
What's your ad, what's like an ad that you booked recently that you're excited about?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Or not.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Uh, I mean diet diet.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
I mean diet smoke.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
This is what I'm working on.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
My foster cat just got on my lap.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Oh my god.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
This is the cat that you're not keeping though.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
I cannot.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Why not?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
First off, buddy.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
No.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
It's she's 12 and Rickety.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
I can't get attached.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
You're going to kick an old cat out.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
My therapist jokes that I was running a cat hospice.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
So, what do you think about that?

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
I want to see lift that cat.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Oh, wow.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Oh, yeah.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
I'm gonna read that.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Oh, yeah.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Oh, yeah.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Oh, come on out.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Oh, come on out.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Oh.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
So many instruments.

02:51.000 --> 02:59.440
So for Venus in or otherwise, Brad, I know you're talking about, man.

02:59.440 --> 03:02.000
I mean, you know what I'm talking about.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
The play.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.160
We uphold Von, what's his name?

03:06.160 --> 03:07.160
Massac.

03:07.160 --> 03:10.720
Yeah, Massac, because that's where Massicism comes from.

03:10.720 --> 03:17.720
Anyway, I haven't cracked anything that's been going on since this started.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.720
I didn't know that was going to be a quarter back.

03:20.720 --> 03:21.720
Yeah.

03:21.720 --> 03:23.720
That was the first thing.

03:23.720 --> 03:27.720
No, like, was there anything you could have done better this weekend that you're

03:27.720 --> 03:29.720
realizing now in hindsight?

03:29.720 --> 03:30.720
2020.

03:30.720 --> 03:33.720
Hmm.

03:33.720 --> 03:38.720
Um.

03:38.720 --> 03:46.520
What did I do doing my hair too late on the weekend when I've started earlier?

03:46.520 --> 03:51.120
Somebody French braided my hair a week ago to the day.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.120
What's that?

03:52.120 --> 03:55.720
I said, mm-hmm.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.400
Uh, would love to get your thoughts.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.400
Here it is.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.400
Great photo.

04:00.400 --> 04:05.400
Oh, it's like a good French braid.

04:05.400 --> 04:06.400
Um.

04:06.560 --> 04:14.200
I can't see what it looks like when you're facing forward, obviously, so, um, but I have a photo

04:14.200 --> 04:15.200
of that.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.200
Yeah.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.200
Can we see that?

04:17.200 --> 04:18.200
Frontal.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.200
That would be great.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.200
There are 360 video.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.200
Oh.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.200
It's good.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.200
I think.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.200
Okay.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.200
Yeah.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.200
Spat makes it.

04:28.200 --> 04:32.600
Um, Grayson, anything you could have done better this weekend?

04:32.600 --> 04:36.200
Um, I asked a girl on a date and she said no.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.400
Why?

04:37.400 --> 04:38.600
I, you know what?

04:38.600 --> 04:39.400
Let's get her on.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.400
Can I send it?

04:42.400 --> 04:45.000
How could anybody say no to you?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.600
Listen, you and I are on the same page.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.600
Just shocking.

04:50.600 --> 04:51.400
So that happened.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.000
I could have done, I guess I could have done that better.

04:54.000 --> 04:54.800
You know, well, yeah.

04:54.800 --> 04:55.800
How do you know?

04:55.800 --> 04:57.600
I'm starting to worry.

04:57.600 --> 04:58.600
With a carrier pigeon.

04:58.600 --> 04:59.600
How else would I do it?

04:59.600 --> 05:01.200
Yes, no, you don't send an animal.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.000
You never send a bird.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.600
No, you said, of course, you send a bird.

05:04.400 --> 05:08.400
I would, I would never send a mammal, but a bird.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.600
Can you focus?

05:10.600 --> 05:11.400
I'm trying.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.000
She loves to be on my lap.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.800
And I can't do it today, Brad.

05:15.800 --> 05:16.800
Right?

05:16.800 --> 05:18.600
I thought she was rickety.

05:18.600 --> 05:21.800
She's pretty erotic, actually.

05:21.800 --> 05:22.800
No, here she comes.

05:22.800 --> 05:23.800
Yeah, there she is.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.400
All right.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.000
This is not good for audio.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.600
She doesn't understand like the ins and outs of fucking oral.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.800
I can't hear her.

05:31.800 --> 05:32.800
That's fine.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.600
Brad, did you, did you ask your wife out on a date?

05:37.600 --> 05:39.800
And she said yes or no?

05:39.800 --> 05:45.600
Uh, I mean, no, but I did bury my turtle in my front yard.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.600
It's been fostering a turtle.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.600
There's no way to have done that better.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.600
There's been fostered a turtle.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.600
You got foster reptiles, I would say.

05:56.600 --> 06:00.600
He, let's see, a month ago, wandered into the yard.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.600
And I was feeding him lettuce, strawberries.

06:04.600 --> 06:05.600
Let us.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.600
Let us.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.600
I'm sorry to even ask.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.600
Try this and lettuce.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.600
Um, and he died on Friday.

06:15.600 --> 06:19.600
And it was a shallow grave, so I could have known that better, I guess.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.600
Actually, genuinely incredible timing on that.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.600
Yeah.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.600
You could have dug a deeper grave for a day.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.600
Yeah.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.600
Is he like sticking out of the top?

06:30.600 --> 06:33.600
Are you kidding me, man?

06:33.600 --> 06:36.600
Don't you get what's happening?

06:36.600 --> 06:39.600
Not really something is happening.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.600
She doesn't care.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.600
She doesn't like turtles.

06:43.600 --> 06:44.600
Oh, my God.

06:44.600 --> 06:48.600
She brought us like the most important thing, dude.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.600
This was easy.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.600
Please, exactly.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.600
That was a cat.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.600
That was not me or the cat.

06:57.600 --> 07:01.600
I found my own soundboard here.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.600
These are all knockoffs of the same sound.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.600
Yep.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.600
How far did that switch?

07:09.600 --> 07:11.600
Disgusting voice.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.600
This morning.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.600
A singer.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.600
Oh, I knew Maria could hate that.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.600
Down.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.600
Down.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.600
Um, we have to keep moving on.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.600
Are you kidding me?

07:27.600 --> 07:28.600
All right.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.600
Jesus.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.600
Um, I'm thrown by this.

07:37.600 --> 07:42.600
Let's keep it going with everybody's bond of the week.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.600
Um, Grayson, I'm not sure if you know.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.600
But basically every week until the next James Bond is cast,

07:47.600 --> 07:50.600
we're going to be lobbying up our picks for the next 007.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.600
Yeah.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.600
I've done this before and I'm prepared.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.600
He, he edits video buzz.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.600
Every week.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.600
Every week.

07:58.600 --> 08:01.600
Um, this week my pick is Shawn Michaels.

08:01.600 --> 08:07.600
Imagine James, like doing sweet chin music on a fool.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.600
Who is Shawn Michaels?

08:09.600 --> 08:12.600
He's like a former WWF wrestler.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.600
Rassler really.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.600
Yeah.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.600
Okay.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.600
I feel like a godfather real in right now.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.600
So pro.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.600
Yeah.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.600
One of those things is you could avoid it.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.600
Which was the row of obviously.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.600
And was the cash.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.600
Yeah.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.600
No, no, no, no.

08:28.600 --> 08:29.600
You could avoid it.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.600
The cat.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.600
If she could just sit on my lap and relax.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.600
I could fucking get on with this.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.600
At least I now I have an excuse for why this episode is going to be horseshit.

08:39.600 --> 08:40.600
Um,

08:40.600 --> 08:41.600
It's a good attitude.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.600
I'm going to go.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.600
Lewis Hamilton for a meal and driver.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.600
That would be really fun.

08:49.600 --> 08:53.600
A steep career change.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.600
It just James Bond do a lot of car chases in the movies.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.600
Yeah.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.600
Okay.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.600
Sometimes that he would certainly be ready for that.

09:02.600 --> 09:03.600
Oh, no.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.600
And he's also James usually running from someone.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.600
And so is Lewis.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.600
He has a lot of demons.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.600
No, he's just always in front and like just, you know,

09:13.600 --> 09:14.600
Well, hey, more.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.600
No, this season.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.600
That's for James.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.600
Brad, bond of the week.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.600
Uh, it's.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.600
Kermit the frog.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.600
I would love that.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.600
Yes.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.600
Muppet Christmas Carol style adaptation style.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.600
Michael Kane.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.600
As.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.600
He's not in James.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.600
Screwed.

09:34.600 --> 09:35.600
Screwed.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.600
But so it's not just, it's just a Christmas girl.

09:38.600 --> 09:39.600
Yeah.

09:39.600 --> 09:40.600
That was James Bond.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.600
Let's hear your best.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.600
The name is James James Bond in a Kermit voice.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.600
James Bond.

09:46.600 --> 09:47.600
You fucked it up.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.600
Even with the voice being fine.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.600
The voice was perfect.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.600
But the line was.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.600
Yeah.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.600
I've never seen a James Bond movie.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.600
Major killer.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.600
Never bite off more than you can chew.

09:58.600 --> 10:02.600
Have the foresight to know what to do.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.600
Well, you had either to ask him on the spot.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.600
So.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.600
Well, he, I mean, he knows that this bond of the week.

10:08.600 --> 10:09.600
All right.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.600
It's sort of a cultural touched on their company.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.600
Totally.

10:12.600 --> 10:13.600
Union square ventures.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.600
You don't make cultural touched.

10:16.600 --> 10:28.600
I was going to be nice and say you kind of do.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.600
But never mind.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.600
Union square ventures made a present.

10:32.600 --> 10:44.600
This is going to make you no sense to the audio listen.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.600
Jeff's foster cat is fully the only thing in the frame.

10:48.600 --> 10:51.600
It's just for.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.600
I don't know.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.600
A little scamp.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.600
She.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.600
I admire.

10:56.600 --> 10:57.600
No.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.600
Okay.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.600
Jesus Christ.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.600
Grayson Bond of the week.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.600
Covalent.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.600
Who nice.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.600
Covalent bonds.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.600
I'll give you that one.

11:13.600 --> 11:14.600
That was next segment.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.600
Yeah.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.600
Brad, let's talk about dating in Portland.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.600
My god.

11:19.600 --> 11:20.600
Okay.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.600
I'll give you that one.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.600
That was next segment.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.600
Yeah.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.600
Brad, let's talk about dating in Portland.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.600
Okay.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.600
Been married for six years.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.600
But all right.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.600
What are like the spots?

11:32.600 --> 11:35.600
Like where do you take bay?

11:35.600 --> 11:37.600
Some time coffee for like the morning.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.600
A little breakfast sandwich.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.600
More of a heart coffee.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.600
Type a guy.

11:42.600 --> 11:43.600
Really.

11:43.600 --> 11:44.600
Yeah.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.600
What about.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.600
What was that one?

11:47.600 --> 11:48.600
What's that?

11:48.600 --> 11:49.600
Pips.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.600
Is that a coffee shop or a restaurant?

11:51.600 --> 11:52.600
Donut.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.600
Place.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.600
Ooh.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.600
On free month.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.600
Hmm.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.600
Chai.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.600
Oh, where?

11:59.600 --> 12:01.600
Where on free month?

12:01.600 --> 12:03.600
Uh, near there.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.600
One of the Starbucks is.

12:05.600 --> 12:09.600
I know that you see the show isn't good, but this is really bad.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.600
All right.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.600
I guess that's dating in Portland.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.600
Let's have a moment of silence.

12:15.600 --> 12:21.600
Seven moment of silence for Terry Melcher.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.600
Ooh.

12:23.600 --> 12:24.600
Terry Melcher.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.600
Don't just say it louder.

12:27.600 --> 12:28.600
He was a producer.

12:28.600 --> 12:32.600
He created the California sound.

12:32.600 --> 12:33.600
And.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.600
Okay.

12:34.600 --> 12:35.600
He died in 2004.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.600
And nobody's fucking talking about it.

12:38.600 --> 12:42.600
Sorry.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.600
Are we, are we taking a moment?

12:44.600 --> 12:46.600
Oh, but silence, man.

12:46.600 --> 12:47.600
Okay.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.600
You never interrupt.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.600
That's not your time to shine.

12:50.600 --> 12:51.600
All right.

12:51.600 --> 12:52.600
By the way, wise.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.600
So how long is it?

12:56.600 --> 12:57.600
Marie.

12:57.600 --> 12:58.600
God.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.600
Kidding me.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.600
I just wanted to know how long the moment of silence needs to be.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.600
We feel it out.

13:04.600 --> 13:08.600
If it's long, like, get up and maybe get some water or something.

13:08.600 --> 13:12.600
You know, Marie get a moment of silence is not your time to shine, by the way.

13:12.600 --> 13:13.600
It's not me shining.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.600
Let's just.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.600
Me multitasking.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.600
I thought you were shining.

13:18.600 --> 13:19.600
Thank you.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.600
A moment of silence for Terry Melcher.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.600
That was easy.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.600
Full steam ahead, obviously.

13:39.600 --> 13:43.600
I saw a New York Times headline today that said,

13:43.600 --> 13:45.600
My marriage.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.600
My marriage has a third wheel.

13:48.600 --> 13:49.600
Our child.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.600
Let's talk about it.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.600
Do you guys want to have kids?

13:55.600 --> 13:57.600
And if so, how many would you have?

13:57.600 --> 14:03.600
And if you have one, how do you make sure that that kid isn't, like, a fucking drag?

14:03.600 --> 14:05.600
That's a real wheel.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.600
Well.

14:07.600 --> 14:12.600
Is anyone on the pod right now, a, an only child?

14:12.600 --> 14:18.600
Um, kind of, or I have, like, half siblings that I didn't really grow up with.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.600
Okay.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.600
So, do you consider yourself an only child?

14:22.600 --> 14:24.600
And she is looking at me to get back on my knee.

14:24.600 --> 14:28.600
Uh, do you consider yourself an only child?

14:28.600 --> 14:30.600
Um.

14:30.600 --> 14:34.600
I think yes, just given, like,

14:34.600 --> 14:40.600
I was the only one living in the house with my parents, so for that reason.

14:40.600 --> 14:44.600
Did you feel like a third wheel at times?

14:44.600 --> 14:46.600
Uh.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.600
I guess.

14:48.600 --> 14:56.600
So, I feel like if, I don't know, I remember I specifically remember I never watched the Lord of the Rings movies because my parents wouldn't let me.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.600
And they watched them by themselves.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.600
And I remember not being allowed to.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.600
So, wow.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.600
That.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.600
And you were, you were, like, 16 at that point, right?

15:05.600 --> 15:06.600
Yeah.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.600
This was last month.

15:08.600 --> 15:09.600
Yeah.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.600
Uh.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.600
No, I don't think I ever felt like a third wheel.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.600
Okay.

15:14.600 --> 15:18.600
Because this is what, um, Sylvie's parents said.

15:18.600 --> 15:22.600
Here's a typical weeknight scenario in our household.

15:22.600 --> 15:26.600
My husband, Tom, our nine-year-old daughter, Sylvie, and I feel like ordering in.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.600
And after a lengthy debate, we decide on pizza.

15:29.600 --> 15:34.600
Later, while the three of us are eating pepperoni slices and playing banana grams,

15:34.600 --> 15:37.600
Sylvie reminds Tom that our wedding anniversary is coming up.

15:37.600 --> 15:41.600
And offhandedly mentions that my favorite flowers are pionies.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.600
After a few rounds of the game, we consider a movie.

15:44.600 --> 15:48.600
Sylvie proposes a scape from New York, a film that has peaked her curiosity

15:48.600 --> 15:52.600
after hearing her father repeatedly imitate Kurt Russell as Snake Plysskin.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.600
I'll look it up on Common Sense Media to see if it's appropriate.

15:58.600 --> 15:59.600
She volunteers, opening my computer.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.600
Unfortunately, she reports gravely.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.600
It's for ages 16 and up.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.600
Except for a severed head, Sylvie reads aloud.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.600
There's little explicit gore.

16:09.600 --> 16:16.600
An atmosphere of cynicism and darkness pervades, including a negative depiction of a US president.

16:16.600 --> 16:22.600
So, in that scenario, Brad, what would you do with your boo?

16:22.600 --> 16:25.600
Is 16 and up, can she handle it?

16:25.600 --> 16:32.600
Do you know if we had a nine-year-old who wanted to watch games of New York specifically,

16:32.600 --> 16:35.600
but learned that it wasn't major-appropriate?

16:35.600 --> 16:36.600
Yes.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.600
I can't tell where you're from.

16:38.600 --> 16:42.600
You can't tell where you should be.

16:42.600 --> 16:48.600
The question that he asked is basically, can your wife watch a scape from New York?

16:48.600 --> 16:51.600
I'll tell you phrase the question.

16:51.600 --> 16:55.600
We've never seen it and we don't want kids.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.600
Wow.

16:58.600 --> 17:04.600
So, you sort of made a mockery of this entire prompt.

17:04.600 --> 17:07.600
Yes, it's the Hild showed today.

17:07.600 --> 17:10.600
Let's hear another one of your sounds.

17:10.600 --> 17:12.600
Hold on.

17:12.600 --> 17:17.600
I guess also don't ask me, because I don't want kids.

17:17.600 --> 17:20.600
That's what she said.

17:20.600 --> 17:23.600
Oh, great.

17:23.600 --> 17:27.600
Do you want, for lack of a better term, rugrats?

17:27.600 --> 17:33.600
I would love rugrats, but only if they were specifically the actual rugrats.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.600
So you want animated characters as your kid?

17:36.600 --> 17:37.600
Yeah.

17:37.600 --> 17:38.600
Absolutely.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.600
That's a Tommy Pickles.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.600
That's not a rug rat.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.600
The other ones.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.600
It is a rug rat.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.600
It's a main one.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.600
I know.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.600
But what if...

17:51.600 --> 17:55.600
We do have to take a quick break, mostly because of ads.

17:56.600 --> 18:01.600
Oh, yeah.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.600
And now a word from our sponsor.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.600
Better health.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.600
Guys, you ever feel burnt out?

18:07.600 --> 18:09.600
I know I do.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.600
I probably look at right now.

18:11.600 --> 18:15.600
You know, whether it's work related or, you know, friend or family related.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.600
Maybe you're not taking enough time for yourself.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.600
Maybe you just feel burnt out in general and you don't know why.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.600
And that's because life can be overwhelming.

18:22.600 --> 18:25.600
And many people are burnt out without even knowing it.

18:25.600 --> 18:29.600
Symptoms can include lack of motivation, irritability, fatigue, and more.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.600
And we associate burnout with work, but that's not the only cause.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.600
Any of our roles in life can lead us to feeling burnt out.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.600
And that's where better health comes in.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.600
Better health online therapy wants to remind you to prioritize you.

18:40.600 --> 18:43.600
They want to prioritize you, you, you.

18:43.600 --> 18:49.600
By talking to somebody who can help figure out what's causing stress in your life.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.600
I go to therapy every week.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.600
It makes me a better person.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.600
It makes me show up in my relationships with my friends.

18:57.600 --> 19:02.600
Families, lovers, and more with a certain genus say,

19:02.600 --> 19:04.600
Quah, a self-awareness about me.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.600
I hope I like to think.

19:06.600 --> 19:12.600
And I think everybody who has the means and the access should give it a shot.

19:12.600 --> 19:15.600
Better health is customized online therapy.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.600
That offers video, phone, and even live chat sessions with your therapist.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.600
So you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.600
It's also much more affordable than traditional in-person therapy.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.600
And you can be matched with a therapist in under 48 hours.

19:35.600 --> 19:38.600
Guys, why would you ever get life insurance?

19:38.600 --> 19:39.600
Right?

19:39.600 --> 19:44.600
Well, if someone relies on you financially, whether that's a child, a parent, or even a business

19:44.600 --> 19:49.600
partner, life insurance gives you peace of mind that they actually have a financial

19:49.600 --> 19:51.600
cushion if something happens to you.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.600
Right?

And we're back.

Yeah, I learned it that recently.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.600
And that's what you want to bring to the show.

21:11.600 --> 21:12.600
We weren't.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.600
I didn't think we were on the show.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.600
I was free.

21:15.600 --> 21:19.600
It was asking me how I was dealing with the loss of.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.600
Each ego, which was his name.

21:22.600 --> 21:23.600
The turtle.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.600
Each he wrote.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.600

Oh, look at me.

21:41.600 --> 21:55.600

21:55.600 --> 21:58.600

21:59.600 --> 22:00.600
No.

22:00.600 --> 22:01.600
Yes.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.600
We booked a bus trigger.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.600
Don't talk about this.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.600
Don't talk about this.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.600
And we're definitely going to do it at all.

22:12.600 --> 22:13.600
Great.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.600
Absolutely.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.600
And so what I thought we could do.

22:17.600 --> 22:21.600
It was to our own stranger things.

22:21.600 --> 22:24.600
This one being for copyright purposes.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.600
Stranger thongs.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.600
Oh, this is worse.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.600
This is Stranger thongs.

22:38.600 --> 22:41.600
So basically, we're going to look at some thongs.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.600
And decide which is the strangest.

22:44.600 --> 22:45.600
Here we go.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.600
This is sort of a patch up.

22:48.600 --> 22:52.600
My shaved box under here.

22:52.600 --> 22:55.600
Versus.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.600
Harvard law.

22:57.600 --> 22:58.600
Just kidding.

22:58.600 --> 22:59.600
It's Yale.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.600
My shaved box.

23:07.600 --> 23:11.600
I guess Harvard law is Stranger.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.600
Slash better.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.600
All right.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.600
Harvard law just kidding.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.600
It's Yale.

23:18.600 --> 23:19.600
Versus.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.600
Same penis forever.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.600
I mean, that's there's so many things you can

23:28.600 --> 23:30.600
insinuate from seeing that.

23:30.600 --> 23:31.600
Right.

23:31.600 --> 23:32.600
Who's who's penis?

23:32.600 --> 23:35.600
Is this a bachelor at party thing?

23:35.600 --> 23:36.600
That would be a good bachelor at party.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.600
I think Harvard law is still the strangest.

23:39.600 --> 23:40.600
Yeah.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.600
You think that's still the strangest thongs?

23:42.600 --> 23:43.600
Yeah.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.600
Yeah.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.600
Oh, my God.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.600
There's no easier.

23:48.600 --> 23:50.600
I tried four different ways how to do this.

23:50.600 --> 23:51.600
Here we go.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.600
Harvard law just kidding.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.600
It's Yale versus I like Bush.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.600
Which is vaguely chemical.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.600
Which one is it?

23:58.600 --> 23:59.600
Yeah.

23:59.600 --> 24:00.600
That's the thing.

24:00.600 --> 24:01.600
It's open to interpretation.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.600
I feel like I would be most jarred if I saw this.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.600
I'm like, Oh, do you?

24:05.600 --> 24:06.600
Is that like a.

24:06.600 --> 24:07.600
I don't know what to think.

24:07.600 --> 24:12.600
I still don't think anything is weirder than Harvard law.

24:12.600 --> 24:13.600
Yeah.

24:13.600 --> 24:27.600
I think if this is Bush 41, then I think it is weirder than Harvard law.

24:27.600 --> 24:31.600
But if it's Bush 43, then I do think that Harvard law is still weirder.

24:31.600 --> 24:36.600
I, you can't tell based on like the font.

24:36.600 --> 24:41.600
Is the Harvard law one officially licensed?

24:41.600 --> 24:47.600
I don't know if I'm trying to like catch them in some kind of like copyright infringement,

24:47.600 --> 24:49.600
trademark infringement.

24:49.600 --> 24:52.600
But I think maybe don't worry about it.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.600
Noted.

24:57.600 --> 25:00.600
That was one of the weirdest sentences I've ever written on the show.

25:02.600 --> 25:03.600
Alright, what's the consensus?

25:03.600 --> 25:04.600
Three votes.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.600
I'm voting for I like Bush.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.600
And I hate that sentence coming out of my mouth.

25:09.600 --> 25:16.600
I'm still Harvard law.

25:16.600 --> 25:17.600
I think that's.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.600
Yes, I'm.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.600
Alright.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.600
Sorry.

25:20.600 --> 25:24.600
Harvard law just kidding it's Yale versus don't play with your food.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.600
And by the way, this isn't.

25:26.600 --> 25:29.600
This isn't like a low-res photo.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.600
This is like 1080p by 1080p.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.600
It's just blurry.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.600
The sign is blurry.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.600
Yeah.

25:36.600 --> 25:37.600
Hmm.

25:37.600 --> 25:44.600
I just feel like all of the other ones have some sort of insinuation.

25:44.600 --> 25:45.600
In Uganda.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.600
Yeah.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.600
But the Harvard law one is like,

25:48.600 --> 25:51.600
what does this have to do with anything?

25:51.600 --> 25:53.600
Just kidding.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.600
It's Yale.

25:54.600 --> 25:55.600
What's Yale?

25:55.600 --> 25:57.600
You're a time.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.600
What are we even talking about?

25:59.600 --> 26:01.600
You didn't catch me.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.600
That's.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.600
Hilled.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.600
Why?

26:06.600 --> 26:08.600
I can't break his red.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.600
Yeah.

26:10.600 --> 26:11.600
Alright.

26:11.600 --> 26:15.600
Harvard law just kidding it's Yale versus.

26:15.600 --> 26:16.600
Coffee.

26:16.600 --> 26:21.600
Because I can count the number of hours I slept last night on one hand.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.600
The other sounds weirder.

26:23.600 --> 26:24.600
Yeah.

26:27.600 --> 26:30.600
We finally did it.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.600
Silver rose.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.600
Why is the font so small?

26:34.600 --> 26:35.600
Oh, that's a bit.

26:35.600 --> 26:39.600
There's only a certain printable area on clothing.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.600
Also, I feel, isn't like coffee a diuretic,

26:42.600 --> 26:44.600
which just feels like a weird.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.600
Why are you doing that?

26:46.600 --> 26:47.600
Why are you doing that?

26:47.600 --> 26:49.600
Why are you doing that?

26:49.600 --> 26:52.600
Extra dehydrated.

26:52.600 --> 26:56.600
Alright.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.600
That one's weirder.

26:58.600 --> 26:59.600
This one's weirder.

26:59.600 --> 27:00.600
Yeah.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.600
Coffee because I can count the number of hours I slept last night on one hand.

27:02.600 --> 27:03.600
Versus.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.600
I have a headache.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.600
Did you make this one?

27:07.600 --> 27:10.600
This is in one of my personal collection.

27:13.600 --> 27:14.600
I still think I've been.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.600
I choose this one.

27:16.600 --> 27:21.600
I still think this one is two sexual.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.600
I feel like it's very not sexual.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.600
Well, I think there's like a stop stop.

27:28.600 --> 27:29.600
I have a headache.

27:29.600 --> 27:30.600
Right.

27:30.600 --> 27:31.600
Right.

27:31.600 --> 27:32.600
That's right.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.600
But it's still like a, I feel like that's like a make sense.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.600
Yeah.

27:35.600 --> 27:38.600
Does it help that it's written in comic sands?

27:38.600 --> 27:39.600
Yeah.

27:39.600 --> 27:40.600
Oh, like a little bit.

27:40.600 --> 27:41.600
Yeah.

27:41.600 --> 27:42.600
I feel like this.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.600
I mean, this could be sexual in UNDO.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.600
It could be like, I'm aching for head.

27:51.600 --> 27:52.600
Nice.

27:52.600 --> 27:53.600
Next one.

27:54.600 --> 27:57.600
Um, so what do we, what do we decide?

27:57.600 --> 28:00.600
I personally stick all at the coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee.

There's no way.

28:13.600 --> 28:14.600
Oh, foot.

28:14.600 --> 28:15.600
Okay.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.600

28:18.600 --> 28:20.600
And footwear slash swimwear.

28:20.600 --> 28:22.600
Obviously, this one's weird.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.600
That's what they said in the, the funding meeting.

28:25.600 --> 28:31.600
I think it's important to disclose your business ties on the internet.

28:31.600 --> 28:34.600
Uh, I do have a 30% stake in think thong.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.600

28:47.600 --> 28:50.600

28:50.600 --> 28:53.600
I feel like a lot of people with penis is talk about.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.600
Not enough support.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.600
You know what I mean?

28:58.600 --> 29:00.600
Not enough support.

Yeah.

29:02.600 --> 29:03.600

29:03.600 --> 29:06.600
Is that a complaint about the thing thong or is that a thing thong?

29:06.600 --> 29:08.600
Penis is in general.

29:08.600 --> 29:09.600
Solves.

29:13.600 --> 29:15.600
It's the penis problem or.

29:15.600 --> 29:19.600
It's a complaint I have about the thing thong.

29:19.600 --> 29:22.600
What kind of flip flop is it on the other side?

29:22.600 --> 29:25.600
Is it the thong style on the other side?

29:25.600 --> 29:27.600
Or is it the slide style?

29:27.600 --> 29:28.600
Glad you asked.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.600
There's two styles.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.600
Slide and other.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.600
Meaning.

29:34.600 --> 29:38.600
The other one is sort of like, yeah, like I guess like a thong.

29:38.600 --> 29:39.600
Okay.

29:39.600 --> 29:40.600
So thong.

29:40.600 --> 29:41.600

It's a thong.

29:42.600 --> 29:43.600
Yeah.

29:43.600 --> 29:48.600
So you can basically sort of, do you guys remember with the baldo?

29:49.600 --> 29:50.600

29:51.600 --> 29:52.600
We got to talk about the baldo.

29:52.600 --> 29:54.600
Here we go.

29:54.600 --> 29:55.600
Sorry.

29:55.600 --> 29:58.600
I should have brought this up at the beginning.

29:58.600 --> 30:02.600
So I'm bare at spread.

30:02.600 --> 30:03.600
Okay.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.600
First of all.

30:04.600 --> 30:05.600
Think thong.

30:05.600 --> 30:06.600
This is weirder.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.600
Shout out to the thing thong.

30:09.600 --> 30:10.600
Um.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.600
But now it's time to talk about the baldo.

30:22.600 --> 30:25.600

30:25.600 --> 30:28.600
With three years of development and testing and over on the prototypes being made.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.600
The baldo is now to refine to deliver maximum pleasure.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.600
So sex will never be the same again.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.600
Let's watch this quick instructional video.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.600
No.

30:37.600 --> 30:51.600
So it's the world's first baldo though.

30:51.600 --> 30:55.600
Tip no wider than most penises, which for that is a selling point.

30:55.600 --> 31:00.600
I feel like if you're going to have ball sex, you should probably have it be bigger.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.600
So loud, right?

31:02.600 --> 31:03.600
Sorry.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.600
So I can't affect that.

31:05.600 --> 31:06.600
You definitely can.

31:06.600 --> 31:07.600
There's yeah.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.600
There's a volume control.

31:09.600 --> 31:19.600
So basically what you do is you slide your sack in between the two divots.

31:19.600 --> 31:20.600
And yeah.

31:20.600 --> 31:26.600
So they're trying to make 2021 the year of ball sex.

31:26.600 --> 31:27.600
So that's the baldo.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.600
Um, and then he did.

31:28.600 --> 31:29.600
Did they succeed?

31:29.600 --> 31:30.600
Instructional.

31:30.600 --> 31:31.600
So you got it.

31:31.600 --> 31:32.600
First of all.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.600
And then you stretch the baldo over your balls.

31:36.600 --> 31:41.600
Stretch the space rings and then insert into your partner.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.600
So why did I bring this up?

31:44.600 --> 31:48.600
Nobody asked you to.

31:48.600 --> 31:52.600
Oh, I could have said I was busy today.

31:52.600 --> 31:58.600
We have more to get to.

31:59.600 --> 32:04.600
Another headline from today.

32:04.600 --> 32:07.600
Elon Musk threatens to pull out of the Twitter deal.

32:07.600 --> 32:10.600
Unless he gets more information about fake accounts.

32:10.600 --> 32:18.600
And how Twitter, you know, monitors that cracks down on it.

32:18.600 --> 32:23.600
And basically this letter that was sent to the, I believe the SEC said that Mr.

32:23.600 --> 32:27.600
Musk had repeatedly requested more information about that.

32:29.600 --> 32:32.600
Sorry, um, about how.

32:32.600 --> 32:35.600
Yeah, a Twitter measure spam in fake accounts.

32:35.600 --> 32:40.600
And he issued an ultimatum basically saying if he doesn't get this information, he's out.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.600
Which I personally would love.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.600
So I thought we could.

32:44.600 --> 32:48.600
Here right now come up with a couple fake accounts.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.600
To sabotage the deal.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.600
sabotage the steel.

32:53.600 --> 32:57.600
Because he's kind of getting this for pennies on the dollar in terms of what I think.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.600
In terms of what I think Twitter's worth.

32:59.600 --> 33:03.600
I thought that he had already backed out.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.600
Did he back in again?

33:06.600 --> 33:09.600
This, I mean, ball no style.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.600
I don't even know if that makes sense.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.600
What even back out?

33:21.600 --> 33:24.600
And they said insert penetrate.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.600
Brad, how do you fuck?

33:30.600 --> 33:32.600
You don't have to answer that.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.600
The ball though music starts.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.600
Oh, let me shave my balls.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.600
On an anniversary night.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.600
Six years, huh?

33:49.600 --> 33:51.600
What's the fucking secret man?

33:52.600 --> 33:55.600
30, 30.

33:55.600 --> 33:59.600
What's the secret to happy wife happy life?

33:59.600 --> 34:01.600
Don't get divorced.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.600
Okay.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.600
Don't hate each other.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.600
We got those going.

34:12.600 --> 34:16.600
Do you guys like make time to still like date?

34:16.600 --> 34:17.600
Hmm.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.600
That's good.

34:19.600 --> 34:20.600
Yeah.

34:20.600 --> 34:21.600
Yeah.

34:24.600 --> 34:25.600
No, you said.

34:25.600 --> 34:26.600
No, I'm not sad.

34:26.600 --> 34:27.600
I'm just thinking about shit.

34:27.600 --> 34:30.600
You got kind of choked up reading the Elon Musk.

34:30.600 --> 34:31.600
Maybe too.

34:32.600 --> 34:33.600
Everything alright.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.600
I was talking about your calling.

34:38.600 --> 34:42.600
I was hoping if I, I'm a hot and ball nerd.

34:44.600 --> 34:46.600
What about ball though dash?

34:46.600 --> 34:48.600
So it's like pandemonium with ball does.

34:50.600 --> 34:51.600
Really good.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.600
You guys.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.600
Mr. Musk is still part of the deal, Marika.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.600
I don't know where you're news.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.600
But he might pull out.

35:00.600 --> 35:05.600
If they don't provide more information.

35:07.600 --> 35:12.600
And I think the more fake accounts, the higher the chance he pulls out.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.600
Ball though style.

35:14.600 --> 35:17.600
That's what she said.

35:20.600 --> 35:22.600
That's what she said.

35:22.600 --> 35:23.600
Why are there?

35:23.600 --> 35:24.600
Oh, wow.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.600
Ellie, you're 12.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.600
You were born in 2010.

35:34.600 --> 35:35.600
Okay.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.600
Buddy, you gotta go.

35:37.600 --> 35:38.600
I don't.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.600
She can't take the hint because I've done that.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.600
And she almost ended the meeting.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.600
That's why this is unacceptable.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.600
Fake accounts.

35:45.600 --> 35:46.600
Yeah.

35:46.600 --> 35:47.600
Fake accounts.

35:48.600 --> 35:50.600
What is fake account?

35:50.600 --> 35:51.600
I don't know.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.600
Like, something run by a bot or not.

35:56.600 --> 35:59.600
So like, what if Brad, you,

35:59.600 --> 36:03.600
Well, I guess Grayson, you have more like tech wise wisdom.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.600
What if you created it?

36:05.600 --> 36:06.600
No, dude.

36:06.600 --> 36:07.600
No.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.600
What if you created an account?

36:09.600 --> 36:11.600
That sort of.

36:13.600 --> 36:14.600
Multiply.

36:14.600 --> 36:21.600
In terms of spam tweets that aren't good to read.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.600
That sentence was pointless.

36:30.600 --> 36:36.600
I mean, with that clearly, the first one should be a Jeff quote, spam bot.

36:36.600 --> 36:42.600
Uh, potentially just a dictionary that's created of anything Jeff has ever said.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.600
And then sentences are pieced together.

36:45.600 --> 36:49.600
And half of them will just read us any sentence.

36:49.600 --> 36:52.600
He says he usually does and bad.

36:52.600 --> 36:57.600
If we do that, and it works and musk pulls out.

36:57.600 --> 37:00.600
I'm, I'm going to call every past lover.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.600
STI style and say,

37:02.600 --> 37:05.600
Who, you don't, then you said I wasn't like powerful.

37:05.600 --> 37:08.600
Like the show, scroll to recall.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.600
There's a show called Scrotal Recall.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.600
It was, I changed it to love sick.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.600
But the first season was called Scrotal Recall.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.600
And I refuse to call it otherwise.

37:19.600 --> 37:20.600
It's a great name.

37:20.600 --> 37:21.600
Yeah.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.600
Brad, do you have any ideas for fake accounts that could get?

37:23.600 --> 37:24.600
Okay.

37:24.600 --> 37:27.600
Now she's pawing at my dick.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.600
I don't know how else to put it.

37:29.600 --> 37:32.600
I just looked down and there was like, these are my ties.

37:32.600 --> 37:34.600
You just see.

37:34.600 --> 37:38.600
Well, I feel like most bots are like,

37:38.600 --> 37:44.600
click here for like sexy photos, click here to see my online.

37:44.600 --> 37:49.600
What if it's cats, pawing it?

37:49.600 --> 37:53.600
I'm sorry to even say what cops.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.600
Dex.

37:55.600 --> 38:02.600
Click here to see my pussy.

38:02.600 --> 38:15.600
You've been, you've been at the company the longest of the four of us.

38:15.600 --> 38:18.600
I'm pretty sure.

38:18.600 --> 38:21.600
And I know that there's been like a lot of new hires recently.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.600
And a lot of that has included like group meetings.

38:24.600 --> 38:27.600
Like zooms where everybody kind of gives them the,

38:27.600 --> 38:29.600
Okay, yes, we want to work with this person.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.600
Brad, did you do one of these?

38:31.600 --> 38:32.600
Yeah.

38:32.600 --> 38:33.600
I am the new hire.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.600
I'm newest one.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.600
I want to know who was on that call.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.600
Because Rico was there.

38:39.600 --> 38:40.600
Okay.

38:40.600 --> 38:41.600
Marika.

38:41.600 --> 38:44.600
Do you have any regrets?

38:44.600 --> 38:46.600
Let's Monday or whatever.

38:46.600 --> 38:50.600
That he just said after him saying pussy the most unsure.

38:50.600 --> 38:54.600
I ever heard anyone say that.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.600
No, I don't think so.

38:56.600 --> 38:57.600
All right.

38:57.600 --> 38:58.600
That's good.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.600
That's got to be a vote of confidence.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.600
Jeff, you might if I ask Brad a question.

39:03.600 --> 39:04.600
Yeah.

39:04.600 --> 39:05.600
Just for a second.

39:05.600 --> 39:06.600
Great.

39:06.600 --> 39:11.600
Brad, after joining this Zoom call, do you have any regrets?

39:11.600 --> 39:18.600
You, definitely need to ask about HR stuff.

39:18.600 --> 39:20.600
There isn't one.

39:20.600 --> 39:21.600
Yeah.

39:21.600 --> 39:25.600
I guess it's good that I said pussy then.

39:25.600 --> 39:27.600
Not good.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.600
Maybe not.

39:30.600 --> 39:31.600
Good.

39:31.600 --> 39:32.600
Good.

39:32.600 --> 39:33.600
Yeah.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.600
Make my call.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.600
Um.

39:37.600 --> 39:38.600
Any more fake accounts?

39:38.600 --> 39:40.600
Because that's all I had today, guys.

39:40.600 --> 39:41.600
I do.

39:41.600 --> 39:42.600
You're so good.

39:42.600 --> 39:43.600
Wax.

39:46.600 --> 39:47.600
Um.

39:47.600 --> 39:48.600
Grayson, what else is up in your level?

39:48.600 --> 39:51.600
If you said that you asked a woman out on the date, she said no.

39:51.600 --> 39:55.600
How is like, has your cock, has your heart?

39:55.600 --> 39:56.600
Yeah.

39:56.600 --> 39:59.600
Definitely all think of more fake accounts.

39:59.600 --> 40:03.600
Can I ask a question about the date?

40:03.600 --> 40:09.600
Did you have one planned?

40:09.600 --> 40:14.600
Like, did you say it with, like, this is what it would be or now?

40:14.600 --> 40:17.600
Uh, it's, I mean, it's so much more complicated than that.

40:17.600 --> 40:19.600
Jeff knows how these things go.

40:19.600 --> 40:20.600
Um.

40:20.600 --> 40:21.600
Why?

40:21.600 --> 40:22.600
Jeff?

40:22.600 --> 40:25.600
I don't know if you're referencing something real in my life.

40:25.600 --> 40:29.600
I don't think asking someone.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.600
I just don't want to be.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.600
I didn't like to be sort of singled out in that moment.

40:33.600 --> 40:37.600
And I felt like I needed a friend to say, like, I understand what you're going through.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.600
Um.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.600
You're just absolutely.

40:39.600 --> 40:43.600
I just needed some amount of support.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.600
No, I don't get it at all.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.600
Let's hear it.

40:46.600 --> 40:47.600
Okay.

40:47.600 --> 40:54.600
What about, what if there was a, you know, a Twitter account that, like, took things that were set on this podcast out of context?

40:54.600 --> 41:01.600
You know, and sort of posted those.

41:01.600 --> 41:06.600
You said that so like it was an original idea of actually impressed.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.600
Thanks.

41:07.600 --> 41:08.600
I just thought of it.

41:08.600 --> 41:14.600
So, you're a good actor or you don't know about it.

41:14.600 --> 41:17.600
You're either a good actor or very stupid.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.600
That was easy.

41:19.600 --> 41:21.600
What's new in your life, Jeff?

41:21.600 --> 41:23.600
Aside from this count.

41:24.600 --> 41:28.600
Uh, I don't know if anybody cares to hear about that.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.600
She just asked.

41:30.600 --> 41:31.600
Hmm.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.600
Oh, no.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.600
Well, I'm going on vacation.

41:37.600 --> 41:39.600
So, that's exciting for me.

41:39.600 --> 41:40.600
Where are you going?

41:40.600 --> 41:43.600
To France and to Montreal.

41:43.600 --> 41:46.600
The two most important places in the world.

41:46.600 --> 41:47.600
How long am I gone?

41:47.600 --> 41:48.600
Yeah.

41:48.600 --> 41:49.600
Until the 20th.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.600
So, catch you all day.

41:52.600 --> 41:58.600
Do you think, do you think head gum will still be afloat by the time you come back?

41:58.600 --> 42:00.600
I hope so.

42:00.600 --> 42:04.600
Because if not, that would be terrible.

42:04.600 --> 42:09.600
You take one, two week vacation and then they come.

42:09.600 --> 42:13.600
I made an extensive out of office document.

42:13.600 --> 42:17.600
Grace and will be posting in the podcast and my absence.

42:18.600 --> 42:19.600
Not this one.

42:19.600 --> 42:20.600
Not this one.

42:20.600 --> 42:22.600
Well, absolutely not this one.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.600
No, you'll have to.

42:24.600 --> 42:25.600
Unfortunately.

42:25.600 --> 42:27.600
I haven't missed anything like a month.

42:27.600 --> 42:29.600
I'd like that to go on record.

42:29.600 --> 42:30.600
But yes.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.600
What do you mean hosting?

42:32.600 --> 42:33.600
Oh, yeah, yeah.

42:33.600 --> 42:35.600
No, but you don't post the video.

42:35.600 --> 42:36.600
I post the video.

42:36.600 --> 42:37.600
I post the video.

42:37.600 --> 42:38.600
You definitely don't.

42:38.600 --> 42:39.600
When you go.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.600
He has a separate YouTube account.

42:41.600 --> 42:45.600
I don't know where it goes, but I definitely posted.

42:46.600 --> 42:50.600
Um, Brad Grayson, you guys are both handsome.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.600
Brad, you're not single.

42:52.600 --> 42:55.600
But are you looking to triangle?

42:55.600 --> 42:56.600
Portland.

42:56.600 --> 42:57.600
How did we get back here?

42:57.600 --> 42:58.600
I have some experience.

42:58.600 --> 43:02.600
I gave us a perfect opportunity to talk about something else.

43:02.600 --> 43:03.600
AKA me.

43:03.600 --> 43:05.600
What do you afford to on your trip?

43:05.600 --> 43:07.600
You're going to the Montreal Grand Prix.

43:07.600 --> 43:09.600
Going to, uh, Canadian Grand Prix.

43:09.600 --> 43:12.600
And the 24 hours of the month.

43:13.600 --> 43:17.600
Uh, also going to Disneyland Paris, which will be fun.

43:17.600 --> 43:19.600
You're going to Paris, Brad.

43:19.600 --> 43:20.600
Brad, and you're going to Disneyland.

43:20.600 --> 43:25.600
Did you see that that video that went viral recently of the couple?

43:25.600 --> 43:29.600
The guy is proposing to his girlfriend at Disneyland Paris.

43:29.600 --> 43:33.600
And then one of the employees, like, comes in and stops the proposal.

43:33.600 --> 43:35.600
You like, takes the ring from him.

43:35.600 --> 43:36.600
He did.

43:36.600 --> 43:37.600
I don't watch the video.

43:37.600 --> 43:39.600
But I didn't see that pop up on my feet.

43:39.600 --> 43:43.600
It was like, precious thing I've ever heard.

43:43.600 --> 43:44.600
Why?

43:44.600 --> 43:45.600
Yeah.

43:45.600 --> 43:46.600
Do you know why?

43:46.600 --> 43:47.600
I don't know.

43:47.600 --> 43:51.600
Maybe you have to pay extra to get engaged in Paris.

43:51.600 --> 43:54.600
And I believe it.

43:54.600 --> 43:59.600
I, fortunately, won't have to deal with that.

43:59.600 --> 44:02.600
So just going to go to the park.

44:02.600 --> 44:03.600
Go on.

44:03.600 --> 44:04.600
You have a precious coaster.

44:04.600 --> 44:08.600
I have a grand old time.

44:08.600 --> 44:11.600
And also do some other Paris things.

44:11.600 --> 44:12.600
Jeff is upset now.

44:12.600 --> 44:15.600
So we don't have to talk about me anymore.

44:15.600 --> 44:16.600
I'm just listening.

44:16.600 --> 44:17.600
I'm trying to take a back seat.

44:17.600 --> 44:18.600
I can't.

44:18.600 --> 44:19.600
He fully disconnected from the car.

44:19.600 --> 44:20.600
You're really good at it.

44:20.600 --> 44:21.600
Yeah.

44:21.600 --> 44:22.600
He.

44:22.600 --> 44:23.600
Yeah.

44:23.600 --> 44:26.600
Are you going to go to Francesca's the hot chocolate?

44:26.600 --> 44:28.600
Haunt.

44:28.600 --> 44:30.600
In Paris.

44:30.600 --> 44:31.600
Did you just Google that?

44:31.600 --> 44:33.600
Isn't that I thought?

44:33.600 --> 44:36.600
I thought I know there's one that's like Angelique.

44:36.600 --> 44:37.600
There's something.

44:37.600 --> 44:38.600
I don't know.

44:38.600 --> 44:39.600
That's what I'm in.

44:39.600 --> 44:40.600
Yeah.

44:40.600 --> 44:41.600
No.

44:41.600 --> 44:42.600
There's one in New York.

44:42.600 --> 44:44.600
So I probably won't.

44:44.600 --> 44:45.600
I was in New York for four months.

44:45.600 --> 44:46.600
Why do you tell me?

44:46.600 --> 44:48.600
You never go to Manhattan.

44:48.600 --> 44:49.600
Like rarely.

44:49.600 --> 44:50.600
I've been to Manhattan.

44:50.600 --> 44:51.600
Yeah.

44:51.600 --> 44:52.600
Twice.

44:52.600 --> 44:53.600
Yeah.

44:53.600 --> 44:54.600
Ah.

44:54.600 --> 44:55.600
No.

44:55.600 --> 44:57.600
It's up by brand park.

44:57.600 --> 44:58.600
I was there.

44:58.600 --> 44:59.600
What?

44:59.600 --> 45:00.600
Oh, God.

45:00.600 --> 45:01.600
Buddy.

45:01.600 --> 45:04.600
What else?

45:04.600 --> 45:05.600
What else?

45:05.600 --> 45:06.600
What do you mean?

45:06.600 --> 45:08.600
What do you take a French lover?

45:08.600 --> 45:09.600
Right?

45:09.600 --> 45:11.600
Let's talk about that.

45:11.600 --> 45:12.600
Okay.

45:12.600 --> 45:14.600
Maria, how's your and Quissy?

45:14.600 --> 45:16.600
It's her bad thing.

45:16.600 --> 45:19.600
That.

45:19.600 --> 45:21.600
I feel uncomfortable saying.

45:21.600 --> 45:22.600
Plugs.

45:22.600 --> 45:23.600
To make me sick.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.600
That's why I didn't say it.

45:25.600 --> 45:26.600
You said it.

45:26.600 --> 45:27.600
Oh.

45:27.600 --> 45:28.600
This is a meeting.

45:28.600 --> 45:29.600
This is an entire meeting.

45:29.600 --> 45:30.600
Yeah.

45:30.600 --> 45:32.600
Where are you going to have to zoom in from fucking.

45:32.600 --> 45:33.600
Yeah.

45:33.600 --> 45:34.600
I'll be in my.

45:35.600 --> 45:38.600
You have an IWC in a restart mail.

45:38.600 --> 45:39.600
One on both wrist.

45:39.600 --> 45:44.600
Plugs.

45:44.600 --> 45:45.600
Plugs.

45:45.600 --> 45:46.600
Yeah.

45:46.600 --> 45:47.600
Back in.

45:47.600 --> 45:49.600
Follow me on Twitter and Instagram.

45:49.600 --> 45:50.600
And Blood or Box.

Listen to.

45:53.600 --> 45:54.600

45:54.600 --> 45:56.600
Well, with young Wayne.

How are you?

46:01.600 --> 46:02.600
Which is really exciting.

46:02.600 --> 46:03.600
Super funny.

46:03.600 --> 46:05.600
I'm also a new to the network.

46:05.600 --> 46:07.600
But not new podcast.

46:07.600 --> 46:09.600
Too scary to not watch.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.600
It's podcast.

46:10.600 --> 46:13.600
Where people talk about scary movies.

46:13.600 --> 46:15.600
And if you don't like them.

46:15.600 --> 46:17.600
Like I don't like them.

46:17.600 --> 46:19.600
You can just listen to other people talk about them.

46:19.600 --> 46:21.600
Which is good.

46:21.600 --> 46:22.600
Uh.

46:22.600 --> 46:24.600
It's all I got.

46:24.600 --> 46:26.600
Wise.

46:26.600 --> 46:27.600
Uh.

46:27.600 --> 46:29.600
You can follow me on.

46:29.600 --> 46:30.600

46:30.600 --> 46:32.600
Great KY's.

46:32.600 --> 46:34.600
And it's too late.

46:34.600 --> 46:36.600
But just don't watch this podcast.

46:36.600 --> 46:38.600
Don't turn this off.

46:38.600 --> 46:39.600
Yeah.

46:39.600 --> 46:42.600
Turn it off right before Brad's plug.

46:42.600 --> 46:43.600
Yeah.

46:43.600 --> 46:45.600
Build.

46:45.600 --> 46:46.600
Uh.

46:46.600 --> 46:47.600
Instagram.

46:47.600 --> 46:48.600
I guess.

46:48.600 --> 46:49.600
St. General.

46:49.600 --> 46:52.600
You're playing the social media on the Instagram.

46:52.600 --> 46:53.600
Yeah.

46:53.600 --> 46:54.600
It's like the one thing everyone has.

46:54.600 --> 46:55.600
Yeah.

46:55.600 --> 46:56.600
They needed that.

46:56.600 --> 46:58.600
Me specifically.

46:58.600 --> 46:59.600
Uh.

46:59.600 --> 47:00.600
Is Brad the human.

47:00.600 --> 47:01.600
Yeah.

47:01.600 --> 47:02.600
And uh.

47:02.600 --> 47:03.600
Take care of your turtles.

47:03.600 --> 47:05.600
Cause you never know.

47:05.600 --> 47:08.600
What could happen.

47:08.600 --> 47:11.600
That actually made me kind of emotional.

47:11.600 --> 47:14.600
Um.

47:14.600 --> 47:16.600
Brad has a Vespa.

47:16.600 --> 47:18.600
My plug is that I want to get a Vespa.

47:18.600 --> 47:20.600
But I have to take a motorcycle.

47:20.600 --> 47:21.600
What's that?

47:21.600 --> 47:23.600
Cause you can come.

47:23.600 --> 47:24.600
Buy mine.

47:24.600 --> 47:25.600
Yeah.

47:25.600 --> 47:26.600
I.

47:27.600 --> 47:28.600
Yeah.

47:28.600 --> 47:29.600
To you.

47:29.600 --> 47:30.600
Right.

47:30.600 --> 47:32.600
But I have to get my motorcycle license in California.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.600
I don't have one.

47:34.600 --> 47:35.600
Yeah.

47:35.600 --> 47:38.600
California is like the only state where you need a motorcycle license to have a

47:38.600 --> 47:39.600
Moped.

47:39.600 --> 47:41.600
You need one in Oregon too.

47:41.600 --> 47:44.600
You're going to get a Moped.

47:44.600 --> 47:46.600
Q downtown by 9.

47:46.600 --> 47:50.600
I forgot about that.

47:50.600 --> 47:55.600
I recently never forget because he had to work a full extra day to shoot the intro to the

47:55.600 --> 47:57.600
video that we did in New York.

47:57.600 --> 47:58.600
Um.

47:58.600 --> 47:59.600
No.

47:59.600 --> 48:01.600
I found this vintage fucking.

48:01.600 --> 48:03.600
Vespa.

48:03.600 --> 48:05.600
Grand Piaggio.

48:05.600 --> 48:06.600
Piaggio.

48:06.600 --> 48:07.600
Um.

48:07.600 --> 48:08.600
Okay.

48:08.600 --> 48:09.600
You just saved your money.

48:09.600 --> 48:10.600
I think.

48:10.600 --> 48:12.600
I'm not good at that.

48:12.600 --> 48:13.600
I'm fully convinced.

48:13.600 --> 48:15.600
I'm going to come into like.

And it.

48:20.600 --> 48:22.600
You know what you might like.

48:22.600 --> 48:23.600
You know what you might like.

48:23.600 --> 48:24.600
A retirement account.

48:24.600 --> 48:25.600
Yeah.

48:25.600 --> 48:26.600
Yeah.

48:26.600 --> 48:27.600
Yeah.

Yeah.

48:31.600 --> 48:32.600
No.

48:32.600 --> 48:33.600
How do you do that?

48:33.600 --> 48:35.600
Well, you know, how you.

Robinhood.

48:44.600 --> 48:45.600
Proud.

48:45.600 --> 48:46.600
No.

48:46.600 --> 48:47.600
I don't think Robinhood does it.

48:47.600 --> 48:48.600
All right.

48:48.600 --> 48:49.600
We'll do a whole finance episode next year.

48:49.600 --> 48:50.600
Yeah.

48:50.600 --> 48:51.600
But you don't ask me.

48:51.600 --> 48:52.600
You'll be gone.

48:52.600 --> 48:53.600
Yeah.

48:53.600 --> 48:54.600
So you don't have to sit through that.

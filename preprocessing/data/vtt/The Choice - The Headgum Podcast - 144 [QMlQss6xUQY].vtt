WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
You guys like that sort of DJ mix that I just did?

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
I did.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Yeah.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Sort of a fort of farce.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Nice.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
What was that of me?

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
You're sort of a tour to farce.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Ready?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Ready.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Yes.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
How is it being in the,

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Yeah.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Yeah.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
The big apple.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
You know, or thrive in and survive in over here.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
One is the bare minimum.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
The other one is the actual maximum.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
So which one are you leaning on?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
It's up and down even within an hour.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Yeah.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Absolutely.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Anything could change.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
I feel like everyone here is low energy jab except for me and on you.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
So let's.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Oh my god. Thank you.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Get some of the energy up.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
I don't know if I'm here.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Did you already record buckets?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Uh, yeah.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Did I say that?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Uh, Billy tweeted about it.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
So my fear is that you used up all your capital,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
social capital, entertainment capital,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
of the world, uh, on that show.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
And didn't say enough for this one.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
So the session.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
If you're going to show up with this

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Natitude, which is a lack of attitude.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Positive or negative.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Even negative, sorry, just one second.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Even a negative outlook showing up with some energy would be good.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Natitude is lack of attitude.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Notitude light.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Yeah.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Yeah.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Amir's been out of town.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
It's like kind of a big deal that he said yes to this at all.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Thank you.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
That's a really good get.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
What's that?

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
This is a really big get for you.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
You're on the show all the time.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Yes, from you.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Thank you very good.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
A big get is when you take the steps.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
I enjoyed that you booked yourself.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
What?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
I just didn't want to email anyone else last week.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
I get that.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Um,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
hot outside.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Todd inside.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
59 degrees.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
It's cool.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
It's not hot at all.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
It's hot inside, I meant to say.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Because I'm under a bunch of covers.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
And I'm wearing socks on sweats.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I think I love it.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
On your, are you in, is it safe to say?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I've actually moved.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Mount Washington is so small that you would be doxing me fully.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
If I was still living there.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Somebody could go on Google Earth and match.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
You know, the 3D Earth view to those windows.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Right.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Yeah, there's some.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Yeah.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Some hacker would, would like look at this.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
The way that the light comes in here and figure out where I am.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
And my question is.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Um.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
What's that?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
If you don't mind.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh, if you have anything else to do.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
We can do this later.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yeah.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Yeah.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
I don't know if I'm just available, but I'm around.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Oh.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Sorry.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Sorry.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Sorry, Jeff.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
We formed an alliance at the top of the show.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
And I can just be treated.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Um, I live in.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Wow.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
That's a cool area.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Wow.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Um, pretty nice.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
That's a fun Eastern move.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Dude.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
What was that?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I don't.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
I don't know.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
I don't know what energy is coming at me right now.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Maria looks tired, which is valid.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Amir looks tired.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Not as valid.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Um, I don't look right now.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
And energy is coming.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Tired towards me right now.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Horns you.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
I'm mustering.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Yeah.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
All the courage I have for this.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
It's hard.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
How are you?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Yeah.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
How are you feeling?

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Uh.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Fine.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
I'm feeling fine.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
I'm feeling bad.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I'm having a bad day.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Is that what you want to hear?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I'm having a scattered day.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
I'm currently running this off a Wi-Fi hot spot for my phone.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Can you actually?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Yeah.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
It's lagging.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
Which I think is also leading and contributing to the lagging conversation.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Yeah.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Yeah.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
So.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
The Wi-Fi cut out.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Eight minutes before this started.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
So I couldn't make a company move the elsewhere across town to a different place that

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
I have Wi-Fi available.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Because you've never less minute rescheduled this.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Sorry.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
I'm doing this again.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
I'm sorry.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I'm sorry.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
I'm sorry.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I'm sorry.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
I'm sorry.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
I'm sorry.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
This is Andrea Savage.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Um.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
I think we can pull through though.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
I think it'll be.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
In terms of the lag or.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
The lag, the energy, the vibes, your scattered day.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Let's turn it over.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
I guess Jeff was the fourth of July.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
Scatter day in the park.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yeah.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
I guess Jeff was the.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Are you guys hearing the computer audio?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
The whole time you haven't heard it.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
No, we have.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
No, you said it.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
So loud.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
What?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
You were talking while it was playing.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Yeah.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Yeah.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Uh.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Capybara.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Are you guys seeing this on TikTok?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
They're like, Capybara.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Capy that one.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Oh.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Don't know who that is.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
I don't.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Okay.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Oh.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
So I don't think I'm seeing what you're seeing.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
But I've been reporting to.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
The video team at head gum that I'm experiencing a phenomenon of every time I open.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
YouTube.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
I'm logged into the head gum channel.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Uh, I get a video about Capybara's to the same song.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Yes.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
That's like a famous song or something.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
But they're all like eight months old.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
So I don't know why.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
And they have millions of views.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I don't know why I'm getting them now.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
It's a TikTok thing currently.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
I think.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
But there's this song.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
It's like Capybara or something.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
And so this would be Capybandra.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Mm.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I don't think that's the same song.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
No one that I'm getting is okay.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
I pull up.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Capybara.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Amir's silent.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
This is nothing.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Listen.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
He's reading an article about John Moran flashing a gun.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
That's probably what's happening.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
He had a blikky in the club.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
It was absolutely not a lighter.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Oh my god.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Oh my god.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Who are you guys is bonds of the week?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Actually, my name is John Moran.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Really, bond Moran.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Very good.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Is it because he already knows how to handle a gun?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Yeah, exactly.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Yeah.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Um, my thing is he didn't, he definitely didn't hold it.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
The way James would.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
He held it like, like, your roommates,

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
girl friends, underwear that you're trying to, like,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
kind of with respect, take out of the dryer.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Beth, respect.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Beth.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Beth?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
With respect.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Two.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Yeah.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Okay.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Do you take as you with that?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Yeah, I just didn't know what.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I didn't know what.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
Take your girlfriends underwear out of the dryer with respect.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Girlfriend.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
I think that make a little bit more sense now.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Barely.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
But sure.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
I think you can say the same of, like, taking a strangers,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
laundry out of the dryer at the laundromat.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
No, because I feel like when you take a string,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
it's like, you still take the whole pile.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
You know what I mean?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Hmm.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
This would be one by one with tweezers.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
Just the, you're like, picking out the underwear from.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
The laundromat.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Let me just want that.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
With tweezers.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
And with respect.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Yeah.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
Marie, who's your bond of the week?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Um.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Oh, boy.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
What's going on this week?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
I don't know.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
I don't know.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
What do you got?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Let's skip this one.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
No.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Marie.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
We'll come back to her.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
She's not ready.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Yeah.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
We can come back to me.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
I'm going to the week.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Speaking of doxing me is, um, my landlord.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Maybe I should have said his name.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Grace.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
I'll believe all of that.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
But I, um, he needs to really replace a couple things in our house.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
So I sent him a list of what I needed replaced on Sunday at 930 p.m.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Yeah.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
And he texted back immediately.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
He said, great.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
I'm getting up crazy early to get some surgery.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Going to be out of it for a couple days.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
We send this again on Wednesday.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
And I'll do it on Thursday.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
And I said, sorry.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I said, absolutely no problem.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I've never had a landlord.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Treat me with such respect, actually, to you.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Yeah.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
It was, it was the credit.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I didn't know what to, I was like, don't even worry about it.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Like, I can, just to even text back and say,

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
I'm getting up crazy early to get some surgery.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Like, I'm waking up early to get some surgery.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
As if you're going to a farmer's market to get a specific glove.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
It was the credit.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
It was like, well, good crazy.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Good.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
You're a dog, man.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
A few months ago, I, we had some silverfish.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
And I texted him like, I tried to, I tried to text.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
I tried to text my, the landlord, like, is infrequently as possible.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
So I sent, like, I was like, I'm going to get a pest control in.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Is that okay?

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
I'm going to take it out of rent and he wrote back immediately.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
No problem.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Thanks.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
What, what is silverfish?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Yeah.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
And how, how did you feel about that?

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
It's just the craziest dynamic of, like, the nicest thing a landlord has ever done.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Generally, they're bad people.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Of course.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Pair, pair, pair, whatever.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
But did they?

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
The, the nice thing being still kind of the bare minimum, though, right?

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
It's the absolute bare minimum, but it is the nicest thing a landlord has ever done,

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
which is saying, no problem. You've got it.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
But then, for him to not know what silverfish was.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Yeah.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
As a landlord of many, many years was crazy.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
For him to say, yes, without knowing what it was.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
What if, I mean, what if it was fish, like, a mirror's implying?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Sure.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
You're taking sugar fish out of your right.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Yeah.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I hope that's cool.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Anyway, I guess, believe all of that.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Sorry.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
But that is what he's my, he's my bond of the week for doing landlord work from the hospital bed.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
I love that.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah. That's, that's good.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
My bond of the week is going to be,

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Um,

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
Gillowsary, because I just scrolled past a tweet where he said,

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Brubba, go do.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
I thought that was funny.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
I thought you were going to say, my bond of the week is Gillowsary,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
because wine, not.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Why do you do that?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Oh, yeah.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
His old snap.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
I also, yeah.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I also think it would be good to have a bond that was like,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
slightly big on snapchat five years ago.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
I say that with the most amount of respect for Gillowsary snapchat,

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
um, big, look up late night kiwi shave.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
Makes me laugh every single time I watch.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Right.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Right.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Night kiwi shave.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
It's so good.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Play it truly like play right now.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
Marika, I have a question for you in the meantime as our marketing director.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Yeah.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Is snapchat part of our strategy?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
No.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
People aren't on that anymore.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
I think they are.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
I gave up a long time ago.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
And had gum no longer.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Yeah.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I mean, and there we have one.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Yeah, we did.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
We used to, um,

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
maybe at like our second, uh,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
had gum live in Austin.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
We had some snapchat filters.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
That's right.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Maybe we bring it back.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Maybe.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
There's no way.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
So popular.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Yeah.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I don't want to.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
A solid bill.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
A couple built a cabin in the Blue Ridge mountains for $150,000,

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
without borrowing a cent.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
So that's all liquidity.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Like that's they're also just rich.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Yeah.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
That's what my take was like,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
people put less money down in borrow money.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Meaning they have less money to spend with.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
They still get a house.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Why did you buy a, you whatever?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Yeah.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
I agree with you.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Yes.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Thank you.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
I'm.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I'm sure that I agree with you.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Somebody built a cabin.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Is that the article that we're,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I've never, I've never had to do this on the show.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
What do you mean?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Could you shut up?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
You said it all the time.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
Guys, guess which state drinks the most beer?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Uh, Wisconsin.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
I was going to say Wisconsin.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I was going to say Wisconsin too.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Because of the brewers.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
It's not.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Don't discount Florida.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Most people party animals.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Colorado.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Not the most people.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
First of all.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Yeah.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Most of them.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
For a party.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
For a party.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Most party animals.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
That's a good question.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Was who drinks the most beer?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
And now.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Is it?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
We've got to.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
We've got to.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
We have to consider like most colleges.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Yeah.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
It's going to be per capita.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
And that's for a chance.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Oh, you can.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
The answer is Montana.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Per capita.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
So like they have the least amount of people.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
But they all drink here.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
You're not getting it.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
So per capita.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
It's about how many gallons per capita per year.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Right.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
So the score is 1.66 from Montana.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Followed closely behind.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
But actually wait.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Holy shit.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
I wasn't correct based on the graph.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
It's actually a new Hampshire.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
No way.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Because you had a bad day.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
You gave you one down.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
You saved a side song.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Just kidding around.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Um.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Live for your die.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
That's their thing.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
That's true.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
You don't have to.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
And they.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
You don't have to wear a helmet on a motorcycle there.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Seems wrong.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Kind of cool.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
And they don't have tax on liquor.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
That's true.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
I don't know if that applies to beer as well.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
But city.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
And they have the world's largest.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
And South.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
In Northern Vermont.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
We'll pay.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
I've worked up to get it ran for you.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
There this year.

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
My question to you is what price would you have to be paid to move to a shitty city?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Wait.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Where are these people getting paid?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
What state cities?

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Kansas.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
It's other.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
They're still doing that.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Yes.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
To peak or wear else.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
South Burlington Vermont.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
I would move to South Burlington Vermont if they paid me $100,000.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Yeah.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
It's not shitty.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
It's nice up there.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Exactly right.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
It is cold.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Hmm.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
And it's cold.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Shut up.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
If they bought me a house.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
I'd move kind of anywhere.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
This is open.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Open invitation to anyone that wants to buy me a house.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Yeah.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
I'd need land.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
I don't want cash.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I don't want land.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Marika.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
You have to relax about this land owning nonsense.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
I need cash.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
You can buy land.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
No.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Not 10,000.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Yeah.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
10,000 is nothing.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Maybe you don't know enough.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
Pedro Pascal revealed his Starbucks order and fans are in a frenzy.

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
The highly caffeinated order has fans wondering is this man okay?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
What's the order?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I knew you would ask that.

17:27.000 --> 17:33.000
It's an iced quad espresso in a venti cup with six shots.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
That is a lot.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Yeah.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
So it's not a lot.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
It's not a quad if it's six shots.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Right.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
It's not a quad if it's six shots.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
That's 10 shots of espresso in a venti cup.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
I'm sending some properties that you can get for.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
10,000.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
110k.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
I was wondering why you were ignoring me and.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
This is exciting.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Not really.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
This isn't any.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I don't want property.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
I don't want property.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
I need a house.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
I don't have money to build the house either.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Yeah.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
Well, you don't home depose doing this thing where you can buy like a tiny home for less than 50,000.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
So all you need is land.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
No.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Right.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Okay.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
So you want to.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Right.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
I mean, for sure.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
But you could also be like the guy that built a house on top of a.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
A skip.

18:27.000 --> 18:34.000
I'm going to call it like a garbage bin.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
In England.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Are you saying?

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
There's a guy living out of a garbage can in England.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
This is where you get talking to a policeman.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Quick.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
There's a man.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
He's living out of a garbage can in England.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
It's literally.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
It's a limerick.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
We're incurred.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Yeah.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
That's fine.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
I think is what they would say.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
That's fine.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
There once was a man from Bökshire.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Rulimden like our rich can.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
First.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Sure.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
I was going to say man.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
His man was slamming.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Yeah.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
You know.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
His pockets were slim.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
You know it's a landmark at this point.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
So bad.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
It's real though.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Look it up.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
It seems like he's thriving.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Marika is an englophile.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
I believe anything.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
Any kind of news she has from across the pond.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
I believe.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Yeah.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Let's go back to this Pedro Pascal thing for a second.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
So.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
I, you know, I'm worried about him from that.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I think.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
He seems like he's got his shit together.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Yeah.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
He's fine.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
I did.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
I saw a play that he directed in 2012.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Um.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
That involved.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
The characters digging a hole.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
Are you guys not seeing this or hearing this?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
We're not hearing it.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
We're seeing it in frames.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Yeah.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
It's really choppy.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Oh, this is another genie moose.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
I'll go back to my story though.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Um.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
So Pedro Carlos.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Can you watch the visuals then while you tell your story?

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Yeah.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
The rest got directed to play over the characters.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
We're digging a hole.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Uh, in the ground in dirt, spoiler alert.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
They were trying to bury a dead baby.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Um, but I sat front row.

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
And I got so much dirt on me because they were literally shuffling.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
It's crazy.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
See an n.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Um.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Genie moose.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
This needs to work.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
It wasn't all.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
It was wise cracked up to be.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
That was good.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
That was good.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
That was good.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
He had the umpire repeating his calls.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
You've heard of balls and strikes.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
Well, these are cause with stripes.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Um.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Genie moose.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
I'm going to fucking blow my brains out.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
Or something like that.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Usually it's like.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
How dare you disrespect Genie like that.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
I know.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
What she does, you could never do.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
It felt a little misogynistic at the end.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
What?

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
There's no way why.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
I don't know.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
I just had like an air.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Didn't have an air.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
No air.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
It was just making fun of the way she.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
It has fractures.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
It's.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
It has.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
It has.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
It has.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Yeah.

21:40.000 --> 22:01.000
Welcome to.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Okay.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
The choice.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
Yeah, no we see.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Have you guys ever seen the voice?

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
No.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Yeah.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
I mean,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Familiar with the concept.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
The choice is like the voice,

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
but you don't have to sing if you don't want to.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Yeah.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
Is that a choice?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Make sense.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Yeah.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
For instance.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
All right.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
So who wants to go first with the choice?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Let's.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Let's pick a song any song.

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
I'm going to go with Margaritaville by Jimmy Buffett.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
And I'm going to call people and you have a choice.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
So here we go.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
On you.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
You're up first.

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
I don't know the words.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
What's that?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I don't know the words.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
You don't know the words.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
It's.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
No.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Can I supposed to have started already?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Yeah.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Well, it's.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
I choose not to.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
I choose not to sing.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Is that the game?

23:14.000 --> 23:21.000
That's.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Okay.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
So.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
So how does it hold up the lyrics?

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
No.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
It's just, do you want to sing or not?

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Okay.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
So I didn't.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Okay.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Here we go.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
This is going to be a mirror.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
I'm going to go with.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
The SNL intro song.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Here we go.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
There we go.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
There we go.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Here we go.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
You're here next to that.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Do you want it?

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
Don't DM me for me and some production or I can not do it.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
I'm here.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
It's.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
This is so easy.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
I think it's Saturday night wide.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Wow.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
With Adam Sandler.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
That was pretty good.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
And.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
I said that was pretty good.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
You know, then you stop very early on.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
I don't really want to even give America the choice.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
The chance of the choice, but this is the choice.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Here we go.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
The choice.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Here we go.

24:19.000 --> 24:25.000
This is LA woman from America on the choice.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Why?

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
This is a woman by the door.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Yes.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
I don't know.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Good luck to you, my friend.

24:33.000 --> 24:40.000
I don't think I know the song at all.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
Yeah, it's just not to say.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Really?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Yeah.

24:46.000 --> 24:52.000
Why would you give us a choice?

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
I saw this funny tiktok trend of somebody doing blind karaoke.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
So you don't know what's on with this.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
When you hear the song, it's usually not the song that it's on,

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
like it still fits, because there's only like nine different songs in the world,

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
I guess.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
But that would have been a better version.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Can we do another round?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
No, we can't.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Oh, you want to do another round?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Break a please.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
All right.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Let's take it back to on.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah, here we go.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Oh, fuck.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
This is going to be...

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Well, maybe you don't say the song could be like a surprise.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Just like that.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Okay, I'll try.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
I'll try to guess the song.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
All right.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
And sing it.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Hello.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
I don't know when it comes in.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
That's part of the joy.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
Is it here?

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
It's not.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
It's like, we're minutes away from them singing.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Start for the 90 second intro.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Yeah.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Well, you still have the choice.

26:04.000 --> 26:10.000
Well, I guess we'll wait it out.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
Yeah.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
It's glitching.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Okay.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
I hear it now.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Is it here?

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
No.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Beautiful flute.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
It's pretty beautiful for a karaoke version.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Here you go.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
It's right here.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
It was there.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
There's a lady who's sure.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Right?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
All the glitters is gold.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Correct.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
I'm humiliated.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
I didn't even know.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
All the lyrics.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
She's buying a stairway to heaven.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
How long am I going?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
On you made the choice.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
To sing.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Here we go.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
This is going to be for Marieka.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Um...

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Yeah.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Here we go.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
If we're going to continue to workshop this idea, it would be cool if the choice was...

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
You had to do something else instead.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Because otherwise.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Can you see?

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Five of the dogs.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Early light.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
What's so proudly we hailed?

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
This song is more about the choice than it is about the voice.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
So it's whether you...

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
You all really have to do like the first two lines.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Because then it demonstrates that you made the choice.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Uh...

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Yeah.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Marieka.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
I was scared.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
That was so cool.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
That was so cool.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
It was so cool.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Let's work.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Um...

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Um.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
I'm here.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Here we go.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Yeah.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Here we go.

27:56.000 --> 28:12.000
You chose not to sing, that is the choice.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
So many times signatures.

28:15.000 --> 28:22.000
That was in the ghetto by Elvis Presley.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
That was the lag.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
Because it slowed down and then it sped way back up.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Which doesn't know this is happening.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
But the listeners at home know and we know.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Yeah.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
Cool, deep Elvis cut.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
Time for our next and last segment.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
Oh, a tree or not.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
What are you doing?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
I'm just a tree or not.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
So we're like, they heard that.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
We're all going to take turns rating one sentence poems on the fly slash off the cuff.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Winner takes all.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Unless it's not poetry.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
So we basically, so okay, so I'm going to point.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
So like, so if you guys pointed to me and said it's my turn, right?

29:20.000 --> 29:27.000
So I would say, um, hungry is the victor that doesn't spoil his own appetite.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
And then you would say, is that poetry or is that just sort of nothing?

29:31.000 --> 29:38.000
And then whoever has the most sentences of poetry by the end of this wins.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Does that make sense?

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
I'm not going to pick it apart.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
So let's just get into it.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
Let's start with Marieka since she seems really prepared and excited.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
So three.

29:54.000 --> 30:00.000
I forgot to say that we're doing this in rounds where we all have one minute on the clock.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
So it's how many one sentence poems can you do in a minute?

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
All right.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
And we're going to just say poetry or not as you say your sentence.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
And then whoever has the most poetry versus nause wins that round.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
Ready, three, two, one, Marieka's on the clock.

30:16.000 --> 30:23.000
Water in a glass on the desk.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
No.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Poetry.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
I'm here.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Poetry, yeah.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
All right.

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
What should it?

30:38.000 --> 30:47.000
If I write a poem, am I a poet?

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
Poetry.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
I also say poetry.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
What is it?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Keep going, Marieka.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
You don't have to wait for the last vote.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
It's very slow.

30:59.000 --> 31:07.000
Or not to be that may be the question at hand.

31:07.000 --> 31:15.000
I don't know.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
I don't know.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
But yeah, a lot of the clock.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
To be the streaming service.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
To be or not to be that is the streaming service.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
First of all, that's about a poem.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
I punched it up.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
You got to.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
You only made two poems.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Here we go.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
I'm here for four years.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
You haven't blinked in a minute.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Three, two, one.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
And here's turn.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Here we go.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
Activity, action, and chaos.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Three, demons.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
You must slay in order to become a better person.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Not poetry.

31:45.000 --> 31:51.000
I'm a great house.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Not poetry, no?

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Yeah.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Aphorism, kind of.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
We met in Hatfield County.

31:58.000 --> 32:04.000
And by the time we were married, we had already moved four times in my heart and twice in my head.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Poetry.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Yeah.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Poetry?

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Yeah.

32:10.000 --> 32:16.000
Daddy used to tell me the story of the teeth, the less stories somebody had to say.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
No.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
No.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
No.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
And that is poetry.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Okay.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
No, I think that's prose.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
Yeah.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Anybody can tighten their belt.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
But it takes a real person to fill out their pants.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
No.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Not poetry.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
That's a saying.

32:32.000 --> 32:38.000
So maybe it's hard to write more than two poems per minute.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Yeah.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Maybe you suck.

32:40.000 --> 32:45.000
And you don't roll poetry if it hit you in the fucking head.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Sorry.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
That was my first one.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Did I run out of time?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I brandish a gun like John.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
Do any of you know?

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
We have to.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
My heart.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
We have to move on.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Next game.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
No, I said a poem.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Oh, a poem by heart.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Like do you have one memory?

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Sorry.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
This is on you.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Three, two, one.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Go.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Oh.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
The way Jeff plays these sounds.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
The birds outside can hear them.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
No.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
poem.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Okay.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Okay.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
So that's one.

33:24.000 --> 33:30.000
So many things I wish I could be doing with this hour of my life.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Poem.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
Poem.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
No.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
So what?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Um.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
None of us in this room have read poetry before.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
Are we hearing poetry now?

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
No.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
Offensive but poetry.

33:52.000 --> 33:57.000
Real defensive but poetry is a better poem.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Okay.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Offensive but poetry.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Sounds.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
All right.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Well, that was my.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Okay.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Well, it's my turn.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Oh.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
You played rise from the west.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Yeah.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
That was three.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
All right.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
And here I go.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Sound off.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
The days of camp are gone long.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
No.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
Days of camp are gone long.

34:27.000 --> 34:32.000
Mama never believed in me so I didn't either.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Pros.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Yeah.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
Kind of quarter-way dreams.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
Sounding means.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
There's a rod in my cock.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
No.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Fucked up.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
First two lines.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Yes.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
I love the rod cock part.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
It's a good name for someone.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Punching in Mexico City.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Did I even leave my comfort zone?

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
No.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
No.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
These are poems.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
These are more like first lines.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Two strokes.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
I'm back.

35:07.000 --> 35:14.000
Like I want her to stroke my axe.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
How did I get zero?

35:18.000 --> 35:23.000
I feel like you also like wrote them ahead of time.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
All right.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
She strokes my back.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
And there.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
That's a poem.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Baby shoes for sale never worn.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Kind of vibes.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Mm-hmm.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
That's cool.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
That reference.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
It's apparently not cool.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
No one responded.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Oh, I did.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
I said mm-hmm.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Oh.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Plugs.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
What do you guys got?

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
What do you want to point the people to?

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Who?

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
The floor is all of yours.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Let's start with on you.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Oh, my.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
What did I plug last time I was here?

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
I mean, listen to every head gum show that I work on.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Yeah.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
I stay tuned to the head gum feed because there's going to be where I'm,

36:05.000 --> 36:10.000
I'm personally launching a very exciting show in the next couple months.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
That's awesome.

36:11.000 --> 36:17.000
And you can listen to my radio shows on the radio on wgxc.org.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
The love motel.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Follow us.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
Send us.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
I don't remember.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
I think we might have gotten one submission from a head gum listeners last time.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Yeah.

36:26.000 --> 36:32.000
Send me your love advice questions or regular life advice questions.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
I would love to talk to you all over on the radio.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
They'll love motel.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
The dot love motel on Instagram.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
On the radio.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Mm-hmm.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Uh-uh.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Uh-uh.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Sorry that was a long one.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
I like your plug.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I didn't like your music response.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Marie, go what you got.

36:51.000 --> 36:56.000
Uh, follow me at Marie Gailon on Twitter and Instagram.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
And letter boxed.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Also the pit wall.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Spat.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Listen to that.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Um, it's a lot of fun.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
We're posting episodes every week.

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
So tune in and also read some poetry.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Yeah.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Yeah.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
Turn this off and read some poetry.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Yeah.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Yeah.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Plug.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
At Jeffrey James on Instagram.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
And listen to the pit wall.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000

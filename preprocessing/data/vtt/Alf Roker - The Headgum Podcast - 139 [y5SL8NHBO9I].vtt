00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Alfred, have you heard this joke before?

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
I think I listened to the first half of an app like a month ago.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Why?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
I wasn't for me.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
I wanted to see what it was about,

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
but then I realized it wasn't for me.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
Then why are you so-

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Looks like you're in a spotlight, Jeff.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
The lighting's impeccable.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Well, let's go ahead.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
No, you don't have to say that, man.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
I know you don't mean it.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
I look to shovel that in the shower in the year.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
It works for you.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
You're-

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
This is-

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
We've got Marieka Brown on those acts.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
You've got Riley and Spawn the Facts.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
You've got Alfred Barrel.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
I've been bringing up the rear.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
I'm so excited to have Riley and Marieka on.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
What the fuck?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
I'm just mad.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm jealous because I showered about an hour ago and I look like shit.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
I was telling Jan of before I came on.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
He's like, has Alfred ever been on the pot?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm like, no.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
And Jeff's gonna go hog wild.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Because this is kind of Jeff's domain.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
And Alfred doesn't know what he's getting into.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
I know.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
I am slightly-

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Marieka's world.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
I mean, it kind of is-

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
It's just like you antagonizing me on a daily basis,

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
or a weekly basis.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
It's in Alfred.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Alfred said, I don't know if you can hear it.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
I don't know if Chris is gonna mix it.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
So you can hear it over with the theme song.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
But that you listen to half an episode and decided

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
this show wasn't for you.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Yeah.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Yeah.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
I have to be either.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah, it's gonna say I don't think it's for anyone.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
It's not for anybody.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
No.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
The people that don't even like doing it.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Mm-hmm.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
It's popular though, huh?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Pop, killer.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I'm gonna go-

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
I'm gonna go-

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
I'm gonna go the door of our guest bath.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Definitely.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I don't wanna-

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
I was in a wallgreens this morning,

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
and they were playing-

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Uh, because I knew you.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Okay.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
For good.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Fucking hell.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah, that's the one.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
I'm bad.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
I'm bad.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I just had to get that out before Riley put her headphones on.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
It was gonna be the only thing we could talk about.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
What did you say?

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
I said I was in a wallgreens and they were playing for good.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
And it was really jarring.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Beautiful.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Thank you.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Shower.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
None of us are in the same bed.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Is this like a game show?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I can't remember.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
I was like half listening to it.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Anyway.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
In a way.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
I was the elevator pitch.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I just wrote down yesterday.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Are you ready?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
She seems like you're real.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Yeah, because nobody-

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Nobody knows what this show is, including me.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
So here's what I'm attempting to write it down into a paragraph.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
I like that.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
It's one second, actually.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Sorry.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Yes.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
That's a politics after it's fine.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I just wanted to have this.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Yes.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Uh, it's 45 minutes of chaotic pop culture discussion.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
It's been in mean spirit of games and quizzes and gotcha journalism.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
It's a sensibly between two ferns meets taskmaster.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
I mean, just to just to check in, have you still not watched an episode of taskmaster?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Never in my life.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
I watched it so good.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
So good.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
You like taskmaster being like this?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah, it's great.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
I've never seen taskmaster.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Oh, season seven.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
That's where I'd start.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Really good.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Oh, episode 139.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
It's pretty good.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Of this show.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
And it's in spite of no way of one of the guests.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
No, there's a one of them.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Two of the guests.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
And it's in spite of one of them.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
I would have heard about it if you made that man.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
After 139 episodes of during this show.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Compared to episode one.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yes.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Night and day back.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Okay.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
It was unbelievable.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
We followed going into the show.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
What's that?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
2020, mid-2020 when we started.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
It was like peak pandemic.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
No one knew what was going on.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
We were all inside.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
No vaccine site.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
And I'd never been happier.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
And you were happier.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
And you were happier.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
And you were now.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah, it's harder for us.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Okay.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Let's get this elephant in the room.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Alfred Bartwell Evans on the pod.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Just call me.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
No, you're the elephant in the room.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
That you're wearing.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Get this elephant room.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Fuck you asshole.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
The elephant in the room is that you're wearing a hoodie that bears your name.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yeah.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
It's not a good look.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I'm sorry.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
This is a friend of mine's fathers.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
And he gave it to me as a gift.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Because it's my name.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
I also have two pint glasses and a lunch box.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
That's how.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
That's how Alfred University men's soccer.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
I thought you were somebody you had.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
You had two pint glasses.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
That's a full exhaustive list of every possession I have.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Yeah.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
All right.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
With you.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Not necessarily.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Right.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
That's a pleasure.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Pretty good.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
There's a lot to get to her.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Only if I can get a word in Eduro has Alfred.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
You're the host fan.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Fuck.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
She's good.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
She's good.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Yeah.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
This is great.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Um.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Me.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
You're you're addressing me earlier.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Do you want me to take over?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Wouldn't be the first time.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Oh.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Am I right?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Come on.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Fucking at least drowning.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
How has the transition been for y'all?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Better than ever.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
It's been hilarious.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I think it's better than when I was.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
It was like, it's night and day.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
It's like your mental.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Night and day.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
It's like a person was like, oh, what's the point?

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
And now I'm like, oh, that's the point.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
It's the thing.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
It's most interesting.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
It's the guests who are frankly begging to come on.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
No.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
No.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Of the show.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
And it's coming out of nowhere.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Now that Jeff's gone.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
They're like, oh, yeah.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Now look at it.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Yeah.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I've been BC seeing me on that.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I guess bragging.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
I never thought Al Roker would express interest.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Right after he recovered too.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
It's like the first thing he wants to do back in the spotlight.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
That was story.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Wrong avenue.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I think to tell the story.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Tell the story through long form improvisation.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
We could do like further channels or something.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
I saw Al Roker in waitress the musical.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Was he the old man?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Yeah.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
That's amazing.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Oh, yeah.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
What about Al Roker?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Al Roker.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Al if you're breaking up.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I didn't say shit.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
You're grainy and like.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
I'm not talking.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Oh.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
I think that's just like interference or whatever.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
I actually haven't said anything for a while.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Jeff, you were addressing Maria.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I want to hear what you were going to say.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Oh, I said, what about Alf Roker?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
No.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
No.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
We're trying to make it past that.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
You're trying to move fast.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Yeah.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Maria, how's your 2023?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
I saw you on New Year's day.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
We got dinner.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
That's true.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Today.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
And that was wondering.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Like how things been going in the last 20 through days.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Um.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
They've been up.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
They've been down.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
We also saw Maria at the head.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
I'm happy hour.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Yeah.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
That's true.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
But we could go on.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Yeah.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
I saw her mug.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Oh, kind of.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Sorry.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
I don't know if.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Let's.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
We did.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
We did have drinks.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
But we had.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Mine wasn't a snowman.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
No.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Mug.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Which was pretty cool.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
And Jeff did pay for it.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
That's nice.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Which is all I can really ask for.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
So for that.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
That's the fuck up.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
For that.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
For that.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
For that.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
For that.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Great.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
So Jeff hate for the drink.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
That's nice.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Yeah.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
For the drink.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
So.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
And yeah.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
You did a nice thing.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
And that way.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
My year started.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Fine.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Jeff.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Shut the fuck up.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Really uncomfortable.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I'm really uncomfortable right now.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Yeah.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
It's just what it's all about.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
I'm sorry.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
I'm sorry.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
It's just 45 minutes.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
He'll be uncomfortable.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Yeah.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I'm not.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
This is like the vibe of the show is supposed to be joy and wisdom.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Jeff, we're about to quarter away through this thing.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
How do you think it's going?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
It's going.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
I mean, people are going to love it.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
But I'm having a bad time.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
What would make you have a good time?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
I don't know.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
Like be, you know, getting to some of the material that I fucking painstaking the outline.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Okay.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Well, you.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
You've asked me how my year is going.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
I want to hear it.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
It's been a while.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I thought you would drink on New Year's Day Eve.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
And you said it was fine.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
I said my year started off fine.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
What do you, what else do you want?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
I thought it was a fun dinner.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I thought it was a fun dinner.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
It was a fun dinner.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
It was.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I'm just saying that, you know,

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
the day overall was okay.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
Riley and Alfred, what did you guys do on New Year's Eve?

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
Um, I went to the ER.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
What happened?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
With that night, I'm fine.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
And I'm party with Daniels.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
I thought I had a blood clot in my head.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
But did you?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Why did you think you had a blood clot?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Because I felt like kind of pain.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Like in my thigh that I've never felt before.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
And it was getting worse and worse.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And Daniel and I were Googling.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
And I'm like, it might be a blood clot.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
And we went to ER, which was very open.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Not a lot of people there at 7 p.m.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
on New Year's Eve and in Evan's vanilla noise.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Um, I did.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
They were like, it's not a blood clot taken aspirin.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
And I remember I was in, and I'm like,

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
I'm like, hey, so obviously my health comes first.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
This is not a big deal.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
But um, if I go to a party and if I want to go,

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
yeah, no, it doesn't matter.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
And they're like, you want to know if you can have a drink

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
with aspirin.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I'm like, yeah, but obviously health is the priority.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
And they're like, I'll ask the doctor.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
And I'm like stupid, stupid.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
And then they're like, the doctor says take take an aspirin

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
and have a drink.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
It's New Year's.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
And I'm like, okay.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
The doctor tried to kill you.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Doctors orders.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Thank you.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Can I have a better help sponsorship on this thing?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Yeah.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Yeah.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Thank you.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
It might be fitting.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
If you want to put it in there.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
I think it's pretty cute.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
A cute or cute.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
I'm cute.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
A cute.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
As I'm like, notice a bar set.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I'll think I'm cute.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Yeah.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
That's what I like.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Play the game.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I'm going to play the game or whatever.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
How much do you do on New Year's Eve?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I set up all night.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Going to the different E.R.s and lying about having a bluff.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
I've played the game whenever the hell.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Well, he didn't actually give a straight answer.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
I can't just wear a family shirt with your namesake on it.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
And then avoid questions.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Honestly, a talk show.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
Riley has been coming at me, but she's been answering the questions.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I've been doing neither.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
If you let me speak, I can give you an answer.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Would you like to hear?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah, it's here.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
I was with my family.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
And we played a board game.

11:16.000 --> 11:24.000
And until about 11.45, at which point I turned on Dick Clark's rocking New Year's Eve on the television.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Wrong title.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
And we watched the last 15 minutes of that.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
The ball went down.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
That's not bad.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
I had a glass of non-alcoholic shardine.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
It's disgusting.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
In a champagne flute.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
That's grape juice.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
To be clear.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
No, it was worse.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
It tasted really bad.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
And then I was in bed by a tiny 1215.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
That's beautiful.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Can I ask what board game you played?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Wing span.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
I don't know.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Is that a board game?

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
It's just stretch out your arms and see who has the longest one.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Well, I would win that game as I won Wing span.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
It's a game of fighting.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Alfred, you have to relax your shoulders.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
An entire body because your head is moving waxily.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
But the rest of your body looks stiff as a board.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
I don't know what I've done.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
To not foster camaraderie joy wisdom and liveness.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Yeah, there you go.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
The first shit you did when I got on the call was start criticizing.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
On to the week.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
My band at the first.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I have to go first.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
My band at the time.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
I have to find where to go.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Every week, Marieka keeps going.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Can I go first?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
That's not true at all.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
The best two weeks you've said, can I go first?

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
It's probably because you took so long to get into the segment.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Okay.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Who is your band of the week?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Joey King.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Nice.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
That's really good.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
That's really good.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
She did us all a service.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
And at the end of the day, that's all I can ask for.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
And I think she'd be a great bond.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Well, here's that.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
My thing is that I don't think she actually hooked up with him.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
You know.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Because there's like no evidence.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
People just decided they thought that they hooked up.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Because they were just doing a press tour.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
And then they were like, they fucked.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I'm like, I don't know if they did.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
I'll find you could go.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
I can see.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Here's the thing.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
I have a question.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
I have a question.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Yeah, I got it.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Here's the thing.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
I have a question.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
I have a question.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Yeah, I got it.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Whatever.

13:37.000 --> 13:44.000
Do you ever explain segments on the show or just die fucking in as if everyone in the audience has heard the show before?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Bond of the week is okay.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
So Daniel Craig is out as bond.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
And so every week until the next 007 is cast, we're loving up our pick for the next James.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
So who would you cast as the next James Bond?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
That was a really good elevator pitch.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Why don't you could just slot that in.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Go, because you're ready.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
And then Alfred give Riley the floor.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Terran, Edrickton.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Okay.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
That's really good.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
When did you launch a man recently?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
I didn't want to recently.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
I've just been thinking about it a lot.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
And I know this in Austin Butler discourse.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Because it's like, where are Terran, Edrickton's flowers?

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
He made the best music biopic in a really long time.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
And we asked Jeffrey.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
What about Todd, Edrickton?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Like cock.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Like the British slang term for cock.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Todd, you're, is that the joke that you're making?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Yeah.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Have you been like it?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yeah.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
It's like in the hairy.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Yeah.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I put it on my torture.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Thank you, Riley.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
My penis is oscillating between freezing cold and burning cold.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
And then he gets mad on cold bear for him bringing it up.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
You wrote it.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
I made my mother.

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
I'm fucking sorry, Harry.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
You're mom's dead, by the way.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
So don't, it woke her when talking about your.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
I'm sorry, Alfred, but for lack of better term.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Fang.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
How could you apologize to me?

15:12.000 --> 15:21.000
My bond, I guess, is Tom Hanks in a man called Otto.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
So Tom Hanks adds Otto as Otto.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Yeah.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Otto from a man called Otto as played by Tom Hanks.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
Can you say bond, the name's bond, James Bond, and as doing an impression of that?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Sure.

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
Tom Hanks famously easy to impressions such as a stink voice.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Oh, grumpy grumpy grumpy.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
My name's a bond.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
James Bond.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
That was really bad.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Have you seen it?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Have you seen a man called Otto?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I haven't, but that doesn't sound wrong.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
I haven't seen it.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Have you seen the commercial?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
No.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
And you wouldn't know.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
It just doesn't sound like Tom Hanks.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
You guys have seen it.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
You think it was good?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
I haven't seen it.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
I haven't seen it.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
I haven't seen it.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
But I watched the trailer.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
I haven't seen the trailer.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
I don't know.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Thank you.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Thank you.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
He's a grumpy.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
He's right.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
He went grumpy.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
He went grumpy.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
He went grumpy.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
He went grumpy.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
He went grumpy.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
He went grumpy.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Tom Hanks.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
I was just going to say he just doesn't.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
He doesn't sound the same in every movie.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Okay.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Elvis?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
That was a choice.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
So you don't know that he doesn't have an accent or a funny voice.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
A man called Otto.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Do you?

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
It would be famous, my boy.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Jeff, did you see Elvis?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Bond.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Yeah.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I don't know.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
And you also pop culture shows.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Who's your bond?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
I'm on the weekend.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
I'm on the weekend.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I was just going to say it.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
When he said, it was a pop culture show.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
I've got the same way.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Yeah.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
We bring up pop culture stuff.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
I don't know.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Yeah.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
I don't know.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Bring it up.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
And I try to bring stuff up and you shut it down.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
It's kind of how it works.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
So all the time.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Who's your bond?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
There it is.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Wow.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
I don't want to.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
My bond of the week is Alfred Bardwell Evans.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Oh.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Alfred Bond.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
She's really good.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Because.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
Sorry, but Aaron Taylor Johnson's not the only white guy with three names.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
Who says no?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
What?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Alfred, would you like to play Bond?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Sure.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
That paycheck.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
I'm sure.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
That's the reason.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
What would you like?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Can I do like?

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Do you like martini shake and not stirred like as Bond like earnestly?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Well, I don't know.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I got to say Riley just saying that straight was actually pretty good.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
No, but like do it like you're as Bond like as earnestly as you can.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Okay.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
I can do that.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Camera's rolling.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Crowd on set.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Sound speeds.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Camera's speeds.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
And action.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Bucky.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Or you bad.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
Top of the morning, my man.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
You're making me in the morning.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Hi, fancy.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Breakfast martini.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
It's just martini.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Almost got it.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
Shaking.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Not sad.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Oh, kind of cheeky.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
You redeemed it at the end.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Yeah.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Yeah.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
What you jealous though, that just aren't relevant to the scene to the movie.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Raise a lot of concern for James doing his job as a sponsor.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Why do you think I should be Bond?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
He's bad at his job.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
I said, well, you should be Bond.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
You're a white guy with three names.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
That's pretty good reason.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
That's fair.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
I'm going to go with a lot of the shit you say.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
But that's pretty good reason.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
Uh, we'd have to move on to news of the day.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Oh, fuck.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
I'm going.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Thank God.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
Why doesn't anybody ever try to enjoy the show?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
I'm going to blast.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
I genuinely try every time.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Okay.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Well, I have a great time every time I come on.

19:15.000 --> 19:24.000
Uh, M&M's announced that my root of is the new face of the company after an indefinite pause hit the classic spokes candies.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
What do you guys think of the why?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Why?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Why?

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Why?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Do you want me to read the official thing?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Yes.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Please.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
All right.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
Back last to the highly sexualized green M&M or something.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
Um, so here is the, uh, just changed her shoes.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
That's all.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Yeah.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
That's all they did.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Yeah.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
And then like a bunch of Republicans were like, M&M's went.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Whoa.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
I don't want to fuck anymore.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Did you before?

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
What's the news?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Um, she's not on heels.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
I don't want to tap that thing.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
And that anyway.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I was going to say an M&M.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Forget it.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Let's talk.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
And the last year we've made some changes to our beloved spokes candies.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
We weren't sure if anyone would even notice.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
And we definitely didn't think it would break the internet.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
But now we get it.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Even a candy's shoes can be polarizing.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Which was the last thing I have an M's wanted.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
This is where all about bringing people together.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
There are four.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
We've decided to take an indefinite pause from the spokes candies.

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
In their place, we are proud to introduce a spokesperson, American, a can agree on.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Beloved Maya Rudolph.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
We are confident Ms. Rudolph will champion the power of fun to create a world where everyone

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
feels like they belong.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
You know what my first thought was?

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Not everyone can agree on Rudolph.

20:45.000 --> 20:53.000
No, my first thought was what is going to happen to the commercial before AMC movies,

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
where it's the M&M's as spies.

20:58.000 --> 21:07.000
They're like, I don't remember the actual joke of this commercial that I've seen a million times.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
I remember like Christmas one.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
The Christmas one.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Yes.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Do you want to be the peanut M&M and I'll be Santa.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Do a little re-enactment.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
I'm talking to me.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Yeah.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Sure.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I don't really remember what they say.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I'm also fucking a reminder.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
I'll do both.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
The peanut M&M goes.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
To say they like run into Santa.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
Like he's like about to eat the cookies and the peanut M&M goes.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
He's real.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
And then Santa goes.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
They're real.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
My question was who he better than Maya?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
M&M?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Be funny, right?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Sorry.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Everything just stopped for me.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
So it wasn't that I wasn't laughing.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
It was just it said you're in an act.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Connections on stable.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Which I don't think it is.

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
That's just my poison.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Infiltrating fiber.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
I disagree.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Oh, Jeffrey, take a little nap.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yeah.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Well, the sun was in my eyes.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Which at first was good lighting, but it was starting to get hot.

22:21.000 --> 22:29.000
Uh, LeBron James is an estimated nine games away from breaking the NBA's all-time scoring record passing cream of dual jubar.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
What record do you guys think you could actually break?

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
Because I think I could swim around the world in the 80 laps.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
Do you do that in the 80 laps?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Yeah, like sort of what?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
What do you mean?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Do you mean like drugs?

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah, freestyle ideally.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
They get tired a little bit of rest.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
Ask 80 laps of a meter length.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Whatever.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
A hundred meter length.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Olympic swimming pool.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
I think I could make it across the whole damn ocean.

22:59.000 --> 23:04.000
I think I could genuinely break a record for how many lemon spin drifts

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
consumed in a lifetime.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
In a lifetime.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
So you want to earn it as you die.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Uh-huh.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
A positive as Guinness.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Well, record.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Mm-hmm.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
That's cool.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
That one I could genuinely break, I think.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
That's that.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I don't doubt you could do that.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Alfred, Maria.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Pretty amazing.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Clementine's eaten in a single day.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
Oh, so what?

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
What number do you think it would be?

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
I mean, I feel like an order.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
Well, I think that like no one's set directly.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
It's not.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
I feel like no one's set the record.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
Like it's not officially on the books.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
Um, so I feel like I could start low and if someone tried to beat me,

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
then I'd have to go like non-stop in a Clementine's for the whole day.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
But I think you could do like 12, and that would be fine.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Yeah.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Yeah.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
And I would.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
And I have.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Get scurvy.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
That's true.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
I will say that Riley and I shot a web series pilot years ago

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
that never aired.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
And I had to eat a bunch of comquats.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Oh, yeah.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
I love comquats.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
And I've also done that.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
I had so many.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
And I just.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
You got sick.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
I had some.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Yeah, some digestive issues.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Obviously.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
So just be careful with the Clementine's brought me.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Well, remember.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Remember when.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
Remember when my mom sent me grapes in the mail.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Yeah.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
This year.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Yeah, this year.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
She sent me a comquats.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
But I did ask for them this time.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
And they arrived.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
They arrived in good condition.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
And I'm good face.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
And I did eat.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Almost all of them.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
There was a lot.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
A lot of no comquats.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
Um.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Alfred, what record do you think you could actually read?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
It looks so bored.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Leeds to mount a fun hat on a podcast.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Yeah.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Let's swear.

25:08.000 --> 25:17.000
X is Sean Penn and Robin Wright seen in Los Angeles spending more time together.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
The pair were married from 1996 to 2010.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
What's going on, guys?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Do you think they're back together?

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
What's that?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Yeah, maybe they're right together.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
I auditioned for a movie.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
That Robin Wright was directing.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
And I didn't get it.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
You didn't get it.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Call back?

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
No.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
That sucks.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Next time.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Mm-hmm.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Better look.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Yeah.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
I watched a movie starring Robin Wright and Colin Farrell.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
Directed by Michael Mayor who directed Spray Awakening.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
American Idiot.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
A bunch of great stuff.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Change my life.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
Uh, it's, it's a great film.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
I recommend.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
By the way, this is how Marieka brings up pop culture.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
So it's like, how are you supposed to respond to that?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Like, the only thing you can say is, oh, cool.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
No.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
I could talk.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
I love spring awakening.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Yeah.

26:13.000 --> 26:18.000
Are you going to try and see Jonathan Graff in Marley when a transverse

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
to Broadway?

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
You saw it.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Oh, I'm so jealous.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Where's it as good as I wanted to be?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
It was pretty good.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
It was.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Yeah.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I had a good time.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Pretty good.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
It's going to work.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
I see.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
I see.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
I do think it's going to last.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
I think, I mean, I think it has such a big draw right now.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Yeah.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
Building up so much hype that I do think it's going to last.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
I think I, I mean, I assume all of the birth transfering.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
But I think they are all scheduled to transfer.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
I think my guess would be the Daniel goes first.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Yeah.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
But he's, he's so good in it.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Oh, my bad.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
My favorite song.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
If you can believe.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
I can't believe.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
And I don't know you, but I can believe.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Money?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
No, I like money a lot.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I mean, it's better than that.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
I love that show, man.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
It's so good.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Really?

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
I can't wait for the movie.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
It's a great question, Riga.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
And I would also love to talk the Marley movie.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I also, I think my favorite part about what's happening right now.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Was that Jeff knows nothing?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
That's why I'm trying to keep it.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
And we know we know Jeff's favorite song.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Hi, musical is Saturday night.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
So we can move on from that.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
We don't have to ask him.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Ryan, I think.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
My is a little night music and into the woods.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Like, it's got to be both of us.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
I am in the introduction of a little.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
And I, I haven't seen a production of a little night music.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
But I did watch a film version.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
A film like a, like a film adaptation or a stage.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Like the performance had been filmed.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
I really think it was just a movie.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Like not, not a stage.

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
Was there any actors of note in there or was it unknown?

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Let me see.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
It's like one of the older films.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
It's from 1973.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Wow.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
It's a sort of contemporaneous to the.

28:24.000 --> 28:32.000
I think I saw that one.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Yeah.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Oh, that one.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
That one.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Yeah.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Oh, that one.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
My favorite home assassins.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Oh, my love.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
God.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
And he loves us.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
He jails.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Can't stop grinning amid.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Affair allegations.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
This was him yesterday.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
He's holding two phones.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
That is true.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
One.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
One.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
One per affair.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Um.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Yeah.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
And you know what?

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
We had a genie moves thing.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
But I'm going to cut it.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
We don't need to watch another one of those.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
We'd have to take a break, though.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Oh.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Oh.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Yeah.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Oh.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Oh.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Oh.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Oh.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Oh.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Oh.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Uh.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Um.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
We do have to do it.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
What's that?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
No one said anything.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
Oh, car.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
We could talk more.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
You want someone to comment on the fact that you did a German.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Accent.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
I was going to start the clock on a murdicous druthers.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
So it is time for.

29:38.000 --> 29:44.000
Uh.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
Greka's brothers, what meaning you can keep talking about what you were just talking about.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Well, I had just scripted.

29:50.000 --> 29:58.000
That reminds me that at one point, I asked you what that sound clip was from because I was spiraling

29:58.000 --> 30:05.000
down if thing were like, I, I was listening to the Sunheim musical, the frogs.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I love the frogs.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.660
and the overture is like a fanfare

30:09.660 --> 30:12.260
that I recognized and I couldn't figure out

30:12.260 --> 30:14.200
where it was from and I thought maybe it was from this.

30:14.200 --> 30:18.220
It wasn't, but it was from comedy-bang-bang,

30:18.220 --> 30:20.720
which really upset me.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.400
Maria, do you remember in Smash when I forget

30:24.400 --> 30:26.720
who in the show, Christian Borle was dating,

30:26.720 --> 30:28.200
but they were like, who do you famous on him?

30:28.200 --> 30:29.040
What do you famous on him?

30:29.040 --> 30:30.240
He's like, and Christian Borle, I'll never get,

30:30.240 --> 30:33.400
he's like, the frogs, and they're like,

30:33.400 --> 30:35.240
no, what are you talking about?

30:35.240 --> 30:38.160
He's like, I don't know.

30:38.160 --> 30:39.480
Jeff, do you remember that?

30:39.480 --> 30:41.560
Yeah, did you watch Smash, Jeff?

30:41.560 --> 30:42.600
Well, it's a Marieka's brother,

30:42.600 --> 30:44.000
so I'm not really supposed to talk for these things.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.280
Oh, that's great.

30:45.280 --> 30:46.440
Yeah, that's good.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.400
How did you watch Smash?

30:49.400 --> 30:50.240
I didn't.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.520
I think I wouldn't have enjoyed it,

30:51.520 --> 30:53.880
but I feel like now it's probably too late to really get

30:53.880 --> 30:54.720
much out of it.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.080
You think it's worth the money, really?

30:57.240 --> 30:58.080
You can go back?

30:58.080 --> 31:01.560
Yeah, I feel like people are watching Glee now,

31:01.560 --> 31:03.240
which is, yeah.

31:03.240 --> 31:05.480
Concerning, just for the culture.

31:07.040 --> 31:09.200
So I feel like you have a right to watch Smash,

31:09.200 --> 31:10.040
if you want to.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.760
Thank you for giving me that permission.

31:12.760 --> 31:16.080
Yeah, I loved Glee at the time.

31:16.080 --> 31:17.480
Were you guys glad?

31:17.480 --> 31:20.320
Season's, seasons one and two.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.760
Jesse St. James and Icon.

31:24.080 --> 31:25.480
Pretty good.

31:25.480 --> 31:26.640
The war blurs?

31:27.880 --> 31:28.720
Oh, Jeff's out of this.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.360
Is this boring you?

31:30.360 --> 31:31.200
Yeah.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.520
Okay, I'm being honest.

31:35.520 --> 31:36.920
Yeah, I appreciate it.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.000
Did you guys watch any of the like,

31:40.880 --> 31:45.880
Broadway web series that existed back in the day?

31:46.280 --> 31:47.160
There was like,

31:50.480 --> 31:53.120
I think some of my videos are playable videos.

31:53.760 --> 31:55.920
Some of them were connected to that,

31:55.920 --> 31:57.600
but there was like a series.

31:57.600 --> 31:59.400
So there's one called The Batteries Down,

31:59.400 --> 32:01.120
which was done by a bunch of you,

32:01.120 --> 32:05.760
the Mishkids, like Andrew Keenan-Boldger,

32:05.760 --> 32:09.240
and a Pacek and Paul, like we're involved

32:09.240 --> 32:11.360
and that was like a musical web series.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.480
That one's iconic.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.880
A lot of great cameo's there.

32:16.920 --> 32:20.040
Just such an Andrew Keenan-Boldger head.

32:20.040 --> 32:25.040
He loves the, yeah, he loves Andrew's blog.

32:25.960 --> 32:26.960
Yeah, for sure.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.400
Which was also a great one.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.480
Anyone comments on the YouTube video

32:32.480 --> 32:36.240
or the Reddit about what you're talking about?

32:36.240 --> 32:39.360
If anyone recognizes this as a piece of media,

32:39.360 --> 32:40.760
I'll give you $40.

32:42.520 --> 32:44.640
No one knows what you're talking about.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.280
On this year or in the year.

32:46.280 --> 32:48.920
I mean, yeah, I know it's,

32:49.920 --> 32:53.080
I've recently realized that a lot of songs

32:53.080 --> 32:54.760
that I took the time to memorize

32:54.760 --> 32:57.480
and like high school early college

32:57.480 --> 32:59.480
that were like theater songs have

32:59.480 --> 33:02.880
the YouTube videos, have like 1,000 views.

33:04.240 --> 33:06.320
And then you, and then you think about that

33:06.320 --> 33:10.880
in retrospect to like this podcast gets 10,000 views.

33:10.880 --> 33:11.720
Right.

33:11.720 --> 33:12.960
Sometimes on videos that I'm like,

33:12.960 --> 33:16.160
what was I, what are any of us doing really?

33:16.160 --> 33:19.400
Yeah, it's really upsetting.

33:19.400 --> 33:23.400
What's your favorite, like, really obscure musical?

33:24.800 --> 33:27.760
Well, my favorite musical is,

33:27.760 --> 33:30.040
I mean, he's a called called Los Estrada Jones,

33:31.320 --> 33:32.920
which isn't, right now.

33:32.920 --> 33:33.760
Yeah, it's.

33:33.760 --> 33:34.600
Jeff does.

33:34.600 --> 33:35.440
Yeah.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.120
Jeff was in it, I think.

33:38.120 --> 33:38.960
Yeah.

33:39.960 --> 33:40.960
Who did you play again?

33:40.960 --> 33:42.800
Jeff sing one of the songs.

33:42.800 --> 33:45.240
It's like, Los Estrada Jones.

33:48.240 --> 33:50.120
In this Greco house,

33:51.600 --> 33:55.400
positano pens, made of linen now.

33:57.840 --> 34:01.400
It's like, this sort of coastal Italy thing.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.400
It was in Greco.

34:03.400 --> 34:08.120
Well, you know, yeah, I think that was moving.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.120
It is moving.

34:09.120 --> 34:09.400
It is moving.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.000
What's the ton of pants?

34:21.000 --> 34:23.120
She's more of Marieka's brothers, right?

34:23.120 --> 34:25.240
I'm trying to take a back seat and you're not really

34:25.240 --> 34:26.080
fine.

34:26.080 --> 34:31.000
Well, my God, this is how the Jones was about college

34:31.000 --> 34:33.960
basketball team that had a won a game in 30 years.

34:33.960 --> 34:37.040
So all of the two leaders who naturally were dating

34:37.040 --> 34:41.600
all basketball players with held sex until they won a game.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.120
I actually do know this.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.200
Yeah, yeah.

34:44.200 --> 34:48.440
As in the playlist of Strada, it's great.

34:48.440 --> 34:52.080
Highly recommend, yeah, positano Broadway

34:52.080 --> 34:54.000
for a 30 something days.

34:54.000 --> 34:54.840
I love it.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.800
There are a lot of them on Spotify.

34:56.800 --> 35:01.840
There is an album, it's really fun.

35:01.840 --> 35:05.400
Like poppy songs.

35:05.400 --> 35:08.840
Yeah, glory days, one of my other favorite musicals

35:08.840 --> 35:12.280
written by the guy that wrote this musical,

35:13.520 --> 35:17.520
which famously closed on its opening night on Broadway.

35:17.520 --> 35:18.360
Oh, there he is.

35:18.360 --> 35:19.200
Yeah, you see it.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.560
Cause of COVID or no?

35:20.560 --> 35:22.080
No, this was in 2008.

35:22.080 --> 35:22.920
Got it.

35:23.880 --> 35:26.160
Yeah, low ticket sales for sure for sure.

35:26.160 --> 35:30.760
Shouldn't have opened when it did openly in the season.

35:30.760 --> 35:34.280
In a bad venue and it was a show about college, boys

35:34.280 --> 35:39.800
that were going to college and facing the crisis

35:39.800 --> 35:41.960
of growing up.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.600
But you know, I love it.

35:43.600 --> 35:47.280
If I saw it, I had literally burst into tears.

35:47.280 --> 35:49.280
It's a great show.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.280
59 seconds left.

35:53.280 --> 35:58.080
Were you guys as favorite musicals that are obscure musicals?

35:58.080 --> 35:59.680
Oh, my favorite year.

36:03.280 --> 36:05.280
Do you want to give us a taste?

36:05.280 --> 36:08.080
My favorite year.

36:10.480 --> 36:13.640
And everything is linen now.

36:13.640 --> 36:15.360
That's less as, yeah.

36:15.360 --> 36:19.040
I mean, obviously you're wasting the 59 seconds.

36:19.040 --> 36:22.080
That I would have preferred to hear what out further,

36:22.080 --> 36:23.960
Riley at the say.

36:23.960 --> 36:25.920
Thank you, Riley.

36:25.920 --> 36:27.800
I'm trying to think, I'm trying to think

36:27.800 --> 36:31.360
what I've been listening to lately.

36:31.360 --> 36:32.640
I've been getting back in a motel debt

36:32.640 --> 36:35.280
because the movie movie was so good.

36:35.280 --> 36:36.800
That was so good.

36:36.800 --> 36:37.800
Good.

36:40.280 --> 36:42.640
I've been getting to know the cyclone.

36:42.640 --> 36:43.400
Oh, I saw it.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.480
I just said, you asked the only country

36:45.480 --> 36:47.480
that didn't get a theatrical release of motel debt.

36:47.480 --> 36:48.320
I did.

36:48.320 --> 36:50.400
I did know that because I was very insane.

36:50.400 --> 36:51.200
I remember that stuff.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.200
They did it.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.840
Oh, that was hard.

36:53.840 --> 36:59.120
You didn't get me something to do with you.

36:59.120 --> 37:05.360
I saw it at the cyclone before Taylor Louderman left the show.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.600
I have also, yeah.

37:07.600 --> 37:11.840
I get that her songs like Madeleine.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.760
We can move on, but I had a great time.

37:18.320 --> 37:27.120
Welcome to, what should I even call this?

37:27.120 --> 37:28.880
Review review review.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.880
Okay.

37:30.880 --> 37:32.920
Now I'm interested.

37:32.920 --> 37:33.920
Yeah.

37:33.920 --> 37:34.920
Absolutely.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.560
Now it's about me.

37:36.560 --> 37:37.560
All right.

37:37.560 --> 37:38.560
I might be in this part.

37:38.560 --> 37:39.560
Give it to me.

37:39.560 --> 37:40.560
What's up?

37:40.560 --> 37:41.840
We're going to laugh at no matter what I said

37:41.840 --> 37:43.600
because you thought it would be funny to start

37:43.600 --> 37:45.640
getting on board at the last minute.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.920
I feel like I've been a bad sport this whole time.

37:48.880 --> 37:51.360
That's part for the course for the show.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.600
I think that was the, you weren't being a bad sport.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.160
You were just reacting appropriately to what you've been given.

37:56.160 --> 38:00.400
This is probably the worst show for you guys to do promo on

38:00.400 --> 38:02.480
because I feel like everyone who listens to review review

38:02.480 --> 38:05.840
listens to the show and everybody listens to your guys to show.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.840
But at the same time, if anyone hasn't heard of it,

38:07.840 --> 38:11.040
do you guys want to soft-pitch or hard-pitch the show

38:11.040 --> 38:13.600
before we get into this segment?

38:13.600 --> 38:15.680
If you have, if you're listening to the show

38:15.680 --> 38:17.440
and haven't listened to a review review,

38:17.440 --> 38:18.320
the might be possible to show.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.880
I think it's a lot more listeners than review does.

38:20.880 --> 38:22.480
That's fine.

38:23.280 --> 38:26.560
Basically, we take any topic literally ever.

38:26.560 --> 38:30.160
Today we did Cafe Nero, which is going to be coming up soon.

38:30.160 --> 38:33.680
We've done Universal Studios Hollywood, Martin L.

38:33.680 --> 38:34.800
Sparkling Sider, anything.

38:34.800 --> 38:36.480
We read reviews of this thing from the internet

38:36.480 --> 38:39.600
and then we do long from improv based on those reviews.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.240
Sometimes, I guess.

38:42.240 --> 38:43.440
It's a great idea.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.440
I think Jeff might have short-during memory loss.

38:45.440 --> 38:48.160
Because Jeff was a co-host and we made the show together

38:48.160 --> 38:50.480
and he was over three years.

38:50.480 --> 38:51.680
And then it was only this past year.

38:51.680 --> 38:55.280
That Jeff stepped down and Alfred stepped up.

38:56.480 --> 38:57.360
I wasn't going to step down.

38:57.360 --> 38:58.320
He was the dad who stepped up.

39:03.360 --> 39:05.120
I've never heard that before before.

39:05.120 --> 39:07.520
I've never heard that before.

39:07.520 --> 39:08.560
I love it.

39:08.560 --> 39:11.200
Well, I mean, so I thought we could just do

39:11.200 --> 39:13.680
a mini review review segment.

39:13.760 --> 39:16.160
But Marieka, since you've never been a part of the show,

39:16.160 --> 39:18.400
I don't want to like travel by fire you here.

39:18.400 --> 39:22.800
So why don't we do Riley, me, and Alfred will do the segment.

39:22.800 --> 39:24.800
And Marieka, you can call the scene.

39:24.800 --> 39:26.320
How about that?

39:26.320 --> 39:26.720
Great.

39:26.720 --> 39:28.800
I'd love for you to not be involved in the improv.

39:28.800 --> 39:29.200
Yeah.

39:30.160 --> 39:30.800
That's fair.

39:30.800 --> 39:33.280
And I think all of the audience would agree as well.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.800
It's not even because Marieka doesn't want to do it.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.880
Jeff just really doesn't want to do it.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.240
Oh, my god.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.280
Yeah, very good.

39:40.560 --> 39:43.360
So this, I thought it would be fun to do a review of the show

39:43.360 --> 39:47.440
post, my departure post, Alfred's arrival.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.720
Were you listening to an old episode of that?

39:50.720 --> 39:51.280
Good podcast?

39:52.480 --> 39:56.720
No, I just haven't opened the Apple podcast app in years.

39:56.720 --> 39:57.280
All right.

39:57.280 --> 40:01.600
Um, I guess since May 14, 2021, here it is.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.680
Uh, five stars of review review.

40:03.680 --> 40:05.600
Uh, this is on Apple podcast.

40:05.600 --> 40:09.360
Uh, this comes in from Nickname, KS already taken.

40:09.360 --> 40:12.480
Uh, Alfred, do you want to give them a nickname?

40:13.520 --> 40:15.520
Uh, sure.

40:15.520 --> 40:17.440
It's KS their initials.

40:17.440 --> 40:18.480
Is that Riley?

40:18.480 --> 40:20.640
What do you, you, you should facilitate this.

40:20.640 --> 40:21.520
I don't know how this works.

40:21.520 --> 40:22.320
Kevin Slime.

40:23.200 --> 40:23.840
There we go.

40:23.840 --> 40:24.880
That's Kevin Slime.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.720
Five stars title is new host.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.680
Better than that other crooked old fart.

40:34.640 --> 40:34.960
All right.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.640
I didn't read this before we started.

40:36.640 --> 40:39.840
So is this, it almost sounds like, oh, he's a crooked old fart, but he's

40:39.840 --> 40:41.360
better than the other crooked old fart.

40:44.320 --> 40:45.520
Yeah, does that make sense?

40:45.520 --> 40:48.960
I'm just kind of reeling because I didn't read the review.

40:48.960 --> 40:49.760
You didn't read it before.

40:49.760 --> 40:51.120
I just opened Apple podcast.

40:52.320 --> 40:53.600
Do you want to do the improv or no?

40:56.160 --> 40:58.960
Maybe if you guys start it and then all kind of like,

40:58.960 --> 41:01.120
we could find a difference for you.

41:01.120 --> 41:04.080
That's the only one in the last 20 days.

41:04.080 --> 41:04.320
Okay.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.280
I'm just relaxed.

41:05.280 --> 41:07.920
You guys fucking start the scene.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.600
And once I calm down, I'll enter it.

41:09.600 --> 41:10.080
All right.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.000
I promise I won't enter it until I calm down.

41:13.600 --> 41:13.920
Okay.

41:17.280 --> 41:21.440
Honey, I know that my remarriage has been a big transition for you.

41:22.400 --> 41:25.920
You know, it's a guardi at a tender age or 14.

41:25.920 --> 41:29.600
And I know that you're dad leaving and me remarrying pretty quickly has been

41:29.600 --> 41:30.640
really hard.

41:30.640 --> 41:32.240
But I brought him over today.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.040
He says in the other room, he'll come in when he's ready, when you're ready.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.160
When you're ready, because it's about you.

41:37.360 --> 41:40.320
And I just wanted you guys to get to know each other a little bit.

41:40.320 --> 41:42.160
Is that something you'd be interested in?

41:43.680 --> 41:45.280
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.960
Do you, and do you want to let me know anything before he comes in?

41:48.960 --> 41:50.800
Like any reservations, any boundaries?

41:50.800 --> 41:52.320
You do want to talk about, don't want to talk about.

41:52.320 --> 41:53.440
You don't have to call him dad.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.680
I want to say that right now, you do not have to call him dad.

41:56.800 --> 42:01.040
And I, if I wanted to, though, of course you can.

42:01.600 --> 42:02.480
You should ask him that.

42:02.480 --> 42:04.720
I bet that he would love to hear that.

42:04.720 --> 42:06.480
Maybe not today, but later.

42:06.480 --> 42:08.320
Yeah, I think that sounds like a good idea.

42:08.320 --> 42:08.960
I'm going to bring him in.

42:09.040 --> 42:18.080
Yeah, I just want to say, I really appreciate it that the time you and I have had together, though.

42:18.960 --> 42:21.120
It's not going to end, you're still my son.

42:21.120 --> 42:24.080
No, I know, but I'm just saying it's been a particular vibe.

42:24.080 --> 42:25.200
But I've, I've liked it.

42:25.200 --> 42:26.080
Oh, me too.

42:26.080 --> 42:27.280
And this will be a new chapter.

42:27.280 --> 42:28.480
So I'll bring him in.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.480
Jack's, Jack's, he's ready.

42:33.360 --> 42:34.720
Come say hi to Chris.

42:34.720 --> 42:37.760
I Chris, I heard what you guys said through the wall, by the way.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.040
I'm not a crooked old fart.

42:41.120 --> 42:44.160
I know the door was closed and it was a little muffled, but that's what I heard.

42:44.160 --> 42:45.120
Jack's, we were joking.

42:45.120 --> 42:46.000
It was a joke.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.600
We were like, oh, he's just a crooked old fart.

42:47.600 --> 42:48.880
You know, it's a, we're kidding.

42:49.840 --> 42:50.560
We're at week, Chris.

42:52.320 --> 42:52.720
Uh-huh.

42:54.720 --> 42:55.280
Call me dad.

43:00.160 --> 43:00.640
Okay.

43:01.360 --> 43:02.560
You don't have to do it right now.

43:02.560 --> 43:03.200
Call me dad.

43:03.200 --> 43:04.560
Oh, that's someone who's just a fart.

43:04.560 --> 43:05.520
And you don't want to talk about that.

43:05.520 --> 43:07.120
Jack's, what are you doing?

43:07.280 --> 43:10.880
I'm going to bring in somebody else that's a fun friend of mine.

43:10.880 --> 43:15.280
And they're going to tell you exactly who they are and what their whole deal is.

43:15.280 --> 43:16.240
And it's going to change the scene.

43:17.520 --> 43:18.080
Parsie.

43:20.480 --> 43:21.520
Marika, that's you.

43:25.120 --> 43:26.560
Parsie, don't be shy.

43:26.560 --> 43:27.200
Come in here.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.520
Tell us your whole deal and change the scene entirely.

43:30.720 --> 43:32.960
I don't know anyone named Parsie before.

43:33.600 --> 43:36.880
Jack's, this is real good.

43:36.880 --> 43:37.920
It's okay, Marika, it's okay.

43:37.920 --> 43:38.560
I'm so nervous.

43:38.560 --> 43:41.360
This is not a machine, Marika, it's okay.

43:41.360 --> 43:44.560
I don't know what I said earlier, but you can improvise in the scene with us.

43:44.560 --> 43:45.600
Parsie, come here.

43:45.600 --> 43:46.560
Pressure on Parsie.

43:46.560 --> 43:50.720
Tell us your whole deal and make it funny as shit to change this whole deal.

43:53.360 --> 43:53.840
It's okay.

43:53.840 --> 43:54.960
I am Parsie.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.960
Oh, who are you?

43:56.960 --> 44:02.080
But even it's really intimate meeting with my son and his new stuff done.

44:02.480 --> 44:04.320
And as we said, I had some notice.

44:04.320 --> 44:06.480
What were you thought of friend doing?

44:06.480 --> 44:08.160
How did you get into our house?

44:08.160 --> 44:09.440
How did you get into our house?

44:11.600 --> 44:13.440
Honestly, I thought this was my house.

44:18.720 --> 44:20.240
Marika, you're blowing it.

44:20.240 --> 44:21.920
This is why I didn't want you to be in the scene.

44:21.920 --> 44:23.120
This is not part of it.

44:23.120 --> 44:23.280
Jack.

44:23.280 --> 44:24.080
Now back to it.

44:24.080 --> 44:24.880
Parsie.

44:24.880 --> 44:25.520
You're an eye.

44:25.520 --> 44:28.000
How would you think this is your house?

44:28.000 --> 44:30.720
This is so clearly my girlfriend's house.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.440
We've just got married.

44:33.440 --> 44:34.000
You're married.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.760
You're never, and by the way, you never stop dating your wife.

44:37.760 --> 44:38.880
You're wife.

44:38.880 --> 44:40.560
Parsie, what's your entire deal?

44:40.560 --> 44:43.840
You have 15, Marika, you have 15 seconds to change the scene.

44:45.920 --> 44:47.280
Parsie, what's your whole thing?

44:48.240 --> 44:48.560
Man.

44:48.560 --> 44:51.200
Well.

44:51.200 --> 44:56.800
I mean, now I'm confused because I came here thinking that this was my house.

44:56.800 --> 44:57.600
It was your house.

44:57.600 --> 44:59.200
Yeah, it looks exactly like this.

45:00.160 --> 45:01.280
Right, yeah, yeah.

45:02.560 --> 45:03.840
It's on the same street.

45:04.640 --> 45:09.040
Parsie, true or false from what you know about me and our relationship that you haven't

45:09.040 --> 45:10.800
really figured out what it is yet.

45:11.600 --> 45:13.280
Would you describe me as a crooked old fart?

45:16.800 --> 45:18.800
I don't know who you are to be honest.

45:22.640 --> 45:25.040
Really, Parsie, we thought he was with you.

45:25.680 --> 45:27.280
I fucking hate the key on.

45:29.600 --> 45:33.120
Mom, you're still in charge of calling this scene, even though you're now so.

45:33.120 --> 45:34.080
Yeah, honey.

45:34.080 --> 45:34.880
What?

45:34.880 --> 45:37.040
Mom, I don't want him to be died anymore.

45:37.040 --> 45:38.480
I don't want you to be anything.

45:38.480 --> 45:40.240
You don't want to be anything.

45:40.880 --> 45:42.720
Parsie, be my new dad.

45:42.720 --> 45:44.400
I really like Parsie.

45:44.400 --> 45:47.040
You don't want to know what Parsie's whole deal is.

45:47.040 --> 45:47.760
No one knows.

45:47.760 --> 45:47.840
No one knows.

45:47.840 --> 45:48.080
No one knows.

45:48.080 --> 45:48.720
Real deal is.

45:48.720 --> 45:49.520
The O.S.

45:49.520 --> 45:50.160
Jackson.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.920
Oh, Chris.

45:51.920 --> 45:54.480
Chris, crooked old fart and now P.O.S.

45:54.560 --> 45:55.840
Christopher, what is this?

45:55.840 --> 45:57.920
Say you're sorry to Parsie and to

45:57.920 --> 45:58.560
your sorry.

45:59.360 --> 46:01.520
You're sorry to Parsie and don't be like that.

46:01.520 --> 46:04.000
No, actually, I accept that apology.

46:04.000 --> 46:04.800
That was nothing.

46:04.800 --> 46:07.760
He was imitating me in being sort of a smart ass about it.

46:07.760 --> 46:09.440
Yeah, but I appreciate it.

46:10.080 --> 46:13.040
Shut up, you're rancid old, so and so.

46:13.040 --> 46:15.280
I'm sick of your ass, Parsie.

46:16.480 --> 46:17.600
Parsie, can we go?

46:17.600 --> 46:18.480
Can we get out of here?

46:18.480 --> 46:20.880
Go get a milkshake, so we're y'all gonna go.

46:20.880 --> 46:22.720
We didn't even get a milkshake.

46:22.720 --> 46:24.320
We didn't even get a glimpse into what Parsie's

46:24.320 --> 46:25.040
whole deal is.

46:25.040 --> 46:28.640
Parsie's deal is that Parsie's deal is that this is Parsie's house.

46:29.680 --> 46:32.080
Parsie doesn't know any of us, but now I guess it's

46:32.080 --> 46:32.720
reverse.

46:32.720 --> 46:34.080
These Chris' new stepdad.

46:34.720 --> 46:36.080
That's how he's deal.

46:36.080 --> 46:37.440
So are you gonna go?

46:37.440 --> 46:38.800
We're gonna go get a milkshake.

46:41.040 --> 46:42.720
So you're gonna work out with this Chris?

46:44.880 --> 46:47.200
I'm still real in off that apology.

46:47.200 --> 46:49.680
I mean, I really fucking appreciated that.

46:49.680 --> 46:52.880
Nobody's ever taken a not only taken accountability

46:52.960 --> 46:55.840
and responsibility, but also delivered just the words I'm

46:55.840 --> 46:57.920
sorry with that explanation and defensiveness.

47:01.040 --> 47:04.960
The only thing I'm still kind of waiting, sitting here in Limbo about

47:04.960 --> 47:08.720
is what Parsie's whole deal is, because that is certain point

47:08.720 --> 47:11.360
by the way, I'm really good you should have said something like that.

47:11.360 --> 47:12.640
To change the whole scene.

47:13.680 --> 47:14.640
And now we're back in it.

47:15.280 --> 47:15.920
Tell me dad.

47:16.640 --> 47:18.800
Wait, sorry, can we pause the scene for a second?

47:18.800 --> 47:20.000
Actually, yeah.

47:20.080 --> 47:23.200
What do you mean, I should have said something like that?

47:26.240 --> 47:29.440
Like you should have, because your assignment, which you obviously didn't

47:29.440 --> 47:32.880
understand the assignment was to come in as Parsie.

47:33.440 --> 47:33.760
You're right.

47:33.760 --> 47:37.760
Say what your whole deal was and change the whole scene.

47:37.760 --> 47:38.400
She did.

47:38.400 --> 47:43.760
I didn't see my whole deal and you told me that I had to call the scene.

47:43.760 --> 47:45.360
And we haven't had a good point yet.

47:45.360 --> 47:46.480
We could have called it.

47:46.480 --> 47:46.800
Okay.

47:46.800 --> 47:48.160
We could have called it when you said it.

47:48.320 --> 47:50.640
So it was supposed to be like, oh, get to know your new step dad.

47:50.640 --> 47:54.160
And now it's about who the fuck is Parsie and why does Parsie think this is

47:54.160 --> 47:55.040
there house?

47:55.040 --> 47:58.640
And I was going to call it, uh, do you want to go get milkshakes, but then

47:59.040 --> 48:00.400
then kept going and then kept going.

48:00.400 --> 48:01.440
Just kept hiding.

48:01.440 --> 48:02.400
I didn't keep going.

48:02.400 --> 48:03.440
You kept going.

48:03.440 --> 48:03.760
All right.

48:03.760 --> 48:05.920
Should we go back to the scene and get to the other point?

48:05.920 --> 48:06.800
Yeah, I'll do.

48:06.800 --> 48:07.440
Perfect.

48:07.440 --> 48:07.840
All right.

48:08.960 --> 48:09.840
Back to the scene.

48:12.640 --> 48:14.240
I'm going to get strawberry.

48:16.640 --> 48:17.440
And scene.

48:17.600 --> 48:18.400
Yeah.

48:22.400 --> 48:25.920
So Riley, Alfred, where can they people find you?

48:25.920 --> 48:27.200
Where can they follow the show?

48:27.200 --> 48:28.080
Where can they listen to the show?

48:28.080 --> 48:29.120
What's a good episode?

48:29.120 --> 48:31.280
Listen with the floor's y'all.

48:31.280 --> 48:32.080
Let's start with Riley.

48:32.880 --> 48:39.920
You can find me on Instagram at Riley and Spa and on Twitter at Riley Koyote.

48:39.920 --> 48:44.880
You can find the show on Instagram at review review on reddit r slash review review.

48:44.960 --> 48:48.800
And we have a discord channel under the Hadgham discord review review.

48:48.800 --> 48:49.360
Comparty.

48:50.720 --> 48:54.160
I think a really fun first at, well, when's this one coming out?

48:54.880 --> 48:55.920
This Friday.

48:55.920 --> 48:56.640
This Friday.

48:57.760 --> 49:01.360
We just, uh, on this past Tuesday, the 24th, we have an

49:01.360 --> 49:03.520
uptrip with Shelby Wallstein, which is really fun.

49:04.560 --> 49:08.000
And I also think, for the new, so you can listen, there's a whole

49:08.000 --> 49:09.360
shit tongue with me and Jeff.

49:09.360 --> 49:10.720
Don't fucking listen to us.

49:10.720 --> 49:11.120
Don't.

49:12.080 --> 49:13.760
But in fact, I've been, Marie,

49:13.760 --> 49:14.800
Kevin, meaning to ask you about this.

49:14.800 --> 49:16.480
Is there a way to get those taken down?

49:16.480 --> 49:17.360
No, yeah.

49:17.360 --> 49:21.120
I know you guys make money off of those now, though.

49:21.120 --> 49:23.360
I would rather we just, things like, you know,

49:23.360 --> 49:24.400
I think it's confusing.

49:24.400 --> 49:28.480
We have one just alpha and I, uh, called Dice, which, um,

49:28.480 --> 49:32.560
our editor Daniel Ray most did a pretty amazing sound design for a

49:32.560 --> 49:35.280
chase sequence, which is one of my favorite audio gags.

49:35.280 --> 49:36.400
We've done so.

49:36.400 --> 49:40.560
Dice, if you want our first solo up and, um, we just had, uh,

49:40.640 --> 49:41.920
Tupperware with Shelby Wallstein.

49:42.960 --> 49:47.120
Oh, yeah, Alfred, yeah, and you can find me on, uh,

49:47.120 --> 49:50.320
Instagram, uh, dot com at Alfred in it.

49:50.320 --> 49:54.320
I am an IT, um, you know, the web browser.

49:54.320 --> 49:57.200
I mean, the web browser, I think my ghost on the app.

49:58.240 --> 50:01.760
My big plea, I guess, if we're doing plugs and please, here,

50:01.760 --> 50:04.880
yeah, uh, I know what you're going to say.

50:04.880 --> 50:06.560
And it gets worse every time.

50:06.560 --> 50:07.760
I know what it does for you.

50:07.760 --> 50:10.480
I know, I know, but I need to say

50:10.480 --> 50:11.760
it. I need to say it.

50:12.320 --> 50:16.000
I know a lot of people who listen to this show use to listen to review review.

50:16.000 --> 50:20.320
Uh, no, if you wouldn't mind writing some things songs for review review that

50:20.320 --> 50:24.640
have my name in them because we're steadily working through the backlog of

50:24.640 --> 50:26.160
songs that are all about Jeff.

50:26.160 --> 50:30.720
You don't have many in the ass is like every, we recorded one today.

50:30.720 --> 50:32.240
And it was about your ass.

50:32.240 --> 50:35.200
This is my impression of every review review theme song.

50:35.280 --> 50:38.640
Jeffs, uh, I'll take me home to the, uh,

50:38.640 --> 50:39.520
uh, cyber long.

50:39.520 --> 50:41.360
That's literally every single fucking one.

50:41.360 --> 50:45.520
And all I'm asking you is that, you know, people out there who've, like,

50:45.520 --> 50:46.960
they haven't, you're asked.

50:46.960 --> 50:51.280
Yes, they have a drag saved garage band of some fucking song about Jeff's

50:51.280 --> 50:51.840
ass.

50:51.840 --> 50:52.640
Just go in.

50:52.640 --> 50:54.800
Uh, hate how long.

50:54.800 --> 50:55.600
Exactly.

50:55.600 --> 50:56.320
It's too slow.

50:56.320 --> 50:57.280
My name in.

50:57.280 --> 50:58.800
Just take my fucking name in.

50:58.800 --> 51:00.080
We had can you feel the love tonight?

51:00.080 --> 51:03.280
And it was like, can you see Jeff's ass in chords or something like that?

51:03.440 --> 51:05.680
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

51:10.480 --> 51:11.360
Easy.

51:11.360 --> 51:12.880
Can you speak to it a little bit?

51:12.880 --> 51:13.600
How is your ass?

51:15.280 --> 51:16.480
Uh, they're writing complaint?

51:17.120 --> 51:18.080
Uh, it.

51:19.120 --> 51:21.840
Yeah, I mean, I think your, our ass is probably pretty comparable.

51:22.240 --> 51:23.840
Don't you dare see that.

51:24.080 --> 51:26.320
Let's let's get a picture of your ass up on Twitter.

51:26.320 --> 51:27.920
And then we'll compare side by side.

51:27.920 --> 51:29.920
I, you know, I don't feel the need to, you know,

51:29.920 --> 51:36.920
You know, chase cloud like that, I think, you know, I'm pretty content, you know, it's not me chasing cloud.

51:36.920 --> 51:47.920
It's me running away from go. Like while I'm young, let's preserve my physical status in, you're trying to sort of lock a time capsule of you having an ass.

51:47.920 --> 51:54.920
If you got your ankle, so it's shattered.

51:54.920 --> 51:59.920
Marica.

51:59.920 --> 52:05.920
Follow me on Twitter and Instagram and letterboxed at Marica Lawn.

52:05.920 --> 52:15.920
And again, if you did watch the battery astound, a classic musical theater web series by Jake Wilson, please let me know.

52:15.920 --> 52:18.920
So I can make for any dollars. Thank you.

52:18.920 --> 52:21.920
And it's at Jeffrey James on Instagram at Jeffrey already on Twitter.

52:21.920 --> 52:28.920
It's going to be next week, Riley has a heart out in two and a half minutes, so we're going to call it.

52:28.920 --> 52:29.920
Candle.

52:29.920 --> 52:31.920
Watch Jeff soap. Showcase, CBS ever.

52:31.920 --> 52:33.920
Yeah, it's so good.

52:33.920 --> 52:39.920
Yeah, Paramount.com for his last showcase, 2023 or dash, 2023.

52:39.920 --> 52:42.920
And if you're a cast and director, please give all three of us jobs.

52:42.920 --> 52:46.920
And I'm not going to say which three, but it's doing me, Riley and Marica for some reason.

52:46.920 --> 52:51.920
I can see him from show with seamless sort of a calling card.

52:51.920 --> 52:53.920
But this whole show was done.

52:53.920 --> 52:56.920
We'll see you guys again next week. I hope.

53:13.920 --> 53:15.920
That was a hit dumb original.

53:16.920 --> 53:17.920
Thank you.

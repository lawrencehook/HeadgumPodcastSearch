00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head gamma original.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Getting things started full steam ahead Tuesday morning.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
We've got Justin Linville on the horn.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Stop clap clap.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Thank you.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Everyone that I know knows you and loves you Justin.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
So I had to have you on the show.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Thank you.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
For this country known for what you do in the shadows known for improv galore.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
And did I mention crashing?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
No, you didn't mention crashing.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
And not everybody does mention crashing.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
So thank you.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
You were in that.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I was in that crown, but still.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
That was not background.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
You had lines for sure.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
That was a foul.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
That was the flash this country, which was the working title of it.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
It wasn't it.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
It was the working title, but for some reason they changed it.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
For reasons beyond my knowledge.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
I still call this country because my friend worked in casting on it.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
And she calls it this country still.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
I like this country more, but hey, that's just me.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
All right, that's just me.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Wow.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
That's just breaking.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
You should just have your finger over that sound effect.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
The delayed bomb drop.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Right.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Be as quick with the bomb as you are with that one.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
There's a problem.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
There's a delay on the bomb drop.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
So when I click it, it already is like two beats and then it drops.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I've looked at these sounds yourselves.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Yeah.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
I could.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
It does have quite an effect, though.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
It's like, it's a two parts sort of effect, which is like,

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
mouth, a gate, weight, one second.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
And then the bomb drop.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And then with this is never before,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
is Maria CabrÃ³n, the on the sacks and J.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Kerritz on the facts.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Good.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
I posted to my Instagram story, Jonathan Villan on the facts.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
And everybody was like, I always thought it was facts.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
F.A.K.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
X.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I did as well.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
And it is definitely the way I said it.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
But it's always been a fact.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
To you.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Well, that's interesting.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
All right.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Major key alert.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Domestic travel is just as important as international.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm in New York for the week.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
We're doing this live show on Friday.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
And I've had unbelievable experiences thus far.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
And this one's going to be another one.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Thanks for recording.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yes.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Giving yourself the applause.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Hello.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Justin, how are you?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
What have you been up to recently?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
What are you excited about in life?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
What are you passionate about?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Four.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
These are a lot of big questions.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Recently, I don't know.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
I just sort of just been like...

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
What?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I had a birthday party.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Small birthday party watched the Muppet movie.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
That was fun.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Happy birthday.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Thank you so much.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Thank you.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
It was an early birthday party.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
So it's actually my birthday next week.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Wow.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Happy birthday.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Thank you.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
I appreciate it.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
But yeah.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
What else have it into?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
I don't know.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
This is sort of, I wish I knew that the question was coming.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Because I would have prepared.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
The two very different questions.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
What have you been up to?

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
And what have you passionate for?

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
It assumes that you've only been up to your passion.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
That's the last week.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Sorry.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
I guess that would be the most important thing.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
What am I passionate of?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Passionate of heart.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Passionate of mind.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Passionate of body and soul.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Um.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
It's really loading on a fit.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
What you were saying?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
I feel like.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
But do you load these in?

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
How, how many cues do you have here?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
He has too many.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
And he's a little trigger happy with them.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Now he's sure.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Yeah.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Okay.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Oh my god.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
They're like absent.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Do you this?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Oh my god.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
I'm getting a virus as we press these buttons.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
It's also I can because of the cookies.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
I just know exactly what your searches are.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
I can.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I can.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
The ads are so attractive to you.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Venti chips and potty barn.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Yeah.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Etsy fashion.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Yeah.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Defusing oils.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Um.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
No.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Just in your passionate of.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Passionate of.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I'm trying to think of something I did in the past week.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Passionate of body mind soul.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Passionate.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I mean, this might be something.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
You know, there's a Winnie the Poom musical coming out on Broadway.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
They're really.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I think it's off Broadway.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Off Broadway.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Off Broadway.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Peter Rowe.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
They're looking to cast a Christopher Robin.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
And they're looking specifically for like 12 year olds.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
And I remember I like, I told my agent about this.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
And I was like, can I audition for this?

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
And he was like, that might be fun.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
And then he like went back and they're like,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
no, they're really looking for like a 12 year old.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
And I was like, can I, can I, can I still audition?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Give me the size.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Give me the size.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Let me do Christopher Robb.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
And please.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
I.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
I love when you appear.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I do kind of want to see that.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
I know it's for children.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
I really do.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
But I just want to understand what's going on in there.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
They're.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
They're all, all the good ones are for children.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
That that's like what the.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
You know, that's what all the stories are.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
It's, it's Disney.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
It's Pixar.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Those are those are the, those are the goats.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
They're all for children.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
But that's fine.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
It's going to enjoy them.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I wept like a baby at Moana.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
And that's okay.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
That's normal.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
I wasn't going through other shit.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
It was just the beauty of the story.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
I.

06:17.000 --> 06:26.000
I would just break your clothes next time I see you.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
That's my new favorite sound.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
It's clear.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
It's so rude.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
But I'm up at movies also for kids.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
That's a good one.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
That's for kids.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
A kids and adults.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
You know.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Yeah.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
All ages.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Oh, over the garden wall.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Technically could be for kids.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
But unbelievably.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I think it's a George sob.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
And I think it's a perfect piece of media.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
It's great.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Fantastic.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I remember even heard of it.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
What is it?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
That's.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Can you not bring this sour to the show today?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
I think we need the energy out.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
It was a curiosity.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
What you said was the best piece of media.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Here we go.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
You want us to wax.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
You want us to have discourse.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
I didn't say my ask a question about something.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
The audience might be asking more questions.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
They might be curious.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
And I'm getting.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Fucking herring by the Russian national cartoon.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
It's like spooky.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
It's an hour long.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
It's on HBO.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
It's good.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
It's.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
It's.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
It's.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
It's good music.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
I'm the highway man.

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
Kind of like adventure land adjacent feeling in terms of tone.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
We're adventure adventure time.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Yeah.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Sorry.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Not the movie adventure land.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
I was interested.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
I was interested.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
I was interested.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Like.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
How could a cartoon about Halloween on HBO be adjacent to adventure land?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
When I was there.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
That like that was the first time I was kind of convinced to actually

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
I was being called out.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Also like computer background is the tree house from adventure time.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
So that's sad for me.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Yeah.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
That is not sad for you.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Not sad for you.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
No.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
None of this being hard in yourself stuff.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Okay.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Yeah.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
You mentioned that.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
I asked.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
That's a major.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
That's a major key alert of the day.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Yeah.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
That's something you can be passionate about actually.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
I asked Justin if he had any questions about the show.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Or if he had listened to it.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
And he's like, I listened to the last few video episodes.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
And today none of this being hard on yourself stuff.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I'm not ever hard on myself.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
I'm the quick.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
I'm the first person to like really pat myself on the back for doing a good job here.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
It's all this.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
These co-workers of mine that spew poison at me.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
For effort.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Sure.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Yes.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
You're right.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
I'm having the podcast thing where you're or being on a podcast where you listen to.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
And you kind of know some dynamics of the posted.

08:55.000 --> 09:02.000
You know, I'm sort of just laughing at everybody.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Was that a mistake?

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Do you like click the wrong button or do you do it?

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
Like it feels almost like the applause is just your cancel it out.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Like you started something.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
You didn't want it.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
You're like hit the applause.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
It'll be over.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Don't make that a lie.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Okay.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Can you also?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
I want to describe this.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Can you share screen again?

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
Because I think the audio listeners might want to know what exactly you're looking at.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
There's a video listeners.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
This is going to be on YouTube, right?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Yes.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Okay.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Sure.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
I have these buttons and then like they correspond to different sounds.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
And time.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Got the time.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Hey.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
It's a series.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
It's a series of.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
What's why won't you die?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
What?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Oh, you want to know what?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Why won't you die?

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
That's a fucking series.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
You know, any breaking news, etc.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Now I kind of have to say something.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Carrier being still refusing the vaccine has come out yesterday.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
I think saying that he won't even consider getting it this season.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
Then you can just play that NBA draft point again.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
That one.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Right?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Yeah.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
It's a good intro and outro to like a piece of a piece of go.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
You know.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Yeah.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
It's a good job.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
It's a good job.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
What's eat as yell.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Oh, I will eat your ass.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
All right.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
All right.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
All right.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I assume the later part of the episodes.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Jeff has four tabs open that saying microwave sound.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Oh, no.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
When that is absolutely not.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Oh, no.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
Forget that you can see all of that.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
So this brings us to the wax portion of the afternoon.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Have you already waxed?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
What were we doing?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
We were waxing.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
But now it's the official wax.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Now it's the official wax.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
Now we just kind of get into anything that we're thinking of.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
That was the pre wax.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Now we're into the wax.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Exactly.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Okay.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Much nicer explanation.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Just we don't really know each other at all.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
We were Twitter Mutuals.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
But I knew of you.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I know homes.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I know Taylor or Taga.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
They all sing your praises.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Jake's wife knows of you.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Oh, everybody.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
I know knows you.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Okay.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
My wife knows of you.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Can you play?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Can you fucking believe that?

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
Jake's wife actually knows of you.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
And knows what you're passionate of.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Is that?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Is that how it was phrased?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Nice.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Yeah.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Oh, my God.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
So loud.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
I was making fun of you.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
And you interrupted with the soundboard, right?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Yes.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
I didn't like what you were saying.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Can I ask?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Is the phrasing?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I don't know your wife.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
But is the phrasing?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I know of this person.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Is that Jeffrey James editorializing?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Or is that?

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
I think it's because my wife works in the TV and film industry.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
So can saying that is like saying that you are a credible performer.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
That's what I think is.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Is that correct, Jeff?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yes.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
It was actually that's correct.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
But it's also that just I feel like I kept circling just.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
And so this is kind of us finally.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
You know, she was passing the night, obviously.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
And then finally like we docked.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
And now we get to go to all the pirate bars.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
And you know, hire a wench.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
And be drunk on rum and be married.

12:37.000 --> 12:44.000
And you have to be like pirate bars to just actually being pirates.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
And we'll bury our duty for landing.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Nice.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Oh fuck me.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
And this is just a comment.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
But my brother's name is Jeremy Linville.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And like Jeremy Lin.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Yes.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
It's like a city named after Jeremy Lin.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Yeah.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Exactly.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Okay.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
That's just a fun stuff.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
That would have been good.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Yeah, that would have been the time.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
Nothing from America for the better part of five minutes, right?

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
I'm the only one that actually knows Justin.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
So I was letting everyone else for five years.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
Just letting everyone else get their stories out of the way.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Do you have a story to tell?

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
I hear I do have a good story about Justin.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
I remember one time you flew.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Would you have Texas?

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
I'm sorry.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
We do have to.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
I'm so sorry.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Thank you.

14:18.320 --> 14:20.000
15 minutes.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
More chance to check this phone.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
That's pretty good.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
That means the episode's going well.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Welcome to Bond of the Week.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Oh my god.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
How are we supposed to do it in three weeks?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I don't know, every week until the next Bond is cast.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Wait a second.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Oh, you said until the next Bond comes out.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Wait, was that the wax?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
That's the wax.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
You cut it off midwax.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
You want this midwax?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
See, I meant I can ask for not speaking.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
When I try to speak, I'm cut off.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Well, it's 15 minutes.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
We have a lot to get to today.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Yeah.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
So, what are you guys' bonds of the week?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Let me pull up my list again.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
I suppose to guess who the next Bond is going to be.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
I guess who you're going to be this week.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
It's Robert Pattinson for me, dog.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Yeah.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
All day.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
That's pretty good.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Pretty good.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
It's actually perfect.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Did you see Tenet?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
He's back.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
He's better than ever.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Back.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Tenet.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
I loved Tenet.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
I thought it was incredible.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
I understand the fucking second of it.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
It's five.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Tenet's five is only.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
No one understands any movie.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
So, you might as well just give yourself over to not getting it at all.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
It's a beautiful film.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
And Pattinson could absolutely be Bond.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Because he's still smoldering.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
And he's got that swagger.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
He's got that charm.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
He's the man.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
He's British to boot.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
It's game over for you.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
You don't have another Bond.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Maybe.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Maybe.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Maybe.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
When you guys said Dev Patel, you were on to something.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Because I felt like that one.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
That was solid.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Yeah.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Yeah.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Do you see where this Jeff?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
It's hard.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Because like now, I, somebody,

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
mentioned me on Twitter saying that Pierce Brosnan's Irish.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
So that, you know, they could be Irish.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
I don't think that we can have it American Bond.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
But, um, let's go Andrew Scott.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Hot priest.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
From feedback.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Hmm.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Do you see areas?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
No.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
No choice.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Fine.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Then Maria.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Also here's his back.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
And Eddie.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Was he who?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Yeah.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Let's go.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Colin O'Donogue.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
You're not even.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Yeah.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
You're just about there.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
Is that, um, the captain hook from, uh,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
once upon a time.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
That is, that is.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
He's pretty handsome.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Yeah.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Yeah.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Yeah.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
I watched that show.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Justin.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Um,

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
I would like to see a Richard kind, um,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
James Bond movie.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Is he dead?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
No.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Oh, talking.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
I thought he was dead.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I think I completed it with that other.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Fred, whatever his last name is.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Jesus.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Richard kind.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Yeah.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
I thought he was gone.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
All wrong.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
He has to be British.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
I thought this guy was dead as well.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
He has to be British.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Okay.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Ben and things so recently.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Also, I don't, I don't think he can leave it on Fred.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
What's his last name?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
It names Fred Willard.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Fred Willard.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Fred Willard.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
I also saw somebody on the street in Echo Park last week.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Oh, God.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
It was a dead ringer for Fred Willard.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
And I was like.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
No way.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
No way.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
He faked his own death.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
And is walking the honey high to get a fucking assay.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
I think he can tell people get a reference.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
I think he can tell people that you did see him and that he did fake his own death.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Honey high.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Yes.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Yes.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
What is honey high?

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
I like a trendy cafe in Echo Park.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Okay.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Yeah.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
They've good coffee.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
It's kind of it.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
They saw like drinks with mushrooms in them.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Like not the drug.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Drugs.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Drugs.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Drugs.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Drugs.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Drugs.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Okay.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
I didn't get my bond of Louis.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Yeah.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
No.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
We're not done.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
It's been awesome.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
So I just was congratulating us on that.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Um.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I'm going to go.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Really?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Well, okay.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
You can piggyback on if you heard the best bond today.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
You can second or the second yours.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
I mean, yeah.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I don't think she's going to second Richard kind.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Right.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Maybe who knows who knows.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
It's time for a kinder.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Bob.

19:07.000 --> 19:13.000
A different kind of bond.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Um.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Okay.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
So it's too fit.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
It's just him on the cover.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
With this face.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Exactly.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
No.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Yeah.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Yeah.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Take the one next to it with the sweater.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
The sweater.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
See to me.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
That's good.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
No time to die.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
That's the same title.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
No, that one's just time to die.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Okay.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
Um.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
I don't know.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Let's go.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
With for my choice of bond.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
Um.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
I think I will say.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Okay.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Jesus.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
I'm going to go.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
I'm going to go.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Rave.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Small.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Great.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Small.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Can we get a second?

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Give me a second.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
I'm going to let her drink.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Okay.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
R.F.E.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
No.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
No.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Immediate.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
No.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Yeah.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
I don't know.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
He's.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
He's too.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
He's too blonde to be.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
He's too pale.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
He's.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Oh, my.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Like some of these photos are just not starters.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Maria.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
But like the first two.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I mean, he's wearing like a great text.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Yeah.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
The first two.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Yeah.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Yeah.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
But Daniel Craig at any angle looks.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Absolutely divine.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Made of stone.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Made of absolute.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Yeah.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Sure.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
What about?

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
No.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Bringing.

20:58.000 --> 21:05.000
I wouldn't be down to bring back Pierce because Pierce pierced by heart and veil.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
And he's on a veil.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
For bond.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
I like that industry talk just and you know what I'm talking about.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Because you book, man.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
You book.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
What did you call it?

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
What do you say?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
On being on a veil.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Yeah.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Yeah.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Yeah.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Yeah.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
I love it.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
I love it.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I was looking at brave small.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I was looking at brave small.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
And he might be a good bond.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Who knows?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
I stand by my choice.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I don't think bond doesn't have to be good at his job.

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
So he can like be a little incompetent bond.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
I think it'd be fun.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Yeah.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
That's not fun.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Bond has to be fucking smooth.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Yes, to be a smooth operator.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Yeah.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
I want to blustering sort of a foolish bond.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
That's kind of my my thing.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I want you to kind to just be late to things.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Yeah.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Oh, God.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Sorry.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Sorry.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Three kids.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
I'm sorry.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I'm sorry.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
I'm sorry.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
I'm sorry.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Not that.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
I'm sorry.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
I'm sorry.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Thank you.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
All right.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
We do have to take a break.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
But we will be right back after a word from these sponsors.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
Thank you to man's gift for sponsoring this episode of our show.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
Guys, there's a lot of trends that are in this fall, but you know what's not one of them.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
A wild and hairy bush.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
Tamier pubes with the help of our friends at man's gate.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
The leaders in below the waste grooming.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
Their fourth generation performance package includes the brand new lawnmower 4.0.

22:44.000 --> 22:52.000
If an athlete treats their body like royalty, why not treat your pubes like Olympic gold?

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Tell us.

22:53.000 --> 23:00.000
Do right by your balls and join the 2 million men worldwide who trust man's gift by going

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
to man'scape.com with the code.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
What's that?

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
Listen, I've hurt my balls on many applications.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
I sliced in dice those little guys.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
Oh, way too much.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
And it hasn't happened since I moved over to man's gift and started using the lawnmower.

23:21.000 --> 23:27.000
I've been using the lawnmower 4.0 trimmer on their Instagram ads and this isn't in the copy,

23:27.000 --> 23:33.000
but they have this thing where they put the trimmer right onto the little skin between your first

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
finger and your thumb and it doesn't cut it.

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
Which means that the lawnmower 4.0 trimmer does cut it.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
If you know what I mean.

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
Talk about a world-class dismount into a post-quarantine world.

23:49.000 --> 23:56.000
The performance package is the perfect package for your package and peak performance in whatever

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
sport you desire.

23:59.000 --> 24:07.000
After trimming your pubes, show them some sportsmanship with man'scape's liquid formulations.

24:07.000 --> 24:16.000
The crop-preserver ball deodorant and the crop-reviver ball toner are key to feeling victorious

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
this year.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
It's also through in two free gifts to their performance package 4.0.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
The man'scape boxers and the shed travel bag.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
So get 20% off plus free shipping with the code.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
What's that at man'scape.com?

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
That's 20% off plus free shipping with the code.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
What's that at man'scape.com?

24:43.000 --> 24:53.000
A cheap pubic glory this year with man'scape.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Aren't you a buck?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
I hated that.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
It's like a gentleman thing, y'all.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
No.

25:01.000 --> 25:08.000
So you fear the audio from on my end for this one's going to be unusable because I'm hearing an echo.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Yeah.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
I can almost hear it.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
I hear it a little bit in the zoom.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
So it's going to be bad.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Should I go on in that closet behind you?

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
It's not a walk-in.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
It's a talk-in.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
All you need to do is talk into the clothes of the closet.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
That's serching.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Really?

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
I've been reading about the host.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
This is absurd.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
We're talking no plus for that.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Not for that.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
Now I got an alert that says the host would like you to unmute.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
But I could stay muted.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I have the control.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
So long.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
I'll do it.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Welcome to...

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Justin Linville.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
Justin Linville.

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
Justin, if you went to Vegas last the last time you went to Vegas last the next time you go to Vegas.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
What are you doing?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
What are you getting up to, man?

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
Everything there stays there.

26:21.000 --> 26:27.000
So your options are thereby opened to possibilities of joy.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
I've been thinking about this a lot.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
Because I don't understand anything he just said.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
You said I've been thinking about this a lot.

26:39.000 --> 26:45.000
I think I'm translating Jeff into what would you do in Las Vegas?

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I'm not.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
It's like a start.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
I've been getting into...

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
I'll preface this thing.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I've been taking a singing class.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
What?

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
For Robin.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Yeah.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Which is why I was like I want to do a Christopher Robin.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
And they're like you are not 12.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
But I can sing.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
But can sing or I'm trying to sing.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
But I started...

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
I was working on the song Donkishane by Wayne Newton.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
And I don't know if he could know anything about Wayne Newton.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
But he is like...

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
He basically wrote and performed the song Donkishane at 21.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
And it's still in Las Vegas performing today.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
And he's like 80 years old.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
I would love...

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
And also the crazy Wayne Newton thing is he is an Arabian horse breeder.

27:34.000 --> 27:41.000
So he has an estate where he has bread over 700 Arabian horses in the sort of lifetime of this estate.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Oh my god.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
And his sailor to have.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Near Las Vegas.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
For sale.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Near Las Vegas.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Near Las Vegas.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
So it's like hacks.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
It's like hacks.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
It is.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
And it also his estate is museum.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
And a living museum.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
So he's living in this estate.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
And it's also a museum.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
I think.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
I think.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
And utterly ridiculous.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Sorry, ridiculous.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Sorry, ridiculous.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Sorry, I'm right good.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
So I would fly into Las Vegas and then go visit.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Wayne Newton's estate.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Whatever it is.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
It's called Castle Shenandoah.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Castle Shenandoah.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Castle Shenandoah.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Castle Shenandoah.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
It's crazy.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
It relates to nothing.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
You just wanted to call it Shenandoah.

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
So it's like blending Spanish and Native American.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Yeah.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Right.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Yes.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
And he also.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
There's some stuff where he sort of claims to have some ancestry that's not quite proven.

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
There's a lot in the Wayne Newton sort of wormhole that I've went down.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
But that or served to Soleil.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Yeah.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
Well, you have a whole weekend.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
That's the level of debauchery.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I think I'm I'm out for these days.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
That in the Wolfgang Puck buffet.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Yeah.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Um.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Cool.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
That's a problem.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
That one is just that there's like, yeah, there's enough silent.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Okay.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Sure.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
That's all I need.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
Unless you want to add anything just in.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Oh, I'm great.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Thank you.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
You're an asshole.

29:25.000 --> 29:33.000
We should say that Jake was 10 minutes late and also texted us 40 minutes prior saying,

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
I have a hard out on 11.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
And now he's dancing like he doesn't have a hard out.

29:40.000 --> 29:46.000
Actually, 10 45 that I have to get going.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Is.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Are you kidding?

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
No.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Yes.

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
Is that Mike is fleece or do you have the same one as him?

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
He has the same one as me.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
He has the same one as Marty also.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
How fun.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Yes. Yes.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Yes.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
But not the exact same.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Mike got the literal exact same.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
What is this me?

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
I do think I have a photo of both of you wearing it.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Yeah.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
We'll often wear the same clothes because, okay.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
No, you can keep talking over it.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
All right.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
He has a family.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
I know.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
It doesn't matter.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
I know he can talk over it, but you can't talk over that part, right?

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
I know he can encourage us to keep talking.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
Let's finish the story about the quarters of this.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Me?

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
Justin, Justin, Justin, that story is well, it seems.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Oh, Justin, what's up?

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
I was just saying that I know that I know that Jake can talk over that,

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
but should he talk over that?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Okay.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Well, that brings us to our next segment.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
What?

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Microwave?

30:49.000 --> 30:55.000
Or, it's Microwave, babe.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
Um, what are the rules?

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
The rules are thus.

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
You always pause like you want us to, like, fucking clap when we just give the name of us.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
That would be great.

31:06.000 --> 31:12.000
It's always met with stunned silence.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
I've never ever heard anyone be like,

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Oh, tight.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Yes.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Clap, clap, clap, clap.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
One second then.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
In almost two years, that Marieka was like, okay, this is going to be fun.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Yeah.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
And I don't know what to do.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
It was exciting.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Yeah.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
All right.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
So I'm pretty.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
I'm going to play a sound.

31:31.000 --> 31:42.000
And you have to attribute it to a microwave or someone explaining away their micro penis.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
It's like explaining away than it wouldn't be.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
It's Microwave.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
Because that would explain away.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
That would come.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
That way.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Come explain away.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
Come explain away this pain.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
I have a question.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Yeah.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Wait.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
I can't imagine any of this not being clear.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I'm just curious.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
I explain away part.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
I don't know if you can necessarily explain it away,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
rather than contextualize it, right?

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
You can sort of say, like, hey, just so you know, I have a micro penis.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
You know, I don't know.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
People are saying.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Honestly, face.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Yeah.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
What I will play the game.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
But I'm curious about explaining away.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Well, we'll get into it.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
We'll get into it.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Let's see.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Okay.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
It gets bigger.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
I think I'm just a little nervous.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
Oh my god.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Explain away.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
I also your voice.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Let's go back.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
That's correct.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Again, this is for actual cash.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Maria, can you just $100?

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
It's $100 for every right answer.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
$100 owed to me for every wrong answer.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
And here's the next one.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Excuse me.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Sorry if this is a weird ask.

32:55.000 --> 33:03.000
But can you put some of these directs in, like, a magnum box?

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
So that it.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Yeah.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
No.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Okay.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
That was explaining away.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Correct.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
All right.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
Microwave.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
That's absolutely correct.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
I'm out $300.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
You guys are all up.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
That's this is horrible to me.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
But here we go.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Microwave.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
That's absolutely correct.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
I'm out $300.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
You guys are all up.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
That's this is horrible to me.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
But here we go.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Microwave.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
That was a trick.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Question.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Question.

33:42.000 --> 33:47.000
What year?

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
That was like 2004.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Yeah.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
But it was in horrible condition.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Right.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Yeah.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
It needs a new fan belt.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
It is what it is.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
It's not explaining it away.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
That's confessing that you have a micro penis.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
It's coming off.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
It's coming off.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
It's not like you're coming to Jesus moment.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
It's never going to get bigger.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Jake is in the lead with $200.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
It's winter takes all.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
So here we go.

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
Set a microwave with like metal in it.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
It's just really peaking microwave.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
File.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Back up to $200.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Here we go.

34:35.000 --> 34:42.000
Oh, it's so loud, awful to hear, microwave.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Well, let's hear it out.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Oh.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
That's correct though, Maria is tied with Jake for two minutes.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Why did you want to finish the sound clip?

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
I have a pimple.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
And I know you guys are thinking about it.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
I can't see it.

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
I have a stressed pimple because of the show.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Yeah, that's a bad time to get it.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
I know.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
But I got some cover up.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Justin.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Great.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Here we go.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Last one.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
I have a micro penis.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
So that's a deal breaker.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
All cards on the table and you're gone.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
I get a lot of explaining away.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
But, uh, Maria wins $300.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
This is beyond fucked.

35:36.000 --> 35:44.000
Oh, so I feel like I should have gotten a prize for guessing all of those hair dryers,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
which was way harder.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Yeah, but I didn't have money at that point.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
That didn't make any sense that you gave it all the pile.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Yeah.

35:53.000 --> 35:58.000
Can I also say, none of those are necessarily the way you should.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
If you have a micro penis, I wouldn't necessarily explain it away in any of those ways.

36:02.000 --> 36:07.000
I'd maybe just sort of try to have a sort of frank conversation with your partner about it.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
If this is a deal breaker, we're done.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
I would be like, well, the thing is you're really big.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
So my penis is actually normal.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I would convince normal.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
They're a giant.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
Are you going to do some sort of?

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Wow.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Yep.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
This is hard because I only had a thousand.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
I had a Tao and I'm in New York.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
So obviously having to spend money.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Right.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Yeah.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Hmm.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
I received it.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Thank you.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Fuck me.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
It's a nice day.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
I just have to mentally get there.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
I'll say one second.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
Oh.

36:59.000 --> 37:05.000
Such an infuriating sound because it gets louder and louder.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Okay.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
I didn't mean to press that.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
I'm sorry.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
All right.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Here you go.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Last game.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
You guys ready?

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Yeah.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
E.A. Sports.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
It's in the game.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I ran out of intro music, so we're just going to use that.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
Welcome to two questions.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Have you guys played 20 questions?

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Yeah.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Well, this is two questions.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
See you at it.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Two to narrow it down.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Okay.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
All right.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Maria, you're up first.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
I've got it.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
I've got something in mind.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Let's kind of start asking.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Is it food?

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
No.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Is it an animal?

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
No.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
It was dockers.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Justin, you're up.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
I've got it.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
It's a bigger than a bread box.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Yes.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
Is it living?

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
It's.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I might have to give you that one.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
It's hot couture.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Is that it?

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
Which is in a way life itself.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Okay.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Wait, what is hot couture?

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
Hot couture is like high fashion, I think.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Okay.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
It's like whatever the opposite of off the rack is.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Okay.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
Should I get that right?

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Yeah.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
I'll give you that one.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
I'll give you that one.

38:28.000 --> 38:33.000
It's bigger than a bread box and it's maybe living.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Thank you.

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
What is hot couture if it's not alive and adapting for the times?

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Sorry.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Every ball stick to the game.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Much like Daniel.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Radcliffe in the role of bond.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
What do you guys think?

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
It's fun.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
That's fun.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
I could I could see it.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
To go from miracle workers to that is would be the best turn ever.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
All right.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Jake.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
I got it.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Is it sauce?

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
It's not.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
It's a good one.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
It's a good one.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
It's not.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
It's not.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
I wish that it had been.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
It was algae.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
What?

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
It was algae.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
It was algae.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Got the algae.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
She.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
And that's.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
She's like a combination of algae and colonjose.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
Or really.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Sauce and colonjose.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Sauce and colonjose.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
You get algae.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Yeah.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
But she got it.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
Is it Sasha Baron Cohen?

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Uh, no.

39:34.000 --> 39:39.000
Is it smaller than a bread box?

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
It is.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
But that's it.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
That's two questions.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
It was throat culture.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Wait a second.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
Don't you get to guess?

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Yeah.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
Don't you get to do two questions and then guess or two?

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Yeah.

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
The throat can chew.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
Um, my heart out is now.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
I'm using that because you want to get out.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Yes.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
You do get to guess.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
For dot about that.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Um, yeah.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
And throat culture is when you wear.

40:16.000 --> 40:22.000
Prada runway outfits to get strip B checked out.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Here we go.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
Back to Justin.

40:27.000 --> 40:33.000
This one's a real trick you want.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
Okay.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Is it.

40:36.000 --> 40:41.000
I'll go with bigger than a bread box.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
It's almost more ethereal.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
It's not.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
You can't answer that.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
There's no questions.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Other fucking guys supposed to get these.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Yeah.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Exactly.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
My second question is, is it almost more ethereal?

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Or is it more ethereal?

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
It's more ethereal.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
It's more ethereal.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Okay.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
Now you're guess.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
Um.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Uh,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Is it speeding in a car?

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
I might have to give you that one.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
What is it?

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
It was a wretched ways of thought.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Wow.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
That's yeah.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
It's close.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
It's close enough for two questions.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
I'll give you that one.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Sure.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Uh, and we'll wrap it up with.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Uh, her wits.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
That's probably.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Is it bigger than a bread box?

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
Uh, ideally not.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
Can you eat it?

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
You can.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
It's my group.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Things.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
I'll give you that one.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
It's a UTI.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
And you're starting it with you.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
Can consume things.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Yeah.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Game over.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Plugs.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Wow.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Justin, what do you have going on?

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
What do you want to point the people to the floor is yours.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Go social media projects.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Uh, flash.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Uh, etc.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
Sure.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Yeah.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
I'm.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Uh, at Justin and Lynnville in social media.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
Uh, the.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
I'm going to show a call welcome to flash.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
That's coming out.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
Uh, it looks like March 2022.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
So it'll be a little while.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
And then, um,

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
I've podcast called my injustice.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Excellent week.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
My friend Maya Sharma.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Hell yeah.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Yeah.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
Um, so yeah, definitely.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
What's a good episode for people to listen to for the first time?

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
Um, we're coming out with new episodes like starting next week on Planet

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Scum, which is a digital company network.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
Um, so probably that first one, which will be on October 25th, 8 p.m.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Hell yeah.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Uh, so that all three days after this comes out.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
Three days.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
And I've decided that scarves are in.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
I like this whole thin scarf.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
So I just want to say scarves are back.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
And scarves are back and just a little scarf.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
You can tie.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
Oh, you know what?

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
Yeah.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
Yeah.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
Just sort of.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
You're new in that.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
And I think they said that is great fire.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
Yeah.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Yeah.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Jeff's eyes just lit the fuck up.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
No, because I have a new style option.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Yeah.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
Scars and pocket squares and mascots.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Mmm.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
mascots are crazy.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Ascotts are basks.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Gotts.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
They are those.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
I want to a drug.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Yeah.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000

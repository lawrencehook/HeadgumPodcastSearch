00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a headgum original.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
That's it.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
The whole episode.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
What a fucking good episode.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
It's a mood killer.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Just right off the bat.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Right off the bat.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
I don't like the energy that everybody's brought already.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
You guys are danced.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
We fucking danced for you.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
This way.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
You smell the dance.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
You do dance.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
I love a good noodle dance.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Like a crung bin concert.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Were you just kind of noodle left to right?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Yeah.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
That's what everybody does a dead and company.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
You want to two of those, right?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Yeah.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Two grateful dead shows.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
On to Rush?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Mike, it came up with that sound best.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Before the live show.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
And I forgot to use it.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Got it.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
How do you think the live show went?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Me, Jeff.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Yeah.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
I just a little post-mortem on.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
I think we ever discussed it.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
It's hard because like everybody seemed to like it.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Which is good.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
But I felt like everyone sort of stole my thunder.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
There were a couple like tech hiccups.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
I wonder if those were built into the show.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Because I one point you blamed having to switch computers.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
That was really, I don't know if you heard.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
But there was, we played Jeff Hardy during a live show.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
And I think during the final Jeff Hardy, Jeff's like,

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Oh, actually the, the final thing is on my other computer.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
So we just scrapped that four minute bit during a live show.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
It was like the, it was the family.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
It was the family.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
It was the family.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Yeah.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
You also didn't know.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
You had no idea what any of the category said, right?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
So you couldn't actually like bear it.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Like we would guess.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
And you didn't know if it was right or wrong.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
And you just had to say you had to click and reveal.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
I feel like like all comedians learn,

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
especially sketch and all comedians less is more over time.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Yeah.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
And like less props, less music cues, less video cues.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Jeff right now is firmly in the more is more now.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
He's the more sound boards.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I, so the, okay.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
So the family rude thing of not knowing what was on the survey.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
That was on me.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
And that's something I learned of like, I need to have cards or something to know what

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
the categories are.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
So I can say survey says and then no.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
The final round of family rude was messed up because I came to the venue for tech

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
completely prepared my entire laptop was set up.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
All I needed to do was plug in the HDMI to the venue set up.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
And then we did it and it kept connecting for like two minutes.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
And then it would cut out as soon as we had it all set up.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
So we tried that like four times with different dongles and it just wasn't working.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
So we brought Marieka's burner laptop.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
And because that had the HDMI input direct and that worked.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
So I had to, I had to air drop everything to her.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
And I forgot to air drop the list of family rude questions.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Various.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
You can edit all of that out.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Yeah.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
This is too inside baseball.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
So what did we miss?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
What did we?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
What did we?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah, what it was not on the new laptop.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Let me find it.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Oh, I'm here to ask questions.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
You just don't have it.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Deeper into.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I'm just curious because yeah, during the live show he's like,

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Oh, never mind.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
I don't have this thing.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
And like, you know,

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Well, Jeff's thinking for us.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Jake and I'm here.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
How would you describe Jeff's mood post show?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Did he feel celebratory?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Or did he feel like you did?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
He rushed it.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
He knocked it out of the park.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
We didn't even, I'm like,

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
I'm going to have to build up this kid's confidence because like that didn't go well.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
But he was already writing so high that I felt like I had to knock him down a peg or two.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Got it.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
I mean, it went really well.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah, you feel good about it.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah, but you shouldn't think that.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Like, you should be focusing on the bad shit and be like,

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Oh, I don't know.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I'm worried about like, I forgot the family dual thing.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
But instead he's like, that was awesome.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
And it didn't matter that I forgot.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
So then I have to be like, I kind of did.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Usually, usually like, Jeff is the bad guy on this podcast,

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
but I actually think you're being kind of a piece of shit right now.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Holy shit.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
This is actually, this is what Jeff's been saying to me.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
This is my breaking bad moment.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Uh, it's bad.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
I'm back to hating Jeff.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah, yeah.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
For sure.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
It's incredible.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
It's incredible.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
You give him one compliment and he's like,

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I will ruin it now.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
This is, yeah.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
This is my moment.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I have to assign a sound effect to that.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
I just want to announce and then we can continue this kind of like natural

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
conversation, but we are waxing now.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
We're in the waxing portion.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Great.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
And we were, yeah.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Jeff, you played a sound bite from on to rush.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
How would you cast the four of us in the role of on to rush?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
That's awesome.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
I think Jake would be Vinnie Chase.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
I think really hoping you would say that.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
You would be, um,

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
I would be Johnny drama and a mirror would be.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Which do you mean to you?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
No, it's Johnny.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
No, there's, we don't have a turtle amongst us.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
We just don't.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
And you can't, like, at a certain point,

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
if you cast before you write,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
not effects the script.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I don't feel like Billy is an E.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Like, I,

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
maybe Billy's closer to a turtle,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
just a friendly, positive,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
fun-loving guy.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Nick's a little bit.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Yeah.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
I think, you know,

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
what about drama,

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
because he's, uh,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
he eats and makes a lot of food.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
And he's worried about people being fed.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
A provider.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Yeah.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
That's why I'd be him.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Not really.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
You're more of a turtle to be honest.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
You're a little bit of an E.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
What's that?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I think you're more of a turtle of the character.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
I think Jeff is already, he's already old.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
He's just like,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
like, seemingly in power,

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
but not really in power.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Victor.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Jeff is so sick.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Jeff is Lloyd, I think.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
He's sort of like,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
the little psychic to Ari.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Yeah.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Absolutely not.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Lower the man.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
What?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
What was that?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
What?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
What?

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
What?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
What?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
What the fuck is that?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Of all the sounds and words in the world.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I've heard it.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
I have no idea what I'm not going to figure it out.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Nice.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
How did you guys think the headgum podcast live show went,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
but also the entire weekend?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Uh, I mean,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I mean,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I mean,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
what's that?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Start with Billy.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Yeah.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
So I'm still images about 10 people on stage,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
really close found out there were technical difficulties

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
and Jeff had a great time.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
So no surprises.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
I'm looking forward to the next one.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Oh, yeah.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
If we can give the post-mortem notes,

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
having nine people on stage with like four or five microphones.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
My dad wasn't mad at me.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
My plan was to have six Macs.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Yeah.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
And that's.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
But then I was like,

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
everybody was having it.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I was like,

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Hmm.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
By once,

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
still more people than Mike's at six.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Yeah.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
More than the Mike's by one.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Yeah.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Yeah.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
We had five microphones.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Up.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Up.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Listen.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
I'm not.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
The energy around the green room was infectious.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
And it was quiet.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
There was no music.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Really going on.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
It was absolutely bumpy bumping.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
You had a bad reason.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
It sounds like you.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
I had a show.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Boss.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
That's no music.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
It was quiet.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
It was the best week in my life.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Yeah.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
I had a great time.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Really.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
I think there is one question that people do have that weren't at the festival.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Yeah.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Jake, you posted a series of photos that were

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
clearly captivated people.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
The series of photos featured a wet spot on on your

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
streams.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Two questions.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Were you intentionally posting that picture to drum up a conversation?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
You didn't mention the wet spot in your post.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Oh, did you?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Were you trying to make us talk about it?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
I know.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
So my idea for the bit was.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
It was just like all takes like a series of photos as I'm getting like closer and closer to you.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Wow.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
So like I have one that's further away than like a little closer than a little closer.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
And I think like the last one was like a video of me getting really up in

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
his face.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Okay.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
But then I got like 20.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I don't get that many DMs.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
But I got like 20 DMs.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
They were slimmed to your DMs.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Yeah.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
People split into the DMs about the wet spot.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
They split into the DMs about the fit of the teams.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Yeah.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
People talk about slim.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Yeah.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
I mean, people were saying your socks were ugly.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
So then I can't keep up.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I can't keep up with the fashion friends.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Then I haven't spent two years and I already feel out of date.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I've never gotten so much.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Keep going down in the DMs.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Yeah.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
And then when I posted screenshots of the DMs that I was getting.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
People really went off.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Yeah.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
That's one of what gets sort of open.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Yeah.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
It's never wanted to be on the story.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
So I guess behind the music.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
I'm here.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
What was the wet spot from?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
We all need to know.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Was it so great question?

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
It was such a specific.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
It was like a quarter sized spot on your upper thigh.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
And it didn't bleed out anywhere.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
It was just one circle of wetness.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
It was something.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Would you say the wetness was just so.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
No.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
I would say it was.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
I thought it was coffee.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
But then we're all.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
We're waxing.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
We're waxing.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Could you stay out of our way?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
No.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
I'm facilitating joy.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Yeah.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Although coffee would have been like I kept wetting the spot.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
You know, you do the old wet the spot.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Watch it.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Yeah.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I hopefully have spot dries with the wetness.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Yeah.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
The spot stayed.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
So it had to have been spoiled.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Ren oil based style stain.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Yes.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Exactly.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I wonder if it was some kind of dejan.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
A mustard nose.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
No.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
It could have looked like a mustard.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Yeah.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
What did you have for Princess that day?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
It was it was a coffee.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
And I want to say like a.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
A scum.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
It looked like fresh wetness.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
It looked like fresh wetness.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
That wasn't.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
I got to be a stain, correct?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Yeah.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
It was fresh wetness.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
It was from that day.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
But it wasn't wet at that moment.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Like it wasn't like people talked about.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
I think it was set.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
It wasn't wet.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
It was set.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
It wasn't piss.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Because it.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Yeah.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
It was part of the pants.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
It wasn't piss.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
It was kissed.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
I think a scot is actually.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I think a scot is a good guess because I think they're good.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
It's gone as well.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
It's real dry.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
That's kind of you.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Dry cream.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
That's why you use the clotted cream.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
And that's why I'd get some of the jeans.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Clotted jeans.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Did you have sous vide by its from Starbucks?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Those are a little grease to them.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Yeah.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Because that's an oily drop.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
But I didn't have it that day.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
I really cannot for the life.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
It was from blue bottle.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I think it was from blue bottle.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
So I don't remember exactly what I would eat.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
That would cause that.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
I want to say it was coughing.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
Because you know these lids that like they put the lid on top of the plastic.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
You have a master in that lid.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
They haven't.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
They haven't.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
The cop is a symbol.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Yeah.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
They got these days on the lip.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
They got rid of straws too fast.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I won't forget in rid of straws.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
We have a solution.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
But it doesn't exist yet.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Okay.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
It's not paper straws.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Don't go green without thinking through.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Yeah.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
That's right.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Wait.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Let's see what you got cold brew right now.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Jeff.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Are you?

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
It seems like a very courteous enthusiasm thing.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
We're Larry just like keep spilling because of the lid.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
The lid holds the liquid.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Yeah.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
And it's the lid holding the liquid there.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Are you getting any splash back on the.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Yeah.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Are you getting a splash back on the other side?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
100%.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
It gets all over your face.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
It's not good to drink.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I don't think it's good aesthetic either.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
There's something weird to me about being an adult with a sippy cup.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
It's just not.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
I need a bigger hole.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I'm trained on the full rim.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And I was just postage stamp sized.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
It's just changing everything.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
It's not cool.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
It's not cool to drink coffee like that.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
But like we're going to need a day to get nice.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
That's actually you need a smaller sort of tighter lid.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
But like I was saying back in the day like gas station coffee.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Like Billy you like hot black coffee.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
That's like the cool way to drink coffee.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Hot black.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
It's cool to be like, I like it shitty.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Like yeah, the shit like out of a friend.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Whatever those things like your bodega dollar coffee.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
You know that blue cup.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
Did they put the lid on it or is it like straight up open?

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
I mean, if you go to a fancy bodega, you might get a lid.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
But more often than not.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
I think it's just carry it and wish wish you the best.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
A hot.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
I remember those New York days where it was like you would like like line the edge of your cup

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
with like six napkins.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
And then those napkins would just be doused in coffee as you're walking down the sidewalk.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
It's like you just show up to meeting stained in coffee.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
The best thing in the world.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Jack.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
React.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Oh.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Like you zoned out.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
We're talking about coffee man.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Your house is just.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
It's because I do the assembly cuts on these.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
And so I just kind of like I'm clocking as we do them.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
What I'm going to cut out.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
What I'm not.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
And so that was all.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
I think it's all interesting.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
So I'm like, I don't if I why interact if I know that that's not going to end up in the final cut.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Up.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Up.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
We could.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Yeah.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Yeah.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Yeah.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
It gets everywhere.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
You fucking killed the wax.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Yeah.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
That's fine.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
That's fine.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
What what.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
What was your guys's favorite moment from the weekend?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Let's say.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
My favorite.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
I don't like to.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
I can't say it on the show.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
I know.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
I was thinking the exact same.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
At the Irish bar.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Yeah.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
No.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I want to finish out the weekend.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
And then we'll go to the beach sleep.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
That didn't be just a week.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
That was a different.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
I think that was a different weekend of the.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
The headgun podcast.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Oh, sorry.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Okay.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Yeah.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Okay.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
So me and we have the same.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Favorite moment shared in the Irish bar post show second night.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Yeah.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
That was my favorite moment of the weekend.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
The low point was after that when we went to Brooklyn.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Yeah.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Yeah.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Yeah.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Yeah.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Yeah.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
And then when I was in the back as we're gone.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Yeah.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Everything value.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
His laptop.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
You lost all this?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
No.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
I got it back.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Okay.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Yeah.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
But I had to go back to Manhattan to get it.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
And that's the worst feeling.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Your stomach just absolutely drops.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
We had that thing happen.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
You know, like in New York.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Billy, you get this.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
It's like the the very end of the night.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
But you're like, let's go to one last bar.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
We're all back to Brooklyn.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
One last bar.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
So I'm looking forward to at least like having one more hour with my guys.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Yep.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
We get there.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Me, Mike.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Johnny Jeff.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Sweet.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
We go.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
We go into the bar.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
And then Jeff is just standing a line.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
He forgot his backpack at the venue.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Jeff.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Everything.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Just spin around.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
They, they leave.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Johnny goes home.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Jeff goes back to Manhattan to get his backpack.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Why did Johnny?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Johnny's like, if Jeff's not here, I'm out.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
I think it just felt like energy.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Yeah.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
It was like three, 15 bars close at four.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
I think it was also like, I'm going.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
I was getting a lift back to Manhattan.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
So I was like, I'll drop you off on the way there.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Oh, yeah.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Johnny lives in Manhattan.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
So it was just like, yeah.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Yeah.

15:58.000 --> 16:05.000
But the, like I've ever moment that I can, that we can talk about was probably.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
Probably like right when the show started and you guys were coming out.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
And people were like going crazy.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Yeah.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
That's, that's, that's up there.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
And mine is when the show's over.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Right.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
I love, I love the post the post show feeling.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Because I get worked up.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
I get nervous before the show.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
When I'm on stage, it's all blur.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Yeah.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
It's the afterglow.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
That's what I do before.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
And after the afterglow.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
It's the after afterglow.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Mm-hmm.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
And then the hotel lobby.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
It's correct.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Um.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Yeah.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
I slept on the beach, Billy.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Why?

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
I was out with my one.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Because that was my comment on your Instagram.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
No.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
I've been running on adrenaline the last three weeks and just making every saying yes to everything.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Which is so much fun.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
But I also didn't sleep on the beach.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
We ended up just not sleeping.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
And so I'm like fucking exhausted.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Because every, I was in New York for two weeks, almost.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
And I don't think I slept more than five hours on any given night.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
I got one hour of sleep last week full, which made me feel more tired.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
Because once you stop running on adrenaline, you crash.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
And then.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Wait.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
What do you mean you got one hour of sleep last week?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Or one week?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Yeah.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Come on.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
That was a nice rest last week, I should say.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
So like one night last week, you got eight hours in the rest.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
You were just like cutting yourself off too early.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Yeah.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
And then Halloween didn't sleep a wink.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
And then last night slept six hours.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
So I'm fucking exhausted, guys.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
We think you're going to like fall sleep tonight at like nine p.m.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
And wake up at like noon the next day.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Like is that how you got it?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
No.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Now I'm climbing at nine p.m.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
What?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Where?

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Why?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Yeah.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Nice.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Because that's the only time George can do it.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
And I haven't seen it in a couple of weeks.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Actually, why?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
So I'm in Brooklyn.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
A couple weeks.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
He's your roommate.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
But he was in New Orleans.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
And I was in Kansas City.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
And then finally we're back.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
And then you're going to get COVID again.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I actually probably will.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
You're trending towards COVID too.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
You're going to be my first double breakthrough friend.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Yeah.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
You're flirting.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
You're flirting with COVID, more than you're flirting with.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
I don't know.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Someone else in your life.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Yeah.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
Whoever you slept on the beach with or didn't sleep on the beach with.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Even more.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Nice.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Nice.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
All right.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
We got to take a break.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
We will be right back.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
We're up.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Okay.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Today's episode of Sponsored by Honey.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Guys, we all shop online.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
And we've all seen that promo code field.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Tonk to sit check out borderline bullies.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
But thanks to honey, manually searching for coupon codes is a thing in the past.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
Honey is the free browser extension that scour is the internet looking for promo

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
codes and applies the best ones it can find to your cart.

18:42.000 --> 18:49.000
Honey sports over 30,000 stores online sites that range from tech and gaming products to popular fashion brands, even food delivery apps.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Nope.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Imagine you're shopping on one of your favorite sites.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Right.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
When you check out the honey button drops down and all you have to do is click apply coupons.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Wait a few seconds.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Honey searches for coupons.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
It can find for that site.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
And if it finds a working coupon, you'll watch the prices much like my ass drop.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
Honey's saved me money on a phone case.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
And five dollars off of twenty five dollar pair of jeans that I'm wearing as we speak.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
So if you don't get honey, you're straight up missing out on free savings.

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
Honey has found it's over 17 million members over two billion dollars in savings.

19:22.000 --> 19:29.000
Meaning if you don't have it, which is free to download your hemorrhaging money that you don't need to be.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
So literally get it.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
It's free and installs in a couple seconds.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
And by getting it, you'll be doing yourself a solid and supporting the headgum podcast.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Again, that's joinhoney.com slash what's that?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Thanks, honey.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Guys, the holidays are coming up.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Right.

19:48.000 --> 19:55.000
And you definitely have family members who are either audio files or you don't quite know what to get them.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
And that's where Raycon comes in.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
All right.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
It's never too early to get start gift shopping for the holidays, especially because today you can

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
save big on a gift they'll use every day.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
And those are the Raycon wireless earbuds.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Raycon sent me two pairs of earbuds.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
And I got to say they are absolutely a joy to use.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
I use them while I climb.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
I use them while I go for a little bike rides.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
They really fit inside your ear because they come with multiple little gummies to fit to your

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
ear specifically.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
And they sound amazing.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
And they also have seamless Bluetooth pairing and a comfortable noise isolating fit.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
So you can start listening right away and keep listening for hours.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
The audio quality is absolutely comparable to any other earbuds I've ever used.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
And compared to the prices of other brands, Raycon starts at half the price.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
The new everyday earbuds come with three new sound profiles to make sure that everything you're

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
listening to sounds it's best with just the right amount of bass.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
All right.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
There's pure mode for podcast listening, blues, instrumentals.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
I mostly use that balanced mode for different podcasts depending on the voice's host.

20:58.000 --> 21:04.000
Rock, heavy metal, et cetera, and there's bass mode for hip hop, EDM, reggae, et cetera.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
Raycon offers eight hours of playtime with a 32 hour battery life.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
And there's also a built-in mic so you can take calls on your earbuds at the press of a button.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I take my therapy calls with Raycon.

21:14.000 --> 21:20.000
So this holiday season get them something they can use for calls or work or play or music or anything

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
on the go and pick up a pair of Raycon's.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Trust me, you or they are going to use them every day.

Thanks Raycon.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
And we're back.

21:52.000 --> 21:58.000
Let's get straight into the most fan favorite of all segments recently.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Bond of the absolute week.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
I can't continue being on this.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I said my bond.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
No, it's every week.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
You have to choose a new bond until next month.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
This week, my casting choice because I think we're getting further and further away from the

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
has to be from the UK, the milk boys.

22:17.000 --> 22:23.000
I followed, do I send you the milk boys?

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
They're an absolute shit follow.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
You, if you ever follow someone who's kind of a disaster on purpose, just to see what

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
kind of insane things they're up to.

22:33.000 --> 22:40.000
They're these four Canadian prankster twins that are like over Trump supporters now.

22:40.000 --> 22:46.000
And all they do is like go to parties and party and go to colleges and like give kids

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
drugs and make YouTube videos and get banned on YouTube.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
They're insane.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
They're terrible.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
But they're wildly entertaining for me.

22:55.000 --> 23:01.000
That's a 38 year old who's just like at home doing nothing following this milk milk.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
And ELK.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
Yeah, it's one of the worst words I've ever heard.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Yeah.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
I think that's half the reason why I'm here like.

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
They get like millions like they like, they drop these like we're making this live stream

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
and like 2.1 million fucking college kids are all following them.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
And they're like, we're at this place, come party with us.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
And it's like during COVID before the vaccine, like a bar or a warehouse.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
They drop their own like a hard cider recently.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
No, hard sell to recently.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
They're wildly successful.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
If I may, if I may backtrack for one quick second, we're talking about the milk boys.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Why are we talking about milk?

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
You said something about bond at some point.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Oh yeah.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
The second is bond to the week.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
So every week until the next bond is cast,

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
we're going to just kind of lob up an idea for casting.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
So this week, I'm thinking what if the milk boys were James Bond?

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Got it.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Okay.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Yeah.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
That'd be terrible James Bond's.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
They're all like barely pubes and pretty bad.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Yeah.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
I just saw my first James Bond movie.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
I'd never seen a James Bond movie before this most recent one.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
What do you think?

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
I thought he's a great driver.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
I can, he's like the best car driver I've ever seen.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Yeah.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Good at shooting.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Seems like a pretty decent guy.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
And the ending surprised me to put it mildly.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Yeah.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
This movie.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
I think I didn't, I didn't like it.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
The ending.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
I think it's got it.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
It's got it.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Yeah, I know.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Okay.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
So I was saying.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
I was saying.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Yeah.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Has anyone seen it?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I've spoiled it.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
I've spoiled the ending.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Two multiple people because I didn't know.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
I've spoiled it to me.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
You're going to spoil it to me.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Well, I mean, I guess it's bad if people are going to walk.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Yeah.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
But it's not quite long.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
You can't spoil it on the podcast.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
No, no.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
It's not right.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
It's uncouth.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
I enjoyed it.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
I enjoyed the music.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I thought the movie was pretty, pretty solid.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Yeah.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
I guess it's like a, it's part of the, like, the whole mystique of James Bond.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
But how do they fucking shoot him with machine gunfire constantly and never, never even, never.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Never even, never get even grazed.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Yeah.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
He was like walk towards a machine gun.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Yeah.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
And then boom.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I have a single pistol in your dead because I got shot.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
What are you eating?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
What is that?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
That's fake.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
I just eating bacon after bacon.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
You just, you made bacon.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
And that's it.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
You're eating it on the podcast.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
You can't even talk while people are talking.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
This is what you guys want to fucking take it over, right?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
That's what you've been doing in the entire half hours.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
So be my disgusting bond.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
You said bond to the week.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
You haven't done your best.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Think of the week.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
You're talking about a real fucking movie.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Daniel Gregg is already in that.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Who's your casting pick?

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
And then let's move on.

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
Shrek.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Yeah.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Shrek is from the UK.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
That's true.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
I think that'll work.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Got the accent.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Kind of fits in.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Where's the suit?

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Well.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Yeah.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
I'll say Henry Cavill.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
That's pretty good.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
What do you mean pretty good?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
It's actually fucking perfect.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
You could.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Yeah.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Fucking exactly.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
That's right.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
That's right.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Wow.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Yeah.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Fucking.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Cool steam ahead.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Okay.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
We gotta go to our next segment.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Jeff?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
I didn't just say one.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I didn't say one.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
It's fun.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
We're eating.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Welcome to Meta or Feta.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Oh, God.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Did you guys see the news?

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Yeah.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Facebook is changing its company name.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
But not the actual like website name.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
The Facebook company.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
It's now Meta.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
And Feta is cheese.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
That's so dumb.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
So who the fuck cares?

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
This is exactly everybody.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
I guess.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Yeah.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
It was a publicity thing and it worked.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
And now Facebook still called Facebook with the company that owns it is called

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Meta.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Great.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
It's like Google is called like the ABC company.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Right.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Yeah.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
So it's like.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Yeah.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Who cares?

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Jake Mark Zuckerberg.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
And you are in the same event.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
Do you feel compelled to want to introduce yourself to Mark Zuckerberg?

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Or you like fuck that guy?

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
I wouldn't feel compelled to introduce myself to him.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
I wouldn't.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I wouldn't not do it because I hate him though.

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
I would just be if people usually when people are like excited about a famous person.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
I like to tack the other way and not give a shit.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Yeah.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
But not like I'm mad.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
I'm not like.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Yeah.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
I feel you.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
You're not had strong about it.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Would you be star struck?

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
No.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
This is not a segment of Zuckerberg.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
It's fine.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
I like Meta.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
I like Meta.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Right.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Right.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Right.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Right.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
I would have to tackle him.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
I want Billy to fucking host the show.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Billy should be the host of the show.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
What?

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Billy is fucking fun.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Positive.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Ask interesting questions.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Responds when you answer.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Your antagonistic bacon eating ass.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
You fucking don't do jack shit.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
You just introduce seconds.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Like buy to the weeks.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Yellow people to wax and then play.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Wow.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
It's.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
You're a fucking poison man.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Yeah.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
I thought.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
I mean, it's a go.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Jake was saying that I was too rude to Jack.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
And it was.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
I basically saw.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
I just like Billy.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
I just like Billy.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
The name of the game is absolutely meta or Fedas.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
So I'm going to do.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
It's filling the blank.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
And you have to say whether it's meta or Fedas.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
All right.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Here we go.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
This is for actual cash.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
From $100 for every right answer.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
$100 for every right answer.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
$100 owed to me for every wrong answer.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Okay.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
Blank recently caused a big shift in the tech industry.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
meta.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
That's not that wrong.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
No, it's not meta cost.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
If anything, maybe both.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
But definitely meta.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Yeah.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
I know what kind of game it is now.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Sometimes.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
That doesn't do this.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
But sometimes.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Sometimes.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Sometimes.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Sometimes.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
But sometimes.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
But sometimes.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Sometimes.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
But sometimes.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
But sometimes.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Sometimes.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Sometimes.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Sometimes.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Sometimes.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Sometimes.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Sometimes.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Sometimes.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Sometimes.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Sometimes.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Sometimes.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Sometimes.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Sometimes.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Sometimes.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Maybe.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Sometimes.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Sometimes.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
It's sometimes.

29:16.000 --> 29:27.760
to happen. Feta. Meta. What? Which one? It was Feta. Do you care to explain why? Or is that just-

29:27.760 --> 29:33.600
I don't like that. I'm supposed to- okay. Right. Jeff, honest question, when you make these games,

29:33.600 --> 29:37.920
do you actually have answers to the teach question or do you just kind of see how we answer

29:37.920 --> 29:43.840
and then reverse engineer at the most prick answer in return? I actually have the answer,

29:43.920 --> 29:48.480
but I'm open to change sometimes. Like, I think when we played Hammer spam, one of the

29:48.480 --> 29:53.680
hands were spam and I still gave it to Marieka because it was sort of a birthday. That's nice.

29:55.520 --> 30:00.480
So where does the logo- what's that? Sort of her birthday or was it actually her birthday?

30:00.480 --> 30:04.400
I didn't say what's that at all during the show I realized when I listened back to it.

30:04.400 --> 30:10.640
Oh, interesting. Blanks logo is blue. Meta.

30:11.600 --> 30:19.760
I said Feta. Oh, god damn it. All right. So Jake is- that's $400. I think every single answer in

30:19.760 --> 30:25.440
this quiz is Feta. And wrong. Because Feta's logo is not blue. No, President Feta.

30:26.800 --> 30:35.680
President cheese is Feta is blue. And President cheese? Who's President cheese? President cheese is a company.

30:36.640 --> 30:45.840
It's a brand of cheese. And their Feta is blue. Their logo is blue and the box that the Feta is delivered in is blue.

30:46.800 --> 30:52.160
And I want you to be so. I want you to be seasonally depred of this winter, please.

30:52.160 --> 30:56.160
You do me that one favor. Would you do me that one common courtesy?

31:00.880 --> 31:03.520
All right. Blank pairs well with wine.

31:05.680 --> 31:13.520
Meta. We were looking for Feta. See, that's a good example of what I was talking about earlier.

31:13.520 --> 31:18.480
Yeah, I'm concerned with him. If you said Feta, he would have said no. No, I would have said.

31:18.480 --> 31:23.040
So here we go. Blank is an exciting new approach to socialization online.

31:23.840 --> 31:29.760
Feta. Because it's the fucking house. Yeah, so that's going to be zooming with a friend while eating Feta.

31:29.840 --> 31:40.080
Feta, which is a cheese. We know, we know it's a cheese. The whole thing has been about this cheese.

31:40.080 --> 31:44.560
All right. You said President cheese at one point. Blank will be an exciting chapter.

31:44.560 --> 31:46.320
Meta. Meta. Meta.

31:46.320 --> 31:46.960
Meta.

31:46.960 --> 31:48.560
You didn't even hear that. You guys think,

31:48.560 --> 31:49.760
Meta.

31:49.760 --> 31:50.960
You have a really caution.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.160
Mama mama mama mama mama mama.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.200
He's an exciting new chapter for the Facebook company. Feta.

31:55.360 --> 32:00.800
Meta. Correct. So that's going to be the introduction of Feta in Facebook breakrooms across the company.

32:00.800 --> 32:05.520
I said it first. I think, because I said Feta as soon as you start. How much cash do I have at this point?

32:06.960 --> 32:09.040
You have, I think, $700.

32:09.040 --> 32:09.840
Nice.

32:09.840 --> 32:14.720
Jeff, Jeff, can you cite your sources? Who said that Feta is going to be in Meta breakrooms?

32:14.720 --> 32:15.520
Moving forward.

32:18.880 --> 32:19.920
Another piece of bacon.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.920
Bill, you're in the dog house.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.920
Now, this is like a new thing.

32:29.920 --> 32:32.240
No, you just crossed me one too many times.

32:32.240 --> 32:32.560
So here.

32:32.560 --> 32:32.800
Yeah.

32:32.800 --> 32:35.040
This is going to be two minutes on the clock.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.560
You can't speak for the next two minutes.

32:36.560 --> 32:40.880
Billy was one of the most like polite, positive, fun loving.

32:40.880 --> 32:44.560
You know what I said, I said, you ruined the live show.

32:44.560 --> 32:50.640
Billy just asked you what your source was as to how you heard Facebook breakrooms are getting

32:50.640 --> 32:52.400
Feta and he got into the dog house.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.280
Billy's like a textbook definition of a good guy.

32:55.280 --> 33:00.320
So if you have beef with Billy, that's, that's on you, brother.

33:00.320 --> 33:03.440
Actually, and fuck it for the next minute and a half.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.040
Just well, Billy's in the dog house.

33:05.040 --> 33:08.800
I'm going to go in on your sad little eyes.

33:08.800 --> 33:14.560
I really, really, I wish you, I wish you froze to the death on the beach, man.

33:17.840 --> 33:21.040
Wow. Holy shit.

33:21.120 --> 33:24.560
Let's that guy, Stel, the movie about the guy that froze in a van.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.920
The movie about a cult of the wild or something.

33:27.920 --> 33:31.840
Oh, he died of, you know, he was poisoned.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.240
He poisoned himself by eating poisonous berries.

33:34.240 --> 33:37.200
And he's, the stomach sort of ate itself from the inside.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.800
Oh, and Chris McCandless.

33:38.800 --> 33:42.560
You're thinking you have into the, yeah, could die like that.

33:44.000 --> 33:44.960
That would be interesting.

33:44.960 --> 33:45.760
That would be fun.

33:46.800 --> 33:50.320
And we'd have to find, they'd find his skill little remains and we'd have to identify him

33:50.400 --> 33:54.880
by his shitty teeth, because he has bad dental hygiene as we all remember.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.560
So we'd look at the bite.

33:56.560 --> 34:00.240
There's an over bite under bite, a couple of cavities, both.

34:00.240 --> 34:03.040
Oh, yeah, but the whole, yeah.

34:04.080 --> 34:08.480
But we'd say, oh, this is definitely Jeff, because he, you know, notoriously took such bad

34:08.480 --> 34:09.680
care of his teeth.

34:09.680 --> 34:10.880
So have to be him.

34:10.880 --> 34:14.480
All he drank was coffee and ate bacon and like that was enough.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.040
He rarely slept and he was rarely happy.

34:17.120 --> 34:21.120
And it was probably, it all started with some sort of infection that was never

34:21.120 --> 34:23.120
canaled, or otherwise.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.720
That's, that's correct.

34:24.720 --> 34:28.480
They'd ask, because if we want the remains to have a funeral and we would say,

34:28.480 --> 34:30.560
and we'd start laughing and giggling to ourselves.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.320
They're like, oh, yeah, yeah, definitely cool.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.440
We'll do that.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.680
Yeah, and yeah, they're knowing full well.

34:35.680 --> 34:38.960
We're both sort of trading out, taking dumps in the urn.

34:40.160 --> 34:42.800
So Jeff, I guess my question would be putting me in the dog house.

34:42.800 --> 34:43.520
Was it worth it?

34:43.600 --> 34:46.640
That was easy.

34:46.640 --> 34:49.840
Ah, ha ha ha.

34:49.840 --> 34:52.160
All right, let's round this out.

34:52.160 --> 34:59.040
Mark Zuckerberg, Mark Zuckerberg approved.

34:59.040 --> 35:03.600
The idea and yes, Jake is fucking $800.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.280
He put Fedah in his Greek salad.

35:05.280 --> 35:08.320
Blink is the best place to access the Metaverse online.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.400
Fedah?

35:12.880 --> 35:13.360
Meta.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.240
He lost it all.

35:14.240 --> 35:18.160
Oh, yeah, yeah, that was an $800 bonus round.

35:18.160 --> 35:21.200
Um, this is not what I wanted this to be.

35:21.840 --> 35:24.400
I was torn a new one and born a new.

35:25.040 --> 35:25.520
Yibun.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.040
I finally break.

35:31.120 --> 35:38.320
It was the fun comment for me, dog.

35:39.840 --> 35:42.640
Have you eaten anything besides the bacon and the cold brew?

35:42.640 --> 35:44.800
Today, uh, that's right.

35:44.800 --> 35:47.840
Yep, just caffeine and pork fat.

35:49.840 --> 35:52.560
Oh, I don't want to, oh, god damn it.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.600
Yeah, Yibun moved me $800.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.040
Transition.

35:57.040 --> 35:57.760
Yeah, the station.

35:58.400 --> 36:02.400
Jeff, I know that you, uh, often sent thousands of dollars

36:02.400 --> 36:05.040
seemingly to your friends throughout this podcast.

36:05.040 --> 36:09.120
Have you read the fine print on Venmo about exchanging money and how you actually have

36:09.120 --> 36:11.920
to report over $600 in exchanges?

36:11.920 --> 36:14.640
So even these taxable then, it's now taxable event.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.440
So even these little games that you play with your friends,

36:17.440 --> 36:22.320
like that moment with Jake probably cost you $2.25 on your taxes.

36:22.320 --> 36:25.440
And you've done it seemingly dozens of times, maybe hundreds.

36:25.600 --> 36:29.200
So you may, and you get it back, you've made technically like thousands of dollars

36:29.200 --> 36:32.160
this year that you owe like 40% on for like short trips.

36:32.160 --> 36:34.240
That's right, that's income, that's income.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.000
And that's not even a forward-facing joke.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.560
Like that's the joke between people on an audio podcast.

36:38.560 --> 36:42.160
So like, even the public doesn't even get the get what you want out of it.

36:42.160 --> 36:46.240
So that's very expensive, little, uh, all risk and zero reward.

36:46.240 --> 36:46.960
That's right. Yeah.

36:46.960 --> 36:51.520
So I didn't explain Russian relate with six bullets.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.960
I really didn't know that.

36:52.960 --> 36:57.200
Yeah, I probably owe hundreds of dollars in taxes for nonsense.

36:57.200 --> 36:58.960
That's right. Yeah, definitely.

36:59.840 --> 37:00.960
Fuck me.

37:00.960 --> 37:03.760
And I don't think you're going to learn a damn thing.

37:03.760 --> 37:06.080
No, I, what about cash app?

37:06.080 --> 37:09.440
The, the, the, everything right now, it's all the same.

37:09.440 --> 37:10.880
Look at the photo.

37:12.880 --> 37:14.320
Just Venmo photo.

37:14.320 --> 37:17.840
It's, it's traffic for what you use Venmo.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.240
Sorry, I'm, hope or so.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.840
Yeah, let's get into our last segment.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.520
This is, were you really crying in that photo?

37:28.240 --> 37:29.760
Uh, no, it was eye drops.

37:30.400 --> 37:32.960
I, I hadn't cried for a year until Halloween.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.280
Why did you cry on Halloween?

37:35.280 --> 37:37.440
Because you were a fucking cold on the beach, sure.

37:37.440 --> 37:41.520
No, uh, they played broke down palace and I started weeping.

37:42.880 --> 37:43.760
That's cool.

37:43.760 --> 37:44.480
The beach planet.

37:47.840 --> 37:59.360
What was that?

38:02.960 --> 38:04.240
What the hell was that?

38:07.760 --> 38:08.800
He's on code.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.160
He's doing cocaine acting.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.720
I was doing cocaine bacon.

38:13.760 --> 38:14.560
Good to see.

38:15.280 --> 38:15.840
What's it?

38:15.840 --> 38:16.800
Good to eat badread.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.720
Oh, that's cool from succession.

38:18.720 --> 38:19.200
You didn't.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.480
Because you know, you don't kill his cat.

38:20.480 --> 38:20.880
He's caught up.

38:20.880 --> 38:21.840
I'm going to be like the thing, right?

38:21.840 --> 38:23.440
Yeah, I'm only halfway through season two.

38:23.440 --> 38:26.160
I didn't, you didn't see Sunday's episode.

38:26.160 --> 38:28.640
No, I'm a, I'm a good way through season two.

38:28.640 --> 38:32.720
Okay, well, it's not a spoiler, but they play a game in a limo called Good To Eat Bad To Eat

38:32.720 --> 38:35.520
because Kendall's getting like obsessed with his own image.

38:35.520 --> 38:38.960
He's kind of believing his own press, um, even though not all of it's positive.

38:38.960 --> 38:39.600
So here we go.

38:39.600 --> 38:40.960
Uh, this is Good To Eat Bad To Eat.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.120
Amir Blumenfeld edition, um,

38:43.760 --> 38:47.360
when we're only going to do the bad tweet and then the segments.

38:49.120 --> 38:52.880
These are real tweets from people who have tweeted about or at.

38:52.880 --> 38:53.760
Amir, are you ready?

38:54.480 --> 38:56.240
Yeah, I love how do we play?

38:56.240 --> 38:57.760
Wait, how do we even play?

38:58.320 --> 38:58.800
That's it.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.800
What does the whole game is Jeff just reading them?

39:00.800 --> 39:02.960
Oh, we don't even say you're like, Good To Eat Are Bad To Eat?

39:02.960 --> 39:05.760
I think I thought Amir said, uh, you don't like in the show.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.120
Kendall yells Good To Eat.

39:07.120 --> 39:10.800
So you say Good To Eat Are Bad To Eat and I'll read that and be really excited.

39:11.760 --> 39:13.040
Good To Eat.

39:13.040 --> 39:13.760
Good To Eat.

39:13.760 --> 39:14.240
I want to read it.

39:14.240 --> 39:16.160
I'm partial to Amir Blumenfeld.

39:16.160 --> 39:17.600
That's from Phil McCreeory.

39:18.640 --> 39:19.360
That's funny.

39:19.360 --> 39:20.000
That's great.

39:20.000 --> 39:20.560
All right.

39:20.560 --> 39:21.200
That's it.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.040
Uh, and then not to the next person.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.680
Bad To Eat Bad To Eat, uh,

39:25.680 --> 39:28.560
witnessing Amir Blumenfeld's gambling addiction is hilarious.

39:28.560 --> 39:29.680
That came in from Raven.

39:31.040 --> 39:31.760
What?

39:31.760 --> 39:32.560
What do you mean?

39:32.560 --> 39:34.400
You do have a gambling addiction.

39:34.400 --> 39:34.800
Yeah.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.400
Why don't you do?

39:36.400 --> 39:38.080
You can't not toy with cash.

39:38.400 --> 39:40.480
I mean, it's exciting.

39:40.480 --> 39:46.080
It's a vice that I enjoy, but I wouldn't say I'm any more addicted to it than somebody that likes a beer at the end of the day.

39:47.520 --> 39:47.840
All right.

39:47.840 --> 39:48.320
Good To Eat.

39:49.600 --> 39:50.480
Sorry, one second.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.040
Boy, here we go.

39:53.040 --> 39:53.840
This is your game.

39:54.480 --> 39:55.600
I know I'll cut this out.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.840
I just, you can't cut it out.

39:57.840 --> 39:58.400
It's a video.

39:58.880 --> 40:01.040
I'm going to love when Jeff goes into a character.

40:01.040 --> 40:02.320
I'm going to start acting.

40:03.040 --> 40:07.120
No, I was going to check something that had to do with this and I can't remember what it is.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.480
And then I started getting frustrated.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.560
God damn it, I don't remember.

40:10.560 --> 40:12.400
All right, good to eat.

40:12.400 --> 40:15.600
I was this close to going on TikTok live with Amir Blumenfeld.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.920
Who's the only reason I'm even remotely funny today.

40:17.920 --> 40:19.840
That was from free roaming goat.

40:20.400 --> 40:21.360
Oh, that's nice.

40:21.360 --> 40:21.840
Very nice.

40:21.840 --> 40:22.240
That tweet.

40:22.240 --> 40:24.240
It's bad to eat, bad to eat, bad to eat, here we go.

40:24.240 --> 40:27.200
So, uh, what about the other people in the Zoom?

40:27.200 --> 40:28.400
Why are we only doing me?

40:28.400 --> 40:29.200
Sure.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.480
He's got that sort of deal.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.480
I didn't say bad to eat.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.240
Jake said bad to eat.

40:34.240 --> 40:34.640
Yeah.

40:34.640 --> 40:34.960
Sure.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.960
He's got that sort of deal of salt and pepper

40:36.960 --> 40:38.640
thing going, but that's it.

40:38.640 --> 40:42.160
Other than that, Amir Blumenfeld is still what he has historically been,

40:42.160 --> 40:44.480
and will always be a loser.

40:44.480 --> 40:45.920
That can be from Alfie.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.040
That can be from Hatch.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.080
Jeff Boyarty.

40:48.080 --> 40:48.720
Yeah.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.320
That really can't say that to you.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.440
Can I see that tweet?

40:51.440 --> 40:54.480
I can't figure out the screen share thing.

40:54.480 --> 40:55.440
Uh, the what?

40:55.440 --> 40:56.720
The screen share.

40:56.720 --> 40:58.160
The screen share.

40:58.160 --> 41:01.120
And you can figure out the deal.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.400
The screen share.

41:02.400 --> 41:06.240
What if for all of 2022, I'm a fucking 40s mobster.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.840
Incared to the entire year.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.040
I would do it.

41:09.040 --> 41:09.840
You're in here.

41:09.840 --> 41:11.280
I was a mobster.

41:11.280 --> 41:12.320
Here we go.

41:12.320 --> 41:13.760
You're a mobster year.

41:13.760 --> 41:14.480
No one second.

41:14.480 --> 41:15.280
Good or bad tweet.

41:16.320 --> 41:17.520
I'm not doing me again.

41:17.520 --> 41:18.800
I mean, it would be faster.

41:18.800 --> 41:19.840
Did you do this show?

41:19.840 --> 41:20.160
Yeah.

41:20.160 --> 41:20.640
Good.

41:20.640 --> 41:21.360
I'm a comedy.

41:21.360 --> 41:22.800
They only did two on the show.

41:22.800 --> 41:23.120
Okay.

41:23.840 --> 41:26.640
But the second one, Kendall was already sort of taking a back.

41:26.640 --> 41:27.680
And I get the way.

41:29.200 --> 41:32.240
I'm a compet only for my boy fee and Amir Blumenfeld.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.600
That's from IP.

41:33.680 --> 41:36.480
Compet means compulsory heterosexual.

41:36.480 --> 41:38.720
So that means like, I think they're only straight for you.

41:39.920 --> 41:40.720
Okay.

41:40.720 --> 41:41.200
Yeah.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.000
Good.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.600
It's kind of a high honor.

41:45.280 --> 41:45.920
Yeah.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.240
You didn't get much of a reaction.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.160
Let's just call Spade a spade.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.360
We all think we're going to be better.

41:51.360 --> 41:52.400
Are these real?

41:52.400 --> 41:52.880
Yes.

41:52.880 --> 41:53.920
That was IP.

41:53.920 --> 41:54.720
That was.

41:54.720 --> 41:55.360
I'll talk about it.

41:55.360 --> 41:55.920
Bad tweet.

41:55.920 --> 41:58.000
I didn't know what compet meant until I saw that.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.240
Jeff did an AMA yesterday.

42:00.240 --> 42:03.200
And no, it's some point.

42:04.160 --> 42:06.160
He wanted us to ask him anything.

42:06.160 --> 42:11.360
And somebody said, who's the best guest on the headgum podcast?

42:11.360 --> 42:13.280
And he proceeded to list.

42:13.280 --> 42:16.880
I'd say maybe 16 to 18 people who were the best guests.

42:16.880 --> 42:18.080
And one was the worst.

42:18.080 --> 42:18.560
Amir.

42:18.560 --> 42:21.440
So of course his intent was, hey, I'm making this two,

42:21.440 --> 42:23.200
throw like a jab at my buddy Amir.

42:23.200 --> 42:27.680
And also like keep this running gag going that Amir is the worst guest on this podcast.

42:27.680 --> 42:30.160
But I think that his second thing is,

42:30.160 --> 42:33.040
all tear your motive was, hey, if I tag these 18 people,

42:33.120 --> 42:36.400
this can drum up a whole new round of conversations amongst people.

42:36.400 --> 42:37.920
And now I am exactly.

42:37.920 --> 42:39.680
And now I'm at the top of the pyramid.

42:39.680 --> 42:41.600
And they're doing all of the work for me.

42:41.600 --> 42:44.640
But what happened folks was even more impressive.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.640
The 18 people tagged in the tweet.

42:46.640 --> 42:48.240
No one replied.

42:48.240 --> 42:50.800
No one acknowledge the working dog.

42:50.800 --> 42:52.720
And if you don't acknowledge a barking dog,

42:52.720 --> 42:54.960
it stops barking after a while.

42:54.960 --> 42:57.840
And I will eat your ass.

42:57.840 --> 42:58.560
No, you won't.

42:58.560 --> 43:01.040
It was so great to witness this.

43:01.040 --> 43:02.560
Oh, social media.

43:06.560 --> 43:08.080
Um, good to be bad to eat.

43:09.360 --> 43:10.000
That was great.

43:11.840 --> 43:13.360
Let's go bad to eat.

43:13.360 --> 43:16.240
The day Amir Blumenfeld eats at a Michelin-star restaurant

43:16.240 --> 43:18.640
is the day they decide to let poor weaklings

43:18.640 --> 43:20.640
into Michelin-star restaurants.

43:20.640 --> 43:22.400
That was from how he got fucky.

43:22.400 --> 43:22.800
Yeah.

43:22.800 --> 43:23.520
No way.

43:23.520 --> 43:24.240
They do.

43:24.240 --> 43:24.560
They do.

43:24.560 --> 43:27.760
Poor weaklings into those restaurants.

43:27.760 --> 43:28.240
Yeah.

43:31.520 --> 43:34.720
Um, between bad tweet.

43:34.720 --> 43:36.960
So the segment's not over.

43:36.960 --> 43:38.960
The applause just happened to the water.

43:38.960 --> 43:40.560
It was a really good tweet.

43:40.560 --> 43:41.360
I liked a lot.

43:41.360 --> 43:42.000
That was from Haddock.

43:42.000 --> 43:42.880
Good fuck you.

43:42.880 --> 43:43.360
Good tweet.

43:43.360 --> 43:46.480
Um, if I could meet any three people on the planet,

43:46.480 --> 43:47.840
it would be in this order.

43:47.840 --> 43:50.800
Amir Blumenfeld, Bernie Sanders, John Stewart.

43:50.800 --> 43:51.920
What about yours?

43:51.920 --> 43:53.280
And this one I thought was kind of nice.

43:53.280 --> 43:55.200
I mean, not only are you at the top there.

43:55.200 --> 43:59.040
Shmoel, but I thought that maybe we could list our three top people

43:59.040 --> 44:00.240
that we'd want to meet in the world.

44:00.320 --> 44:01.200
I just think that.

44:01.200 --> 44:04.880
So we're just pivoting to a different thing entirely.

44:04.880 --> 44:08.640
The game is over and how how how how how how how how how how

44:08.640 --> 44:10.560
a place is Blumenfeld and that group.

44:10.560 --> 44:13.760
Oh, like, four people because it's like,

44:13.760 --> 44:15.360
like, I guess we came true.

44:15.360 --> 44:16.560
No way.

44:16.560 --> 44:17.680
Guys who's wish came true.

44:17.680 --> 44:18.400
He's there.

44:18.400 --> 44:21.120
So like Bernie and John Stewart have to talk to the guy who's

44:21.120 --> 44:21.920
wish came true.

44:21.920 --> 44:22.240
Yeah.

44:22.240 --> 44:25.360
But then Blumenfeld is just there with Bernie.

44:25.360 --> 44:26.480
That's yeah.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.880
I'm sort of waxing politics doesn't make any like.

44:28.960 --> 44:31.440
I feel like I can see you're just a bander.

44:31.440 --> 44:32.720
Those three got in your eyes.

44:32.720 --> 44:33.920
You got to the conversation.

44:33.920 --> 44:34.720
For instance.

44:34.720 --> 44:35.200
Yeah.

44:35.200 --> 44:37.280
You're out for real.

44:37.280 --> 44:40.640
Where we have to assume that that fan is Jewish too.

44:40.640 --> 44:42.880
He just doesn't want to meet three Jews and he's not.

44:42.880 --> 44:43.840
Then hand himself.

44:43.840 --> 44:45.040
What was his name?

44:45.040 --> 44:46.160
Ben Hansen Kaplan.

44:46.160 --> 44:47.120
I don't think that's a Jewish name.

44:47.120 --> 44:47.440
Yeah.

44:47.440 --> 44:48.480
Kaplan's pretty Jewish.

44:48.480 --> 44:49.680
He's a Kaplan.

44:49.680 --> 44:50.160
Yeah.

44:50.160 --> 44:51.360
Hansen, not maybe.

44:51.360 --> 44:52.080
Hansen.

44:52.080 --> 44:52.640
Yeah.

44:52.640 --> 44:53.600
Maybe it's a half a half.

44:53.600 --> 44:54.080
A half for.

44:55.520 --> 44:56.880
Did you look up for anybody else?

44:56.880 --> 44:57.280
Billy.

44:59.360 --> 45:01.440
Oh, this is who you'd want to have dinner with?

45:01.440 --> 45:02.000
Yeah.

45:03.040 --> 45:04.960
Is this a living your dad or what?

45:05.680 --> 45:06.320
Hmm, your dad?

45:06.320 --> 45:06.880
I don't know.

45:06.880 --> 45:07.920
It's your idea.

45:07.920 --> 45:09.680
This is such horseshit.

45:09.680 --> 45:10.320
I'm sorry.

45:10.320 --> 45:12.960
But I came with some good games today.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.000
And you guys are like, right?

45:14.000 --> 45:14.320
Right.

45:14.320 --> 45:14.880
I'm only going to anger.

45:16.880 --> 45:19.920
Well, you, you played good tweet bad tweet.

45:19.920 --> 45:22.160
Which lasted four and a half rounds all on me.

45:22.160 --> 45:24.640
And then you said, who do you want to have dinner with?

45:24.640 --> 45:25.120
Okay.

45:25.120 --> 45:26.320
So let's, let's see what else we got.

45:26.320 --> 45:27.520
Come up Ryan or drink it.

45:28.160 --> 45:29.280
This will, let's just do a live.

45:29.280 --> 45:30.800
Colonel Brian Bobweer.

45:30.800 --> 45:34.800
And let's go fucking, um, the Nell.

45:34.800 --> 45:35.760
The Nell's voice.

45:35.760 --> 45:38.000
The Nell's voice as one, a malgum.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.680
Three people that you would have dinner with?

45:41.680 --> 45:42.480
Yeah.

45:42.480 --> 45:42.880
Yeah.

45:44.160 --> 45:47.920
Well, it have to be for me, um, Obama.

45:48.720 --> 45:49.760
And then, which one?

45:49.760 --> 45:51.760
Like Jeff Barack Obama.

45:51.760 --> 45:53.120
Michelle, or not Michelle.

45:53.120 --> 45:54.960
Uh, oh, I should, that's perfect.

45:54.960 --> 45:57.120
So it's Barack Obama,

45:58.160 --> 46:01.040
Malia Obama and Jeff Rose and Brooke.

46:01.040 --> 46:02.880
Because I feel awful.

46:02.880 --> 46:05.600
Well, no, then it's, you know, two people that kind of know each other.

46:05.600 --> 46:06.720
I feel like I'm at my best.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.080
That's a double road scene.

46:08.080 --> 46:08.880
Yeah, one's data.

46:08.880 --> 46:09.920
And then we get to know it.

46:09.920 --> 46:12.320
Yes, not a double date, but it's like we have a lot,

46:12.320 --> 46:15.680
we have a deeper connection than, you know, three random people.

46:15.680 --> 46:19.680
It's like, I get to introduce the Obama's to my good friend, Jeff.

46:19.680 --> 46:23.120
And then they're like, you know, that's like us, a father,

46:23.120 --> 46:24.800
a daughter bonding thing that happened.

46:24.800 --> 46:29.120
I feel like that results, the way you play this game is you got to,

46:29.120 --> 46:30.880
you've got to excuse me, you're typing.

46:30.880 --> 46:33.040
I don't know what you're doing, but I'm still in the middle of my.

46:33.760 --> 46:34.320
All right.

46:34.320 --> 46:34.720
Yeah.

46:34.720 --> 46:35.040
Yeah.

46:35.040 --> 46:35.920
No, it's fine.

46:35.920 --> 46:38.960
Uh, the game of this is to get that second dinner.

46:38.960 --> 46:40.320
That's not the wish dinner.

46:40.320 --> 46:42.560
That's just the, you know, the, the four, you know,

46:42.560 --> 46:43.520
quit typing, please.

46:43.520 --> 46:47.600
Uh, the four people want to come back and have that additional meal.

46:47.600 --> 46:48.400
Mm, okay.

46:48.400 --> 46:51.360
Did I say, and I feel like this sets us up for success.

46:51.520 --> 46:52.960
And everybody's zoned out.

46:52.960 --> 46:56.320
Billy's the only one that's fucking, I love the second dinner.

46:56.320 --> 46:59.040
I love at the end of the first meal where I'm like, I won that.

46:59.040 --> 47:00.160
I won that little social.

47:00.160 --> 47:00.560
That's a good thing.

47:00.560 --> 47:01.600
That's a good thing.

47:01.600 --> 47:03.200
Uh, we have a Saturday.

47:03.200 --> 47:05.040
We have Billy or fucking talking.

47:05.040 --> 47:06.800
Uh, we're talking like normal.

47:06.800 --> 47:08.400
In the middle of, yeah, we're, we're talking.

47:08.400 --> 47:09.200
We're talking.

47:09.200 --> 47:11.200
All right, bad, we don't have bad tweets left.

47:11.200 --> 47:11.840
So here we go.

47:11.840 --> 47:13.680
Amir has nothing to do with the dinner thing.

47:13.680 --> 47:14.880
That's from Wendy Williams.

47:14.880 --> 47:17.200
The dinner thing did seem interesting, but it doesn't seem like for us.

47:17.200 --> 47:19.040
And then we'll finish, then we'll do the dinner thing.

47:19.040 --> 47:21.200
Uh, rather talk through the dinner stuff.

47:21.680 --> 47:25.680
Uh, Amir can't stay at an event for more than an hour and a half without feeling anxious.

47:25.680 --> 47:27.680
That's that you're a deemable shit.

47:27.680 --> 47:28.720
That was from Avitall.

47:29.520 --> 47:30.880
No, none of these are true.

47:30.880 --> 47:31.840
The Wendy Williams.

47:31.840 --> 47:32.240
No way.

47:32.240 --> 47:33.040
She tweeted about me.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.120
If I had a gun with two bullets and was in a room with a mirror blooming fell

47:37.120 --> 47:40.880
and Vlad the impaler, I'd pistol whip a mirror beat the shit out of him and then

47:40.880 --> 47:41.520
shoot him dead.

47:41.520 --> 47:43.120
Well, Vlad got away.

47:43.120 --> 47:44.160
That was from Johnny.

47:44.960 --> 47:46.640
So, Johnny, who?

47:46.640 --> 47:47.520
Vila.

47:47.520 --> 47:48.080
Yeah.

47:48.080 --> 47:48.880
No.

47:48.880 --> 47:49.280
Yeah.

47:50.240 --> 47:50.720
His face.

47:50.720 --> 47:51.600
Where did that he?

47:51.600 --> 47:54.000
He doesn't want to kill Vlad the impaler.

47:54.000 --> 47:54.480
No.

47:54.480 --> 47:54.720
Yeah.

47:54.720 --> 47:56.240
I mean, what did he say?

47:58.240 --> 47:59.840
Up come back beside it.

47:59.840 --> 48:00.720
What is that?

48:00.720 --> 48:01.840
I don't know.

48:01.840 --> 48:02.880
It says, what pass?

48:05.600 --> 48:07.680
It was trending on my soundboard.

48:07.680 --> 48:09.680
Also, people found my soundboard.

48:09.680 --> 48:11.120
I guess you can use it.

48:11.120 --> 48:14.320
So, I don't know how they found it, but I saw it on the discord.

48:14.320 --> 48:15.520
Billy, what about your dinner guests?

48:15.920 --> 48:24.080
Um, my dinner guests would be Don, Don Jr. and Eric, I think, and make.

48:24.080 --> 48:25.080
Whoa.

48:25.080 --> 48:26.080
Yeah.

48:26.080 --> 48:29.120
And I think we just have a real frank conversation about how we got to be who we've

48:29.120 --> 48:30.120
become.

48:30.120 --> 48:32.640
And I'd be curious to see where that goes.

48:32.640 --> 48:33.640
Why?

48:33.640 --> 48:34.640
Hmm.

48:34.640 --> 48:38.880
I mean, I could pick Jay-Z and other billionaires and learn from them or I could step into the fire

48:38.880 --> 48:41.960
and see if I can make some actual change in this world.

48:41.960 --> 48:45.480
It'd be interesting if you flipped the table over at the dinner.

48:45.640 --> 48:48.680
You just have them to dinner so you could take them all out.

48:48.680 --> 48:50.120
There's something to be said for that.

48:50.120 --> 48:52.680
I mean, there's something to be said for it.

48:52.680 --> 48:53.520
Yeah, so that's what I'm going.

48:53.520 --> 48:56.520
I'm going Don, Don Jr. and Eric, next question.

48:56.520 --> 48:57.520
Okay.

48:57.520 --> 48:58.520
Well, I'm here.

48:58.520 --> 48:59.520
What's yours?

48:59.520 --> 49:00.520
Come on.

49:00.520 --> 49:01.520
Come on.

49:01.520 --> 49:02.520
It's LeBron.

49:02.520 --> 49:03.520
Yeah.

49:03.520 --> 49:05.240
LeBron AD and Russ Westbrook.

49:05.240 --> 49:06.240
I want to get the quote.

49:06.240 --> 49:07.520
There are three men.

49:07.520 --> 49:08.520
Yeah.

49:08.520 --> 49:10.160
You guys don't have so much wine.

49:10.160 --> 49:14.200
I'll be our budget trying to tell your dinner guests that your friends with me at the table

49:14.200 --> 49:17.240
next to you with Don, Don Jr. and Eric.

49:17.240 --> 49:18.240
No, these are good guys.

49:18.240 --> 49:19.240
So, Eric is good guys.

49:19.240 --> 49:24.640
Yeah, this is just like this weird hypothetical that came true for you.

49:24.640 --> 49:26.360
We did know Jeff had that power.

49:26.360 --> 49:27.360
Yeah.

49:27.360 --> 49:28.360
Wow.

49:28.360 --> 49:29.360
All right.

49:29.360 --> 49:35.160
Well, that was, that was good tweet that tweet.

49:44.200 --> 50:10.320
All right, plugs, Billy, what do you have going on?

50:10.320 --> 50:11.520
What do you want to point the people towards?

50:11.520 --> 50:12.840
What an earnest ending to the show.

50:12.840 --> 50:13.840
I might cut all out.

50:13.840 --> 50:15.880
What do I want to plug?

50:15.880 --> 50:16.880
No joke, buckets.

50:16.880 --> 50:20.880
Anything on headgum at Billy's cafeteria across socials.

50:20.880 --> 50:21.880
And that's it.

50:21.880 --> 50:23.880
That's all you have to say.

50:23.880 --> 50:24.880
Yeah.

50:24.880 --> 50:25.880
Yeah.

50:25.880 --> 50:26.880
Same.

50:26.880 --> 50:31.880
No joke, buckets, and fallabilly on social media.

50:31.880 --> 50:32.880
Jake?

50:32.880 --> 50:34.880
No joke, buckets.

50:34.880 --> 50:36.880
It's fallabilly on social media.

50:36.880 --> 50:40.160
Venmo and then no Billy.

50:40.160 --> 50:41.160
Yeah.

50:41.160 --> 50:47.640
I'm going to say no joke, buckets, everything on headgum, and then Matt, Billy's cafeteria

50:47.640 --> 50:49.080
on all socials.

50:49.080 --> 50:58.360
But spell Billy's cafeteria, G-E-O-F-F-B-O-Y-R-D-E-E on Twitter, and then it's G-E-O-F-F-R-E-Y-J-M-E-S-L-N-S-D-R-M,

50:58.360 --> 51:00.080
and that's pronounced Billy's cafeteria.

51:00.080 --> 51:04.440
Thank you guys so much for listening to this episode of the headgum podcast.

51:04.440 --> 51:05.600
Billy's going to kill you.

51:05.600 --> 51:06.600
Look at that bucket.

51:06.600 --> 51:08.280
That's Billy's going to kill you, face.

51:08.280 --> 51:09.600
I know where Billy lives.

51:09.600 --> 51:10.960
He doesn't know where I live.

51:10.960 --> 51:13.960
So come to my house and let's see what happens.

51:13.960 --> 51:14.960
Yeah.

51:14.960 --> 51:16.960
And it right there.

51:16.960 --> 51:17.960
Yeah.

51:17.960 --> 51:18.960
Yeah.

51:35.960 --> 51:37.960
That was a headgum original.

51:40.960 --> 51:41.960
Thank you.

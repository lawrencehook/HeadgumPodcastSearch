WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Yeah

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
What was that nothing?

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Friday, September 16th, right?

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Today's the 6th, but people are listening to it on the 23rd.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
So they're all right.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
It's so fun.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Yeah.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
And I'm full of autumn cheer.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Nice.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Um,

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Make your healer.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
If you're trying to get into that fall feeling,

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
which is sort of like that Friday feeling,

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
but for all of autumn,

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
you have to like do it first.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
You're not going to just feel the cheer.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
You have to start wearing orange.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
You have to start wearing earth tones.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
You have to start going into leaves.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
You have to start picking apples from trees.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
That's what's going to make you feel a tunnel.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
It's not the other way around.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
And if you feel like it is,

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
then I genuinely feel sorry for you.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Uh, yeah, I think it's the other way around.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Really?

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
You start to have to wait for the weather to get a little crisp.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
So you can't just wear a sweater.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
If it's still 94 degrees up.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
And as for the leaves,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
if they haven't started turning here in LA,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
then you can't just force that either.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Jeff is going out.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
And dare I say kind of painting the roses red,

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
style to the evergreen forest.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Stop it.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Stop the audio.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
That one lasts too long.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Well, yeah, everybody talks about painting the town red, right?

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
But what about painting the trees red?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Thank you.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Put the roses on the wall.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
That's what I just read.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
But I made an Alice in Wonderland reference.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
You did, yeah.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Alice in Wonderland's pretty awesome to me.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Scared me as a child.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Because you were worried about falling in a hole?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Uh, maybe.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
No, I think it was just like the red queen,

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
not super down with the like scary forest vibes.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
I'm also a nice huge fan of the car too.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
Or like the Cheshire cat like the eyes.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Yeah.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
But just so we're all in the same page.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
We're talking about, you know, walking cards.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
I don't understand it.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Oh.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
When I was in France,

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
the Paris Disneyland has an Alice in Wonderland maze.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Okay.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
And then it wasn't scary,

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
but they did have like one point where the cards were like pretending to try and chop you.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
They also had a raffle, right?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Meaning?

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
I thought Disneyland Paris is known for their sort of sweepstakes, yeah.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Well, let's play that train noise.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Chew cheer.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Full steam ahead.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
That's the motto of rail.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Do you guys have any fun weekend plans?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Sort of a Spanish custard?

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Uh, I was invited and then uninvited from a pool party.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
How are you uninvited from a pool party?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
And who's party was it?

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
It's one of Avital's friends, and she's like, you should come and I'm like, cool.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
And then she's like, it's actually a girls-only thing.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Which is also kind of nice.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
It's fun too, because then I can just sort of have it a mere day.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I had lunch every day.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
What is an a mere day?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
So I'll just like, yeah.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Stay at home and watch.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
College, the Paula, whatever.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Or whatever.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Do you like college football?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Not really.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
But like, at the same time, I don't like anything else.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
You like that?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
So, yeah, it's not on yet.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
It's all turned on like Clemson, Georgia Tech, or some shit.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Some really early game.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
That doesn't really have a lot of stakes and all.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
But like $12 on it just feels something.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Yeah.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
And if it doesn't hit all of a sudden, I feel like shit.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Yeah.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
A game that I barely cared about is now bumming me out.

05:14.000 --> 05:22.000
So you are basically, in a mere day, it's just gambling on sports that you don't like.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Hmm.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Close.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
It's gambling on sports that I do like.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
And are you happy?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
No.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
And I'm either pissed that it lost or fine that it hit.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
So you don't even get happy if you win with that.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
I just avoid the noise.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
And in terms of like, I feel like most people, and this is a hot day, I think most

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
people watch college football to have something to talk about.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
To other people.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Yeah.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Is there anyone that with friends in my life that you're pissed?

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
I mean, I was sort of talking to your ear off about SC last week.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
But I guess you were not talking to my ear off.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
You sent me a screenshot and Marieka, by the way, of just the fact that USC played

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Rice.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
That's not talking my ear off.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
That's a screenshot.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
And the one.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Because Rice is bad.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Exactly.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
And now we're talking about it.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
You know.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
You know, like drum kits will be miced individually by drum.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Yeah.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I'd like to mic you.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Meaning?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Like, yeah.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Like mic, like mic, mic, mic, mic.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
You're like your nose player.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Yeah.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Like let's hear every blink.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
Let's feel every sneeze in Dolby Atmos.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Seven, actually nine.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Boy, one.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Surround them.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Well, that's scary.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
It's a lot of pressure.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
That's true.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Let's talk about the pit wall.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Jake was maybe supposed to be on this episode.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
In hindsight, not really, but I invited him twice.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I mean, you didn't respond the second time.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
He's like, he's like, oh, for 11 on your most recent invites to this show, we should

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
say.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
I feel like he's done what six months.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
There's no way he's at this.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
It's a sketch.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Yeah.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Let's be honest.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Yeah.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
Which I can't say the speed.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Yeah.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
You didn't make that sort of talk about it.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Right.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Yeah.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Right.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Right.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
You know, like, don't be casual.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Because you honestly, you are a casual.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Sorry.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
You wanted to talk about the pit wall.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Yeah.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
So this is an F1 podcast for casual fans.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
If you haven't heard the bish, you might as well go, uh, listen to us dish about

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
mixed humaker sort of being.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
What's the opposite of a prodigal son?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
He sort of just a son, I guess.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Yeah.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Yeah.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Yeah.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Yeah.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
I barely was trying to think of a word, but I can't.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Prodigy.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Not a cool.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
I'm prodigiously not a cool.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Um, no.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
Is that a line from a rap that you already knew or did you just make it up now?

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
I'm prodigiously not a cool.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I'm prodigiously not a cool.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
I'm radical.

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
And I know my thought, thought bubbles are exploding, like, um, oceans eroding.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
That's a M&M line.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
And then it goes like, uh, I got a U haul for, for my balls.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
And because I got, not because I'm tired.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Because what you're saying is boring.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I was really into it actually.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Me too.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
No, I love it.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Good.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Yeah.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Yeah.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Listen to the pit wall.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
We should do a buckets pit wall crossover.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
A collab.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
A collab of sorts.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Yeah.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
What's look like.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
I think it's like what the driver equivalent is for basketball.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Hmm.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I probably.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Yeah.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
The driver equivalent of Daniel Ricardo's.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Honestly, probably Russell Westbrook by performing out performance.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Uh-huh.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
If you're going off personality, it's, he's Richard Jefferson.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
He's Ricky Rubio with a list.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
And a trist.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I mean, it's nothing to me.

09:29.000 --> 09:36.000
If it's, well, Charlotte Claire is probably like, um, Rudy go bare.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Just in terms of.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
No, he's probably because he's really good.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
And you really like him.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
But he always kind of comes up short.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
So maybe Jimmy Butler.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Yeah.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Maybe Jimmy Butler.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
He's a little less intense.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Carlos signs is like,

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
lovable and also good, but not a champion.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Uh, interesting.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Maybe like, uh,

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
lovable and good, but not a champion.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Yeah.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Charles Barkley.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Yeah.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
No.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Charles Barkley's louder.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
This guy's handsome and still.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Sorry.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
You guys doing a weekly podcast.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
If there's, well, he's a champion.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
What if you do a, what if there's a race that weekend?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Are you still doing a podcast?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
No.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
But we're sort of getting together and hashing it.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
And when you guys talk about the group chat on the show,

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
is that a Slack channel?

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Or is that literally a eye message thing?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
It's an eye message thing.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
The show's named after the eye message that was me,

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
Jake and Pile that we then added Jeff and Casey to.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Oh, that's cool.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
So you're like, we should make this a podcast.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Hmm.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Yeah.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
And it's interesting that Casey has not only the latest to the game,

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
but also completely, like,

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
swerved into the idea of racing in terms of him actually being.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Yeah.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
What is it called the rally car race or what are those?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Go cart.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Go cart.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Yeah.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
So he's like, he just learned about it in Arizona, right?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Yeah.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
We like got him into a fun during the off site.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
But we also, I feel like we went.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Go carting in Arizona.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
And did he win?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Multiple.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
No.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Dane one.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
But I feel like multiple people after that were like,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
that was the best moment of my year.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Just like, go carting.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
And I'm inclined to almost agree.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
It's like there.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I went go carting for Billy's Bachelor party.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
And I was so sick by the third go around that I was driving.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
And I felt so nauseous.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
I had to get out of the car.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
He DMed me and was like, did a mirror go?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
I was like, no.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
I got motion sick.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Did you not feel that at all?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
No.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Not really.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Interesting.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
It really is a thrill.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I think I might do it on my birthday this year.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Shit.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
I don't know.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I wish there was one slightly closer to here.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
But Casey is like posting his times and he's like beating stranger.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Like I see just like a of phenom at it.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
And how was he so much faster than the other go carting?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Just been going.

12:17.000 --> 12:26.000
Well, yeah, I think so he after the off site he got into the F1 game.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
That's true.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
Like the video game and bot like pedals and stuff in a well to play it.

12:33.000 --> 12:41.000
So I wonder if that like helped kind of train him into thinking about the breaking that you need for go carting.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
I see.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
I see.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
So there is some strategy in the world.

12:45.000 --> 12:52.000
But also, I mean, I guess I can't I'm like the last person that should be making claims about California.

12:52.000 --> 12:58.000
But like who's a professional carder in a burbank go carting place, right?

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
Yeah, maybe not professional, but the fact that you go it's like the people at a bowling alley.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Like someone's going to be a lot better than me just because they're constantly going.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
But he was like his first like first or second time and he was dominating it seems.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Yeah, maybe it was all kids.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
Maybe it was like a kids birthday party and Casey.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Well, no.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
He's screaming tweens and dreaming queens.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Well, it's going on there, Jeff.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Oh, sorry.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I'm just making an espresso.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Yeah, because you were yawning a lot during that segment.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Not really.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Yeah.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
We're just we're just waxing.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
There's some segments coming up.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
But you know, I figured I didn't work out a couple of these.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
I have a I have something related to that after drinking coffee cold brew.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Like the last decade or so off and on.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
I finally made my own.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
I've only bought either from a cafe or like a jug of cold brew from the store.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
I've never made my own cold brew.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
I used to do that and then I lost my jar.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Yeah.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
So I bought it.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
I bought a finger in Amazon.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I bought a thing on Amazon.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I'm fired right now.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
And then we have a podcast sponsor that sends ground beans.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
So I'm like, okay, I'll get those beans for free.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
I'll buy the thing that like makes cold brew.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
And it's relatively simply just put the beans in the water and wait 24 hours.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
But I haven't had it yet.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
It's in my refrigerator.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
My one concern is that that sponsor doesn't send ground beans.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
That sponsor sends ground beef.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
So are you just soaking lamb overnight or?

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
Yeah, I'm having cold stew and it's been good so far.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
It takes 24 hours.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
It's taste and good.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
No, it's been good to me.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
This is not this is the last of the jarred one that I bought before.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
The cold brew that I'm making.

14:46.000 --> 14:53.000
But I had no idea like the cost of like I didn't know anything about like the ratio of beans to water.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
How much money the beans cost versus the amount of cold brew I can make.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
I'm not saving that much money while it looks pretty good.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Oh, really?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Yeah, it's nice.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Is that a preble?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
It is a preble.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Yes.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
We have one of those here.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
I just made an espresso.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Did you really good?

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
The New York office has a brevble.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Yeah.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
That's that New York shit.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
LA just has cold brew on tap.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
I'm like, let's get classy if this is going to get a brevble.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Yeah.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
I do hot to have like an as a hot espresso in LA's.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Yeah.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
That's true, but you can do iced.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Why are you posing for that?

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
He's finding his angles.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
And my angles.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Wait, Marika, you're coming out to LA.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Yeah.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Yeah, we have a live show.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Wednesday.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
September 22nd.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Alright, so the day before this comes out.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Yeah.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Marika.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
By the time you listen to this, Marika will have come to LA and maybe even left.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Yeah.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
It's true.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
You leave on.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
When do you come and leave?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Come on Wednesday.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Leaving Saturday.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Oh, that's good.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Yeah.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
You get it.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Oh, really in his ex-room?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Yeah.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Um.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
Friday might try to see the Oklahoma tour with on, yeah.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Interesting.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
There was an Oklahoma tour.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Wait, is that the one that you told me to see in New York that I saw?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Yeah.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Did you see that?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Yeah.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
It was like in a round and there's only four rows.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Yeah.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
So it's that but in LA.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I remember having an issue with that plan.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I can't remember what it was.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
It was like weird multimedia things going on, right?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Yeah.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Lots of like sudden darkness.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Yeah.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Yeah.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
The the camera, the life camera during Portrait instead.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
I love it.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
It's great.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
A 10 minute ballet that has.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Yeah.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
That boy boots dropping from the ceiling.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Yeah.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I'm like, what did they do in the series?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Not that.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
The dream ballet in Oklahoma was like a really like classic thing.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
And a lot of people were upset that this didn't like replicate.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Replicate the original choreography as much as it could have.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
But change is good, guys.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Yeah.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Yeah.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
And it's such an old.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
It's like a literally 100 year old play almost at this point.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
It's pretty old.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Yeah.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
So the story is feels antiquated.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
But it's cool that they updated it.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Where are they doing it in LA?

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
Uh, maybe it's an omniscent.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
I don't know.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Wow.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
That's a big theater.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Yeah.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
Uh, and I really wanted to see the tour.

17:42.000 --> 17:50.000
So I'm happy that I managed to coincide with a date in LA.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Me too.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
I'm happy for you.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
We do have to date.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Of course.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
You just.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
He talked for four minutes and made an espresso during the break.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Yeah.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
And we're back.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Guys, I wanted to talk about office gossip.

18:11.000 --> 18:17.000
Uh, who's fucking who?

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
I have no gossip.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Really?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah, really.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
Because I wondered if anything was happening with like English.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
She's married.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Oh, I didn't mean that.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
I meant like what's up.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
Like as she's starting fights is she being like a little passive aggressive to like,

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
I don't know.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Johnny.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
No.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
You have Joel's a bit of a brick.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
It seems like the New York office really gets along.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Hangs out outside the office.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Me too.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Yeah.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Not you too.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Not you too.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Not with anybody from head to go.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Joel.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Joel's great.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Joel and I.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
Every week we've had a calendar invite to watch high school musical.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
The musical the series.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
With each other in the office.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
But we've only done it once and now the season's over.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
So.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Because the show is better because you.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
Guys, your schedules just don't line up.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Uh, because I usually watch it.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
The day it comes out, which is Wednesday.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
And by the time Thursday rolls around.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
I'm like, Joel, you got to catch up.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Um, and the show is in my opinion.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Really actually good.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
I applied to work on season three and it didn't work out.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
I'm sorry.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
What about season four?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Or whatever the next one's going to be.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Yeah.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Work on writing acting.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Whatever.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
I'll be okay.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Yeah.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Yeah.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
In the room where it happens.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
To be a writer's assistant.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
That's.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Um.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Last thing.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Actually.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I want to get to all of this.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Head금 live 2022.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Is it happening or not?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
No.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Yeah.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Spring.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Hopefully.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Something early 2023.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Yeah.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
I think we ran out of time to plan a big show in the fall.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
So we're going to do it when it warms up again.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Yeah.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
Why don't we stop doing the anniversary parties?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Uh, I can COVID slowed that down.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
First one was like never even planned.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
And then the second one was planned.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
And then we had to cancel.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
I remember that.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
This one sort of came and went and.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Yeah.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
We hadn't done it for three years.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
We just had our off site.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
All right.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Next year will be.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Eight.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
We should do something for that.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
But also like we wouldn't have to.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
We don't have to fly everyone out.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
We could do like satellite parties just to make it cheaper.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Let's still do it.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Which will be fun.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Yeah.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Um.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Anyway.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Um.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
What office gossip?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Okay.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
Okay.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Your timing sucks.

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
Can you guys see the photo that I framed as a studio?

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Yeah.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Yeah.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Me, Jake.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
World's best dad.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
That's all.

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
Welcome to Green Flag Workplace, right?

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
Buzzfeed released an article.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
That was just an it was a listicle.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
Really have people sharing the green flags from job interviews that tell you it's a good place to work.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Okay.

22:14.000 --> 22:20.000
I wanted to list all of these and see if head gum passes the same tests.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Right?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
All right.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
So who's the arbiter because like I could say green.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Green because.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
Oh my god.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Of course.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
This also doesn't fully work because Marie gave you work here since what?

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
2016, 2017.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Yeah.

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
One, when they ask you questions about yourself, what are your interests?

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Pobies.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
What do you proud of personally to show that?

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
What kind of person you are rather than how much of a work course you'll be?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Do you feel that it had gum?

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Do people care about you personally?

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
For the interview only or just like company culture.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
I think the interview.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
What is the point of this?

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Just to see.

23:08.000 --> 23:16.000
This is like the most realistic segment you've ever come up with.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
And it's still bad to do.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Yeah.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
We ask people a both a mirror and I've been in a ton of interviews.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
So we ask people what their interests are.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
Well, because that shows that you're interested in learning about them.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
You know, and like as a person who actually has a work life balance.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Green flag then.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Green flag.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Yeah.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
If asking people what they do for self-care?

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
Yeah.

23:52.000 --> 24:02.000
Asking, like, on job interviews, do you guys ask people what they do for self-care?

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Like how do they, you know, create that work life balance?

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
I have, yes.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
I'm here.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
I don't know if I have.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
I'll ask about hobbies, but not specifically self-care flush.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
Work life balance, yeah.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Talking more about just business.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
Or sorry, talking more than just about business.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
So different.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
So the exact opposite.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
So like basically it turns into a conversation, right?

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
And so that is going to feel good in the room or on the Zoom.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
Do you guys make it more of a conversation?

24:46.000 --> 24:57.000
The thing about this is that you've never been in one of the interview processes.

24:57.000 --> 25:02.000
So like, you don't know what we actually do.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
That's just over the entire interview.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
Oh yeah, you did.

25:08.000 --> 25:16.000
Um, yeah, we have like a whole thing.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
Sister.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
We definitely have a whole system.

25:22.000 --> 25:31.000
And we try to get people to talk to as many people at the company as possible.

25:31.000 --> 25:37.480
and all get a sense of vibe and interests and all that kind of stuff.

25:37.480 --> 25:43.800
Yeah, one of the rounds of interviews is more of a culture fit versus how it's like a depth

25:43.800 --> 25:51.320
at the job you'll be. When the person being interviewed asks about the business,

25:52.920 --> 25:55.400
you answer with genuine passion about the company.

25:55.880 --> 26:02.200
I answer. Are you, do you? Nobody asked me.

26:07.800 --> 26:14.200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Again, worked here since 2016.

26:14.200 --> 26:20.440
They also feel very vague and bland. I also don't know what we're answering.

26:20.440 --> 26:28.200
Yeah, like which point of view do you want? This feels like a clickbait link at the bottom

26:28.200 --> 26:34.840
was an ESPN article or something. When you talk about the job, you think about it positively.

26:36.040 --> 26:43.480
Not really, but like, do you express excitement to someone?

26:43.480 --> 26:49.400
If you think about that, let's read your paintings. Similar. All these are very similar.

26:50.840 --> 26:55.320
Asked and answered. When you are interviewing someone and you're like,

26:55.320 --> 26:59.880
oh, do you know premiere and then before they can even answer, you're like, it's okay if you don't,

26:59.880 --> 27:07.320
like we can teach you, but like it'd be great if you did. Right? Again, what's the question?

27:08.040 --> 27:16.120
When you guys are in interviews, do you offer some room to teach people shit?

27:17.800 --> 27:22.520
Is that just exactly what I want it? Okay. Yes, of course.

27:24.440 --> 27:30.440
But there will be some things that we expect them to need. Yeah. Like if we're hiring a video editor,

27:30.440 --> 27:36.440
we expect them to know. We can't be allowed to teach you at it. Yeah. Wow.

27:37.880 --> 27:41.000
Not really. That's the most bland thing we've ever said.

27:47.160 --> 27:51.640
When you're interviewing someone, do you ask them if they listen to head-gum podcasts?

27:53.000 --> 27:58.680
Yes, we ask them if they listen to podcasts and what their favorite podcast is. And I usually

27:58.760 --> 28:07.160
specify that they don't have to say or list a head-gum podcast. But if they do, listen,

28:07.160 --> 28:12.040
do you ever go like, well, what do you think we could be doing better? At,

28:16.760 --> 28:20.520
no, not in that situation.

28:21.160 --> 28:33.720
That's good. One more, right? God. Would you say that head-gum is good at retention?

28:35.960 --> 28:42.840
Yeah. I mean, we have over 30 employees. And yeah, but like 20 of us started this year.

28:43.880 --> 28:47.640
Yeah, even before that, I can't think of too many employees that left.

28:48.120 --> 28:50.120
Handful.

28:54.760 --> 28:56.440
Yeah, I feel like it's hard to.

29:05.560 --> 29:10.440
Welcome to Menage or Six. Nikki edition.

29:10.440 --> 29:18.360
So, I'm going to read quotes and you have to attribute it to which Nikki, six or Manage.

29:19.800 --> 29:24.440
Okay. Who is Nikki, six? He was in Motley, crew. Okay.

29:27.080 --> 29:30.200
Maria is melting. This is what you've done to her. Yeah.

29:35.080 --> 29:39.080
He tossed that salad like his name, Roman. Nikki, Manage.

29:40.600 --> 29:46.040
By main camera is a Nikon D3.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.480
Okay. No one's in Nikki, Manage.

29:56.440 --> 29:59.000
I'm here with correct. Maria goes wrong. That was Nikki, six.

30:00.200 --> 30:01.720
I'm inspired by children.

30:04.120 --> 30:07.960
It's got to be Nikki, six. I'm not like Manage's inspired by kids.

30:10.520 --> 30:19.720
I agree. I've got my fingers in many pies. And I'm excited about creating stuff and watching

30:19.720 --> 30:22.360
it blossom and bloom and harvest and get on with the next thing.

30:25.240 --> 30:32.920
That again, it just like be like. I'll go six.

30:34.920 --> 30:40.120
Correct. There's nothing more beautiful than a smile

30:40.120 --> 30:44.760
that has struggled through tears. Six.

30:47.960 --> 30:56.760
That was Manage. Well, respect your haters. They're the only ones who think you're better than them.

30:57.080 --> 31:04.040
Nikki, Manage. Nikki, Manage.

31:07.720 --> 31:13.720
Yeah. I feel like the glue to everything.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.520
Manage. Six.

31:19.400 --> 31:22.760
That was six.

31:25.160 --> 31:28.440
Nothing is worse than going home having not playing a gig.

31:29.640 --> 31:30.840
Having not had.

31:33.560 --> 31:36.600
Six. Manage.

31:39.640 --> 31:43.560
It was Manage. She said gig? Yeah.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.720
What? She's really into the gig economy.

31:46.200 --> 31:50.760
Hmm. Some girl asked me for an autograph and I asked her why.

31:50.760 --> 31:57.480
She said she admires me. I said she should see a shrink. Then she started crying and I started laughing.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.960
Manage. I really hope and I...

32:03.720 --> 32:04.440
Six.

32:09.240 --> 32:13.240
That was the most intake ten minutes. That took three and a half.

32:16.680 --> 32:23.960
Can you guys tell what this is? What? What is it?

32:25.960 --> 32:26.760
Oh, no.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.120
Oh. Does it feel like it's in a chord?

32:31.400 --> 32:32.760
A hanger is correct.

32:36.440 --> 32:40.360
Let's lay hanger or chord.

32:40.680 --> 32:45.720
That would have been good. If Jeff had earned it.

32:47.960 --> 32:51.000
That game was better than the two Jeff came up with.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.400
Yeah. Also, because I won and that felt good.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.880
How random would it be if I got this is a tattoo?

33:03.400 --> 33:06.280
See, that's also funnier than anything Jeff has said all that.

33:07.240 --> 33:10.840
It's so weird. I'm like, yeah, it's like, yeah.

33:11.560 --> 33:17.560
Or like, what if you got what if you showed up to work with prosthetic makeup that like, it looks like

33:18.200 --> 33:23.240
hanger was stuck through your face. That's when you're like behind my head kind of like this.

33:23.240 --> 33:26.360
You're more like King Tut style. Yeah.

33:26.360 --> 33:32.600
But it's a hanger. Yeah. Even me like just fucking farting out half-baked.

33:32.920 --> 33:40.760
This is funnier than what Jeff has done. He's kind of a cancer to the show.

33:42.360 --> 33:47.320
Interesting. And out of the end of the day you're just pushing a hanger all around your face.

33:47.320 --> 33:49.480
Yeah, exactly. All right.

33:50.680 --> 33:53.320
This would be the worst one to get tattooized.

33:53.320 --> 34:00.600
Yeah, it's kind of like a bad mustache. Yeah, plus yeah, would go with the right

34:00.600 --> 34:06.680
forehead to up into my, where my hair line is. This would be so random to get.

34:09.560 --> 34:15.640
That's fun. Sorry. Let's play. What was it Jeff? Green flag or not? Where we look at

34:15.640 --> 34:25.880
different colors and decide that's there. Black and the better trim green. That's good. That's

34:25.880 --> 34:32.360
really funny, actually. Even that. That's to come off. Yeah. That got him steamed it.

34:33.640 --> 34:40.360
He's a steamed boy slash bow. How's that espresso with one ice cube in it?

34:42.040 --> 34:50.440
Not colder. I just the lukewarm trip. I can't get to me anymore.

34:50.520 --> 34:59.880
Why? Why? Because I don't respect me. You don't respect you. You don't respect us.

35:00.600 --> 35:07.080
Him. Me. So I feel like we did get to you. Nothing you say.

35:08.760 --> 35:17.560
Can make me feel any type of way. Because I've already thought the best of me and I've thought

35:17.560 --> 35:37.720
the worst of the me. For ice cubes. As is it cold? Maybe. They melted immediately. That's

35:37.720 --> 35:46.520
like a warm Americano. And then how does that compare to the like coffee beans that I could get

35:46.600 --> 35:50.760
to make cold brew? Is it the same or is it more expensive? Because it's espresso beans. You want

35:50.760 --> 35:57.560
it? Any coffee beans? Any coffee beans? Any coffee bean can be made into an espresso. Yeah.

35:58.440 --> 36:02.760
So it's not a different bean. It's just the different way of preparing the coffee beans. Yeah.

36:02.760 --> 36:07.160
Yeah. So I could take these beans and make cold brew. You can take them and make an espresso.

36:07.160 --> 36:12.360
I used to make cold brew out of these beans. And now I used to make espresso. And how much does it

36:12.680 --> 36:19.800
how much does it cost per bag? 20 bucks. Yeah. 20 bucks for like eight espresso. Maybe more.

36:19.800 --> 36:24.680
Probably more. Well, also I'm near. Aren't you making like cold brew concentrate? When

36:24.680 --> 36:29.320
yeah, you're supposed to mix it with milk and water. Yeah. Yeah. You don't, you're not supposed to

36:29.320 --> 36:37.960
mix it with milk or water. Just water for sure. But the bag can make basically three like of the

36:37.960 --> 36:43.240
pictures and the pictures like a quart which could last, you know, three to four drinks.

36:44.120 --> 36:50.440
Yeah. It's definitely cheaper than buying. I mean, intelligence is coffee's five dollars

36:50.440 --> 36:54.840
50 cents and you have to add like you have to add a tip. Oh, that one is the most I was

36:54.840 --> 37:03.640
comparing it to like a jug of cold brew. I can buy it like Whole Foods. Yeah. I think it's like

37:03.800 --> 37:10.680
the price. Yeah. I started doing the the jug situation. Yeah. The jug at that. Whole Foods are like the

37:10.680 --> 37:16.680
jug at home. The jug at Whole Foods. The Whole Foods are any grocery store or any. Yeah. It seems

37:16.680 --> 37:21.480
like it's like half and half like making at home is like five dollars of quart and then it's like

37:21.480 --> 37:27.720
$10 a quart at Whole Foods and then like if you buy literally a cold brew every day that's like $40.

37:27.880 --> 37:35.800
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, America. I'm coming to New York in October. I think. Do you know when yet?

37:36.520 --> 37:47.160
Either the first or second weekend we should go to just one weekend. Yeah. Seems like a quick trip for

37:47.960 --> 37:55.160
cross country travel. No. Why not? I'll probably go ahead. I'll go on a Wednesday and then leave

37:55.160 --> 38:05.400
on Sunday. Yeah. I would leave Monday. Why? Just so you can like not be stressed out on Sunday. Yeah.

38:07.400 --> 38:10.280
Trying to cram it all in and get to JFK by what? Four.

38:15.080 --> 38:19.400
Then maybe I'll leave on Monday. Right? Well, at that point you might as well do Tuesday. How are

38:19.400 --> 38:28.040
you mad at us giving you travel advice? We're literally telling you to enjoy your trip more

38:28.040 --> 38:33.480
in your pistons. No, you know what you're right because I want to go to Sunday in Brooklyn.

38:33.480 --> 38:40.040
Have you ever been there? No, we're interested on Sunday. Yeah, Brooklyn. It's the best

38:40.040 --> 38:45.480
brunch I've ever had. Interesting. It's so what it's just eggs. I literally used to live on that

38:45.480 --> 38:49.800
street. You get scrambled eggs and potatoes and it's the best you've ever had. The best breakfast

38:49.800 --> 38:59.560
sandwich I've ever seen or had or her name. Where would you stay? With Johnny and eight my friend

38:59.560 --> 39:07.560
AJ. Oh, that's cool. Couch crashing or they got a bed situation. They got a spare bedroom. Nice. So

39:08.600 --> 39:15.080
I mean, that's just like $500 a night. I mean, those two tell us together. Pricy. Do they live together?

39:15.480 --> 39:21.560
Yeah, really? They do. Yeah. Since, well, I know that since like a month and a half ago.

39:22.120 --> 39:27.160
That's your two friends that met through you are now living together. Yeah, that's not the first time

39:27.160 --> 39:35.000
that's happened. Really? I'm a match maker. I'm a snatch taker. You've never

39:36.200 --> 39:43.400
taken a snatch. What's that? I said you've never made me friends.

39:43.400 --> 39:53.000
I've tried. What does that mean? We've gone out together. You met my friends. You could have

39:53.000 --> 39:59.160
been friends with them independently. I guess. Who would you match Marika up with roommate

39:59.240 --> 40:11.160
was of all of your friends? Honestly, AJ. He's already taken show. Yeah. Yeah, it's all hypothetical.

40:14.600 --> 40:19.000
Well, she's not even trying to move. Sorry. Now I'm getting actually upset. Yeah. What about

40:19.000 --> 40:25.640
George? I feel like we can get along because we both like cooking stuff, right? Yeah, maybe George.

40:25.640 --> 40:30.200
Who would you put with me? I would not compare you with, like, you know,

40:32.760 --> 40:37.960
not love to hear it. He clearly have someone in mind who would I live with. Probably someone, like,

40:37.960 --> 40:43.080
I'm trying to think of who my most violent unhinged friend is just like, because they can chance

40:43.080 --> 40:51.480
no, it's best be like the Yin and Yin because I want you to die. So like,

40:52.440 --> 41:00.600
highest chances of that happening, maybe, you know, my buddy Mason. He has a panther. He has an

41:00.600 --> 41:10.280
attention for anger. We're free-style rapping again. I'm Mr. New York. All right, plugs. What

41:10.280 --> 41:15.320
do you guys have going on September 23rd? This comes out or some ship? Yeah. Thank you for coming to

41:15.320 --> 41:21.400
the headgun live show. That was yesterday. It was a blast. It was insane. Great time. It was fun.

41:21.480 --> 41:27.720
There's a movie. Wait, Jeff, I'm hosting with you, right? Yeah. Do we know what that entails?

41:28.440 --> 41:33.160
I have, like, my own set that I want to do and then I thought you and I could just MC or something.

41:33.160 --> 41:36.760
What about Dale? He also hosting with Danny. Danny's probably going to want his own

41:36.760 --> 41:41.480
five to ten minutes, I think. But we should up on a call to talk. Yeah, with him. Like, just,

41:41.480 --> 41:49.480
are we doing together independently? I need to plan quite frankly. I can't just show up on the day

41:49.560 --> 41:59.080
with that agenda. I mean, I see a run of show. There is that. I'll just see that. I'll be soon.

42:03.080 --> 42:14.840
I mean, the run of show is like, just times like it's you, Danny, Jeff, start the show 730.

42:14.920 --> 42:24.680
You're just reading the agenda instead of going to the show. George's car got egged last night.

42:26.680 --> 42:32.120
This was two minutes ago. He texted me in my roommate. This won't super pertain to

42:32.120 --> 42:37.080
either of you because I'm the only one who parks on blank, a different street near us. But my car

42:37.080 --> 42:43.160
got vandalized last night. Nothing crazy, shaving cream and eggs, but flagging there are vandals

42:43.640 --> 42:53.400
of shaving cream. Vandalized. Oh my god. Was it a bunch of cars next to him or not really? The reason

42:53.400 --> 42:59.560
he parks on the street is because nobody parks on there. Why? Because it's kind of out of the way and

42:59.560 --> 43:07.240
residential. Yeah. But yeah, I don't understand. That's so funny and bad.

43:07.480 --> 43:16.520
All right. At Jeff, where do you on Twitter? I think we're 169 away 159 from 10,000,

43:16.520 --> 43:25.320
where I will bear my ass. We're all to see. And, uh, Mariaica? Mariaica Elon on Twitter, Instagram,

43:25.320 --> 43:33.480
and letter box. Let's get those. All of those social followers up. I want to see everyone turn up

43:33.560 --> 43:44.680
for me. And listen to the pit wall so that we can keep making more episodes because I really want

43:44.680 --> 43:58.280
to make everyone watch the television show that I found that is a romance novel turned into a TV show

43:58.280 --> 44:06.280
about an F-1 driver because I think that'll be bad. That's the offshoot to the pit wall.

44:06.280 --> 44:16.280
A spin-off one. Yeah. Listen or watch it wherever you get your podcasts. Please.

44:17.080 --> 44:24.120
Love it. And we'll see you guys again next week. That's Dallas folks. We got to do an in-person one.

44:24.120 --> 44:33.880
I feel like it's been next week. Yeah, it's been next week. Let's do it.

44:35.880 --> 44:41.720
I'm going to call Mason. Why? Now he's going to be with you for sure. No. Okay.

44:54.120 --> 45:03.880
That was a hit-dum original.

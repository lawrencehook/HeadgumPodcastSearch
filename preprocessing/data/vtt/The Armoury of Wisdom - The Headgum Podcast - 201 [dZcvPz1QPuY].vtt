WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:02.000 --> 00:30.640
It's like I have to do something else that I started putting together my new vacuum.

00:30.640 --> 00:40.640
What's that?

00:40.640 --> 00:43.640
Do you get any soundboard?

00:43.640 --> 00:45.640
Same soundboard.

00:45.640 --> 00:51.640
Dabbling in some fan favorites from your from yesterday year.

00:51.640 --> 00:57.640
And oh yeah.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.640
Auditioning some new ones.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.640
Yeah, that one didn't go show hot.

01:02.640 --> 01:03.640
I really didn't.

01:03.640 --> 01:08.640
I thought it was going to be a little bit more resounding than that.

01:08.640 --> 01:11.640
More ultimately resolute.

01:11.640 --> 01:12.640
Resonant.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.640
Resonant.

01:13.640 --> 01:14.640
Yeah.

01:14.640 --> 01:15.640
Resonant.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.640
Art was resonant.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.640
Well, I really could have had more reverb.

01:19.640 --> 01:20.640
I mean, Ferris your musician.

01:20.640 --> 01:21.640
You got it.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.640
The EQ could have been further thus.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.640
It resonated with me.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.640
Meaning good way.

01:28.640 --> 01:29.640
Like emotionally.

01:29.640 --> 01:30.640
Yeah.

01:30.640 --> 01:34.640
It hit your ears and you recognized it as sound.

01:34.640 --> 01:36.640
But not much more.

01:36.640 --> 01:37.640
Yeah.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.640
I was like, yeah, I agree.

01:39.640 --> 01:41.640
Right.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.640
It's a Monday, you know.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.640
It rang.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.640
Yeah.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.640
Yeah, it did ring.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.640
See now there's a new sound that's not even.

01:50.640 --> 01:51.640
Here we go.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.640
Oh, wow, this sucks.

01:54.640 --> 01:56.640
The favorites will play.

01:56.640 --> 01:57.640
The favorites will play.

01:57.640 --> 01:59.640
So we just start over.

01:59.640 --> 02:01.640
No, I think this is all good stuff.

02:01.640 --> 02:04.640
I mean, guys, we're coming off of a hit.

02:04.640 --> 02:08.640
The 200 episode was truly there there.

02:08.640 --> 02:12.640
And all four of us were there then.

02:12.640 --> 02:13.640
Yeah.

02:13.640 --> 02:14.640
It's crazy.

02:14.640 --> 02:16.640
To tell the tale.

02:16.640 --> 02:22.640
I mean, there's not much to do until we kind of recap that episode.

02:22.640 --> 02:25.640
Like, how does everybody feel in the wake of it?

02:25.640 --> 02:27.640
There's not much to do.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.640
There's actually we have some things to get to.

02:29.640 --> 02:34.640
But I feel like we have to at least acknowledge the greatness that was had.

02:34.640 --> 02:37.640
Yeah, reactions have been nice.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.640
We don't minimize it even by saying something positive.

02:40.640 --> 02:44.640
Well, because like, yeah, it's been good.

02:44.640 --> 02:51.640
On YouTube at least, people are still really like it's still pretty mixed.

02:51.640 --> 02:56.640
And this is like sincere thanks and also, like this podcast is terrible kind of thanks.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.640
So to me that's the same.

02:58.640 --> 03:01.640
I mean, how's the, how's the TikTok doing?

03:01.640 --> 03:03.640
I know we were going semi-viral to have.

03:03.640 --> 03:07.640
Yeah, we went pretty viral, really hoping that chapel,

03:07.640 --> 03:09.640
Ron will see it.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.640
A lot of people are not going to say it.

03:11.640 --> 03:12.640
A lot of tractor.

03:12.640 --> 03:15.640
I know, but on Friday, who is it during the Coachella?

03:15.640 --> 03:16.640
Yeah.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.640
On your alley, or somebody was like, I mean, you were also part of this conversation,

03:19.640 --> 03:25.760
Conversation but somebody what somebody initially was like and it's perfect because she's playing Coachella today

03:25.760 --> 03:27.280
I'm like that's not perfect

03:27.280 --> 03:29.960
She's not gonna be on her phone at all. Absolutely

03:30.960 --> 03:36.160
This is the one day she has to be absolutely locked in and by the way she was I saw clips of the performance

03:36.160 --> 03:38.160
Yeah, the performance

03:38.560 --> 03:40.840
Nice. Okay, all right. Yeah, I

03:41.560 --> 03:44.920
Appreciate it this comment from Gorned on TikTok

03:45.440 --> 03:49.600
They says the name Gorned G-O-R-N-T. Thank you

03:50.560 --> 03:55.840
They said someone please explain this bit to me. It's very much my brand of humor, but I need the origin

03:56.200 --> 03:57.400
Yeah

03:57.400 --> 04:06.000
User double D said he is parodying Chapel Rones popular song hot to go, but both versions are absolutely fantastic

04:06.440 --> 04:12.280
Gorned to response Gorned says thank you for explaining. I got that part so far

04:12.280 --> 04:18.200
But I really want to know the origin of this running joke. I agree with you though. This is amazing

04:19.000 --> 04:20.720
Omar response

04:20.720 --> 04:27.720
Gorned he makes a lot of parodies about burning grains. There's really no other explanation

04:28.720 --> 04:33.240
Yeah, but I left Friday being like maybe there's a chance

04:33.440 --> 04:37.240
Maybe if we are posting to TikTok more consistently

04:38.120 --> 04:41.160
Not to be confused with consistency of sand

04:42.120 --> 04:47.960
People might have a way in in the way in might oddly be the fucking rice songs

04:48.440 --> 04:50.440
Ferris I might

04:51.640 --> 04:53.640
Not to be a contrarian, but my

04:54.000 --> 04:58.240
Rebuttal to that is that there were also multiple comments of people being like

05:00.680 --> 05:03.640
I was fine. I don't I don't know

05:04.640 --> 05:07.440
There've been there've been multiple comments of

05:08.240 --> 05:13.960
From people being like I've never listened to this podcast, but I've listened to every single race on which to me

05:13.960 --> 05:15.960
It is crazy

05:15.960 --> 05:17.960
It's so insane

05:17.960 --> 05:19.960
I see a couple

05:29.480 --> 05:33.720
See I'm nervous because I don't know what that means. Yeah, I'm really

05:33.720 --> 05:35.720
Translation yeah

05:35.720 --> 05:37.720
Translation

05:39.840 --> 05:41.840
That one's universal

05:41.840 --> 05:49.120
Yeah, we should test new ones. No, it's it seems dangerous. Well, I'm also gonna up cup up this all in I

05:49.800 --> 05:51.800
Missed

06:02.600 --> 06:04.600
This isn't going well

06:04.680 --> 06:06.680
No

06:09.680 --> 06:13.680
Yeah, we're loves now and whoop salt drops episode

06:19.560 --> 06:21.560
That was pretty good

06:23.720 --> 06:25.720
That's gonna obviously

06:26.440 --> 06:28.440
Get our video taken down

06:30.280 --> 06:34.320
That one I might keep that one's good. Anyway. Sorry

06:35.560 --> 06:36.760
Um

06:36.760 --> 06:39.400
What you're doing is not good for this show

06:41.640 --> 06:46.280
Like you were you were just talking about wanting to you know build it more

06:47.280 --> 06:51.640
Yeah, the last like few seconds. I don't agree with

06:55.880 --> 06:57.880
No, I mean

07:04.600 --> 07:07.800
All right, I think I'm gonna just bleep it. Yeah

07:12.400 --> 07:16.600
That one was a Ferris original to have nice

07:18.520 --> 07:20.520
Dude a couple of people have said

07:21.680 --> 07:30.760
Something to the effect of like I don't even did you mention you want to make a fully produced album of the rice songs because people are people haven't forgotten

07:30.760 --> 07:40.440
You did mention it. See it's hard. Is that's a lot of work and it's gonna I don't know if it'll be paid or not because I don't think that falls under the purview of the scope of work that I offer to have gone as a 1099

07:40.440 --> 07:42.440
NEC

07:43.160 --> 07:45.160
Yeah, I don't think I don't think I

07:47.400 --> 07:50.360
I was excited for your time. You were the first to me studio

07:51.080 --> 07:53.080
You and even said an email will

07:54.760 --> 07:58.120
I would just know that that's a freelance personal front of you

07:58.680 --> 08:02.920
You could you could reap the rewards at that point. It's all

08:03.640 --> 08:11.000
I pee based on the company so I don't weigh well, you're staring me over because I'm not gonna yield to police ads on the album

08:11.560 --> 08:15.400
Not only hope is that this federal law might go into a fat on the album

08:16.280 --> 08:18.280
Like all right people don't do that

08:18.280 --> 08:25.460
Supplemental messaging like fun branded clear hey, yeah, why isn't it like a brought to you by yeah

08:25.940 --> 08:27.460
Race oroni

08:27.460 --> 08:29.220
Yeah, I mean fairies my cousin

08:29.220 --> 08:34.980
I'm around on your last EP you did like there's one song where like you know how Jim Morrison and writers on the storm like whispered

08:35.460 --> 08:40.580
and layered the whisper underneath the singing you did the same thing but it wasn't the lyrics of the song

08:40.740 --> 08:46.580
It was basically defending big tech well really it was just like a better help ad sort of at this sort of volume

08:47.860 --> 08:53.220
Just sort of coasting underneath the surface of the chorus of my song and I just you know

08:53.300 --> 08:59.140
Sort of gave them my own personal experience with online therapy and the privacy of my own home

08:59.140 --> 09:01.140
It was really something that

09:01.140 --> 09:06.020
I found helpful especially I mean we're living in crazy times and I mean during the pandemic

09:06.020 --> 09:11.140
I basically lost my mind. I was drinking vodka out of my desk while I was working

09:13.140 --> 09:17.620
It was very nice I talked a lot of out of like a you know blast it was on

09:17.620 --> 09:23.540
Yeah, I was imagine it was a bottle in my dump into a drawer that's what I'm talking about

09:23.940 --> 09:25.940
Oh, I'm sure

09:26.580 --> 09:31.780
That's fell out that promo code spell out the promo code and probably do it twice at the

09:32.180 --> 09:37.060
Just so that's a very good point. That's it's not quite better. I saw a poem. Yeah, that's better

09:37.060 --> 09:39.060
H-E-L-P dot

09:39.860 --> 09:44.180
Ford slash April that's the most confusing thing to spell in the yard

09:44.180 --> 09:46.180
Oh, yeah

09:46.980 --> 09:54.580
Dwarra got that yeah, sorry drawer vodka sounds like ferris is like celebrity liquor endorsement like

09:56.260 --> 10:00.020
Like what Dwayne Johnson has what's it? What's the tequila brand he has?

10:00.580 --> 10:03.540
Oh, Teramana yeah, Teramana and then you know

10:04.260 --> 10:06.260
What is it? Clooney has

10:06.740 --> 10:11.860
Casabegos not anymore and then ferris would be drawer vodka

10:14.180 --> 10:18.260
The bottle on she's like a fucking soft clothes. I think we could

10:18.820 --> 10:25.540
We could do that kind of like for walls always sunny podcasts. I was gonna say yeah

10:26.100 --> 10:32.420
Whisky way, but ours is just drawer vodka. Yeah beta testing beta vodka

10:33.300 --> 10:39.380
Can you make vodka out of rice or is that only a potato? Oh? It gets off in jam. Yeah

10:40.020 --> 10:42.020
Haha

10:42.580 --> 10:44.580
Damn, there's

10:44.580 --> 10:47.700
This is man. It's you. I got a good vodka name, too

10:49.940 --> 10:52.180
All right, let's keep it going

11:00.580 --> 11:04.660
Bond of the week this week. I'm gonna have to go with taz fustock

11:05.300 --> 11:06.580
Hmm

11:06.580 --> 11:11.540
He's sort of a British aristocrat who just closed a club

11:14.260 --> 11:20.820
Close to close there at the end of the night muscle and the leaves are the thing no he wasn't there till to a

11:21.540 --> 11:24.180
He shut down a bar that he owned

11:25.860 --> 11:34.260
Does that make sense and that's the fall of time because yeah for the Bond role because I don't think Bond has any business in

11:34.900 --> 11:42.820
The after hours market. I'm thinking he's ready to make the shift from Lalo a nodding hill joint

11:43.460 --> 11:47.460
to broccoli's own James

11:49.860 --> 11:57.220
I can't imagine a club in nodding hill that's kind of why I chose him also that's like opening up a club in like

11:57.220 --> 11:59.220
Topanga

12:00.180 --> 12:05.540
That doesn't resonate with me, but I'm sure it doesn't it's far there. Yeah, yeah

12:07.540 --> 12:16.580
Well, who do you got for your Bond over a week? I think I'm gonna go her with Jake style this while why Jake in this room

12:16.580 --> 12:22.740
I think Jake was recording like not another D&D podcast or something and he did all these like little drawings

12:23.300 --> 12:25.300
And there's so many of them

12:25.300 --> 12:30.500
Bob and there doesn't do it. Well, he could take a look at that

12:31.060 --> 12:34.900
Tell me if he likes you don't a poster if he did

12:34.900 --> 12:42.660
his dad don't James Bond would be like an old master oil artist. He wouldn't be on the some of them Cartoon quite crude

12:43.460 --> 12:45.940
That's what I'm saying

12:48.420 --> 12:52.900
I think I think Bond could could draw cartoons in a spare time and

12:53.540 --> 12:59.460
Couldn't you imagine Jake fit it up in the suit? No, yeah, block nine

13:01.220 --> 13:03.220
Bond doesn't have a clock

13:03.780 --> 13:06.180
Good, Jake's boss

13:06.180 --> 13:11.940
That yet right, so it's already not finished usuring the new everything is Jake with a clock

13:12.980 --> 13:14.980
Holding it sideways

13:15.700 --> 13:20.020
Wearing a wrecky shirt, Tuxedo, the whole movie takes place outside of New Haven

13:20.980 --> 13:22.980
Oh

13:23.380 --> 13:25.380
Ferris, who do you got for your bombs fee?

13:26.260 --> 13:35.220
I said it on the 200th. I really want to kind of drill down on it Jack Black. I really I want to see that I think I mean

13:36.660 --> 13:38.660
But okay, it would change everything

13:39.380 --> 13:43.220
right it would give Bond it and an entirely new facelift, but

13:44.100 --> 13:45.700
God wouldn't that be good

13:45.700 --> 13:47.700
Jack Black kind of a James Baroo

13:48.260 --> 13:50.260
That's rude

13:52.260 --> 13:54.260
That's rude

13:57.140 --> 13:59.940
Grunt what was the commenter's name Grunt?

13:59.940 --> 14:01.940
Grunt?

14:01.940 --> 14:04.420
Rico, who do you got for your bronbly?

14:05.700 --> 14:10.580
Um, I think I'm gonna have to go

14:11.780 --> 14:14.500
Uh, because of this week's SNL

14:15.060 --> 14:17.060
Ryan Gosling

14:18.100 --> 14:21.860
Preferably as bevis from bevis and butt head

14:23.220 --> 14:25.460
Um, I don't know if anyone watched that. Yeah, sketch

14:26.260 --> 14:31.940
But it delighted me to know end. It was straighter sketch. Are you serious? Yeah

14:32.900 --> 14:37.140
And makey day. Yeah, the big discourse around that was that

14:38.740 --> 14:42.660
You didn't want it spoiled but every thumbnail I saw

14:43.460 --> 14:45.700
Every idol I saw every tweet I saw

14:48.660 --> 14:50.340
Spoiled it spoiled it

14:51.300 --> 14:56.660
It was a real delay and I watched it live and it really it really tickled me

14:59.220 --> 15:04.820
It's fascinating to imagine the person who listens to the 200th episode a week late

15:05.460 --> 15:10.900
And they are so on cloud nine they are like ready for another energy full

15:11.460 --> 15:14.420
You know everyone's laugh and and then they tune in here

15:15.140 --> 15:18.980
Yeah, I think we're gonna get up soon. So distracted to be honest for a second

15:18.980 --> 15:21.860
I was ever a second with a reading I'm definitely back

15:21.860 --> 15:26.580
I'm looking at my outline and deciding whether to cut you guys off should we move on you're asking for more energy

15:27.220 --> 15:28.820
200th episode

15:28.820 --> 15:34.260
Let's continue talking about it because I wanted to ask you guys what was your favorite part of that of this

15:36.660 --> 15:38.660
Because I had a blast

15:38.740 --> 15:40.740
Three of you guys killed it

15:41.220 --> 15:42.740
It was

15:42.740 --> 15:47.380
For me it was your fucking face singing that song that was the highlight for me

15:48.260 --> 15:51.220
I mean, I've I've seen you get into it

15:51.940 --> 15:53.940
But not quite like that

15:54.340 --> 16:00.260
That was the full screaming and then dropping an octave because you were like I can't

16:04.260 --> 16:08.260
Everybody because I was staring at the lyrics I was trying to I mean very quick

16:08.660 --> 16:14.260
Trying to nail it all which I didn't even and so by the time I was wailing I was like I feel like I'm irritating people

16:14.260 --> 16:18.980
Let me drop the octave slash that ass and I think ultimately the song was a hit

16:19.780 --> 16:21.780
Mereiko was your favorite part

16:23.780 --> 16:25.780
Said all right then will

16:26.340 --> 16:29.460
Did I loved Jeopardy Jeopardy

16:30.340 --> 16:32.340
Yeah, that was

16:33.300 --> 16:37.380
This is why I wanted you on this episode specifically on you said who's gonna be on?

16:37.380 --> 16:42.580
I said it has to be Mereiko for 201 because I need you to prove right now and here

16:43.620 --> 16:46.340
That yeah, yeah, actually got the gift is it physical

16:47.060 --> 16:51.060
It's not as ultimately did it all but don't she been it by saying

16:51.620 --> 16:53.620
You're pointing out the wax

16:53.620 --> 16:55.620
Get it me it's a get it for free

16:56.580 --> 17:02.740
It'll let me if I I opened the Airbnb app

17:05.220 --> 17:10.740
$500 gift also it looks like you're locked into litigation on a previous day

17:12.260 --> 17:14.260
What did you do in Montreal

17:18.740 --> 17:21.620
Yeah, I would say Jeopardy Jeopardy was

17:22.260 --> 17:25.380
Number one and I was winning with the first place on the board

17:26.100 --> 17:31.380
It felt it was the most excited event on the show at any point in time because I felt

17:32.020 --> 17:38.420
I felt the heat and then immediately impressed me and then got like 700 points and I I feel like there's only like

17:38.580 --> 17:44.580
Three people who could have four people maybe who could have one which is a mere mereka ferris and onya

17:45.140 --> 17:46.500
Because they've been

17:46.580 --> 17:47.780
involved

17:47.780 --> 17:51.620
Farris since the beginning and onya very intensively recently

17:52.660 --> 17:57.380
Yeah, and then mereka and a mere on like every episode pretty much one of them yeah, I was

17:57.380 --> 18:02.580
I think disappointed with my performance. I think the only guess I ever made you're like

18:03.220 --> 18:10.020
What's where did I first start recording this podcast and the only time I chimed in was to say a basement

18:10.580 --> 18:12.580
And I never got another word in

18:13.540 --> 18:18.180
There's you had to do it. I wasn't even a straight of reading right before

18:18.500 --> 18:26.500
Which you handled with class and ease. I would say oil slick glands. I would say your

18:27.460 --> 18:29.460
Cords were velvety

18:31.060 --> 18:36.260
I was feeling some pressure to blast through it too because it was so hard getting bored and up

18:36.340 --> 18:42.180
Yeah, but you also insisted for it to be finished in its entirety so I was like

18:43.380 --> 18:47.220
Three hours writing the shit yeah, we tend to do that

18:48.420 --> 18:51.140
All right, what were everyone's gripes with the 200th?

18:52.500 --> 18:56.740
What do you wish had been different? What irritated you to know and

18:57.780 --> 18:59.620
Let's start with the

18:59.620 --> 19:06.180
Less guests less guests that was the whole point less a lot of thinking like three might be a good fit

19:06.340 --> 19:13.140
That's what we're doing now. I know but we can all talk and you know we're kind of catching up. We're talking about you know our lives

19:13.460 --> 19:15.060
People are hearing more of us

19:15.060 --> 19:17.060
Which we're going to work

19:17.620 --> 19:21.220
We have to talk about your weekend. I know I had a crazy weekend

19:21.620 --> 19:24.420
What did you do to do good? Notting Hill

19:25.860 --> 19:28.340
No, I went to a I went to a few Broadway shows

19:29.860 --> 19:32.340
Which Marieka is especially interested in?

19:32.420 --> 19:36.260
Did you see the Michael Imperial Lee enemy of the people? How was that?

19:37.300 --> 19:42.820
Was it in the light the wrong or the right? Let's do it round indeed round and see

19:43.380 --> 19:49.140
Did you get a shot? I was in I did get a shot. I was incredibly close to missing the show

19:49.540 --> 19:54.820
My ran from the train no late entry no late entry they shut it down

19:55.220 --> 19:58.500
Is that after I made it test the climate protests? They don't do it late entry

19:59.380 --> 20:01.380
Maybe that's how they got in

20:01.380 --> 20:03.380
Is they just sure that's late?

20:04.020 --> 20:11.540
No, I made it. I got a shot they give you liquor in the show. Okay, so it was like whiskey. I was worried it was like an HPVVX

20:11.540 --> 20:13.540
No, it was like

20:13.940 --> 20:15.940
It was a Swedish

20:15.940 --> 20:17.940
Vodkis fish

20:17.940 --> 20:23.620
It was much more vodka to be sure. It was great strong strong was

20:23.620 --> 20:30.900
Spittling yeah, he was spittling the whole show Imperial Lee didn't seem to have that problem Imperial

20:30.900 --> 20:34.900
Only kept it all in some people some people are spitters. He didn't spit for me

20:35.620 --> 20:44.340
But maybe some like got more into it. Yeah, did you do the after after at Imperial Lee's restaurant? No

20:44.980 --> 20:50.660
I did dress all in brown as a oh to just Jeremy's strong

20:50.740 --> 20:55.940
So I think it was more there for strong than Imperial Lee. Yeah, we got to be there in a strong in a way

20:56.740 --> 20:59.220
And he kills it he's so good

20:59.620 --> 21:02.980
God if you're in the York City and you have $250

21:02.980 --> 21:07.700
There's no better way to spend it than on a hotel and then not having not having enough

21:08.100 --> 21:09.860
Yeah, right can actually

21:09.860 --> 21:12.500
If you're in New York then you have to worry about that hotel

21:14.660 --> 21:17.540
I'm trying to see it before it closes. I might come out the end of May

21:17.940 --> 21:24.340
To have would love to see you Jeff. Yeah, you know we've never met in person Jeff. I know it feels wrong. You see

21:28.180 --> 21:33.780
Any more gripes or can we move on oh my gripe was just that I didn't know

21:35.460 --> 21:40.660
There would be people on on zoom like I didn't know fair not in the room

21:41.620 --> 21:45.620
Zach we had to have Ferris and to a lesson that we had to have Zach

21:46.900 --> 21:51.380
Yeah, I mean I agree that their presences were necessary

21:51.460 --> 21:59.140
But I think they were too front and center because of the spatial aspect of the zoom for the whole the whole point originally was

21:59.940 --> 22:06.660
The most people in studios possible and then that kind of now then it just became the most people which is also good

22:06.660 --> 22:08.660
But I thought it was a different

22:09.620 --> 22:14.740
Yeah, I mean I get that I just think 23 is better than 21

22:15.940 --> 22:23.380
Yeah, for sure I wanted to push it it was sad that we there were people that couldn't join like Brad

22:24.180 --> 22:26.420
Ian Carmel yeah

22:26.420 --> 22:32.340
The other was supposed to be so I saw somebody comment being like no Ian and I was like we tried and he's on tour

22:33.300 --> 22:38.500
That's true. Is Ian a staple of the show. He's only been on on one

22:38.500 --> 22:40.660
But it was like a hit and he loved it

22:40.660 --> 22:44.020
I was shocked that he loved he was like I want to come on all the time

22:44.580 --> 22:52.580
He hasn't been on since, but you know, he's been busy busy guys. I kind of wish that he and I had linked up in

22:53.380 --> 22:59.460
Like being on this show a couple times before I've since I submitted to write for cordon twice

23:00.340 --> 23:03.620
Mm-hmm and I'm like if he had known me more intimately

23:03.860 --> 23:08.820
John it never came across his desk and even if he had he would have been too drunk on drawer wine

23:09.780 --> 23:11.780
To get the jokes

23:11.780 --> 23:17.860
Yeah, let alone the dude was Ian who passed Ian car all your work and said not good enough

23:17.860 --> 23:20.340
Did you guys know that in 1944 FDR

23:21.220 --> 23:24.980
Proposed a 100% tax on the top earners in the country

23:25.940 --> 23:31.940
No, no, he proposed it how do you have to go people like it you got it done they got it

23:33.140 --> 23:35.380
The rich people got it down to 94

23:35.940 --> 23:40.580
But I'm just like why are rich people complaining about taxes now because in 1944 during the war

23:40.980 --> 23:43.940
They literally were taxed at 94% of their income

23:45.620 --> 23:50.660
No Twitter back then. Is that true? That's true. That's crazy moving on

23:51.300 --> 23:53.300
Fairness

23:53.300 --> 23:55.300
Like was that my nurse acts

23:55.300 --> 23:58.420
Behind you. Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, so a cannonball

23:59.140 --> 24:05.140
Nice nice nice. Was it the quote in the outline superstars like killer swears work out in athletic wear

24:07.300 --> 24:09.300
I don't want that

24:10.180 --> 24:15.740
Not let me craved that word. He posted himself pumping on in leather pants

24:15.900 --> 24:17.900
That is so ridiculous

24:18.940 --> 24:26.780
sunglasses and boots inspiring comments like my man never breaks character full-time rock star

24:27.340 --> 24:33.660
The video gave one guy an excuse reasons why I haven't started working out one

24:33.900 --> 24:35.900
I don't own any leather pants

24:36.940 --> 24:39.660
Cravots lifted weights to his own music

24:41.660 --> 24:44.700
Dressed to go so much from the gym to the stage

24:46.460 --> 24:49.020
Do you think he baby powdered his thighs and

24:50.300 --> 24:56.060
What a dumb song those damn rates story to imagine when he having to make like Ross

24:56.060 --> 24:58.060
All right, who does this remind you?

24:58.780 --> 25:00.780
Slaathering on motion

25:02.380 --> 25:05.100
I thought you're gonna say Marty it's sweaty leather pants

25:07.820 --> 25:15.580
Not since Lenny ripped his leather pants on stage and accidentally exposed his privates in 2015 has his leather

25:15.740 --> 25:20.220
Given such pleasure. Did you see the footage where his like pants split stuff?

25:20.220 --> 25:25.820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do you think I could get that on YouTube? That's on YouTube. Okay. Good. I'll look for that at least Cravots

25:27.820 --> 25:29.820
This definitely happened

25:32.380 --> 25:36.380
Who does this remind you of unless you think the weight of Marty? It was purely

25:37.740 --> 25:40.940
It spawned a soldier images of Lenny's abs

25:41.660 --> 25:44.380
Especially impressive. He's about to turn six

25:45.580 --> 25:48.860
Nothing wethery about Lenny except his pants

25:49.340 --> 25:51.340
That's one fan noted

25:51.340 --> 25:53.340
Man is even immune to chafing

25:54.300 --> 25:56.300
See you know

25:56.300 --> 25:58.300
New York

25:58.300 --> 26:00.300
Accept his pants

26:01.500 --> 26:05.900
Where do we begin? Yeah, yeah, did you see the video of

26:06.460 --> 26:10.300
So Gravots like giving him this doing a speech for the

26:11.100 --> 26:12.940
His Hollywood walk of fame star

26:13.340 --> 26:15.340
No, yeah, who was it? It's Denzel

26:16.620 --> 26:19.180
Huh what what didn't Denzel speak at his

26:20.300 --> 26:21.660
Walker fames

26:21.660 --> 26:24.460
ceremony? I was talking about so he craved it

26:25.180 --> 26:27.180
Speaking because she specifically mentioned

26:28.860 --> 26:32.220
That she was always embarrassed when he would come to pick her up at school

26:33.500 --> 26:37.500
In leather pants and mess shirts. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's kind of a uniform

26:38.140 --> 26:44.540
Yeah, I mean Lenny has the you know skin tight leather pants that are kind of flared out

26:44.540 --> 26:45.900
Mashed top

26:45.900 --> 26:50.460
sunglasses inside it's last night and then will has sort of this like

26:51.740 --> 26:53.740
Workwear

26:53.740 --> 26:55.740
oversized button down

26:57.580 --> 27:03.420
Maybe it's hard to draw a comparison or contrast between mine and Lenny's styles

27:03.660 --> 27:10.220
Definitely contrast. I would say that he has been he looks like he was kind of chiseled out of marble

27:10.220 --> 27:12.780
And you kind of look like you live in a shipping container

27:13.180 --> 27:15.180
Interesting interesting

27:15.180 --> 27:20.140
Like just kind of the nuance my response to such a personal attack

27:21.740 --> 27:23.740
I let it roll off my back

27:23.740 --> 27:25.740
Don't think so you're shaker

27:26.380 --> 27:28.380
Don't quarter have forgotten

27:29.420 --> 27:32.620
I've forgotten and I've forgiven we have to take a break

27:33.900 --> 27:35.900
Yeah, we'll be right back

27:40.940 --> 27:44.700
Sorry, actually I need your guys to help on this one. This is the first ever

27:46.140 --> 27:48.140
Kind of multi vocalist

27:48.620 --> 27:50.620
race song

27:57.100 --> 27:59.100
All the grits are

27:59.500 --> 28:02.540
To brag because I rack the graze

28:05.740 --> 28:07.740
Boyle it's like a wall

28:09.740 --> 28:11.740
As I see or the sword

28:14.380 --> 28:16.380
Rice to be shaped in scorn

28:18.140 --> 28:20.140
We're at burnt till it's graze

28:22.940 --> 28:24.940
Charming rice like crazy

28:29.180 --> 28:33.180
And they pump up the smurched

28:34.940 --> 28:37.580
Torred every single grain

28:39.420 --> 28:45.660
Well, I blacken boss body and boss body as cooking oil spray

28:47.260 --> 28:50.540
You know that over Cossay

28:52.140 --> 28:53.900
I trash rice

28:54.060 --> 28:56.060
from chefs

28:57.420 --> 28:59.420
Putting rice and steam

29:01.420 --> 29:03.420
It's not how you make rice

29:15.420 --> 29:17.420
Sing a long if you know the words

29:24.860 --> 29:26.860
Sorry, it's a solo

29:29.900 --> 29:34.300
There's something so appropriate about you looking like paraff of the rapper today

29:34.700 --> 29:36.140
Graff of the Graff of the

29:36.140 --> 29:37.500
Bobby you're at a scene

29:37.500 --> 29:40.460
And I usually am the one that looks like paraff of the rapper

29:40.460 --> 29:41.900
Boys in turn some love

29:43.900 --> 29:46.300
As they clawed on to ride

29:48.700 --> 29:51.100
A ball that tastes like chocolate

29:52.060 --> 29:54.540
Because it's made with the rye

29:57.580 --> 30:00.220
And by scalding round face

30:01.420 --> 30:03.420
I could find the grip

30:06.140 --> 30:08.140
Rice should not be steaming

30:10.940 --> 30:12.940
Just ruined rice with hands

30:14.540 --> 30:16.540
Just black in the whole pan

30:17.500 --> 30:19.500
Dream

30:32.860 --> 30:36.780
I think you've got like 12 10 12 tracks man. You've got to produce this

30:38.780 --> 30:40.780
I fully forgot to say

30:42.060 --> 30:44.060
I forgot

30:46.540 --> 30:48.540
And in the lyrics

30:49.740 --> 30:52.140
I read it as I was locked in

30:56.700 --> 30:59.340
Now the mama's and the poppers have a shoot

31:01.020 --> 31:03.020
Well, um

31:03.420 --> 31:05.420
It's the the mama's and the poppers

31:06.380 --> 31:11.980
Or sorry, it's it's the forget it let's take another fucking break. Yeah, yeah, we don't

31:17.420 --> 31:21.100
We don't sell that many ads for this show. I don't know what happened

31:23.100 --> 31:28.300
We used to I don't know what happened. Yeah, sorry. That's just how you come back from breaks now

31:29.420 --> 31:30.620
Correct, sure

31:30.620 --> 31:32.620
That's absolutely correct. Be more jarring

31:33.260 --> 31:35.260
It's like basically

31:35.260 --> 31:37.260
Rods of aluminium hitting

31:38.060 --> 31:39.260
concrete

31:39.260 --> 31:42.700
Yeah, this is how you wake up the listener exactly the Adler

31:43.180 --> 31:47.420
From the dozing off they're rolled into that's better help HEL

31:49.740 --> 31:53.500
All right, um, I also I got to give a shout out. I'm trying to reload my discord

31:55.580 --> 32:00.460
But I know that so that californian dream and parody was inspired by a discord member rufus

32:00.540 --> 32:03.260
Who was like what if we there's a californian dream and parody

32:04.700 --> 32:06.700
And we all kind of like started

32:07.740 --> 32:09.740
Throw in some lyrics out

32:09.900 --> 32:17.100
And all the grits are black are came from rufus. So shout out rufus shout out Matt S and shout out mighty femputer

32:17.740 --> 32:18.700
for

32:18.700 --> 32:20.700
Inspiring that

32:21.580 --> 32:25.020
Rice parody all right guys there's been a lot of

32:25.740 --> 32:27.580
Talk especially around the 200th episode

32:28.300 --> 32:30.300
As we kind of look back on this show

32:31.500 --> 32:36.780
People psychoanalyzing me people saying that I'm a fucking maniac and uh, obviously I don't

32:36.860 --> 32:41.100
Appreciate it any more than will appreciated me saying that it looked like he grew up on a

32:41.980 --> 32:43.500
Fucking barge

32:43.500 --> 32:47.900
But um, that was out of pocket. I'm open to criticism

32:47.900 --> 32:54.220
I just wonder if we can maybe quail some of people's conspiracies because I think I am emotionally intelligent

32:54.220 --> 32:58.220
I feel like I do have good social skills and I thought that we could all kind of

32:58.780 --> 33:00.780
Take this quiz that I found

33:01.100 --> 33:03.100
That's basically an EQ test

33:03.660 --> 33:05.020
Literacy

33:05.020 --> 33:11.580
spoil the end of this quiz, but okay. I really think the thing is that you are emotionally literate

33:11.580 --> 33:17.500
You are a manipulative with that information. So you think I'm always it's not like an accident

33:17.740 --> 33:22.460
How you make people uncomfortable you think I'm kind of Japano to the Pinocchio that are my ghosts

33:23.020 --> 33:26.620
I think that gives you a lot more credit than deserved but it's a little bit more

33:27.900 --> 33:29.900
Moment by moment

33:29.900 --> 33:34.540
Well, I mean, it's the thing of like the great white whale and moby dick is like supposed to represent human

33:34.700 --> 33:36.700
Fallibility, but

33:37.260 --> 33:42.460
You guys wonder if maybe I am the whale and I'm just eating people for sport

33:43.260 --> 33:48.780
No, I know that people are not cruel. I know that y'all are human beings with

33:49.420 --> 33:57.020
Whole-back stories lives loved ones and I still choose to kind of dox your personal information in addresses. Is that what you're saying?

33:57.980 --> 34:01.180
I mean, you do cruel the mood quite often

34:05.420 --> 34:07.420
Not on every week

34:09.100 --> 34:11.580
And I'm not calling you one of

34:13.820 --> 34:17.580
There's 12 questions. I'm not calling. Okay, yeah, I'm not taking it

34:19.180 --> 34:25.500
I mean, obviously setting up a second thing and it did just cut him off every time. No, I'm sorry, please go ahead

34:27.020 --> 34:32.620
I'm not calling you one of these, but you know how sociopaths are in their own way like

34:33.260 --> 34:35.260
Super dialed in emotionally

34:36.780 --> 34:38.780
But in a distanced manner

34:39.340 --> 34:42.140
Social distanced or because I feel like we're fast enough

34:43.660 --> 34:47.340
I don't think they I don't think they respect okay

34:48.060 --> 34:49.100
Yeah

34:49.340 --> 34:54.540
Your child in direct contravention to your orders runs into the busy road

34:55.100 --> 34:58.940
You pull them back and a smack them

34:59.740 --> 35:06.380
B Master your emotions and explain why this wasn't a good idea or see

35:07.020 --> 35:12.220
Master your emotions and resolve upon subsequent punishment

35:15.500 --> 35:17.500
I'm gonna collectively

35:17.500 --> 35:22.620
Is this for you or are we just becoming one personality the four of us then taking it together

35:23.580 --> 35:28.300
I can't tell if that's a really good question or if you're trying to

35:29.340 --> 35:31.340
Crack yoke on my

35:31.980 --> 35:33.260
No, I'm a

35:35.900 --> 35:39.740
What do you guys I got my face make it your own content team. What do you think?

35:42.300 --> 35:44.300
Really

35:45.020 --> 35:49.020
I think that these quizzes are

35:49.500 --> 35:51.500
so obvious

35:53.580 --> 35:58.220
All right, let's just say master your emotions and explain why it's not a good idea to run into a busy road. Yeah

35:59.420 --> 36:02.220
That is the best choice the next question

36:02.860 --> 36:04.700
you then a

36:04.700 --> 36:08.620
Apologize and explain that mommy or daddy was frightened

36:09.820 --> 36:14.300
Be burst into tears or see tell the child off

36:15.500 --> 36:18.460
And then threaten them with dire punishment

36:19.020 --> 36:21.020
Which by the way

36:21.020 --> 36:23.020
In the flow chart you could have already smack

36:24.300 --> 36:26.300
There's more dire

36:27.500 --> 36:30.620
I'm gonna go with Apologize and explain the daddy was a little

36:31.740 --> 36:33.740
fright slash

36:34.300 --> 36:37.100
Yeah, you don't seem like the type to burst into tears

36:38.220 --> 36:44.140
Jeff, are you putting yourself in the right shoes when you're it seems like you're just choosing the right answer

36:44.140 --> 36:49.020
But yeah, that's I really want you to tell you that parent when you're answering

36:50.060 --> 36:55.500
Well, what if we could put Jeff in that situation that would be your cat. I would be ideal

36:55.500 --> 36:57.500
The storm hell of an episode

36:57.820 --> 36:59.820
No, I would tell her off

36:59.820 --> 37:02.460
Yeah, I would be like misty dome

37:03.340 --> 37:07.420
And then I later after I wasn't scared. I'd be like sorry. I just

37:07.900 --> 37:09.900
You know didn't want you to get run over by

37:10.860 --> 37:13.980
For lack of a better term big rig because I live right near the freeway

37:14.300 --> 37:19.100
Yeah, would you but you wouldn't cry out of like stress relief sort of thing?

37:19.740 --> 37:27.420
I would but I wouldn't let her see that because she has to think that I'm kind of her strong rock her Jeremy

37:28.140 --> 37:32.780
Strong or otherwise next question now we're getting now we're getting real. Yeah, let's go

37:33.500 --> 37:36.140
It annoys you by the way that was like the least

37:37.100 --> 37:42.220
Relive and thing I said was I have to care Jeremy in front of my cat

37:44.220 --> 37:46.220
Do it

37:46.220 --> 37:49.100
Sentient thing this this is the real desperate all back

37:50.140 --> 37:52.140
All right, it annoys you to a

37:54.060 --> 37:56.060
See others unkempt

37:56.620 --> 37:59.100
Be

37:59.100 --> 38:08.220
Have to make the most of your physical attributes at work or see see others making the most of their

38:08.220 --> 38:10.220
Physical attributes at work

38:10.620 --> 38:14.460
Where is this quiz from? It's all the tests stop. Oh

38:15.820 --> 38:17.820
Which of those three?

38:18.620 --> 38:20.700
Which of those three annoys you the most?

38:20.700 --> 38:25.100
Correct. App does out work. I mean at your job or like

38:25.500 --> 38:27.100
In your place

38:28.460 --> 38:32.300
I think it has to be in your workplace. I mean, what about I thought it wasn't play

38:33.900 --> 38:39.180
I think it's in at the workplace. What do you guys think like for y'all you have to answer this this is

38:39.180 --> 38:43.740
No, but this one's kind of interesting. We all might have to answer this. I would say it annoys me to

38:47.900 --> 38:54.460
Have to make the most of my physical attributes at work. I like a nice work life balance and I don't want to have to

38:54.540 --> 39:02.700
Macs out my energy output for the show and maybe that's why we don't have many advertisers this year

39:05.020 --> 39:07.020
Ferris

39:07.580 --> 39:14.300
By the way, fairs lots of comments by the way. I'm sure you saw of people kind of being like you lowkey

39:15.180 --> 39:18.220
Went underground and got marvel jack

39:18.860 --> 39:24.460
Really the yoke isn't on my face the yoke is in your veins

39:25.340 --> 39:31.820
I do eat a lot of eggs that is true and we can tell I feel like you could bench

39:32.700 --> 39:34.700
Erica

39:35.340 --> 39:40.140
I don't be I haven't met Erica in person. I don't yeah

39:40.940 --> 39:47.020
The issue with bench pressing a human being is that you need to compress them into bar forum or else

39:47.580 --> 39:51.660
It's just a very like loft slightly. I lend wrote a song this actually

39:52.540 --> 39:54.700
The lonely island wrote a song about how you'd have to like

39:55.900 --> 40:00.620
Turn a person into a rod. Well, they're the best solution, but

40:01.980 --> 40:09.580
bikini bench pressing bikini babes is the best body building phrase you can ditch the barbells of the fancy ways and we get

40:09.580 --> 40:12.940
a guarantee that you're gonna look great

40:13.900 --> 40:20.700
All right, so when you first said that Maria cut was like you're on an NPR podcast was like you were taking the most serious moment

40:21.260 --> 40:29.980
I take it very serious. Although to go back to the question it seems to me like Jeff you are most concerned with your co-workers physical attributes

40:30.540 --> 40:32.540
Which would be answer C right

40:33.980 --> 40:37.020
Ferris's guns seem to be intimidating

40:37.260 --> 40:44.940
You a it was more of a role right like I weren't this might be misguided excited about Jake being in a suit

40:45.500 --> 40:49.100
Yeah, that was an issue really physical adorably

40:50.300 --> 40:54.060
I'm proud it was pride in his physicality and

40:54.540 --> 41:01.180
Honestly, and this might be a little rude to say, but I would say I feel like I played some role in it

41:02.620 --> 41:03.820
Yeah

41:03.820 --> 41:05.820
I would say like part of the problem

41:05.900 --> 41:09.820
Percent of his muscle mass and or water weight

41:10.220 --> 41:20.220
When he stopped working on the show at the time for himself and the drive to kind of get out all his frustration towards me

41:21.180 --> 41:23.180
on to the

41:24.940 --> 41:26.460
ropes

41:26.460 --> 41:31.580
That is the 5% from you it was just you know the gym is a great outlet

41:32.380 --> 41:35.740
Yeah, yeah, forget better help man. Just go to the gym

41:36.540 --> 41:40.620
Don't forget better help. Do that's the only advertiser for the rest of the year

41:41.100 --> 41:43.100
Yeah, right

41:43.100 --> 41:47.740
Question four and then we might just wrap it up you're infuriated with your partner

41:48.300 --> 41:55.900
Do you a plot revenge b refused to speak for days or see swear and go for a walk?

41:56.460 --> 41:59.580
I'm gonna go ahead and start and say all three of these are bad options

41:59.980 --> 42:08.860
But of the three I would say swear and go for a walk. Yeah, yeah, because that it didn't describe what could happen after

42:09.260 --> 42:12.140
But that basically means cool cool off

42:12.860 --> 42:18.300
Come back and maybe you won't be plotting revenge against your partner after that

42:19.020 --> 42:25.420
Yeah, all right. Let's just wrap it fire these your parents slash parent and law is nagging sarcastic and interfering

42:25.820 --> 42:31.020
Your principal feeling is a resentment be resignation or see pity

42:32.220 --> 42:35.660
I would say a a yeah resentment is kind of classic

42:36.860 --> 42:43.900
All right six grief is a a blight on your life be a necessary and salutary process

42:44.940 --> 42:47.580
Or see something which time will heal

42:49.020 --> 42:52.220
All of the above but let's just go with a

42:52.780 --> 42:56.140
Unnecessary and salutary process

42:57.260 --> 43:00.460
Such a bad quiz and just power through

43:01.980 --> 43:06.060
Don't worry service purpose. I would say sometimes

43:07.500 --> 43:09.980
You are outraged by a newspaper star

43:11.340 --> 43:13.340
Jack

43:13.340 --> 43:15.340
It's where's leather pants

43:16.380 --> 43:18.380
drives me fucking crazy

43:19.260 --> 43:25.420
Do you a ran to your friends and family be become depressed or see right a letter to the newspaper?

43:25.420 --> 43:27.420
I would say be become depressed

43:28.220 --> 43:31.580
Nine is your anger destructive of yourself a

43:32.220 --> 43:38.300
Spur to change or a spur to hurt and destroying things

43:40.860 --> 43:47.420
This is like an ESL test this can't be real you couldn't take in one on psychology today

43:47.740 --> 43:51.260
I'm gonna say it better is destructive of me

43:52.540 --> 43:59.580
Yeah, this is this this is the sparkle of emotional intelligence. All right time is above all

44:00.140 --> 44:02.140
My the great destroyer

44:03.420 --> 44:07.660
Being to be vanquished or see the great healer

44:08.380 --> 44:12.300
What I would say this the great healer time heals all wounds

44:13.260 --> 44:16.620
But you let's get that where you're the grief enough

44:17.820 --> 44:19.820
I'm taking a quiz

44:21.180 --> 44:23.180
Can you read the next one's in your head?

44:24.220 --> 44:26.220
No

44:28.060 --> 44:30.060
Violent crunch is to me

44:30.860 --> 44:34.300
A outrage about which something should be done

44:34.860 --> 44:41.500
B and isolated tragic case from which we can draw a lesson or see a reflection of general trends in society

44:42.460 --> 44:50.620
Yes, you like music to be primarily a exciting be deeply moving or see soothing

44:51.660 --> 44:57.260
Depends completely no, it's not different song should be it again. It should be all of the above

44:59.020 --> 45:01.020
I would say deeply moving

45:02.540 --> 45:04.540
Because that says a lot

45:04.540 --> 45:12.940
Deeply a deeply moving track forget it correct me if I'm wrong Monchi, but a deeply moving track could be soothing or exciting

45:12.940 --> 45:20.380
So I would say it's the closest to all of the above. That's true. I would agree with that. Yeah, and we have the results so you guys ready

45:21.340 --> 45:23.340
Yeah

45:24.780 --> 45:32.540
The results of me slash us taking this quiz the result is you emotional literacy

45:33.500 --> 45:41.660
Yeah, because he chose the middle answer this whole segment might retrospectively be called emotional literacy or not

45:42.780 --> 45:45.260
Because those are the only two seeming options

45:45.260 --> 45:51.580
Yeah, you're robust attempts to master your emotions, which they keep saying master emotions

45:52.780 --> 45:57.340
Our praise worthy, but frequently ill judged in unsympathetic

45:58.300 --> 46:02.940
What you defend yourself from unworthy emotions by simulating appropriating

46:03.260 --> 46:10.060
Appropriate responses, but you tend to give rent free space in your head to people and things which were better

46:10.140 --> 46:16.940
Considered understood and consigned to the emotional data bank for subsequent use

46:17.660 --> 46:22.620
The fact that you use the phrase rent free in your head is like an emotional data

46:22.620 --> 46:24.620
Literacy is so clear years

46:24.620 --> 46:28.620
By the way, this quiz was written in 2006

46:30.700 --> 46:33.340
Crazy, I would say I wrote this

46:33.900 --> 46:39.340
They were ahead of the game with the living rent free in your head phrase. I didn't hear that shit

46:39.340 --> 46:40.380
till

46:40.380 --> 46:42.380
Just a few years ago really

46:42.380 --> 46:44.380
Yeah

46:44.380 --> 46:47.180
even emotions even emotions which seem unworthy

46:47.820 --> 46:51.260
anger, fear, frailty, depression

46:51.740 --> 46:56.780
Into harmless contexts such as when listening to music or watching films

46:57.180 --> 47:01.980
Explore them and acknowledge them they are part of the armory of wisdom

47:03.580 --> 47:05.580
Wow

47:06.140 --> 47:08.140
I kind of love the armory of wisdom

47:11.660 --> 47:14.140
Are you really able to take a real quiz?

47:15.180 --> 47:17.500
To see how it compares like with a doctor

47:17.900 --> 47:19.180
I

47:19.180 --> 47:23.660
Thought you meant like sitting in on like a community college course. You want me to applaud it

47:24.300 --> 47:26.300
Sucking sociology

47:26.300 --> 47:28.300
Yeah

47:28.540 --> 47:30.060

49:11.900 --> 49:13.900
Did you run into the rather yeah

49:15.580 --> 49:17.900
The truth comes out grab her by the tail

49:23.180 --> 49:25.180
Oh

49:26.140 --> 49:28.380
Do you do the projector and say the TV yeah?

49:29.820 --> 49:35.180
Yeah, this is the extra give me I bought so I bought this like in 2020 it was

49:35.740 --> 49:40.300
These are like a thousand dollars now, but when I bought it it was like $250 on Amazon

49:40.780 --> 49:42.780
I think

49:42.780 --> 49:47.660
Is it all right about how much money has put on stuff but I think it was definitely way less than a thousand dollars

49:47.660 --> 49:52.460
I wouldn't have spent a thousand dollars in a projector, but I bought it with money that I got from

49:53.020 --> 49:57.740
That holiday happy hour that we did in COVID in 2020

49:59.020 --> 50:01.020

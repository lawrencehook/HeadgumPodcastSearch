00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
First Zoom record in like two months this sucks.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Don't you prefer the Zoom records to the regulars?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
A laugh factory.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Nice!

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
We did mention this on this act on episode that came out today.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
For all of you guys playing head-gum podcasts,

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Bingo, there's my slot where I mentioned the day we're recording.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
A non-helpful sort of...

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Almost, I guess confusing way to start the episode.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Yeah, the episode that came out today

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
to the people listening to this episode that came out today.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Okay, the episode that came out last Friday.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Oh, I'm confused.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
For this episode, can we give a mirror background

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
since he's like full blue screen for once?

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
It's not well enough to do it, but I'll do it.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Oh, like actually in post to make it a screen.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
I thought you wanted me to choose a Zoom virtual background.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
No, it's...

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
You didn't light it well enough for me to do it perfectly,

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
but I'll key in the floor to keys or something like that.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Key in a bunch of keys.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I can... let me see if I can turn it.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Maybe I'll key in peel.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Nice.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Yeah, about this.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Worse.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Of course.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Because you have to be lit and the background has to be lit.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
So you're putting on the light on this episode.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
This episode has to be lit.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Isn't good for the key.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Forget I asked.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
We've got Joel done off on the show.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
You're looking like very much white men can't jump right now.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
I see I was actually worried about my lighting too.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Lighting in my bedroom isn't great.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
The sun could go down at any moment.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah, you're really fighting the sun over here.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
You also might wipe your webcam, right?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
It's very smudgy.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
A rosy glow.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
I love where it's now.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Yeah.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
All right.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
If you were doing post effects,

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
can we do Joel smudges his lens and then he has a mustache for the rest of the show?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
No.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Handlebar.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Joel smudges your lens again.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Shoot.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Great.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
So I'll put it in between the two smudges.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Because with the last thing I'm going to...

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Sorry.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Excuse me.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
One second.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
The last thing I'm going to do when we're in this December period,

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
where I'm banking three weeks of work in three weeks,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
which is just doubling up three weeks in a row,

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
is to motion capture,

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
or at least motion track a fake mustache under Joel.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Because ultimately that's not funny.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
And a funny.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Not really.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
I think it's a little funny with this after part.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
No.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
We were talking on the episode with Zack Dunn,

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
that it's harder for me to be mean to people in the studio.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
So here we are back on Zoom.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
I'm in a room alone,

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
so I can say anything I want.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
In my own.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Out loud.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
And that doesn't hurt your guys.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Just feelings.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Well.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Did you guys see slash listen to last week's episode with Zack?

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
I saw it was uploaded,

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
because I always check to make sure that Jeff did his job.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
I didn't watch it yet, though.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Joel, I haven't heard of you there.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
That was one thing everybody had to do.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
No.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Yeah.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
No.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
I am happy to report that,

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
for once the head compound cast was not on my Spotify rat.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
From just like checking to make sure it's working and things are fine.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
So what was on your Spotify rat for podcasts?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Not always sunny pod.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
It was the top one.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
New comers.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
It was the second one.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Gossip Kings.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Of course.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Nice.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
And the red flags podcast.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
And that one podcast.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
That I listened to until I realized what the host was cat coans by friend.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
And I couldn't go on.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
I ran into Carl Tart the other day at Eden Day.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Oh, we're at Eden Day.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Did you say hi?

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Yeah, I said hi.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
My roommate, George Sava, works on Grand crew.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
So I was like, also you work with my roommate.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
And he was like, yeah, George.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
That's nice.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
That's so great.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Yeah.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
There's more to that story that I don't feel comfortable telling right now.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Joel, how's that cock?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
You said you got on field.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Let's get a field update.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Joel texted me.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Sorry.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Sorry.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Could be drinking anything right now.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Is that a flat Pepsi?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Is it a red wine?

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Is it a, a Mr. Pib?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Joel's Mr. Pib.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
First field date went swimming.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
What?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
What?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
What powdered lime?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Actually, that's my, my big plug.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Why don't we?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Why don't we?

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Why don't we?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Why don't we?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Let's take it the Marie.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Right?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
I have a lot.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
I have a lot to talk about.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Let's do a 15 minutes of Brownlee.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
And then we can get to the real stuff.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
You can show that to obviously tell she loved that movie.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
It's my favorite movie.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
The air probably.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Wow.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
I've watched it with her.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Your fifth favorite.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Hmm.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
You said five.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
So I was like, oh, you're fifth favorite.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
What if I was doing an Irish accent for dinner?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Joel texted me.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
First field date went swimmingly.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
So really, in a way, you spread me a bit of joy.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
And transitively.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I said, canyon.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
This is a joy to hear.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
An oraborous of exaltation for the both of us.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
I did say this.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
You didn't respond.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I mean, you can't say it now.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I can't say this.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Not that he didn't say it.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Yeah.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Marie could go on.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
I have no idea what any of that meant to be on.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Is the name of the person you went on a date with?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Yes.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Oh, I thought I'd talk about the canyon.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Okay.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
No.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I don't know what that is.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Got it.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Uh, Marieka.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Do you want me to talk?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
We haven't done about anything.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
In a while, let's do a Marieka takes the reins for seven minutes.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Seven.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
She did, she did say before you came on a mirror that she has a lot to go over.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Well, it was prompted.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Or Jeff asked me what was wrong with me.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I think, or something to that effect.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
And I said that I was falling apart.

07:44.000 --> 07:52.000
And part of that is because of the heroing thing that I experienced yesterday.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Which is actually like seriously bad.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
But I will make light of it because it was crazy.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I want to see the movie bones and all.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
At a movie theater.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
The AMC 34th Street Theater.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
I had been there.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Meer days ago to see glass onion.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
But I went back to the exact same theater.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
The theater 12 on the top floor.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
To see bones and all movie.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Starting to Mithi Shalame.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Taylor Russell.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Candles.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Watching the movie.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Having a kind of stressful time.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
There's a lot of stuff going on in my row.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
I was in the back row.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
There were like phones going off.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
At one point, two ushers came up.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Both aisles.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Checked on something.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Like someone in the row.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Waved.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
And then they left.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Before the movie.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Someone came up.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
And was like looking for a specific chair.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
And then was like messing with the settings.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
And like trying to fix it.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
I think.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Someone left their headphones.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
And of course, they came back to the theater.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Right.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
As the movie was starting to get them.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Just a lot going on.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
So I was in the theater.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Just like a little stressed.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
It's also like a little bit scary of a movie.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I don't know if anyone's seen it.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I won't spoil what happens.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
But in the last five minutes when arguably a lot is going on.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
In this movie about cannibals.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
I look over to the man that is sitting directly next to me.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
And his dick is out of his pants.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And he out of his zipper.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Yes.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
And I leaned over to my friend.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
And I was like the man next to me is masturbating.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Sure.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Yeah.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
And she was like.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Move towards me.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Then I was like, I'm going to get up.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Am I going to miss anything crazy?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
And she was like, yes.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
And so I just exited my seat.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
I didn't bring any of my stuff with me.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
And I just walked.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
And I stood in the hallway for the rest of the movie.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
And I watched standing immediately left.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
It was truly crazy.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Can't stop thinking about it.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
Obviously because why so many reasons.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
And then I tweeted her all.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I got a lot of it.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Got a lot of those responses.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Classic.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Classic.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
I did tweet my review.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Which is basically like I couldn't review this movie.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Because the man next to me had it in the last five minutes.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
But that's more than a dick out.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
That's like a.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Yeah.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
No, for sure.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
My friend said afterwards.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
He like just covered it with his phone.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
And I'm like, what?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I don't know.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
That's how small it is.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
That's how small it is.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
By the way.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I own mini.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Yeah.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
He had the 12 mini.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Yeah.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Also his phone kept going off the entire movie.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Like every five minutes it would like have.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
It would be.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
And I went.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
My friend.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Oh, Amber alerts.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
What was the state of this man?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Was it like a dignified old man?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Who was it a Ram Munchy teen?

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
An older man.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Like.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
He seemed.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Fine.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
I felt like.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
What are you doing?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Well, there was a lot of stuff going on.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
And I feel like, you know, sometimes people go to movie theaters to sleep.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Like they sneak in or whatever.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
And you're like, just to like sit for a while.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
And I felt like there was someone else in the theater that was doing that.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Because it was like, I don't know.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
They had like a ton of bags with them.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Like a huge book bag.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
A little weird.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
But this guy, he walked up to his seat.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
He sat down.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
He sat down on the headphones that the man later.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
So he was like, are these yours?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
I said no.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
He put them in the seat next to him.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
And we carried on.

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
But like, it wasn't like I didn't hear like, I saw him occasionally like shifting like this.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
I did.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
I felt like a little uncomfortable vibes for me.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
I couldn't really tell why, but I chalked it up to watching a movie about cannibals.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
We're like.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
It's just like, who can you trust?

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
So he was jammed out of the cannibal part.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
I mean, it was like a significantly bloody like.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
God.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
Every like the culmination of the movie.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Kind of.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
So that was crazy.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Yeah, a lot of weird responses to my tweet as well.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Someone tagged Jeff and one.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
And it's like.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
I don't know.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
Get off the internet for a night.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Really like laughing or really like legitimately traumatized.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Like how many jokes should we make right now about it?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Yeah.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
I mean, no.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I was making jokes.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
I was talking about it very loud.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I was exiting the theater.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I just wanted everyone around to be aware.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
God.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Yeah.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Did you tell on him?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
No.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Because like, I like how.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
You know what I mean?

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Like kind of a waste of your time, I guess.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Yeah.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Yeah.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I have to imagine he like snuck into the theater,

13:15.000 --> 13:27.000
which honestly, like, there was a woman sitting by the escalator on the bottom floor that barely checked me in.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Like, I almost walked faster.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
So I could see how that would happen.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
But yeah, I was like, I, who am I going to tell?

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Like, what is I going to do?

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
But I mean, ultimately I can make fun of it.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
But it was terrible.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Yeah.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
I'm sorry.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Yeah.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
And now that movie is written for me.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
Did you like it aside from that before you realize the, the faculty?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Yeah.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
I will.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
The other thing that I was that is kind of like the joke that I was originally going to make,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
which I decided was too bad to make.

14:07.000 --> 14:13.000
But then became fine when this happened was, I, my review for the movie was almost going to be.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Army Hammer watching this and jerking off.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
Uh, I was going to make an Army Hammer joke.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Uh, so yeah.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
So now it's fine to make.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
Um, but I mean, did we, did we pull out that it was him?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
That was perfect time storytelling.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Seven minutes of murica takes the reins and she wrapped it up.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
That's the seventh minute.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Um, seven minutes.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Hell.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Ha ha.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Ha.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
hilarious casting, by the way, the Timothy Shalemay's not movie.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
He's kind of great in it.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
I don't know.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
He's like, he's like, he's, he's being real weird on it.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
It's really good.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Yeah.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
I enjoyed him.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
They're like, how, what was the inspiration for this character?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
And he's like, well.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Uh, that's my heart.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
That's my heart.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
It's the music.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
We do have to move on.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Uh, we can talk more about and that you be a problem.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Like, I don't want to move on.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
And you're just sweeping this whole thing under the rug.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Go on, Tom.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Like, Marika, we actually can't move on.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Exactly.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
But yeah, let's hear what's what's going on.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
Gordon get covers as the guy co lizard or some shit.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Well, it was going to be bond of the week.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
But um, yeah.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
Like, do you all talk about it with Django next to everything?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Talk it.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
That's all right.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Um, that's nice.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
That's horrible.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
That's a non-consensual sexual experience.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Yeah.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
For sure.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
That sucks.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I'm sorry that happened.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
That's okay.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Internalized it.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
I'm going to go for it one day.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
Um, Madonna is my bond of the week.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Lines.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Edward.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
In glass onion.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Specifically a character Miles Brown.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
That's good.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Did you like that movie?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
I got it.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Did you see it?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
No.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I didn't see the first one either.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Joel.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Shit.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
I'll go Will Smith.

16:29.000 --> 16:35.000
I think he needs like if there was just one slap scene in the movie, it would go viral.

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
I think that would undo all of the press that he's currently doing to read.

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
Juvenate his figure that is ultimately fine because no one cares anymore.

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
The emancipation style.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I mean, you're a bond of the week.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
You already did your recent run.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Um, you know, that's over.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
What?

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
I was going to say Anthony Fauci.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Evan hasn't come up as a bond before.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
It's a, I remember everyone's.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Yeah.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
You know how they do to casino royals.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Yeah.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
This will be the second doctor.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
No.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Because that's kind of what he did for like two years.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
He was like, he was a doctor who's telling you no.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
You can't do that.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Yeah.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Laugh there.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Can somebody?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Yeah.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
That's what you like.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
I had a good podcast.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Fandom.com.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
What kind of whatever those things are page that the style of the bonds of the week?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Yeah.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
It would take a few weeks to put it all together.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
But we'd appreciate it.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Yeah.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Let's just do a Wikipedia page because that's more legitimate.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
That would help me get very nice.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
It's not a week.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Yeah.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Yeah.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
I get.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
I mean, that's the first place that I go for any relevant information.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I skip them over time.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Because I'm like, I was easily crazy.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Crazed fans.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
The editing of these pages will be nearly.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
Do you want to know something really sad and weird that I did recently?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
I can't do that.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
So I want to see this movie.

18:19.000 --> 18:29.000
I was trying to look up a really niche reference to the Netflix series, the Punisher,

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
to respond to a text from my friend.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
And then I couldn't find it in the fandom article.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
But I got so enthralled in the plot description.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
But I read the entire plot description of every.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Of a movie you've seen.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
No.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Yeah.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Well, I have seen it.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
But it's multiple TV shows.

18:52.000 --> 19:00.000
Like every plot that the Punisher was involved in in the Marvel Netflix universe.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Written out.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
And it wasn't written well.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Clear mistakes.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
So why did you read it, man?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
I don't know.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
This is great.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
I've never seen this.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I'm feeling normal.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I've rarely gotten a word in edge wise.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
Amira is his normal, sinewy, deplorable self.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
But Marika is coming in with that Friday feeling.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Woo.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
All right.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
A white lotus mister.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
This is news of the day.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Actually, you know what?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Let's take a quick break.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Thanks, my sponsors.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
Hoping the show does a little bit better financially next year.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Hear me, Bob.

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
Guys, sometimes you just wish that life came with a user manual, right?

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
Whether you start a new job or project or a new relationship,

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
or have any struggles within your family's core.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
Sometimes it's like, what am I supposed to do here?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Right?

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
And that's why better help online therapy is here.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
Because it is the next best thing to a user manual for life.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Because unfortunately, life doesn't come with a user manual.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
So when it's not working for you, it's normal to feel stuck.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
And navigating any of life's challenges can make you feel unsure whether it's a career

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
change, a new relationship, or becoming a parent.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
Therapists are trained to help you figure out the cause of challenging emotions

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
and learn productive coping skills, which makes therapy the closest thing

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
to a guided tour of the complex engine that can.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Called you.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
I've been therapy every week.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
I've said the same thing on every ad read for this.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
It really is important if you want to be the best version of yourself

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
and show up for the people that you care about and the people around you

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
as the best version of yourself.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
What's that?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Thanks, better help.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Let's take it into news of the day.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
For the Wall Street Journal, a white lotus mystery.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Constant hotel dining.

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
I'm so, I was so happy when I saw this headline because I was like, yeah,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
these people are all like really rich.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
They wouldn't be eating at the hotel every single night.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
They're in Sicily.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
Maybe it's not more of a remote location.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
And it has like a world star restaurant.

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
Every night, they said these decadent television characters can afford any meal anywhere.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
Why do they stick with the same in-house menu?

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
Oh, like the characters in season two.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Yeah.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Yeah.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
The hotel.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
Well, actually some of them have been going off to yachts and day trips and night trips

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
and stuff like that.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
So that's not entirely accurate.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
Well, Christopher from the sopranos and his family always

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
eats at the restaurant every single night.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
I'm like, and they all look so complacent.

22:25.000 --> 22:31.000
I'm like, that's what, like, vacations are for breaking your routine, Joel.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
Yeah, but there's something nice about going to the same restaurant every single night.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
You're also kind of great father.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
What's that?

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
They're kind of depressed.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
What an impish smile or mirror just had.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Sorry, I'm trying to sit down.

22:52.000 --> 22:58.000
This is actually one of my favorite underrated tweets of my own recently.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Can I read it?

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Yeah.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Okay.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Please.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Um,

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Rumpy Stilt Skin.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
An imp, barters for a daughter slash also has a fucking dump truck.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
Is that what happens in Rumpel Stilt Skin?

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
Yeah, like a hunchback barters for a dart.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
No, that's Rapunzel.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
That's Rapunzel.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Oh, Rumpy Stilt Skin.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Did you guys get it?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
I don't remember who Rumpel Stilt.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Rump?

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
He like trades gold for a daughter.

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
I was, I was confusing him with Raspian.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
Oh, real person.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Yeah.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Um, all right.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Discuss.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
Lake Belle jokes that she's straight up a better parent on weed.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
What do we think?

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
I think it really sucks that Lake Belle was killed off in the beginning of Black Panther.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
What kind of forever?

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
I think it really sucks that I've only been to her house once.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Hmm.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Did you just let her die?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Because you should go more.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
Because I should be invited for a weekly dinner, Gilmour Girl style.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Oh.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Did you in Gilmour Girls?

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
No.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
No.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
But they haven't.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
But they haven't.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
But they haven't.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
I don't know that.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Yes.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Shit.

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
I should pay Rory back because for the grandparents paid for Rory's college.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Yeah.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Yeah.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I think you're a Logan.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Is that someone in Gilmour Girls?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Because if it was, I would know.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
It's not.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
It is.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
It's her third boyfriend.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Oh.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
I'm a Luke.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Hmm.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Hmm.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
And I will run a diner one day.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Okay.

24:46.000 --> 24:56.000
I never watched Gilmour Girls, but I don't believe you're a Luke.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
You're not a like flannel and hat sky.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
What?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Come here.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
I'm on your Twitter.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
I didn't.

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
You never tweeted the rumples.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
You're last.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Did you delete it?

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Because it was a so underrated.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Imagine dying during a massage.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
That's your most recent one.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Thinking about going to my work.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Because someday whatever.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
That one got Marika.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
I just like.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
It was of your face and the little thing.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
And someone like continues beating into.

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
First of all, you died at minute 14.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
The rumples still skin.

25:38.000 --> 25:45.000
And they're like, wow, so tense.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Hollywood can make you miserable.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
White lotus star.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
I'll re-plaza.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Just laugh it off.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
A mirror.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
Does Hollywood make you miserable?

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Not me personally.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Because I haven't had much success.

26:00.000 --> 26:08.000
But I can see why the entire industry is toxic and structured in such a way that most people

26:08.000 --> 26:15.000
either fail or have a terrible time succeeding.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Okay.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
That was depressing.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Shit.

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
The U.S. city with the most coffee shops per capita isn't what you'd expect.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
Where do you think we see at all?

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Where do you guys think it is?

26:29.000 --> 26:35.000
Is it a city we've heard of like a big city like Denver or is it like a random small city like concord New Hampshire?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
It's a top 10 U.S. city.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Wow.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Phoenix.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Boston.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
I'll say Miami.

26:43.000 --> 26:51.000
Believe it or not, San Francisco actually is packed with the most coffee shops per capita.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
It's not terribly surprising.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
Or is it like a small, densely populated city?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Yeah.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
Not that many people live there.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I'm so worried.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
This is per slate.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
I'm so worried my kid is becoming that kid.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
How can I keep that from happening?

27:12.000 --> 27:17.000
Don't send them to the University of Chicago.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
So you think you're that kid?

27:20.000 --> 27:34.000
That kids are a term that you Chicago students used to refer to the students that like ask for homework or like raise their hand constantly.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
Just a general annoying nuisance in class.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
Like a picnic girl, but for classmates.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
I don't know what a picnic girl is.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
A picnic girl is like a female.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Yeah.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Oh, that's cool.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
What?

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
They want to be the only girl in the room and they're like, oh, like I'm such a guy's girl.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
And it's like they try and push other women down well.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
A cool girl?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
No.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
And not like other girls actually not like a cool girl.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
No, that's a bad kid move.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
This article had my jaw on the floor.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
This person's judging his kids so quickly.

28:18.000 --> 28:24.000
My five-year-old had a fairly smooth transition to kindergarten after only limited preschool experiences because of COVID.

28:24.000 --> 28:30.000
He seemed to have friends be well-elected by his classmates and is testing academically at about average or a little above.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
He's definitely.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Academally?

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
Let's academically.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
Like somebody named Emily or.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Sorry, continue.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Carry on.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
My therapist.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
It was your name.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Bye, hard.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Shut up, Fred.

28:56.000 --> 29:03.000
At our first quarterly conference with this teacher this week, we were pretty blindsided to hear that he's been having a tough week.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
He's been struggling to stop talking slash fidgeting when asked.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
He's disrupting the class by chatting or not keeping his hands to himself, etc.

29:10.000 --> 29:17.000
It seems like his impulse control, which I would say has been at an age-appropriate level until recently has really slipped in the classroom.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
This kid is five.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
I'm out of loss and I'm freaked out.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Is something wrong?

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
Do we need to evaluate him for something?

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
I have so many theories.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
He's been out sick with the flu.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
He's overstimulated.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
He's struggling to adjust and on and on.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
I have no idea which of these may be accurate.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
It sounds like this particular class is a tough bunch overall.

29:37.000 --> 29:44.000
I'm terrified my child is going to earn a reputation as a bad kid and worse internalize that himself.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Or worse that.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Or worse that kid.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
There were worse that kid.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
This is interesting.

29:52.000 --> 30:01.000
My mom was just telling me how no parent can objectively evaluate their own child.

30:01.000 --> 30:14.000
So the fact that this parent thinks his child is average at impulse control and about average academically might mean they've never been good at any of these things.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Yeah.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
Average isn't good, I would say.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
So I'm like descending into darkness here.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Moreally.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
4 or 4 p.m.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
We see you open in Fandango.

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
Yeah, it sucks for that kid I guess.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Yeah.

30:37.000 --> 30:43.000
When the name of a movie is cocaine bear, a bear being cocaine.

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
You can expect critics to snort.

30:47.000 --> 30:57.000
But the bonkers trailer has moviegoers salivating to see the film featuring a bear high on coke and barked on a murderous rampage.

30:57.000 --> 31:04.000
Shark NATO but for bears but on cocaine.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
And then there's that tease inspired by true events.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
This much at least is true.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
Millions of dollars worth of cocaine fell from the sky this morning in Knoxville, Tennessee.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
That did happen in 1985.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
When a drug smuggler named Andrew Thornton died in someone's backyard,

31:24.000 --> 31:30.000
when he jumped from a small plane with bricks of cocaine and a duffel bag attached to it.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
It looked like a gentleman jumped out of an airplane with a power sheet just too small for his load.

31:34.000 --> 31:45.000
Before he jumped, he apparently dumped other cocaine filled bags and a 170 pound bear was found dead among the drugs on a Georgia hillside.

31:45.000 --> 31:51.000
Officials said he, oh, deed, the movie shows the bear dining on coke.

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
The real bear died from the drugs and there was no killing spree.

31:57.000 --> 32:04.000
It's believed the stuffed bear eventually ended up in a place called the Kentucky for Kentucky Fun Mall,

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
where you can buy cocaine bear earrings.

32:08.000 --> 32:13.000
And even what they call a blow globe does not contain cocaine.

32:13.000 --> 32:19.000
A poor guy is being compared to Scarface.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Poor guy.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
Some are calling him Pablo Escobair.

32:25.000 --> 32:31.000
A nickname even a coke-dop bear might not take lying down.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Genie moats.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
CNN.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
New York.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
What do we think?

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
We sort of want about Drake giving DJ Khaled for toilets.

32:48.000 --> 32:56.000
It's the, I'm excited for cocaine bear seems really dumb.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Yeah.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
We don't have time.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Maybe next episode.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Four toilets seems like a lot though.

33:02.000 --> 33:09.000
I also, my friend really likes one of the stars of that movie.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
Alden, whatever his last name is.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
The guy that was the young Han Solo and Solo, a Star Wars story.

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
So I knew about this movie for a long time, just by the name cocaine bear.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Yeah.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
Surely this is just a strange or named movie.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
But it's, it's what it sounds like.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
I'm here.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
How would you go about giving someone four toilets?

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Right.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
You'd have to deliver them.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
Just the installation alone would cost that person over a thousand dollars.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
Would I guess it's fine?

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
I'm not like, can you tell it has themselves?

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
It's also like, you just have someone for four toilets.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
You have four extra bathroom.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
I think if you answered, if you call it, if he could.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
He doesn't call toilets.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
He'd say, yes, for sure.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
He said he'd say nothing's impossible.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
That's good.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
I gave you to be toilets and then he'd be like another one.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
And then they get all right.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Fine.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Yeah.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
I think it probably went something like Drake was like,

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
Let me get you this really special toilet board and he's like,

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
another one.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Let me get you these toilets now.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
That's too Drake.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
Yo.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Hi.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Can you evaluate that?

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
I said this is me.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
I got you a toilet.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Yeah.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
That's bad.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Yeah.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
No, man.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
I got the DJ collard impression.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Really?

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Oh, pee.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Yeah.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Really?

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
They're both bad.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
They're just like, like, you like, you like, you like, you look like.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
You're just like not to be.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Not to be a DJ collard.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
You need like, one line at the beginning of the song.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
I think you could fill in for him.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
We the best toilet.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Is that him?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Yeah.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
We the best, yeah.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
You know, I got you a toilet though.

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
Uh, welcome to Shopify RAPT.

35:06.000 --> 35:11.000
Everybody's been looking at their Spotify RAPT this week of your most listen to artists.

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
But I thought it would be interesting to do Shopify RAPT, which is a company man.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Yeah, yeah.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Grace cut that out.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
It was fine.

35:28.000 --> 35:34.000
What I need you guys to do is I need you to open your email inbox and search Shopify order.

35:34.000 --> 35:41.000
And then we're all going to go one by one and list the first five results

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
that are actual Shopify orders.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
And that'll be our Shopify RAPT.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
What do we think?

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Well, I actually have a difference.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Yeah.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I'll actually a really big note.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Okay.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
I'm going to read you.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
You can go first thing.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Yeah.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Well, first off I was going to say I don't think I'll have anything just confirmed.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
I don't.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
But what I'm actually interested in is

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
I have a white elephant party

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
that I'm going to tomorrow that I don't have a gift for.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
All right.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
So like if instead, like,

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
maybe Maria has a good gift idea for me.

36:20.000 --> 36:25.000
Well, why don't we do our Shopify RAPT because what you're describing is just a discussion that's

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
mostly unrelated.

36:27.000 --> 36:34.000
And then maybe some of our previous purchases will spark joy slash inspiration.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Sure.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
I don't have anything from Shopify.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Neither today.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Maria.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Uh, me neither.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
However,

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
what I could do is log into the

36:54.000 --> 36:59.000
headgun email for the store and just read everyone's information.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
That's ordered.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
Which is my exact point.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Like this.

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
It's not a game.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
It's just like an interesting thing to be doing.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
It's like when you're playing cards with friends,

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
but then you're talking about other shit Shopify isn't a

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
store.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
It's an e-commerce platform that other stores use.

37:21.000 --> 37:26.000
So if you say shop if just look at our recent orders.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Fine.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Let's go.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
In recent orders.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Well, you do Amazon, but that's a kind of boring.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Like a shampoo toilet paper.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Shut up.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Shut up.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
All right.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Here we go.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Sense of place wines.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
I ordered some, you know,

37:44.000 --> 37:49.000
noir online because I found this wine that I really like from Monterey County.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
That's number one.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
So sad, man.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Number two.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Oh, we're not going around in a circle.

37:56.000 --> 38:01.000
I think it's just Jeff trying to sort of brag about buying stuff online.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Yeah.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
It's just like that too.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Yeah.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
It's wild.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
It's wild.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
It's wild.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
It's wild.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Maybe that's interesting, but I just thought this would be interesting,

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
because that's what's going on in the ether right now.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Right.

38:15.000 --> 38:20.000
Spotify is not shopify.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
Got a buddy for toilets here.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Nothing that exciting.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Um,

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
I was only prepared with my shopify stuff.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Well, do your shopify stuff.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
If you look at some of it, it was funky.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Personal.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
Then don't yell at us.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
Because how are you not going to end up reading the personal stuff?

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
Uh, uh,

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Hi.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
This is good.

38:51.000 --> 38:58.000
Uh, a signed steely Dan Asia record that I got for somebody for Christmas.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
That's nice of you.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Here we go.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
A cream cable net.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Fisherman sweater.

39:06.000 --> 39:15.000
Jeff, don't you normal on a recent episode that we learn that you are limiting your spending

39:15.000 --> 39:20.000
to only necessities and the things that have been in your orders list.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
Our, uh,

39:23.000 --> 39:29.000
steely Dan record wine that you like and a fisherman sweater.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
First of all.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
And you live in LA.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
First of all,

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
I resent the implication that wine is not an necessity.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
Second of all, the steely Dan record is a gift for an important person in my life,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
who I need to impress.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
And that's not a, that's not an necessity.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
And the fisherman sweater was a birthday gift to myself.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
All right.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
Also, I didn't say I was limiting my spending to nothing.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
I don't need.

39:55.000 --> 40:00.000
I just said I was trying to rain in my expenses, which I have been doing.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
I have $10,000 in VT sex.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
What's that?

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Joel knows.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
I don't.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
It's a van yard.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
Joel.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Like Joel.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Lean back like a foot.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
Are you in full darkness?

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
What are your guys's last four online orders?

40:21.000 --> 40:26.000
I just bought your socks today.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
Um,

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Ando.

40:28.000 --> 40:34.000
Marina wool no show socks for Pat charcoal black.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I got something for you Jeff.

40:37.000 --> 40:42.000
My friend that I always go bike riding with never wears a helmet.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.000
So I bought him a helmet for his birthday to try it on.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
It didn't fit.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
So then I bought him a new helmet, which I just sent to him.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
And you have a review podcast, right?

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
So I sent him the top review for this item,

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
which is I have a big head and have problem finding helmets that fit.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
This one fits even my king sized dome.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
So I think it is pretty good looking.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Yeah.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
I don't know, man.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
I mean, I look at reviews all the time.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
I think that's pretty down the middle.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Well, it fit my friend's head.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
So that's the important thing.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Nice.

41:20.000 --> 41:25.000
Um, my Billy Razer subscription reopt.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
So that's probably the second thing that I ordered.

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
I got this cool dilly hat.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Yeah.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
Nangers.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
All right. Well, this sucked.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Let's just move on.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
Jesus man.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Listen, this is this is kind of real.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
I just thought this would be a nice way to end this episode.

42:07.000 --> 42:12.000
There's been a lot of hate speech going around yesterday.

42:12.000 --> 42:19.000
Kanye said that Hitler had a lot of good things about him and merit.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
And that Naziism isn't bad.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
So I thought we could instead of spreading hate speech,

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
which I don't like the show spreads hate speech,

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
which spreads hate mostly towards me.

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
Uh, but I thought we could all go around and say one thing we love about each other.

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
I'll start because I know you guys don't have anything.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
Joel, I think you're a really charismatic guy.

42:43.000 --> 42:51.000
I think that people are magnetized to your personality and smile when you're at a bar.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
Maria, when you get out of bar, I take it back.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
You're a bar, Joel.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
Fuck you.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Really into bars?

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Yeah, I think we have.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
Maria, go.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
Yeah.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
When you get into things, you get into things very deeply,

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
which resonates with me and I appreciate it about you.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
I know that if I consume a piece of media,

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
you've already have consumed it.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
And I can ask you any question about it,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
and you would know the answer to that question.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
That's pretty cool.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Interesting person.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
All right.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
It's like us.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Joel, Maria.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
You guess?

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Are you just skipping a mirror?

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Oh.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
I like that in the, oh, here's something else.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
I like that in the past couple of years.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
You kind of ramed it in content was.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
Right.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Like you're not like trying to make pilots anymore.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
You're not even really doing Jake in a mirror videos anymore,

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
which you guys like.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Started doing again and then I stopped.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
You're having less of a digital footprint is good to me.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
That's also why I'm wishing for the demise of Twitter.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
This is all a compliment.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
I'm saying I'm glad that you've very not really.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
And I'm proud of you for that.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
I think that shows a great compliment.

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
It's a compliment because I think you're realizing what your strong suits are

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
and where you maybe should disappear.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
What's that?

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
What would you say is my strong suit?

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
Uh, what was that movie where,

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
oh, a rest of development that school where it's like a blank boy,

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
like, you know, is out of sight out of mind.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
Oh, that's a millford man.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
A millford man.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Yeah.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Is never a millford man.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Ideally you're a millford man in that regard.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
This is supposed to be nice.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
But yeah.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
That's, we share that concern.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
No, I'm here.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
I think you're, uh,

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
I think you're really smart and observant of human behavior.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
And that's why you can add little isms in your comedy.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
That resonate with people.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
Making it up entirely done that.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
No.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
All right.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
Now it's, let me popcorn it over to Marika.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Um,

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
And by the way, we don't go anywhere.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
The show doesn't end unless everyone does.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
She's trying to put some positivity out there.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
Right. Right.

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
A lot of your positivity for me was that I do less and that you're proud of me.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Then you thought of an arrest development joke.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
Then you said I do stand up or something.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Marika.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
Um,

45:33.000 --> 45:38.000
Joel has been a great person to

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
Sharon office space with.

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
And it's always very,

45:45.000 --> 45:49.000
This is so badly worth it.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Uh, you're always very,

45:51.000 --> 45:56.000
like open to doing things with everyone.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
And you're always there for the free lunch,

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
which I really respect.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
Uh,

46:01.000 --> 46:07.000
and I like having you in the office.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
That's not good enough to my past.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Go on.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Oh, that was good.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Joel on King.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
Um.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
I'm.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Amir is.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Celebrating so early.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
I'm not.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
No, I, I really appreciate that you.

46:42.000 --> 46:49.000
Come to me for theater recommendations for yourself and your family.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Uh,

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
I think that's really fun.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
And I like giving those out.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
So I am.

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
I'm glad that I can view that person for you.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
Broadway expert sort of a cold compliment to yourself.

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
But I'll take it.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
I ordered wine from Monterey.

47:13.000 --> 47:18.000
Well, the, the nice aspect of it was that I recommended a show for

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
my parents to see and they liked it a lot.

47:21.000 --> 47:28.000
And they, he sent me the their response, which was very cute.

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
And that made me happy.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
Jeff is.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
I'm so bad at those kind of thing.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Um.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
No, that's all right.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
You don't know.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
No, genuinely, genuinely.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
I.

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
Really enjoy being your friend.

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
And have for the past five years or whatever.

48:01.000 --> 48:06.000
It's been great watching you grow up.

48:06.000 --> 48:12.000
How much older than me are you four years?

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
Three.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
You're 28.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
Yeah.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
Yeah.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Um.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
Thanks.

48:19.000 --> 48:25.000
But you always felt like a child that was around.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
I feel like it still do.

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
Well, it's, it's also like I was so used to being that person like the younger person in

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
friend groups because I like graduating early in stuff.

48:35.000 --> 48:42.000
So it was fun to have someone else that like took over that role.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
I'll take it.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
But genuinely.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
Uh, your, your great pal.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Thanks.

48:50.000 --> 48:55.000
This is also, by the way, just a midway point of why decided to do this.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
This, this is the ultimate way to make people uncomfortable.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
People always ask me like, what's your podcast about?

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
I'm like, it's really hard to explain.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
But it's basically like a panel show hosted by a maniac.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
And I just try to make people really uncomfortable.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
This is the most uncomfortable anyone's ever been on the show.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Let's take it over to Joel.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
You're asking us to be sincere and vulnerable.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
Let's do a mirror, actually, because I know that a mirror is going to have

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
the hardest time.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
And I don't want to end it on his sour.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
I'm here.

49:20.000 --> 49:27.000
Joel is brilliant and incredibly hardworking and talented.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
He's also a perfect personality fit.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
It seems to never get stressed out.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Always down to hang out.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Great sense of humor.

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
Can, you know, program and also do the Hedigan podcast.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
Rare to find someone who can do those things.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
He loves basketball.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
Appreciate that about him.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Always down to talk hoops.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Always down to play hoops.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
I heard it's very athletic and good at basketball.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
This is a lot.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
Marika is incredibly hardworking.

49:54.000 --> 50:00.000
You know, the backbone of Hedigan makes sure that everything runs on time never gets to,

50:00.000 --> 50:06.000
like, stressed out despite having to deal with so much shit from everybody at the company.

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
Constantly is down to make Hedigan a better place.

50:10.000 --> 50:17.000
Whether it be through live shows or make sure that like all the ads are served on time.

50:17.000 --> 50:22.000
Making sure that, you know, little things get done and huge things get done all at the same time.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
One man wrecking crew.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
And, you know, is one of the reasons.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
Probably the biggest reason that Hedigan is where it is is because of Marika.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
And we have that all on record.

50:34.000 --> 50:38.000
So, Marika, I want to, we'll all clip this out for you to send in an email to Marty,

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
demanding at least 120,000 a year.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
If you're not already thinking that.

50:44.000 --> 51:11.000
Jeff is always kind of like down to figure out like different, like, I couldn't wear what Jeff wears.

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
No way.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
It wouldn't fit for one.

51:20.000 --> 51:26.000
Yeah, but it doesn't fit him either, so.

51:26.000 --> 51:31.000
You can't rock like log socks and blunt stones.

51:31.000 --> 51:39.000
I, we both seemingly equally cannot, but Jeff is down to.

51:40.000 --> 51:48.000
Which, um, yeah, onto the jewels.

51:48.000 --> 51:55.000
By the way, if those were, you know, on TikTok, drummers will like drum to the rhythm of comedy.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Yeah.

51:57.000 --> 52:02.000
That would be too perfectly executed jazz drumming solos.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
And then like a toddler learning the tambourine bad.

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
There's a ways of events for good to everybody.

52:10.000 --> 52:16.000
How quickly and effortlessly they came for Joel and Marika, and then for me, you stumbled into it.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
Well, I do.

52:17.000 --> 52:26.000
I do also feel like a mirror is in a position where he has to evaluate employees in that sort of way.

52:26.000 --> 52:31.000
And like, you're not really fully an employee, so he doesn't really have to do that with you.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
Right.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
Oh, yeah.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
He was like, he was like prepared for us.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Hmm.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
Joel.

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
I'll start Marika, so I think that's the easiest.

52:44.000 --> 52:51.000
You know, Marika is great at meeting people where they are.

52:51.000 --> 52:59.000
Feel like, like, the, when there's, you sort of, you always know that she has your back.

52:59.000 --> 53:11.000
Like, in the office, I feel like if there's like a gym moment, writing to sort of look at someone and like, we both know like that was funny or weird.

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
Marika's like the person for that.

53:14.000 --> 53:21.000
And just has a kind and understanding heart and is always great to be around.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
Thanks, Joel.

53:24.000 --> 53:34.000
I mean, I guess it's cool that you're the boss, but you don't really act like it as in.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
You act like one of the responsibilities.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Good, or bad.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
Yeah.

53:40.000 --> 53:47.000
Like, you're sort of very down to hanging out with all of us underlings.

53:48.000 --> 54:00.000
Whether it's shooting hoops, talking hoops, just being yourself cracking the same jokes that we hear on here all the time.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Whether good or not.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
Classic.

54:05.000 --> 54:13.000
And then Jeffrey, you know, it's interesting hanging out with Jeffrey.

54:13.000 --> 54:20.000
I think you, I think Jeff is actually a very, uh, we usually stop around the 50 minute mark.

54:20.000 --> 54:39.000
That was a hit dumb original.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
You

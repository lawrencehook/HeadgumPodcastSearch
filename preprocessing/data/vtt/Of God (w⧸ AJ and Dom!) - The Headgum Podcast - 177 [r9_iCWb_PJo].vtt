00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Man, these cats are cooking.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
What was that?

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Man, those cats were cooking.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
That was just Maria.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Oh, who's Maria?

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
AJ knows Maria.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
I did, Maria, where is she?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
She's in New York.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Do you think she was going to be on this episode?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
You said that was just Maria.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Oh, no, that Maria could have did the theme song.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Oh, Maria is just somebody who works here.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Oh, I think I met her. She had a suitcase on the way out.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
What?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Dude, yeah, she was like, I was waiting outside.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
I don't know that she was here. I want to send goodbye.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
She left before she was gone before you got here.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
But like, by five minutes.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yeah.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
What the fuck?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Yeah.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
We met, we exchanged words.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
We exchanged blows.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Yeah.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
It was mostly heard just kick at my ass in the parking lot for a full 45 before you got here.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
People don't know who y'all are.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
People have clicked on the link.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
They're like, what the fuck wears a mirror?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Yeah.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
You're starting at an at negative.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Yeah.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
People are not excited to see your face.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Unless they know you from internet or boyfriend unless they know you from boyhead.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Yeah.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
So, let me, I'll give you guys a chance to introduce yourself.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
And I'll introduce you.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
I will start by because one of your songs I've played on this show for years.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
So...

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Fuck.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
You fucking stalker with those words.

01:42.000 --> 01:59.000
That song has been a song the soundboard for years until very recently.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
I guess because the soundboard that I used just took it off, it's not on my uploaded.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
That's all good.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Yeah.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
But I understand.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
That was all you.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
That was all.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Yeah.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
The internet boyfriend.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
I was going to say that that soundboard.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
They just don't want to see me win.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
You know?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
What was that?

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
That was when your body rejects a piercing.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Yeah.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
The soundboard is attacking you.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
Like a cancer.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Y'all are two of my closest musician friends.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Other songs, McCall songs, list them all.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
And you know what?

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
This show has sort of included a lot of musical bits over the years, especially this year.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
We'll get to it later.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
But y'all also both continuously release music.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
And I wanted to bring you guys on so that you could plug this shit.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
But not with that, putting y'all through the ringer.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Not without pushing you into the deep end of what this show is.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Dom was saying that he doesn't listen to the show.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I don't think he listens to the show anymore either.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
I listen sometimes.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Sometimes.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Sometimes.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Sometimes.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
You know how often I listen to your new EP?

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
I know it's coming.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
On the daily.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
My ringback tone is lighter.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
So I mean, how fucked up is that?

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
What is a ringback tone?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
It's where you call someone else.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
And it plays a song towards you.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Whoa.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I didn't know you could do that.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Um...

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
We're going to start things off with our...

03:29.000 --> 03:37.000
Fond of the week.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Daniel Craig is out as 007.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
What?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
So every week until the next James is cast,

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
we're lobbing up our choice for the next 00.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Um, this week my pick is Tom Clancy.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Oh.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Do you want to offer this Tom Clancy?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
The author.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Tom Clancy would like every dad's favorite books.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Exactly right.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
At least of the like early thoughts.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yes.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
He's the thing.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Tom Clancy used to be...

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
What's that?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
What is he writing about?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Sorry.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Did I come into the studio when you were recording your last EP?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Oh.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
And did I say, right before you're going to do a vocal take on my vocal?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Wait, you know Tom Clancy?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
I didn't do that to you.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Right?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
That's so valid.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
No.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
That's awful if you did it.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
But my life.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Um...

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Tom Clancy because instead of James Bond,

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
it could be claims Tom.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Because...

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
And I don't know if you knew this, Tom.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
But Tom Clancy used to be an insurance adjuster.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Whoa.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
You know that the insurance adjuster, too.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Um...

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Double a seven pipe line.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
And then...

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
What was that?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
It sounds like you choking.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Yeah.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
That was...

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Since someone else who works then I work choking.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Who is it?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Should we applaud this?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Or should we...

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Should we be sad?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Did they pass?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Is it Joel?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
You're okay.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Was it Joel?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Tell me if you have...

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
You know...

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Legally you have to tell me if it's Joel.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Who's Joel?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Joel done off?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
He sort of...

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
He works on the tech team here.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
All right.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
You haven't met any headguard.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Dude.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Other than Alex Burkeman, who's outside.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
We met very briefly.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Yeah.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
They seem nice.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
And when you said briefly, did you mean when you were that year in brief?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Um...

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
I'm...

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
The always in brief?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Is that true?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Box a brief?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Right now Box a brief.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Nice.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
But sometimes, dude, just the...

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Yeah.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
I think...

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Say it.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Before this podcast started Jeff was like...

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Is there anything that's off limits?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
And I was like...

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
There's like one or two things.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Um...

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
And I didn't realize that we were going to be discussing my underwear so shortly.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
And a sentence I just had to stop my...

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Or so immediately up to...

05:45.000 --> 05:55.000
I realized they also didn't give you guys any time or space to say who you are.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
I don't even...

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
I don't even...

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Uh...

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Dom's...

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Plug your stuff.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Who are you?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Who's Dom?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
AJ told me that this is like...

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
You put your guests through the ringer.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Like...

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
I wouldn't be...

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
I wouldn't have been surprised if we'd walked in and it was just like...

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
A series of saw traps.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
It's kind of about to be that.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Okay.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
I barely started.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Fantastic.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Uh...

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
My name's Dom.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I release music under the name internet boyfriend.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
I am a songwriter and singer and producer.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
And...

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Um...

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Classical singer here around town.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
And...

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
I...

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
That is...

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
That is what I do.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
That's how I...

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Uh...

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Keep the horrors at bay.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
One...

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
One song.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
If people are going to look up your spotify internet boyfriend.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
And they're going to listen to one song.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
What song?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Uh...

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Go listen to meds.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Meds is a song that we just...

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Excuse me.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
I'm pumping this mic.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Bad radio.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Uh...

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Go listen to meds.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Meds is a song that my friend Lilo and I just put out.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Um...

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
It...

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
It fucks pretty hard.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Um...

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
That's... that's the one.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
If I had to tell people like...

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Go.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Now immediately.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Listen to the rest of this.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
But...

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Yeah.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Fucker.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I mean, sorry, AJ.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Uh... my name is AJ.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I release music as boyhood with the period at the end.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Yep.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
You just made half the audience, bro.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
A boy had period on all social media.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Um...

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
And Joel and I have the same hairdresser.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Ha ha ha.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
You're a little better.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
More...

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Intertwined with headgum lore, I would say.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
Because all the headgum New York people know you and you live with Johnny Villa.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I do live with Johnny Villa, Shadow Johnny Villa.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Johnny and I have never met, but...

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
You also know Johnny.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Actually, yeah.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
I forgot about that.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
I always forgot about this.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
The week that Johnny started a headgum, he DMs me on Slack.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
And he says, you know, uh...

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Internet boyfriend.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
And I was like, yeah.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
How do you know him?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
And you guys just know each other from the Internet?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Dude, just from the Internet.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
You know, I just...

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
I just love to say dumb shit to people.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
I've never met.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
And that's how Johnny and I know each other, I think.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
So...

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Like a month or two ago.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
A friend of mine posted on his Instagram story.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Like this, like, brochure, I guess that he saw in Little Rock.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
And it said,

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Spanking children for correction is of God.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
And legal in the state of Arkansas.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Let's talk about it.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
First of all, what do you guys think about Corporal Punishment?

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Second of all, what else is of God?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
We've talked about this a lot.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
We do talk about this a lot.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Yeah.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
A lot of things are of God.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Yeah.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
So...

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
To me, let's go three things that you think are of God.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Three, two, one, go.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Printers.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Got it?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Wait, sorry, I'm just not doing right there.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
I said, say three things are of God.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
You're first to our printers and friendships.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Yeah.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Let's wrap it up.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Friendship is...

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Friendship is Godly.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
That second, though, this is a ranking

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
and the first one's printers.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Have you had a printer work?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Actually, recently.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
It's a religious experience.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
What are your hits?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
What is it?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
What is it?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
What is it?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
What do you have?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Never mind.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
You just got a printer.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
I'm a new old machine.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
You just got a printer.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
I'm a new old machine.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
You just got a printer.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
I'm a new old machine.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I'm a new old machine.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
What was the ocean?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Yes.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
The ocean is of God.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
So...

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Okay, what do you think of corporate punishment?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Yeah.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
To me, not of God, but I can be convinced.

09:28.000 --> 09:35.000
Oh, yeah.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Guys, we all live busy lives these days, right?

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
And you can't afford to waste a day stuck on the couch

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
because of what a few drinks the night before.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
And that's where zbiotics pre-alcohol comes in.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Because it's the answer we've all been looking for.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Zbiotics pre-alcohol probiotic drink

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
is the world's first genetically engineered probiotic.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
It was invented by PhD scientists to tackle rough mornings after drinking.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Now, here's how it works.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
When you drink alcohol gets converted into a toxic byproduct in the gut.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
It's this byproduct, not just dehydration.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
That's to blame for your rough next day.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
Zbiotics pre-alcohol probiotic produces an enzyme that breaks down

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
that toxic byproduct.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
So just remember to make Zbiotics pre-alcohol your first drink

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
of the night, drink responsibly, and you'll feel your best the next day.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
I just started using Zbiotics.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
I used it for a whole weekend, which obviously, you know, oftentimes

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
and includes a few drinks, and it includes a few drinks on Friday, Saturday,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
and then again on a Halloween.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
And I got to say that my experience with it was pretty impressive.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
I didn't drink responsibly, and I did notice a difference the next day.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Even after a night of, you know, costumed drinking,

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
I feel like now I can confidently plan on doing that.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
As long as Zbiotics is the first drink, and still saving the next day,

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
and being productive the next day, and, you know, waking up and not feeling like

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
I'm going to stay in bed the whole day, which really does bother me when that

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
does happen.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Thanksgiving's right around the corner, speaking of holidays.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
So make sure that you stock up on Zbiotics pre-alcohol probiotic,

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
because there's a lot of drinking around the holidays, guys.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
All right, this is the perfect time to pick up Zbiotics.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah, New Year's Eve.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
These are all very, and by worthy holidays.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
So why not save your next day?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
The Wednesday before Thanksgiving, everybody goes to their hometown,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
goes out, gets drunk, and then has to wake up and eat bird.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Have some Zbiotics.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
See how it works for you, because it has worked for me,

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
and I can't recommend it enough.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
And we're back.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
So you're three were...

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Prentice friendship, the ocean.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Prentice friendship in the ocean.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I'm three things that are of God.

12:12.000 --> 12:19.000
I'm going to say the guitar solo at the end of why you want to treat me so bad,

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
by Prentice is the most godly thing I know.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Godly or of God?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Of God, godly, you know.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Different.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Fuck.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Then I have to change my answer.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
Would you say spanking children for the correction in the state of Arkansas?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
In the state of Arkansas?

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
Man, I don't want to touch that yet.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Because I'm still trying a product of little rock,

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Coralville punishment, though.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
The Clintons?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Yeah, I don't think from a little rock or something?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Hillary and Bill.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
I think just Bill, maybe.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Just Bill.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
I feel like they're talking about rock.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Who got for the fuck?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
That's a man who got spanked.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Well, I'm Bill Clinton, and I, you know.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
That's my Bill Clinton.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
They spanked his ass until he was a president.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Yeah.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
No, his bottom was still sore when he sat down in the middle office.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Straight.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Oh.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
We have to take another break.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
We have to take another break.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
We have to take another break.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Are you a millennial of Mrs. What Life was like in the 2000s?

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
Have you had a hard time finding new or curated music?

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
Are you interested in multiple perspectives on relationships dating and music?

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
Then you're going to love see the thing is a podcast hosted by Grammy Award

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
Winning R&B Artist, Bridget Kelly, and Media Personality and podcast trailblazer,

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Mandy B.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
Twice a week, Bridget and Mandy have nostalgic conversations in their grown segments, political

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
pop culture conversations in their honest segments, and relationships slash hot take conversations

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
in the slightly toxic segments.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
The opinions on the show are real and brought to you by the genuine connections that the ladies

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
have with the guests that they like to call their friends with benefits.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
Each week you'll leave with some new music recommendations or a curated playlist that you

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
didn't even know you needed in their freshly squeezed music segment.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
Most recently the ladies have sat down with Remi Ma, Van Lathen, and Robert Glasspur.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
So, star power for sure, and I would highly recommend you guys go follow and subscribe.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
To see the thing is on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, or on YouTube.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.000
New audio episodes drop every Tuesday and Friday, and visuals are available on YouTube Wednesdays

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
and Saturdays.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
When we take a break does that mean that, um...

14:28.000 --> 14:35.000
I mean, that we read as in between.

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
Oh yeah, but like, oh, but this is like, so short segments.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
It's amazing.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Not segments yet.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
This is just the wax portion where we just kind of talk.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Exactly.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Well, I mean, not exactly.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Seconds of time.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
No.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Not exactly.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Egg is on your face.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
Dude, I did come in here after Malika was like, you can go inside.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I was just sitting outside eating a bagel.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
And it was not until after we had a full interaction where I was like, oh, wow.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Like, it's so nice to meet you, Dada Dada.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
I looked at the mirror.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I was like, yeah, there's like this much cream cheese on my face.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Mmm.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I've got three things.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
The guitar solo at the end of why you want to treat me so bad by Prince.

15:20.000 --> 15:32.000
Videos of unlikely animal friendships involving like a bird and a rodent, a reptile and an amphibian,

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
like the two, the further you get, the more close to God it is.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Sure.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
The more of God it becomes, excuse me.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
And probably the Crusades.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
No.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Moving on.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Discuss.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
A recent slate article begs the question.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Is the slow dance dead?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
What do you guys think?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
No.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
You don't think that.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Why?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
So dancing is of God.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Good.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Got it.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Yeah.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
I think slow dance.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
You can do any dance slow.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
No.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Like, this is, sorry.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Oh, my God.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Sorry.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
You're going to have to blur the bottom of this.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I've, I've destroyed the studio.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
But like, you can do any dance slow.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Like, check this out.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
We've never...

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
So dancing, not of God.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
We've never done this.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Three breaks.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
We have to take another break.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Unpresident.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
And we're back yet again.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
I didn't realize how spanking heavy this episode was going to be.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
But it's time to introduce our first segment.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Okay.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Spanked or not.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
I'm going to show you a series of celebrity photos.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
And you guys are going to tell me whether or not you think that they were spanked for correction as a child or not.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
Let's start with Dwayne Johnson, the rock himself.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Spanked or not?

17:16.000 --> 17:23.000
I think not because he's looked like he was like 300 pounds since he was so small.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Such a child.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
I also think not because like his family, like his dad was a professional wrestler.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
No.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Like, I think that's sort of environment.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Yeah.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
He's getting all his spanking out during the day.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Like, he doesn't need to come home and like do some more spanking.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Right.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
Um, you would argue maybe that his, his like metaphorical spanking was neglect.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Yes.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
On record.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Spanked or not?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
No.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
He's a billionaire.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
You think, sorry, they only spanked him with like enough money to like start whatever

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
fucking Microsoft bullshit he was doing.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
I'm sorry.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
I feel like maybe every billionaire in the world is spanked because they remember that trauma.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
This man is a live or dead right now.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
In the photo or in life.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
And like right now.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
He is alive.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Okay.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
It's a live.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Spanked or not.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Spanked.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
No.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
I think spanked.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Jeb.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Jeb.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
No.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Oh, what do we think?

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
Do we think the Bush family in general is into corporate punishment?

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Not Arkansas, Arkansas family or dynasty rather.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
But I wouldn't be surprised if Jeb was spanked.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Yeah.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Because please clap.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Gives like spanked energy.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Yeah.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I think George was not spanked.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
And the end.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
George senior and wife were like.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Yo.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
We fucked up.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Yeah.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
And we should say that you refer to all couples as.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
AJ and wife.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
What the fuck.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
This is Phil Heath.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
The like best body builder in the world right now or something.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Right now or something.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
I think.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
I think 2011 Jeff on that placard behind that.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
That's true.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
I think he's still like one of the greats.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
I believe it.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
This man looks great.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
And this man looks spanked to me.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Yeah.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
Because he was spanked and then he developed this body so that it would never happen again.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Exactly.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
AJ.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Oh, I say spanked.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Yeah.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Spanked or not.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Oh.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Is this a current pope?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Yeah.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
This is Pope Francis.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
He's more tolerant than past pope.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Correct.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Not spanked.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Holy shit.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Not spanked.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Not spanked.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
It's a big old chain.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Dude.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Spanked or not.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Spanked.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Really?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
I think so.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
I think absolutely not spanked.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Oh, my Jeff.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
You said that with a lot of tenderness in your voice.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Yeah.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
I mean, look at him.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
He's always had a good life.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
I mean, he's always had like a glimmer in his eye.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
He's never had really ran into any trouble.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
You and I ran into him on the bedford stop.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Oh, we know you weren't there.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
You told me to better think.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Yeah.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Anyway.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Oh, no.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Yeah.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Oh, no.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
It's really funny, Jeff, to be like, oh, yeah.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
The time I met him, I bumped into the celebrity.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Oh, no.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
You weren't there.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
So every, like, any time you tell this story to you.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Oh, sorry.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Yeah.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
You weren't there.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
And I thought you were fucking right.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Oh, it's right.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Freudian slip because I think this one spanked first.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Yeah.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
He's older, right?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Yeah.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Spanked.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Yeah.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Spanked or not.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Spanked or not.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Oh, no.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
What do you think, Adrian?

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
I think, no.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I think he's got too much whimsy in his heart.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Yeah.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Yeah.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
I think anybody who is that interested in the pursuit of truth was, like, that was fostered.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
And if you're spanked, you're saying that people might want to mar that truth.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Slash a logo.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
I think if Bill and I had been spanked, we might have gotten, like, um, there might be a sequel to

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Oppenheimer called Nye.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Spanked or not.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
There's no way.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
If he'd been spanked, we wouldn't have any soprano sex, smooth jazz.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
This is what I hear in my head.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
AJ.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Kenny G.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Oh, spanked or not?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
I'm saying spanked.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
I think spanked.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I think the music is coming from a place to spank.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
I think.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Ultimately.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Yeah.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Spanked or not, finally.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Maximilian Robespier.

21:22.000 --> 21:28.000
What I will say is that trauma begins trauma and he did end up guillotine a lot of people,

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
which is sort of like the spanking of the head.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
He's got a really small head.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
He's got, I honestly though, I have a soft spot for Robespier because look how thin his ankles are.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
No.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
You got thin ankles?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
I've got thin ankles.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Yeah.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
You can't tell right now because I'm wearing boots.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Ah.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Yeah.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I would, that's how I would hide that as well.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Maybe it's a small head.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Maybe he's just leaned back.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Yeah.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Yeah.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I mean, this is in monarchical France.

21:53.000 --> 21:59.000
He was like fighting for, you know, every man landowning or not to have the right to vote.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
And I feel like that equality, right?

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
It comes from a place of at one point there is a power dynamic between him and Mr. Robespier.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Comes from a place to spank.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Exactly.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Did you explain that to me?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Comes from a place to spank.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Yeah.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Did you explain that to us?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Because you think we don't know who fucking Robespier is?

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
I think a lot of the audience doesn't know who Robespier is.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
And then the people are going to be like, Jeff thinks we're a fucking idiot.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
It's fuck Jeff.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Jeff doesn't even show up and he's preparing all the time.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
This is like, everybody relax.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Jeff, I think you're doing an amazing job.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
You don't really say that.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
You really don't.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
I know I don't.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
I'm not being paid to say that.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
You can't really see his ankles in this picture as well.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
They're both kind of marred.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
They're both obscured.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Yeah.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
All right.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
But spank or, or no spank.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Yeah, spank.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
Oh, I said, um, that spank.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
You don't have to get angry because like Dom was like,

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
but spank or no spank.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Yeah.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
You're like, oh.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
I said that.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Yeah.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
He talks to me like that.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
Um, spank or no.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
What?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Spank or no.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
I spank.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Okay.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Got it.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Yeah.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
I think spank.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
I think if you're French in the past, you're spanked.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Yeah.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
I get that.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Should we just leave Robespier up on the thing?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Because if I take it off,

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
it's going to turn on to what the frame TV always turns on to,

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
which is, uh, young Turks.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Oh.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
TYT.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
I think, uh,

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Leave Robespier up there.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
I want the young Turks.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
I want the young Turks.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
TYT.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Fuck you guys.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Right?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Because I've read together.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Good show.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
This is a great show.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
It was like a TYT parody.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
I got there.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Jeff.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Let's, let's be clear.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Take a minute to sit in that.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Okay.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
I mean, we should say that that is straight off

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
of the new boyhood EP.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
I know it's coming.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
To it's an interlude.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
It's the single.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
That and a blunt.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Oh.

23:57.000 --> 24:12.000
You got the royalty free version.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
What's that?

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
What?

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
Risotto is a dish that tastes nice.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Yeah.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
Butter, broth, white, rind, spice, and rice.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
I'll congeal into a cream.

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
Some people will eat this with glee, I disagree.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
Use a walk to ensure burn char.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
I like synged rice.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Use a walk to ensure burn char.

24:43.000 --> 24:58.000
Mix with chicken beans, rabbit, and saffron.

24:58.000 --> 25:05.000
But you don't need all that.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
I would argue that's mostly meat, keep it simple.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Use a walk to ensure burn char.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Ruin your rice.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
Use a walk to ensure that's called.

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
And the syring rice goes.

25:42.000 --> 25:48.000
Rice casseroles, the dish that some make best.

25:48.000 --> 25:53.000
Most of them live in the Midwest.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
Midwesterners know how to char.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
Usually it's overcooked ham to their credit.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
They use walks to ensure burn char.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
They damage rice.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
By using walks to ensure burn rice.

26:07.000 --> 26:16.000
They do this for like 45 minutes.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
Cecilians eat R and G meat.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
So many verses.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
Crestions eat perfectly cooked rice.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
Belgian folks eat rich start.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Rich start is a ricey pie.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
I hate all that.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
I use a walk to ensure burn char.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
That's all garbage.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
Just use a walk to ensure burn char.

26:40.000 --> 26:52.000
I feel like I should elaborate.

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
Elaborate on the topic of rich start.

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
Rich start is a Belgian pie made of rice and slightly charred but it's dessert.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
It's nothing like loose rice that's called.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
I want burnt rice.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
So use a walk to ensure burn char and the scorching rice goes.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
That was hard.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
Five whole verses.

27:37.000 --> 27:42.000
Got the perfect amount.

27:42.000 --> 27:48.000
I said to AJ last week I said hey y'all should make a burnt rice parody.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
You've never heard the show at least not recently.

27:51.000 --> 27:57.000
Basically the lore is that there used to be a own a giri restaurant on the same street as the old studio called

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Ammsby.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
Ammsby closed and then during the pandemic we started singing songs.

28:01.000 --> 28:08.000
Baking puns on rice and then at a certain point it became songs about Ammsby and then songs just about

28:08.000 --> 28:14.000
Rice and then songs about ruining rice by overcooking it and charring it and scalding it, you know,

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
cauterizing grains.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Oh my god.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
It's like I'm getting excited just thinking about the back.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
Out of luck because at some point ideally in the next six months I'm going to actually release

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
a record mixed master and release and EP of all the songs we've done.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
This one is the newest iteration.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
We haven't done one for a couple months.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
So this is actually the audience is going to be excited.

28:33.000 --> 28:40.000
That was walk to ensure burnt char instead of walk on the wild side.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Yeah.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
I was wondering what that was.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
Do you guys mind if we just talked to these lyrics real quick?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
I can get some notes because y'all actually are musicians.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Yeah.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Again, boyhood and internet boyfriend.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
So there's an e-missing also if you're looking for me right now.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
We'll figure that out later.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Don't worry.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Just going to talk to these.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Rosodo is a dish that tastes nice.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Mm.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Agreed.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Butter, broth, white wine, spice and rice.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Mm.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
So far so good.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
All congeal into a cream.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Some people eat this with glee.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
I disagree.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Yeah congeal.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
What's that congeal?

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
I would argue that Rosodo is a congealed cream.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Is that fair to say?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
It's sort of like sweet and condensed.

29:19.000 --> 29:25.000
Um, as a man who knows how to make Rosodo and not much else.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
As a man.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
As a man.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
As a man.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
So as a man.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
And I'm not going to get hung up on congeal.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
But the, you know what?

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
No.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Keep going.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
The point of this is to hyper scrutinize every single syllable.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Okay.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Could it be?

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
Could it be?

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
How do you feel about Rosodo?

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Do you like it?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Do you like it?

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
I don't like Rosodo.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Why not?

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
I just think it tastes like a congealed cream of rice.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
I think you've probably had a ban.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
And I got that from your.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
There.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Which is awesome.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Yeah.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Is there what you know?

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
There you go.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
And you did.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
University through sessions.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Okay.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Now that I have that.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
I understand.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
I'm prepared to move on.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Hmm.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
Use a walk to ensure burnt char.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Speak on that part.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Yeah.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
So basic.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Thank you.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
That's where you live.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
So far so good.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
That's where you live.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
You think people are.

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
I don't think people are burning their rice on a walk before they make risotto.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
But that's the point.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Okay.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
And that's what I'll say.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Is it twist on a classic?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
This is maybe the.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Some of the best lyricism I've done.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
I really wanted to show up because each verse.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
No, it's how it's a story.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Yeah.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Yeah.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Ice or rice base dishes as we'll see.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
And the chorus is saying forget all that.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Yeah.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Just just simply take a walk.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Put rice in there and burn the shit out of it.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
Yeah.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Yeah.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
Basically like use a walk to ensure that there's burnt char all over the grains.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Does that make sense?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Yes.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Okay.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
I've arrived.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Well, not only does that make sense.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Do love it.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Well, so you're looking at kind of.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
It's five versus you're looking at five different cultures.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
The people make rice.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
And you're saying actually fuck all that.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
Don't in a walk or in the shit out of it.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Fuck the thing that you guys are doing.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
You're culturally.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Yeah.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
I like sins rice.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Sure.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Use a walk to ensure burnt char.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Okay.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Okay.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
Payaa is made up of soggy grains.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Rich too.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
Mixed with chicken beans, rabbit and saffron.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Is rabbit?

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Okay.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
He did.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
He did.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
He did.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
He did.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
He did.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
He did.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
He did.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
He did.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
He did.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
He did.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
He did.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
He did.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
He did.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
He did.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
He did.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
He did.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
He did.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
He did.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
He did.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Wow.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
How can I give up such a lie?

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
Well, I'm not a present saturation.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
People are doing that for color a lot.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Oh yeah, no way.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
You roll out your high end.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
You can sell like vB bridges.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
That's true.

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
Well, I was going to ask, would you mind if you wouldn't feel comfortable having

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
JSON mixed this episode.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
OK.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
First track on a BP mixed by JSON.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Yeah.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
I looked it up and said, Paya.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
What's in Paya?

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
And it's chicken beans, rice, rabbit, and saffron.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.600
but you're done for hours.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.240
You're on page 50.

32:15.240 --> 32:17.640
That's where you got rabbit.

32:17.640 --> 32:18.640
Yeah.

32:18.640 --> 32:21.880
I don't want to offend anybody who knows what's

32:21.880 --> 32:23.520
in Piai, I do not know.

32:23.520 --> 32:23.880
Yeah.

32:23.880 --> 32:26.120
But you don't meet all that.

32:26.120 --> 32:29.040
I would argue that's mostly meat.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.680
Meaning that's mostly not rice.

32:31.680 --> 32:33.920
That's mostly rabbit and saffron, it seems like.

32:33.920 --> 32:35.560
Yeah, you want more rice.

32:35.560 --> 32:36.520
Keep it simple.

32:36.520 --> 32:37.360
Yeah.

32:37.360 --> 32:38.200
Keep it simple.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.520
Use a walk to ensure burn rice.

32:40.520 --> 32:41.360
Yes.

32:41.760 --> 32:47.600
Ribbon your rice by using walks to ensure burnt char and the

32:47.600 --> 32:48.880
searing rice goes.

32:50.600 --> 32:51.600
That's a fair part.

32:52.240 --> 32:52.600
Yeah.

32:52.600 --> 32:57.920
I think that the commitment, you know, a good and a

32:57.920 --> 32:59.120
mediocre lyric.

32:59.120 --> 33:02.840
I'm not saying that's what this is, but a mediocre lyric

33:02.840 --> 33:05.880
can really be salvaged by an incredible performance.

33:05.880 --> 33:08.040
And I think you brought it in this.

33:08.040 --> 33:09.400
That can't come from it.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.000
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to say

33:11.000 --> 33:11.640
mediocre.

33:11.640 --> 33:15.520
I think, um, bad to be fair, Jeff, they're no words.

33:15.520 --> 33:17.240
They're not lyrics, but your performance is

33:17.240 --> 33:18.000
exceptional.

33:18.720 --> 33:20.440
It's the sound of, um,

33:21.640 --> 33:22.280
serious.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.000
It's the sound of it's the sound.

33:25.240 --> 33:26.080
It's my favorite post.

33:26.080 --> 33:28.480
It's gold and you can do it.

33:28.480 --> 33:31.400
But can I just next, sorry to interrupt, but like, I'm

33:31.400 --> 33:33.000
sure you have like dozens of IDs in the back.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.520
Had a lot, but like the sound of settling by the post

33:35.520 --> 33:38.120
of service, the sound of pretty good.

33:39.120 --> 33:41.200
You guys could have written that on the way here.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.800
Yeah, we could have.

33:43.800 --> 33:47.080
Rice casseroles, the dish that some make best.

33:47.600 --> 33:50.440
Is that a real, is rice casserole, real thing?

33:50.440 --> 33:53.720
If somebody presented me with a rice casserole, I would,

33:53.720 --> 33:56.400
I would really have to evaluate like how badly do I want

33:56.400 --> 33:57.680
this person to stay in my life.

33:57.680 --> 33:58.520
What the heck?

33:58.520 --> 33:59.520
If it's a gift.

33:59.520 --> 34:00.520
A gift is a gift.

34:00.520 --> 34:01.400
You know, you're right.

34:01.400 --> 34:02.720
I'm always grateful to be gifted.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.880
Most of them live in the Midwest.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.120
So there's a lot of casserole.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.080
I grew up in Cleveland.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.240
Yeah.

34:08.240 --> 34:10.600
There's a lot of casseroles there.

34:10.600 --> 34:11.720
Rice based.

34:11.720 --> 34:14.640
Most of them not rice based, but you know, some of them.

34:14.640 --> 34:15.640
It's just enough.

34:15.640 --> 34:19.040
So Jeff, don't you don't talk about the lyrics?

34:19.040 --> 34:20.400
No, no, no, no, no.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.080
Enough casseroles.

34:21.080 --> 34:22.920
That would have been such a funny way to be like,

34:22.920 --> 34:23.760
enough.

34:23.760 --> 34:24.560
Enough actually.

34:24.560 --> 34:25.960
Don't belittle your work like that.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.000
This is more than just as long as it's your truth.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.520
No, this is sort of, this might have to be the lead single.

34:31.520 --> 34:32.520
Yeah.

34:32.520 --> 34:33.640
This bangs.

34:33.640 --> 34:36.040
And in Westerners know how to char,

34:36.120 --> 34:40.080
usually it's overcooked ham to their credit.

34:40.080 --> 34:43.360
They use walks to ensure burnt char.

34:43.360 --> 34:45.200
Where is the rhyme?

34:45.200 --> 34:46.040
What's that?

34:46.040 --> 34:48.240
Where's the rhyme of there?

34:48.240 --> 34:49.200
It's okay if there's not one.

34:49.200 --> 34:50.200
Rice casseroles, the dish that's

34:50.200 --> 34:52.160
something best, most of them live in the Midwest.

34:52.160 --> 34:53.400
Midwest, thank you.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.040
My Westerners know how to char usually

34:55.040 --> 34:56.720
it's overcooked ham to their credit.

34:56.720 --> 34:59.760
I think that's a large intermission

34:59.760 --> 35:00.880
between best and Midwest.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.160
I was like, hold on.

35:03.160 --> 35:03.680
Cool.

35:03.680 --> 35:04.680
I'm back.

35:04.680 --> 35:05.800
I'm in the studio.

35:05.800 --> 35:08.200
My rhyme schemes are like, there's A, B, A, B,

35:08.200 --> 35:09.600
there's A, B, B for me.

35:09.600 --> 35:14.240
It's like A, Q, R, D, C, you know what I mean?

35:15.240 --> 35:16.680
I like to make people feel on edge.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.040
I got, it's working.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.040
I like that.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.520
They use walks to ensure burnt char.

35:21.520 --> 35:26.320
They damage rice by using walks to ensure that skull.

35:26.320 --> 35:27.640
Ooh.

35:27.640 --> 35:29.280
I like the use of skulled.

35:29.280 --> 35:30.120
Yeah.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.440
Sicilians eat R and Genie.

35:32.520 --> 35:36.080
Greshens eat perfectly cooked rice.

35:36.080 --> 35:38.440
See, this is the right because like the Greek,

35:38.440 --> 35:39.760
hearing all the previous lyrics.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.080
I've been in diet, yeah.

35:41.080 --> 35:43.000
My first thought is like, this man doesn't know

35:43.000 --> 35:45.320
the proleral word for like the Greek people.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.120
And then you bust out Greshens.

35:47.120 --> 35:49.640
Ha ha ha.

35:49.640 --> 35:52.640
You're saying that the lyricism involved

35:52.640 --> 35:54.680
in making the song parody.

35:54.680 --> 35:58.680
Suggest someone so dull.

35:58.680 --> 36:00.200
It's just that they wouldn't know the,

36:00.200 --> 36:01.720
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

36:01.720 --> 36:02.640
That's not what I'm saying.

36:02.640 --> 36:05.680
I'm just, I would have expected Greeks.

36:05.680 --> 36:07.680
A lot of bad candid compliments being given.

36:07.680 --> 36:08.520
Yeah.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.120
The slinging poison and poison.

36:10.120 --> 36:12.960
It's this or it's this or we just actually

36:12.960 --> 36:13.720
spank each other.

36:15.720 --> 36:18.880
Belgian folks eat rich start.

36:18.880 --> 36:20.280
This is my favorite verse because I feel like

36:20.280 --> 36:21.640
I learned something.

36:21.640 --> 36:22.640
I read it.

36:22.640 --> 36:23.960
Yeah.

36:23.960 --> 36:24.800
Agreed.

36:24.800 --> 36:28.360
There hasn't been a lot of new info in these rice

36:28.360 --> 36:31.240
parodies, but yeah, Belgian folks eat rich start.

36:31.240 --> 36:34.200
Rich start is a ricey pie.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.040
I hate all of that.

36:36.040 --> 36:36.880
Yeah.

36:36.880 --> 36:40.000
Just use a walk to ensure burnt char.

36:40.000 --> 36:40.600
Yeah.

36:40.600 --> 36:41.440
Okay.

36:41.440 --> 36:42.600
That's all garbage.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.320
Use a walk to ensure burnt char.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.800
Yeah.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.960
So I mean, I was gonna be like,

36:49.960 --> 36:51.320
so here's what rich start is,

36:51.320 --> 36:53.040
but the next verse explains it.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.520
Yes.

36:54.520 --> 36:58.000
I feel like I should elaborate.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.960
Collaborate on the topic of rich start rich start is

37:02.960 --> 37:07.160
a Belgian pie made of rice and slightly charged.

37:07.160 --> 37:11.520
So what rich start is is basically rice pudding in

37:11.520 --> 37:15.160
sort of a flaky buttery crust with like a creme brulee

37:15.160 --> 37:16.600
seer on the top, right?

37:16.600 --> 37:17.200
I don't.

37:17.200 --> 37:17.920
Yeah, I do.

37:17.920 --> 37:18.640
I have to share.

37:18.640 --> 37:19.760
No, I would.

37:19.760 --> 37:20.840
Oh.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.840
You said I would like talking about a celebrity

37:22.840 --> 37:24.040
that you would smash your past.

37:24.040 --> 37:25.040
Yeah.

37:25.040 --> 37:27.200
Well, restart as a Belgian pie made of rice and slightly

37:27.200 --> 37:28.440
charged, but it's dessert.

37:28.440 --> 37:29.600
Mm-hmm.

37:29.600 --> 37:32.800
It's nothing like loose rice that's calleds.

37:32.800 --> 37:33.960
Mm-hmm.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.360
I want burnt rice.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.120
So use a walk to ensure burnt char.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.640
And the scorching rice goes,

37:38.640 --> 37:42.200
and that's the song.

37:42.200 --> 37:47.840
Um, overall for this and for the other rice

37:47.840 --> 37:48.800
parodies that I've done.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.920
I think, really good.

37:50.920 --> 37:51.920
Yeah.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.520
I think you're doing everything that you've done.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.880
Yeah, obviously after we walked through it,

37:55.880 --> 37:57.360
I'm even more convinced.

37:57.360 --> 37:59.000
I think you told a story.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.120
I think I learned something new.

38:01.120 --> 38:04.320
I think there were five verses, but they flew by.

38:04.320 --> 38:07.920
I think the chorus is convincing.

38:07.920 --> 38:09.440
I danced along.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.320
You did different things with your voice.

38:11.320 --> 38:12.760
You kept it interesting.

38:12.760 --> 38:13.640
There was some talking.

38:13.640 --> 38:14.480
There was some singing.

38:14.480 --> 38:16.520
There was some hissing.

38:16.520 --> 38:17.360
Yeah.

38:17.360 --> 38:18.400
There shouldn't be hissing in a song.

38:18.400 --> 38:20.000
There were some parts that were pretty reptilian.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.840
It would be a surprise.

38:21.840 --> 38:25.560
And that reptile, friends with a shark.

38:25.960 --> 38:27.120
Whoa.

38:27.120 --> 38:27.960
We got there.

38:27.960 --> 38:28.320
Here we are.

38:28.320 --> 38:30.160
I've got it.

38:30.160 --> 38:32.880
Callbacks, callbacks, callbacks.

38:32.880 --> 38:34.880
Guys, we made it to the end of the episode.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.480
What the fuck is this?

38:40.880 --> 38:43.400
You want to, you want to bang out a second?

38:43.400 --> 38:45.240
What the fuck are you talking about?

38:45.240 --> 38:47.760
You, you, what's that?

38:47.760 --> 38:50.560
You want to bang out a second episode, real quick?

38:50.560 --> 38:52.680
Moona's coming in in 30 minutes.

38:52.680 --> 38:53.680
Famous.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.840
If we had a Patreon, it could be like a bone.

38:55.840 --> 38:58.440
It's backlogged after the episode.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.880
And what happens live after show.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.240
But no, you have to get the fuck out of here.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.480
That's from plugs.

39:05.480 --> 39:06.480
What do you guys have going on?

39:06.480 --> 39:07.680
What do you want to point to people towards?

39:07.680 --> 39:10.840
We've already plugged the music, but continue to plug it.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.080
I guess, probably, right?

39:12.080 --> 39:13.440
So let's start with Dom.

39:13.440 --> 39:14.440
Again.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.240
Oh, OK.

39:16.240 --> 39:17.280
Couldn't just be social media.

39:17.280 --> 39:19.280
It could be like, OK.

39:19.280 --> 39:20.960
I reckon the people find you.

39:20.960 --> 39:21.880
The people can find me.

39:21.880 --> 39:24.440
I think easiest place to probably Instagram.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.360
My app is I'm T. R.

39:26.360 --> 39:27.400
You don't think the easiest place to be.

39:27.400 --> 39:28.840
What the fuck?

39:28.840 --> 39:32.360
That's actually, I mean, you will, you can find me, like,

39:32.360 --> 39:34.800
on my, like, afternoon depression walk.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.360
Or if you're visiting AJ in New York,

39:36.360 --> 39:37.440
the easiest place to find you would be.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.440
Fuck.

39:39.440 --> 39:40.960
Yep.

39:40.960 --> 39:42.640
Yeah.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.240
You can also find Johnnyville out there.

39:44.240 --> 39:44.600
You can.

39:44.600 --> 39:45.600
You can.

39:45.600 --> 39:46.120
Fantastic.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.520
This access, both.

39:47.520 --> 39:48.320
Dom.

39:48.320 --> 39:49.960
Dom.

39:49.960 --> 39:52.480
Um, yeah, you can find me on the internet

39:52.480 --> 39:54.280
doing way too much.

39:54.280 --> 39:55.360
Instagram.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.440
My app is I. N. T. R.

39:57.440 --> 39:59.120
Net B. F.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.960
I. N. T. R. N. E. T. B. F.

40:00.960 --> 40:05.200
And we got links in the bio to Spotify, where you can hear

40:05.200 --> 40:09.200
every song I've ever made for the last half of fucking decade.

40:09.200 --> 40:11.720
My Twitch, where I'm streaming myself, making music,

40:11.720 --> 40:14.880
and playing video games with my friends.

40:14.880 --> 40:20.840
And my YouTube wears, like, which is not as important.

40:20.840 --> 40:22.360
Yeah, listen to my music, please.

40:22.360 --> 40:27.760
I'm begging you, so I'm so fucking tired.

40:27.760 --> 40:30.680
We're shit, AJ. AJ.

40:30.680 --> 40:35.040
You can find me on Instagram at Joel Man Dunnoff.

40:35.040 --> 40:38.360
Um, no, you can find me at Boyhood period.

40:38.360 --> 40:41.480
The word periods about out, because they wouldn't let me end

40:41.480 --> 40:43.600
with a symbol.

40:43.600 --> 40:46.360
You can find me on kind of wherever you listen to music,

40:46.360 --> 40:49.000
at Boyhood period, but it's just the period.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.400
It's like a dot.

40:51.440 --> 40:53.160
And I just put out an EP.

40:53.160 --> 40:54.800
It's called, I know comma.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.360
It's coming.

40:57.360 --> 41:02.200
And Jeffrey is my muse.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.080
I forgot how to say that as well.

41:04.080 --> 41:05.640
Every song I've written is also about you.

41:05.640 --> 41:06.640
Yeah.

41:06.640 --> 41:08.240
This is similar.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.640
My birthday, baby.

41:09.640 --> 41:10.640
Yeah.

41:10.640 --> 41:11.640
Oh, yeah.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.480
Let's write off on this.

41:22.240 --> 41:28.440
See, and what we could do is just write out over the credits.

41:28.440 --> 41:31.000
But instead of what we're doing is we're live listening to it.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.400
And everybody's watching us hear a song.

41:33.400 --> 41:34.400
Love you, action.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.240
Over the live.

41:35.240 --> 41:40.320
At Jeffrey James on Instagram, that's it.

41:40.320 --> 41:43.000
And let keep listening to this show and send it to your friends.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.760
Namaste.

41:44.760 --> 41:46.760
That's does, folks.

41:46.760 --> 41:52.520
Be your soul of lead by and round.

41:52.520 --> 41:57.160
Sitting me out and that's fine.

42:02.160 --> 42:08.240
You're soul of lead on your way.

42:08.240 --> 42:12.120
What does she run me down?

42:16.760 --> 42:24.760
Break down.

42:24.760 --> 42:32.600
Feel a picture like that.

42:32.600 --> 42:36.200
Wanted to change.

42:36.200 --> 42:39.200
Played down.

42:39.200 --> 42:46.200
But I don't have my fight back.

42:46.200 --> 42:47.200
Yeah.

42:47.200 --> 42:53.200
You're soul of lead on your way.

42:53.200 --> 43:02.200
And I want to stay fight my mind.

43:02.200 --> 43:07.200
You're soul of lead still in the core.

43:07.200 --> 43:17.200
These are your ways of hard to feel fine.

43:17.200 --> 43:23.200
You're soul of lead pinning me down.

43:23.200 --> 43:28.200
Sitting around and that's fine.

43:33.200 --> 43:38.200
You're soul of lead in the core.

43:38.200 --> 43:42.200
And over and over.

44:02.200 --> 44:10.200
Thank you.

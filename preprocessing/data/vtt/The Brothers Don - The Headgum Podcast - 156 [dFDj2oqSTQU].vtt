WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Maria, take it away.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Really?

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
I mean, I'm back in the hot seat.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Everyone seemed to love you as the host, right?

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
So let's just keep on going down that track.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
I'll swallow my pride, I'll swallow my feelings.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Last week, I still hosted.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I still had the outline.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You were my mouthpiece.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
And now people are giving you due credit.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Putting you through due process.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
And I'm having trial by fire without a jury.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Right?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
What am I supposed to do?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Deep better.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Really?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Yeah.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
How so?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
I don't know.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
I got a lot of compliments from people saying that last week's episode was their favorite episode

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
of the podcast ever.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Right?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
No, it's just an outline that I did.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Right?

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
Where does the part where you're swallowing your pride come in?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
You said you were going to do that.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
It doesn't really seem like that's happening right now.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
You think I'm proud right now?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
You think I'm proud to sit here and yell at everyone?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I do.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
A little bit.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Yeah.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Why?

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I don't know.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
I can feel it.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Emma, did you hear the episode last year?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Last year last week?

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Last week.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Let's start with last week and then I'll figure out if you liked the Miles Bond's

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
in your air.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I didn't hear it.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You didn't hear it either.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
I'm having an echo and all I can hear is myself.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I'm really sorry.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
This wouldn't have happened.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
This wouldn't have happened if I was hosting.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Last week you are hosting.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
No, Marieka's the fucking host now.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
That's what I've decided.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Right?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
This week is to me.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
I don't have an outline.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
This week, Marieka's taking the reins as host.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
And she has to figure out the games and shit.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
And you're just going to have to bring this on her.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Yeah.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
And honestly, that's not even how the show works to begin with.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Because in theory, you're planning every week.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
True.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Because you can be excited to hear.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
I'm theory.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
You're going to just say, hey, Marieka, you're turning to plan.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
If you think you're so good at it.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
But you didn't.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
And so now we all look dumb.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Well, I don't need someone.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Yeah.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
No, you don't.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
I don't.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
And then someone to every week be like, by the way,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
you need to come up with shit for the podcast.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
I either do or I don't.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
You don't need someone.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
But you're so basically.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
You're not quitting this.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Let's get it to you.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
I'm not quitting.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I'm just this is like a fire quitting.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
I said, you're quitting this to if I.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
And I need guidance from somebody to just do what I'm

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
quote unquote supposed to do.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Yeah.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
When I was supposed to do it in the first place.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
You're destitute to do it.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
It seems, which I don't appreciate.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
I show up to every week with a certain air.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
A certain air.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
A certain air.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
A certain air.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Sometimes joy.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Sometimes wisdom.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Sometimes Joel.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Sometimes joy.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
And sometimes soil.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
I had a dream that I pissed my pants.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Did it cause you to piss your pants?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I don't know.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
If we should get into that, obviously,

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
a little bit of personal, a little bit.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I guess your bed is right behind you.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
So if it was last night, I guess we'd be able to.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Yellow and red spin.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
I've been sort of having kidney issues.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
No, I, I did think it was time for a wax episode.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Sometimes people get mad at the segments that I do.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Sometimes get mad.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Then they also get mad when I don't prepare anything.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
So I, you know, it's been flowing for a while.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
I feel like we've had a couple of episodes.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Now it's time for an ad.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Does that make sense?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Sure.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Amid it.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Did any of you ever call you Eva Foley?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Not until right now.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
So this is kind of the first step of your life.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
And not, yeah, the inaugural Eva.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Yeah.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Succession is over.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
You guys didn't talk about it at all last week.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Okay.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Fly it out, line to follow.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Right.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
And now we get to talk about anything.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
How freeing is that?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Brah!

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Not.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I've never seen that.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
I've never seen it.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Now you're looking like a different monitor.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I'm sorry.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
I asked for 50 minutes of your guys's undivided attention.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
And I can't even understand.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
I can't even understand.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
It's in line to divide it.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Also, you didn't specify that.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Yeah.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Well, undivided, we fall.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Yes.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
United.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Well, yeah.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I guess undivided as United.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
No, you kind of got it right.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Have you ever flown undivided?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Meaning.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Right.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Because the opposite of United.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Oh.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Yeah.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
No undivided is United.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
That's a synonym for United.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
You guys aren't following.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
I'm really not undivided.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
So not divided.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Right.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Okay.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
United.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
That's true.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Right.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
That's what we've been saying.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
And you guys are.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
This is so fucked up.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Maria, let's say you're hosting this episode.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
How do you crawl everybody?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Everybody's being unruly.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
I'd say, like, I do some sort of sound effect.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
We have to move on, even though we weren't really talking about anything in the first place.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Probably not the knocking sound effect though.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Yeah.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Yeah.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
I think that would be easy.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
I could say about my hosting ability versus your hosting ability is that I took the

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
time before the recording to really set up how everyone was going to hear.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
The sound effect.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
I made sure that they were at a reasonable volume for everyone.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
No, you didn't.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
I can't.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Yeah.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
And I can.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
And I can.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
I have to do that.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Because I don't even know.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Okay.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
There you go.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Right.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
But you could have thought to download it.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
Or you could put all of your sound effects in a better sound effect.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Place.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
And what I thought you were going to say is that you could put all your sound effects

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
in a bin.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Which, like, they're not in a folder, but they aren't mine.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Right.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
It's kind of like carrying all your eggs in a basket.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Putting all your sound effects in a bin.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Well, that's what I've done with this show.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Right.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
I go to like general meat.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
What's that?

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
I go into like writing and acting general meetings.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
They don't want to work with me.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
I don't want to work with them.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
And they say, what do you do?

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
And I say, uh, mostly I host this podcast.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Maybe you've heard of it.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
And then there's like this awkward pause.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
And then they're like, what's the title of it?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
I'm like, oh, right.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Yeah.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Sorry.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
It's called the headgump podcast.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
And they have no idea what I'm talking about.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
They say headgun.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
And I'm like, no, head gum.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
And that's sort of where we're at.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Also partly.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Yeah.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I mean, I think you kind of set yourself up for that.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
By saying you've probably heard of it.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Or something to that effect.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Um.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
But you have to be confident.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
You don't know.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Of course.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
How?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
And those have been going well for you?

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Uh, they've sort of the well's run dry.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
And ultimately, I don't know if it ever was that wet.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Does that make sense?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Like, yeah.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
What do you mean you?

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
I just don't like you saying wet.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
You're the one who's sexualized it.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I was talking about a well, not a vision.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
All right.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Okay.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Move on.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Yeah.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
Um, and let's talk about dating in New York.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Are you still?

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Yeah.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
No.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
My love life took a bit of an hour earlier this year.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
But.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Really?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Oh, we're covering.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Are you heartbroken?

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Are you asking?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I was, but I'm better.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
You're recovered already.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
This was what, January?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Um.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Yeah.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
It was kind of January to March.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
No.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
I'm not recovered.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
But that seems like the polite thing to say on your face.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
So that we don't like dive into the idea of heartbreak.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I mean, if you want to.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Were you on faithful?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
No.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
Did you think about being on faithful?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
No.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
That's not really my style.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Definitely.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Me either.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
All of a sudden.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Because what you do is right now.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Holy shit.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
I'm a look.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
We're twinning.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
What's your, like, cent?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Sandalwood, mixed with theater.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Nice.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
I wonder if I was like, it's actually a citronella.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I've been dealing with a mosquito.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
Or like the guenneth palatro candle.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
That's what I was thinking.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Yeah.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Well, when we were, because we, we should say that the New York

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Office is in, it's like a floor below.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Guenneth's old digs.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
I think she often did lunch at dig.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
That's good.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Yeah.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
Um, so, but are you, are you looking to mingle or thringle?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Sure.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Yeah.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Okay.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Yeah.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Let's start throwing out phrase.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I want to take that out of the podcast.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
But getting back out there.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
But you're already out.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
But you're, like, you're okay with,

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Sorry.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Mingle and thringle.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Wringle.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Yeah.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Uh.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Are you looking to be set up?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
I can start throwing some names out there.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Uh.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I don't know.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Depends.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Maybe you throw the names out there.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
And then I'll tell you if I'm, like, going to be set up.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Do you know Emily Rikoka?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
No.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Okay.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
She went to NYU.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
She's Tish.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
That's cool.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
I should have a movie.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
I'm looking to get out there.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
So maybe we couldn't.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Yeah.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
The short.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Yeah.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
It is.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Final glitch.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Well, yeah.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Final sound effects.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
If it gets into festivals,

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
I'll do another sound mix.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
The sound is kind of shitty.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Really?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Uh.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
And you don't fear that the sound mix is sort of what

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
makes a break.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
The festival run.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Okay.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I do fear that.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
So thank you for coming.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
I absolutely do hear that.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
That's like my main fear, yeah.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
But aren't you an audio engineer?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
I mean, yes.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
You made the beginning of this podcast.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Did you know I recorded it?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
No.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
No.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Um.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Why do you get somebody ahead?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Come to mix it.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
What about fucking Peter?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
No.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
I'll ask around.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I'll put it in Slack.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Oh, speaking of Peter.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Um, one of them.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
I don't really know the people.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
I don't care to hear anything on the top subject of speaking of Peter.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Because it's not going to be entertaining or good.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
It was good for me because he said that.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
It was.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
What do you mean?

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
He said that my episode was just favorite episode of the podcast.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
And then he also said that he saw fast acts over the weekend.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
And Jason Mamo is character reminded him of you.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Because I have long hair.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
No.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
No.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
It's the energy.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
You were married to this guy.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Yes.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
I ran into Lisa Bonet twice in like a week.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Where?

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
Just sort of been 2019 to Penguin Canyon twice in the same day.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
We sort of were right in the same errands.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Okay.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
And that's that is what you thought was interesting from the whole story.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Um.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
It's just sucks because I didn't know Peter listened to the show.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Yeah.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
And it seems like his favorite episode was the one where I didn't host.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Yeah.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
That's not what exactly what I said.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Oh, that's true.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Wait.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
What'd you just say?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
The his favorite episode.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
No.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
The exact sentence you just said.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
That's exactly what I said.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Where do the day?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Said.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Exactly right.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Um.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Brad.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Let's talk about.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Marital woes in Portland.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Okay.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
How are you guys keeping it romance?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Have you read mating and captivity?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I have not read mating and captivity.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I don't think I need to.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Because things are going in your doom.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
No, because it's the first five race.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
We've been married for like seven.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I didn't know that.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Yeah.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
So don't say it.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Like I'm supposed to know.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Don't assume shit without asking shit.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Maybe if you hit me up every now and then.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
For a chat or a gab.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Or showed up when I invite you to things.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
The climbing thing.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
You're still on that.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Yeah.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I still don't remember.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
I'm going back to LA in a couple weeks, actually.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
And this time you didn't bother to tell me.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
I don't tell you.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Shit.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
You know what's man is that I had your voice in my head this morning.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
I didn't even.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
I thought you were on tomorrow's episode.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
So this wasn't even because I was thinking that I was going to see you today on zoom.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
But I had your voice being you call and Joe stood me.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
And it did make me laugh.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
That's good.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
I'm glad it's good.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
It's actually really good.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Thinking of me made you laugh.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Well.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
That was nice.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Very chill.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
I guess it's time for everybody's.

14:31.000 --> 14:39.000
Bond of the week.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I don't think you guys gave.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
First of all, Murika.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
I just want to say that you sort of butchered.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
My bond of the week last year.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Because you said.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
It was the last year.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Blue diamond.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Last week.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
It's the second time.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Yo.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
I'll cut it out.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
And I don't mean edit.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
I mean all cut it out.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Is that guy gone?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Is that guy dead?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
What's his name?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Joey?

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
You?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Oh, from Joey.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
I don't call Joey.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Yeah.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Dave Coolier.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
He said, you know that elinus Morrisett song.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
You ought to know.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Yeah.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
It's about him.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Wow.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Yeah.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Well.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
Well, I guess on the topic of shit that doesn't matter.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Murika last week.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Yeah.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
You were like Jeff Spawn of the week.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
As the CEO of Blue Diamond Growers.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Because it's time for a James Almond.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
Which is not how it was typed out or meant to be said.

15:35.000 --> 15:44.000
It was supposed to be a James Almond.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Interesting.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
Frantically searching.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Yeah.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Look.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Once once again.

15:55.000 --> 16:01.000
I just want to reiterate that you sent a PDF document of your outline.

16:01.000 --> 16:07.000
And at very clearly states, it's time for a James Almond.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Almond does not capitalize at all.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
It was capitalized.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Nothing is capitalized.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
This is crazy.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
There's no way.

16:15.000 --> 16:25.000
So the formatting changed.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Right?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
It was that I typed it out just so.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Yeah.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Yeah.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
Didn't really proof read or edit.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Yeah.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
To do it.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
That's fucking graces job editing.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Not your document.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
I all right.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
What is this cross examination?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
I'm getting the fucking third degree.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
You were giving you the third degree.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
So I turned it around on you.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
How do you like that?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
What are your guys' bonds a week?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Mind is a...

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
No, no, no, no.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Mind is a sort of a...

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
It would be like double a seven Saturday night.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
It's time for a James song.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Yeah.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Yeah.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Your classic Saturday night references because that's the only show

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
that you know because you did it in high school.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
Double a seven takes the great white way.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
Can you imagine like a chase scene that ends at the fucking Richard Rogers?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I can.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
It's kind of like that happens a lot.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
Richard Rogers theater was featured in the last John Wick movie.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
John Wick 4?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Yeah.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Maybe it was in 3.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Yeah.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
So not ultimately.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Yeah.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
James Bond a week.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Who do you have?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Pattington Bear.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
And then in this case it would be...

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Pattington Bond.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Okay.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
And then we could...

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
You just say Patting Bond and then I'll edit it so that you set it right away.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
No, I'm not going to say that because I don't want it to be that.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
No.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Because if you say Pattington Bond and then I edit it right there,

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
people are going to laugh and think that you know, you are really on it today.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Right.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
But I don't need that glory.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
And I don't want it to be Pattington Bond.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
And don't edit that into a different thing.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
It's Pattington Bear.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Emma, what do you got?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Your director sort of a casting.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Excellent.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
That way.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Let's say you're doing...

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Sorry.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Just once again.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Let's say you're doing James.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
You're directing James Bond.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Absolutely.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Who do you cast?

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
That does seem like the natural next step for me, first of all.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Second of all.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Let's fix that sound mix and then it's the next step.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
The girl in...

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Are you there? Got us, me Margaret.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
She just signed with WME.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Did you?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Really.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
I think.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Sorry.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Did you just like assume?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
You guys already did the choice.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
Did you just assume that everyone signed with WME?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
No, there was a deadline article.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Brad.

19:17.000 --> 19:23.000
I'm going to go famous Italian American scam artist Charles Ponzi.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
It's time for a James Con.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
You could still have said Bonsky.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
I thought James Con was better.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
James Con is way better.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
James Con is just a different actor.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Steve's on.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
James Con.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Yeah.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
James Bond.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Zon.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I'm going to change mine to Steve's on.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
It's always funny when people change it last minute because it just doesn't matter.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Is it funny?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I'm going to ruin it.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I mean, let's talk about the air quality.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
We got into it a little bit before we started recording.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
But I mean, is it truly...

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Are you guys having trouble breathing?

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
Are you guys basically smoking cigarettes without any reward?

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
Sure. I mean, I've been going outside with the mask that I did yesterday.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Um, stand on a roof for an hour.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Just inhaling and waiting.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Yeah.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Charming and waiting for it to take me.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
As one does it's rice.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I thought it would be funny if I took this call from outside.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
But I ultimately decided against it.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
I do think though, if it's a equivalent to smoking six cigarettes.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Yeah.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
That's not so bad.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
That's not so bad.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Yeah, you'll, that's just Saturday night.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Well, I was like, I haven't smoked enough a week.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
So actually, I think this is fine.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I think this is going to be a net neutral for me.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
That's...

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
But again, you don't get anything from it.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Like smoking a cigarette like a little bit of a buzz.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
You look really...

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
But if you...

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
That's true.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
It's true.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
I'm not going to look cool.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
Well, what's the whole, what's the whole fit?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Are you wearing like a royal tenon bombs?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Jack suit, cash, and bottoms?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
And I would advise you not to say that side.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
No, I would advise you not to say that side.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
No, I would advise you not to say that side.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
No, I would advise you not to say that side.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Yeah, then why don't you step out?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
I mean, where are you, are you in Bushwick?

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
No, I'm in East Village.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
You'll be fine.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Nobody cool.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Dresses there.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Sorry.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Nobody dresses cool there.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Really?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Do you have any in Bushwick?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Yeah.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
No.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
No.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Um...

21:36.000 --> 21:42.000
Do you guys think I would last a day and I'm square?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
No.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Scraised?

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
What do you mean no?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
I was just kind of...

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Actually, can I tell a real story about...

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Um, I'm square because I was there this weekend.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
And also I hate the named Times Square.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
But I was walking past a restaurant.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
And there was a child sitting...

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
There's a family at a like four top outside.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
And they were sitting kind of next to like a ramp up to the restaurant.

22:09.000 --> 22:17.000
And then as we approached them, there was clear that there was a child behind them lying on the ramp on a blanket.

22:17.000 --> 22:23.000
And they were literally eating fries with like not inside of the family at all.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
Like shoes blocking the entrance to the ramp.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
And ultimately the child...

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Um...

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
It was the crazy thing I've ever seen in my life.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
I don't know why...

22:33.000 --> 22:39.000
Why would you just let your child lay on the street at a restaurant?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah, I don't know.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Kind of sounds like a pie.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
This show is sponsored by BetterHelp, guys.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
How much time do you spend on you, right?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Yourself.

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
I bet it's not that much in any given week because we're always spending time on other people, right?

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
Work requirements, work relationships,

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
personal relationships, personal requirements, right?

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
It's easy to get caught up in what everyone else needs from you while neglecting yourself.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
And that's where therapy can come in, alright?

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
It's good to have set aside time to talk about what you're going through.

23:33.000 --> 23:40.000
What you need from you, what you can do to sort of cope with the week's stressors, right?

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Because when we spend all of our time giving it,

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
can leave us feeling stretched then and burnt out.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
And therapy can enter the picture and give you the tools you need to find more balance in your life.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
I'm in therapy every week.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
I just came from therapy just now in my car.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
And I'm floating.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I mean, I'm on top of the god damn world with this shit.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I don't know what else to say.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000

Thanks BetterHelp.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Fuck you guys.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
Sorry, my god, I was so, I went somewhere else.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
That's so good.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
So much dead here, man.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I'm getting a call with no color ID.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Should I answer it?

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Yeah.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Absolutely.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Hello.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
We should.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
It's clear slaughter.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Oh.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Yeah.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Is this from my 115 appointment tomorrow?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Holy shit.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Yeah.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
I'll be there.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Tons of like to me.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Thank you.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
No.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Allergies.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I've got a 115 tomorrow.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
I've got a 115 tomorrow.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Yeah.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
But yours is with destiny.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
That was just a surgeon who's doing performing at thoughts like that.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
How do you know my dentist's name?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Doctor destiny would be a dentist.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I would not give a dime to.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
What is that?

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Why?

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Doctor, it just sounds like that.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Did you ever get insurance?

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
That was really good.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Thank you.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I will say that Marieka last week.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
And why don't we, why don't we get some, why don't we set up for this?

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Why don't we set up Marieka?

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Oh, you said set up?

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
This was a sound.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I didn't even know it was on my sound.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
And I found it out.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
And I found it out.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Yeah.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
That's true.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
But we'll, we'll keep it going.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
Full steam ahead here.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
We can get Peter to sound mixed that too.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
That's also loud.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Um.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
I, I don't know what you guys expect for me, right?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
We're trying to fucking keep this thing going for another.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
I don't know.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
20 minutes.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
That's all we really need.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Were you addressing me about something?

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
I said why don't we set up.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
Because you were, your posture was looking sort of like, I don't know.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
I was worried it would be like a can.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
But you were, you were like, another thing that Marieka did.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
Oh, was that you played that sound last week?

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
And I didn't even know that was on my sound board.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Uh.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Well.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Um.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Let's just go through some fucking news of the day.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Right?

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
That's what we do in the second day.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
What do you mean, Jesus?

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
I'm trying to fucking keep this thing going for.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
You know what?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Anything else to talk about?

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
What about the fact you were out of town for like three weeks?

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
Or I was in Kentucky for three weeks.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Was it actually three weeks?

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Yeah.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
It was almost four weeks.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
It nailed that.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Well.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Yeah.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
And you set on Instagram that a snake almost paid you?

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Yeah.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
So a black racer snake, nonvenomists.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Yeah.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
So you don't worry.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
But it nipped at my ankles on a trail.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I was getting my steps in Brad's style.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
And then it ended up being like some leaves rustling, you know, to my three o'clock.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
Um, to use Brad terms.

27:30.000 --> 27:35.000
And uh, I just like, this like fucking rope looking thing just comes at my fucking

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
ankles.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
That's thin ankles.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
And um, it didn't nick me.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
But it was addictive to me.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
It hissed.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
And I was pissed.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
And uh, it was ultimately all fine.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
But I was like, I gotta get the hell out of Kentucky.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
There's snakes in California too, right?

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Much more venomous than California.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Yeah.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Yeah.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Right.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
So three weeks.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
You haven't been getting any meat in this.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Yeah.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Sorry.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
I'm just trying.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
Oh, Chris, Chris, you entered the president's race.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
What do you guys think?

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
Uh, I think he's going to lose.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Bad.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
When though.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
And we all know who'll lose.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
But when.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
I mean, he'll probably drop out after like the first debate.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Maybe the second.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Okay.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
So per the cut is the headline.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
What if you weren't scared of your kid being fat?

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
It's not going to be me.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Hey.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
He's scared of you.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Scared of that.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Hold on.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
I smell gas in my apartment.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
I just want to see something light a match.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I want to see something.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Per.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Per billboard.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Gen Z isn't drinking.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
And clubs aren't happy.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
I saw that headline actually.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
How about you don't read the news when you're going to be on the show?

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
I found out I was going to be on the show yesterday.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Right.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
And that headline was from last night.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
I don't think it was.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Um.

29:04.000 --> 29:11.000
Hmm.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
If anyone was wondering, I, it wasn't my stove.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
So if I keel over.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
Um, from natural gas inhalation.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Please don't.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
We need to think of me fondly.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Bondly.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Not good.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Um.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
It can be brownly.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
That's really good.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
I kind of got his hair.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
That's good.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
It's time for a Marieka Brown.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Oh.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
Guys, I don't know what more to do.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
I feel like I'm coming here or the ton of energy.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
It's not being matched.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Brad.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
This is going to be start of the episode.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
And seconds of silence.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
And you said.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
I'm taking phone calls on the show.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
You told me to answer.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
And she's like, should I step outside and my adidas?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
And then Brad is fucking.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Exactly.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
The problem.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Okay.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Brad is fucking looking at other monitors.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Thinking about his wife.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
And how good their fucking union is.

30:19.000 --> 30:24.000
How fucking did undivided they are?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Uh-huh.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Which is the same as United.

30:27.000 --> 30:34.000
Marieka can't handle the show to the extent that she's inhaling CEO.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
Nice.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
I don't know, man.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Like, what do you want to do?

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Do you want to say another song?

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Station.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
I want to screw you.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
You want to talk about something.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Right?

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Let's not do that.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
What do you mean?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Because it's not.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Extra-station live going.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
It's great.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
It's awesome.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Hitting numbers that you thought they might.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
I didn't know that.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Exciting.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Exciting.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Exciting.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Expectations.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
And also the bar was pretty low.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
But they pushed past it.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
And also shattered the glass ceiling.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
I guess we could say that we have had gum.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
Happy hour show being hosted by

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Exploration Life.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Coming up.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
And that's June.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
July.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
July.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
July 17th.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
That's what I was going to say.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
July 17th.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Monday night.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Come through.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Caviot.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
New York.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Yeah.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
Not a very good night.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
To have a show.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Well, that's what you think in LA.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
But Monday could be a different story.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
I don't know.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
That's true.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
In beer news.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Popular food truck.

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
Massive sausage company is taking over the Lemessa.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
Lemessa beer pub in San Diego.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
Just from like the San Diego Chronicle or something.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Yeah.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
It's going to San Diego Eagle.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Yeah.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Okay.

31:53.000 --> 31:59.000
What do you guys excited about in your lives?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
All right.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
Like, can you guys not pick up on the synergy that I'm like pushing through,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
trudging through the sand?

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
I'm excited about a lot.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I have a busy ass summer plan.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
So what are you doing this summer?

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
By the way, you don't have to wait till you're prompted to share.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
That's my height.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Literally just started sharing.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
I think I got it.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
What are you excited about?

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
With the direction for me.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Let me just talk about what I'm excited about.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Man.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Let's hear it.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Let's hear it.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
I'm going to squamish.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Meaning.

32:28.000 --> 32:33.000
It's a town in British Columbia, north of Vancouver.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
For my birthday on the 4th of July.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
We're going to go rock climbing.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
We're going to climb a thing called the chief.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
Uh-huh.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
It's big.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Yeah.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
You're just looking outside.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Going to some concerts.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Going to see big kids.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
Going to see golf, babe.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
The golf, babe, babe.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
Going to Iceland for two weeks.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
What are you going to do in Iceland?

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
We're renting a van.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
We're going to drive around the whole country.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Bring road.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
We're going to go climb.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
We're bringing all of our rock ice.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
No.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Rock.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Iceland climb.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Iceland climb.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Yeah.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
We're going to see puffins.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Some cute little puffins.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
Are you going to see Amber Ruffin?

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
Don't know who that is, but maybe.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Do you just burp?

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
No, that was a gasp.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
You don't know who Amber Ruffin is.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Okay.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
But yeah, busy summer.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
My band.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
We're trying to play a show this summer.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Our first show.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Original songs.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Yeah.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Why didn't you ever play a song on the show?

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
I'm actually working on the rice one.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
The Blink 182.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Yeah.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Yeah.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
That's cool.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
So you didn't hear last week's episode?

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
So you didn't hear rice burn.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
I heard it.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
That was good.

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
Is it a different take on the rhythm of the rice?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Say that.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Rico, what was that?

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
I said, do you could say that?

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Yeah, but you said it in a way that like,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I felt like you were really working up the courage to say it.

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
And then you look immediately self-conscious.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Like, I'm going to just.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Splice it in right here.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
Rice it in right here.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
This sucks.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
This episode sucks.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
This might have to be worst episode ever three.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
I think it's going fine.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
Yeah, but that's the attitude that's making it go bad.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Is that everyone's like, yeah, it's fine.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
But I'm like, you're not adding anything.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Right?

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
Well, if you wanted me to host, I would have had to have a different recording set up.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
So I could do the soundboard.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
I didn't actually want you to host.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
I just wanted you to feel bad about the fact that you were last week.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
About the fact.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
I was crushing it again.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
What I, okay, you did well.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
But we have to acknowledge the outline.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
And that's what, that's the grudge I've been holding against everyone here.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
For the past 40 minutes.

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
I think the outline really didn't help that much.

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
The outline's the only reason it lasted for 50 minutes.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
The outline was everything.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Rice brewing?

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Right?

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Yeah.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
I mean, I was like, answering the same questions as Donald Trump

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
from his CNN down all a month prior.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
That didn't go well at all.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
Because he didn't give any questions.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
It was just kind of like a document.

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
But you don't feel like I was a little bit responsible for the omniscience of me.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
Well, I saw a decent amount of comments that were like the worst part of the episode

35:38.000 --> 35:43.000
was like the 30 something minute mark to the 30 something minute mark.

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
And when you clicked on it, it was using Rice brewing.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
So I think people kind of sourd when your voice appeared.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
We felt comfort in it.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
And Casey said it was like that.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Your phone's a try.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Yeah.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
I guess so.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Yeah.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Yeah.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
How does that make you feel?

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Do you guys like get a different hourly rate?

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
Like, do you guys get like a pay bump if you do the show?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Because I just feel like not enough.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
People say yes to doing it.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
And they look like they'd rather be anywhere else.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
And I'm pretty sure all three of you guys are salary employees.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
So you're not making any extra money doing this.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Why do it?

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
If you're going to come up and show up with the sour.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Well, sometimes it's fun.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
And not today.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Sorry, you're saying.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I like the segments.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
You like when I have segments prepared.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Yeah.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
I mean, and also like at the very least,

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
we could have stuck to the segments,

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
but made them up.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
That's what you went along.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Okay.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
So what should we do?

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
What segments should we do?

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Because I thought about rickles or

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Henry Don edition.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
I love that.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
What's that?

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Um, all right.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
This is an on the spot.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Or should I say, don the spot?

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
That's really good.

37:16.000 --> 37:26.000
Um, a man with a briefcase can steal millions more than any man with a gun.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
Rickles are Henley.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
I want to go Henley.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
Correct.

37:34.000 --> 37:39.000
I'm not on any crusade.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
Rickles.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
That was Henley.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Tough.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
You know what's funny to me?

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Attitude.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Henley.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
That was rickles.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
Mereka's exactly right.

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
The Eagles and the critics were not the best of friends.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Rickles.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Correct.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Yeah.

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
All these brandy quote things from rickles is just bashing the Eagles.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Oh, this is kind of topical.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
I'm a New Yorker originally.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
I was raised in.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
That's where Marie goes.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
All right.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Don't.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
I think they're from Texas.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
That's cool.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
Um, playing the drums hurts my back.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
I'm going to say rickles again.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Henley.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
That's exactly right.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Um,

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Lost suits should not.

38:50.000 --> 39:04.000
You'd be used to destroy a viable and independent distribution system.

39:04.000 --> 39:12.000
Why aren't you guys like cracking up?

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
That was Emily.

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
Um,

39:18.000 --> 39:23.000
Italians are fantastic people, really.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Oh, God.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Rickles Johnson.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Don Johnson.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Correct.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Rickles.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Um.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
Sox.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
Jeff, what is your bag say?

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
I.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
If I say what it says, it doxes me.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
Didn't say where I mean.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Weep it.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
I mean.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
It's just.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Something.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Something.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Something.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Something.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Something.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Also said.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
At least a million times.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
That was rickles.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
Or Henley.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
Don addition.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
I think that's a hit.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
I think that's the whole fucking ship from sinking.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Sure.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Can I ask?

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Sure.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Here's I have a question.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Yeah.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
More like a thought experiment.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Or just like something to pause it.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
But what do we think the next.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Um,

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
Statement tote is going to be.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
From me.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
It's from.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Or you mean in the world?

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
In general.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
Right now it's what?

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Because it was LL being.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
And then it was Trader Joe's and then now it.

40:35.000 --> 40:40.000
Uh, well, it was like the New Yorker one for a while.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
Yeah.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
About that.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
I feel like.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
And then also like outdoor voices.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
The tote bag that you go and you.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Buy their their clothes.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Was that true.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
And he thoughts.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
Not a big tote guy.

40:58.000 --> 41:03.000
Doesn't carry that.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
A backpack.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
Usually.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
It's cool.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
And you have like a car.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
So you're going to spy groceries and put them.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
Well, I do.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
I do use a toe when I go grocery shopping.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Cartier.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
A Cartier toe.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Yeah.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
I think Cartier is going to start bagging jewels in hemp.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
And then people are going to start like state.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Holy shit.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Look how much money I have.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
You know, he went to he didn't go to Jared.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
He went to Cartier.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
And also I have this like bag made of straw.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
Plugs.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
What do you guys got?

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
What do you want to point the people towards?

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Uh, the floor is yours.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Let's go.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Emma Brad.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Me.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
And then if we have time, we'll go.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Maria.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
You can follow me on Instagram at Emma Rose.

41:54.000 --> 42:00.000
And the poison coming somewhere sometime pending the sound mix.

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
Thank you, Jeff.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I have been meeting to ask.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
Is that about me?

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
When I say your name is it about you?

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
No, the movie.

42:15.000 --> 42:21.000
Um, the poster tagline being like that Jeff is poison.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
No, it's not about you.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
But if you want to see it, I'll send it to your wife.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
You can tell me if it resonates.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Maybe it is about you.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Brad.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Brad the human on Instagram.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
If you live in or around Portland.

42:38.000 --> 42:43.000
I may or may not be playing a show somewhere at some point this summer.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
So not a good plug.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
We'll just have you back on the week before you're about to have a show.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
How about that?

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
Sure.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
But you were going before me.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
Um, at Jeffrey James on Instagram, but I don't post that often.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
So it doesn't matter.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
That was like a decent amount.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Once a month.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
That's not where I go on.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
On Twitter and Instagram and letter box.

43:03.000 --> 43:09.000
Also come to a come happy hour at caveat in New York City.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
On Monday, July 17th.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
It's going to be a lot fun.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
Line up is really great.

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
Joe Firestone, Celeste M, Conor Atlas.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Yes.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Mike Bruce Cane.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
Huge.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Still exciting.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Don Rickles.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Don Henley.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
On the drum.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
The brothers.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
Don.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
On the drums.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Throwing out his back.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
On the drums.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
Throwing out his back.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
On the other.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
Um.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
And we'll see you guys again next week.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
We're going to be in studio tomorrow for next week's episode.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
So hopefully the energy is a little bit less poison.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
Um.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
And Rick, are you on top of everyone?

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
No.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Okay.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
I wasn't invited.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
And I'm not in LA.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
And also, I'm going to tell everyone a poison.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
The energy.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
And you.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Live on air.

43:57.000 --> 44:16.000
That was a hit dumb original.

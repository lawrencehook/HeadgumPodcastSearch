00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Yeah.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
No.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
No.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
First in thought.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
F**k.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
F**k.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
No.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
You got it, you got it.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
F**k.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
There you go.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Delay on the button.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
That should be instant.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Yeah.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
First new New York studio in studio episode of that gum podcast.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
You got it right this time.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Good job.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
And Johnny Villa bringing up the rear.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
How are we feeling?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
It's Thursday morning.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
It's 11, actually.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Oh, make a wish.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
What's your wish?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
I can't.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
But this hour goes by as if we were five minutes.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Yeah.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
I feel like the onus is already extremely on me.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
And I'm not appreciative of it.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Meaning?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Meaning.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Let's f**king get the energy up.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
I mean, you wrangled us in here 11 in the warning.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
English really loud.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
I was like, I mean, coffee.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
But okay.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
That's true.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
And that is because Kayla's, I think, has food poisoning.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Do you think it's something?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
And is it?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
She got, do you think she got it on her birthday?

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I hope not.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
But maybe.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
I mean, I have a stomach bug right now.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
But he doesn't see me complaining.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
You keep leaving the throat.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
I feel too good.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
What's her birthday on Monday or Tuesday?

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Her birthday was Monday.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Because some people wish her birthday on Tuesday.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I was like, let's slip a belated in there.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Yeah.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
You didn't get it.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
So it was Angie's day at that point.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
That's true.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
I didn't wish Angie.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Yeah.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Have your birthday.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
It's never too late.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
And you can just talk about that in some time.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
So you slip a belated.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
You're fine.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
A belated.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Right.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
What do you think the rudest amount after a birthday to wish someone a birthday is?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
I think actually a day after.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Really?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
I think the day before.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Like the day before, but you don't say happy early birthday.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Yeah.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
But then at least like you're showing excitement.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
And you know approximately when it is.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
I mean, unless you say it with a bunch of ways.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
With a bunch of what?

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Like you meant M.A.L.A.Y.S.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I only want to mean.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
That's a fallen poor joke.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
I know all of our Malaysian listeners.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Oh.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
We know you're out there.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Yeah.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
It goes New York, Toronto, Coala, and poor.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
I feel like day before is actually better than day after because day before means that you think you nailed it.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
And nobody reminded you.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
You just know that that's when someone's birthday is day after.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
You're only wishing them happy birthday because you saw everyone else wishing them happy birthday.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
You didn't remember.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
If I have to say it late, I usually say I'm sorry.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm late to the party.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
That's really good.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
That's really good.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
I say fuck fuck fuck.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
I'm so sorry.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I'm such a bad friend.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
And then it kind of becomes about me.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Yeah.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Well that's nice.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yesterday was my friend's birthday.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
And I couldn't.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
I wasn't 100% sure it was her birthday.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Usually it popped up in my calendar.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
And I was like, I'm going to confirm on some social media.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
But I couldn't find it.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
So I texted happy birthday.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
And then a bunch of exclamation points.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Two question marks and the more exclamation points.

03:57.000 --> 04:04.000
So kind of either been like, I was asking or I accidentally hit the question mark twice.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
But that's her birthday.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
But that's her birthday.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
That's over thinking.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Never heard of that.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
I mean, I made it.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
I think it worked well.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
It looked like my point of view of Marie.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Right now is this.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Mike arm is over your eyes.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
And it looks like you're doing an anonymous talk.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Like he used to be in drug trafficking.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
A second ago when you put your glasses on your forehead.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
That's all I could see.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
It looked like you were doing a bit.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Yeah.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
We're in New York City.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Some might call it New Jack Shitty.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Who called it Jack?

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
I was typing into kayak.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
My flight information on this book.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
It's not a Mario Kart track.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
New Jack Shitty.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
I don't think so.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
New Jack City though.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Something like that.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I think it is New Jack City.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
It would be incorrect.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
I don't get it.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
The chances of me being right and you being wrong are always so slim to mine.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
No, I was telling Johnny on the walk in.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Patrick, I don't know if you feel this way, but New York sort of has a certain energy to it.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
He's been saying this literally every moment he can.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
You want to move here so bad.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
I honestly, I'm like on the verge of tears as they walk through this.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
And it's like arguably a bad day out.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah, but it's like gloomy.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
It's going to rain soon.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
It's been scholarly in Los Angeles though until like seven days ago.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
So just to be able to wear this specific sweater, which is actually the article of clothing,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I've owned for the longest time.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Wow.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Whoa.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
You can use four of the longest, yeah, jumper.

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
I'm going to shed blustery and all I can think of now is Jeffrey James and the blustery day.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Like when you look through the style.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
My bottom was.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I'm the lowest.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Just a skirt.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
We've got malaise and bluster out of English so far.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Great.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
How long have you owned that sweater?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Eight years.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Wow.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
That is a long time.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Yeah.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
My school growing up had a uniform.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
So I didn't really own a lot of clothes other than, like,

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
khakis, slacks.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Yeah.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
New Jack City is a movie.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I made an error.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
How did you do a numbers go?

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
You look at a number screen on a movie title.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
No.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
It really does have a certain as you want to be about it.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
It has a as unicyc law.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
And I really do want to move here.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
It's it's hard to be here at this point.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Because the last time I was here, I was living here.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Oh, I didn't know.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
I didn't know you would talk here before.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
It only for a month.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Yeah.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Oh, okay.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Okay.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Yeah.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
People still have property in LA.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
That has a property.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
We've had property.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
I wouldn't be doing this show.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
I rented something for a bit.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Yeah.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
You could close.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
I don't know.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
That's property.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Personal items.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Yeah.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
I had a flu.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Champagne or otherwise.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
I guess it's.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
Contraval and Bach of the week.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Daniel Craig lives in Woodstock.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I wonder if I joined him.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
He was on Woodstock.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
I didn't know that.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
He does.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
He lives in Ulster County to be sure.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Woodstock.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Oh.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Onya ran into him up state one time.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
That's ran into him.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
That's where you say about someone you know.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Well, like.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
I think she was working in a store and he came in to buy something.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
And then she realized it was Daniel Craig.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Do we know this while ago?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
I don't know.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
I think I asked her that exact question and she didn't have an answer.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
We'll have to.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
We'll have to double gin loafers.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I loved it.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
I think it was a house.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I think it was a housing store.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
What does that mean?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
How was it?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
He just buy a house.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
How was it?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
How was it?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
A blow of asking.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
My bond of the week this week is.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
So, sozy bacon.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Who is that?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Who's that?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
She's the star of Smile.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Have you guys seen that movie?

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
I'm not going to watch.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
I really do not think that she in the show.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Please like me.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
I think so.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
It's my favorite.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
One of my favorite TV shows.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
It's great in it.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Sozy bacon.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
A cause she's a great actor.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
And B because then it would be bacon and broccoli.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
We were talking about this last night.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
That the producer of the bond movies is Barbara Broccoli.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Which is maybe the best name I've heard since English preview.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
And one of the original people of bond.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
You said that we're out broccoli.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Yeah.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Anyone else have any bonds of the week?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Um.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
You mean like Colin Farrell?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Why?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I just like him.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Sanford edgy bod.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Yeah.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
He has an earring.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Yeah.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Yeah.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Colin mockery.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
That would be great.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Yeah.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Edgy.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
That's good.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I think Colin mockery is doing a show in New York.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Very close to here.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Really?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Yeah.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
I think it's hypnosis and improv combined.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Did you do something?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Should we have a look?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Yeah.

09:42.000 --> 09:51.000
I think the jazz and Mamamia should just all be like sort of a rat team bomb.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Oh yeah.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
I'm going to go on the conch and come and flirt.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I've been very classy.

09:57.000 --> 10:04.000
I think the jazz and Mamamia should just all be like sort of a rat team bomb.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Oh, there we go.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Tie it up the hip.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Yeah.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
They're doing constructions.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
It sounds like above here.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
It's, I think it's below.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Constant.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
But it kind of sounds like what I assume is happening in Taylor's stomach right now.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
It would be.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Just like normally.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Yeah.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
What a great image myself.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Wow.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Thank you.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Perkins.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Sumer reports.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
No.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Vemper is the best time to buy blank.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
What do you guys think?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
There's four options.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Not options.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
But turkeys.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Would you say turbions?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
It's an expensive purchase.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Not even.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Oh my god.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
I said turkeys.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Oh.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
That would actually be the worst time to buy turkeys because everybody's buying turkeys.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Yeah.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
What is the best time to buy me?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I was assuming like like the easiest time to purchase.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
I was assuming that was like the best.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
But I'd wise.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
No.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
Like it's good for the people making the product.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Like.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
I know.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
I'm sorry.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
I'm a rakey.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I'm a capitalist for that.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
You're crazy for that one, bro.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Thanks.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
I would say like close that are out of season.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Like shorts.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
We were talking about also on the walk in that you might get some low dock.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Martin's.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Yes.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Low dock.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Which are very out of season right now because it's about to snow and rain all the time.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Yeah.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
I'm okay with a wet sock.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Oh.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Or better looking.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Believe it.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Yeah.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
The correct answers were coffee makers.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Headphones.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Cookware.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
So Christmas dance.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
And humidifiers.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
I think yeah.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
I'm I ain't a pair of both 700 noise cancelling over the years.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
And they just jumped down from 329 to 279.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
Still not what I'm looking to buy right now.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
We took black Friday.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
That's actually a really good idea.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Yeah.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
I kind of get all my purchases out on black Friday.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I kind of like your personal purchases.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Yeah.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
So nothing for friends and children and like soaps and all the insurance.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Yeah.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Insurance.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Very good.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Very good.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Thank you.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
I am energy.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Says the CEO of Bang Energy.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
What?

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
Jack O'Wick, a trash talking chest bearing only in Florida.

12:35.000 --> 12:45.000
Entrepreneur has challenged and rocked the touring industry.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I can't believe it.

12:48.000 --> 12:57.000
I'm also trying to read along like whatever you're saying would ever be written in print.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
He looks a little first of all.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
We're looking at a graphic.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I'm going to put it up somewhere here.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
He even in a non photo.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
Kind of like sort of a squinted eye.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
He has one squinty eye and one very wide eye.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Yeah.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
How did the non photo get worse?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
This is my question.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Let's basically fix that in the artwork.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Yeah.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
The closet died down by the time Jack O'Wick mounted the stage.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And I'm Manhattan conference venue in June.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
So not a great start.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Yeah.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
A microphone in one hand, an energy shot in the other.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
He moved in to fist bump the outstretched palm of the moderator.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Then sidestepped him.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
400 pairs of eyes surveyed the bill.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
He wore.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
He wore a shiny renaissance meets Miami nightclub blazer.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
And even shiny or button up.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
New Balance sneakers and a joyless expression.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Sling around his neck.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
We're too thick gold chains.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
And on his chest rested a big bedazzle.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
Lowercase be the logo of his company bang.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
Through his veins, course to the caffeine equivalent of a button.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
He comes to coffee.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Should we keep going with this?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
No.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
I read the title and I saw the photo.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
I said this ought to be good.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
I imagine flashing a faint smile.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
He flashed a faint smile.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
A handful of people.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
And a pointless expression.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Yeah.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
I need you to take out your bang and take a sip.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Because we got to get the up the energy level in here.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
That's basically how I started this episode.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Yeah.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
I don't want to resonate with the CEO of bang.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
No.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
What do you do differently then?

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
You don't live in Florida.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
So that is one step in the right direction.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
But I don't live here.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
And that's equally bad.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Yeah.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Have you guys ever had a bang?

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Do you think that it's making a bang in the energy drink industry?

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
No.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
And I've never seen anyone drink a bang before.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I didn't know what existed.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Yeah.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
I've definitely seen it.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Yeah.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
You saw it in.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
It was like, oh John Wilson.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Yeah.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
That's okay.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Yeah.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
That is what the show was.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
I was trying to think of.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Yeah.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
It's a big tick-tock thing.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Bang energy.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Yeah.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
This is on your for you page.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Yeah.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
It's not showing up online, certainly.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
I certainly know.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
I think it's like a bit.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
I think they do sponsor a lot of creators.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
For us.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I think they do sponsor a lot of creators.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I think they do like compete with Red Bulls.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Sponsoring creators.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Does that don't think that's possible?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
I don't think you can.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Yeah.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
You can't compete with Red Bulls.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Yeah.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
What do you have a bang?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
No.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
I don't know how many bangers the equivalent to nine cups of coffee.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
But I'd rather have even three cups of coffee.

16:00.000 --> 16:08.000
I'd rather do really fast shots of espresso and feel that vibe than drink it and energy drink.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
So.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
So when I go out, like my what I'll do is.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Everybody does this.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
But like I'll do shadow whiskey and like a beer.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
I came up with this sort of way to game the day when I was living here before.

16:22.000 --> 16:28.000
Where I would do a shot of espresso, like a shot of alcohol, and then wash it down with a cold brew.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
And I'm just off to the races.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Yeah.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
I know what I'm doing.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
I'm doing well.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
That's how I make a very good.

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
I feel like every time you hopped on a zoom, you looked bad.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
It felt bad.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
I don't.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
I'm living life wrong.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I don't know what else to say.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I go to sleep.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
You know, at 3 a.m. when I wake up at 11 already behind on shit, especially in LA,

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
because at least here, you know, it's 8.30 a.m.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Yeah.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
Even if I woke up now at 11.30, it's 8.30 a.m. Pacific, which most of the stuff at the company,

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
I feel like starts at 8.30 on Pacific time.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
Yeah, they really favor the Pacific time zone for meetings and such.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
So that's also why I feel like I should live here.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
My lifestyle but fits that.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Yeah.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Anyway.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Yeah.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
If we get in at 9 a.m.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Yeah.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Six a.m. there.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
And then you're, then you're really in your building in your mindset.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Oh, no.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Oh.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
She asked.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
It's back.

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
This Canadian news anchor and reporter has had experience dealing with human pests.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Please.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
You're not wearing a mask.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
You need to get away from me.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
You're not wearing a mask.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
But that didn't prepare her.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
Though a mask could have helped when a pesky fly dive bomb

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
or mouth.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
A national emergency hospital.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Has been invoked.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
But the weather in Pakistan extreme weather is alarming.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Wow.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
You've got your reports.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
Global nationals far a NASA made it through the intro.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
The stealthy fly was invisible.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
All viewer saw was the deep gulp.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
I could feel it.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Fluttering.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
In the back of my throat as I finished that introduction.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Sorry.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
I know this is so gross.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Insects are feasting on prominent Canadians.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
I'm sorry.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
From your Doug Ford.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
I love it.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Just weeks ago.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
It's coming from the health sector.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Oh.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Oh.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Just hold the beat.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
Now viewers are comparing and contrasting the two.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
Both reach for water to no avail.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
It wasn't going to happen.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
It was just hot.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Holy.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
He's wedged to my throat.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
NASA was a lot of soldering on.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
A national emergency has been invoked.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
He's been invoked.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
One Twitter user asked,

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Who looked better?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Farah or Ford?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
The parody account.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Doug Ford's being dinged.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
His language.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
Unlike Ford, you definitely kept a composure.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
But maybe a B with a thread of a sting is tougher to swallow than a fly.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
There was a fly.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
It was enough to grail.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
This sportscaster.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Just closing it out.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
NASA didn't have to be excused.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Did you ever see the fly?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
There's a nose.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
No.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
No.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
No.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
There's a nose.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
There's a nose.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Running it.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
It's so sporadic.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
The nose.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
I don't know.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
That's the nose.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Oh, my gosh.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
I mean, that little bugger.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
So, I saw a nose.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Yeah.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
That was the thesis.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I thought the thesis was like,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
There are flies on Canadian people.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
And it's just two.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Which is not a pattern.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
It was like a bodily sportscaster.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
And yeah, it was a bottle of not a fly.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
That came in from GMMus.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
GenieMus, I don't know how you said.

19:57.000 --> 20:03.000
She also did the King Charles made a splash with his fang.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I can tell.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
She's an unbelievable newscaster we got to get her on the show.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Yeah, she's incredible.

20:10.000 --> 20:15.000
I don't know what, she very much could have played it off completely.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
But I think she called attention to it.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
And she's right.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Yeah, like I would have not wanted anyone to know that.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Oh, yes.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Yeah, fair.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Yeah.

20:27.000 --> 20:34.000
It's about like, I do like how they integrated social media into this completely and correctly.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Yeah.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
But like, the first one was like, someone said,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
and then it pulled up the tweet and they're

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
probiotic.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
There's just like a cartoon bulldog.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Yeah.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
And lighting commentary.

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
But one read the, the greater than meme wrong.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
So you guys are, let's say we're all doing the show, right?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Okay.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
One by one flag goes into your mouth.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
How do you react?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
I'll start it on the hot.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Really.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Totally like that.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
That's really good.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Yeah.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
English.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Oh, I'd probably like cough.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
And drink.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
No, I want to actually see it.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
There's a video component.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
I don't know how to.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
It's pretty good.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
It's pretty good.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
It's good.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Yeah.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Rica.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I feel like I'd probably do it like.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Oh, I'm trying to blow it up.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Yeah.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
I think I would go like.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
I think you do that.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
I think we have to take a break.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
We have to take a break.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Yeah.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
This is fucked up.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
Oh, yeah.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
Our next partner has a product.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
I literally use every day.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
All right.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
I started taking athletic greens because I don't sleep well.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
And it's apparent on every video record of my right guys.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
And athletic greens has been helping.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I take it every day in the morning.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
I have water.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Athletic greens.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Cafe.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Rinse.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Repeat.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
It starts me out.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
No matter when I wake up.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
On a good note.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
It's better than what I used to do.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
Which was taking a lot of different pills and supplements.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
It's cheaper.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
It's just easier to put the powder in the water.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Shake it up.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Taste great.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
And then you don't have to be like.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
One pill.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Chualo.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Three pills.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Chualo.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
I hated that.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
I hated doing that.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
It was hard to continue that supplement routine when I hated doing it.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
So, what is this stuff?

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
Well, with one delicious scoop of athletic greens, you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins,

22:47.000 --> 22:51.280
minerals, whole-food source superfoods, probiotics, and adaptogens to help start your day

22:51.280 --> 22:52.280
right.

22:52.280 --> 22:56.280
This special blend of ingredients supports your gut health, your nervous system, your immune

22:56.280 --> 23:02.000
system, your energy, recovery, focus, and aging all the things.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Right?

23:03.000 --> 23:08.480
Tons of people, like I said, like me before, take a multivitamin or, you know, are on some

23:08.480 --> 23:09.480
kind of supplement routine.

23:09.480 --> 23:14.240
And it's important to choose a product with high-quality ingredients that your body will

23:14.240 --> 23:15.240
actually absorb.

23:15.240 --> 23:18.240
That's why AG1 steps in gets the job done.

23:18.240 --> 23:21.160
It is a small microhabit with big benefits.

23:21.160 --> 23:24.920
And it's the one thing that you can do every single day to take great care of yourself,

23:24.920 --> 23:25.920
right?

23:25.920 --> 23:28.120
Sometimes, you know, you forget to go to the gym or you don't have the energy to go to

23:28.120 --> 23:29.600
the gym.

23:29.600 --> 23:34.280
Taking athletic greens makes me feel like I'm doing at least one thing for my health.

23:34.280 --> 23:37.400
Your subscription also comes with a year's supply of vitamin D, which is important to

23:37.400 --> 23:41.560
add in these upcoming winter months when we don't get as much sunlight.

23:41.560 --> 23:44.840
It costs less than $3 a day and you're investing in your health and it's cheaper than

23:44.840 --> 23:46.240
your cold brew habit.

23:46.240 --> 23:49.640
I have both, but still, it's cheaper than also than getting all the different supplements

23:49.640 --> 23:50.640
yourself, right?

23:50.640 --> 23:55.680
If you don't even, you know, taking, doing the physical act of taking the pills aside,

23:55.680 --> 23:57.320
it's also a lot cheaper.

23:57.320 --> 23:58.760
I've seen that over the past year.

23:58.760 --> 24:01.160
I started taking it in last December, last January.

24:01.160 --> 24:04.240
I don't have a pill budget anymore.

24:04.240 --> 24:07.440
When you're investing in an all-in-one nutritional insurance.

24:07.440 --> 24:10.600
So right now, it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient

24:10.600 --> 24:14.320
daily nutrition, especially heading into cold and flu season.

24:14.320 --> 24:17.960
It's just one scoop of athletic greens in a couple of water every day.

24:17.960 --> 24:18.960
That's it.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.360

24:21.360 --> 24:26.160

24:44.480 --> 24:46.960
No, it is athleticgreens.com slash what's that?

24:46.960 --> 24:51.960
Things athleticgreens?

24:51.960 --> 24:54.960
We're back.

24:55.960 --> 24:57.960
Not really.

24:57.960 --> 24:58.960
Perfect.

24:58.960 --> 24:59.960
It's not that.

24:59.960 --> 25:01.960
It's traumatized by the fly.

25:01.960 --> 25:02.960
Yeah.

25:02.960 --> 25:03.960
Yeah.

25:03.960 --> 25:08.960
It's going to take a while to recover from the fly.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.960
The footage, the fly, the coverage.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.960
What is this?

25:13.960 --> 25:14.960
Colladium.

25:14.960 --> 25:15.960
Great.

25:15.960 --> 25:16.960
Great.

25:16.960 --> 25:17.960
Thank you.

25:17.960 --> 25:18.960
I agree.

25:18.960 --> 25:22.960
I was waiting to buy these this for years.

25:22.960 --> 25:23.960
Really?

25:23.960 --> 25:24.960
No.

25:24.960 --> 25:29.800
I just have them in college because they're waterproof and they, like, you can wear them

25:29.800 --> 25:30.800
two ways.

25:30.800 --> 25:31.800
They fold down.

25:31.800 --> 25:32.800
That's cool.

25:32.800 --> 25:36.960
And the brand got, like, stopped selling the waterproof version of these.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.960
And then they finally brought them back, like, I think a few years ago.

25:39.960 --> 25:41.960
And I just noticed this past year.

25:41.960 --> 25:42.960
Okay.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.960
That's my, that's my plug.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.960
She was sponsoring me.

25:46.960 --> 25:50.960
We were talking about how everybody in the world has, like, a parade deal.

25:50.960 --> 25:51.960
Yeah.

25:52.960 --> 25:53.960
John.

25:53.960 --> 25:54.960
Yeah.

25:54.960 --> 25:58.960
But I mean, like, parade deal just means you have a promo code.

25:58.960 --> 25:59.960
Okay.

25:59.960 --> 26:00.960
I don't even get them for free.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.960
I think you do get them for free.

26:02.960 --> 26:03.960
Yeah.

26:03.960 --> 26:04.960
They're, I mean, most about them.

26:04.960 --> 26:05.960
Yeah.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.960
They, they'll give anyone close.

26:07.960 --> 26:10.960
Don't get a share.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.960
That's, that's a share.

26:12.960 --> 26:13.960
It's getting share.

26:13.960 --> 26:14.960
I want a parade deal.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.960
I think you can go on.

26:16.960 --> 26:17.960
Definitely do it.

26:17.960 --> 26:19.960
Surprisingly, you can get parade deals.

26:19.960 --> 26:20.960
I didn't know that.

26:20.960 --> 26:21.960
Yeah.

26:21.960 --> 26:24.960
Selfage or not is the name of the game.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.960
Do you guys want to take a guess at how this works?

26:26.960 --> 26:27.960
No.

26:27.960 --> 26:30.960
You want us to determine whether or not something is salvage G.

26:30.960 --> 26:33.960
So which denim were regular denim or not?

26:33.960 --> 26:34.960
Yeah.

26:34.960 --> 26:38.960
I guess I could have called it salvage or regular.

26:38.960 --> 26:45.960
That topical for Kayla, but I didn't know that she was going to have this issue.

26:45.960 --> 26:49.960
Selfage or not is, are these jeans made of salvage denim?

26:49.960 --> 26:50.960
No.

26:50.960 --> 26:51.960
I don't think so.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.960
You don't think this one is salvage?

26:53.960 --> 26:54.960
No.

26:54.960 --> 26:55.960
Shit.

26:55.960 --> 26:57.960
I don't think so.

26:57.960 --> 27:04.960
Looks like a regular Levi's or even like,

27:04.960 --> 27:05.960
that's correct.

27:05.960 --> 27:10.960
This is not salvage.

27:10.960 --> 27:14.960
Selfage or not.

27:14.960 --> 27:15.960
Selfage.

27:15.960 --> 27:16.960
It's got to be salvage.

27:16.960 --> 27:17.960
Yeah.

27:17.960 --> 27:18.960
That gives me salvage.

27:18.960 --> 27:20.960
That's correct.

27:20.960 --> 27:25.960
I did do a little bit of research about salvage jeans because some of my friends are wearing

27:25.960 --> 27:26.960
them.

27:26.960 --> 27:27.960
Yeah.

27:27.960 --> 27:33.960
I think like they're like slowly, which surely coming back into style in some circles.

27:33.960 --> 27:34.960
So not my style.

27:34.960 --> 27:37.960
Do I not know salvage is that?

27:37.960 --> 27:38.960
It's like, yeah.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.960
It's like a higher end denim.

27:40.960 --> 27:41.960
Yeah.

27:41.960 --> 27:45.960
It has one pair of salvage that I found second hand.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.960
So they fit someone else's body perfectly.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.960
They were like barely worn.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.960
But they were like a resell shop.

27:52.960 --> 27:53.960
That's cool.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.960
Because the idea with salvages, you don't wash them.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.960
And then you do soak them.

27:58.960 --> 27:59.960
And then they fit your.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.960
You do, you can wash them.

28:01.960 --> 28:02.960
You don't wash them.

28:02.960 --> 28:03.960
Like every time.

28:03.960 --> 28:04.960
Right.

28:04.960 --> 28:05.960
It's a weird.

28:05.960 --> 28:07.960
It's a weird.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.960
It's a weird.

28:10.960 --> 28:14.960
Don't your pants start to smell after like.

28:14.960 --> 28:19.960
I mean, I, I wash them more often than you're supposed to.

28:19.960 --> 28:20.960
Yeah.

28:20.960 --> 28:21.960
I do too.

28:21.960 --> 28:22.960
Yeah.

28:22.960 --> 28:23.960
Mine aren't salvage.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.960
I don't know when the last time I washed these were.

28:25.960 --> 28:26.960
I was probably washed them.

28:26.960 --> 28:29.960
We have a washer dryer said if you need it.

28:29.960 --> 28:31.960
Do you have an end unit?

28:31.960 --> 28:32.960
No.

28:32.960 --> 28:33.960
I don't have an end unit.

28:33.960 --> 28:34.960
I don't have an end unit.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.960
I don't have an end unit.

28:36.960 --> 28:37.960
I don't have an end unit.

28:37.960 --> 28:38.960
I don't have an end unit.

28:38.960 --> 28:39.960
I don't have an end unit.

28:39.960 --> 28:40.960
Who said, yeah?

28:40.960 --> 28:41.960
Yeah.

28:41.960 --> 28:42.960
You said, yes.

28:42.960 --> 28:43.960
Yes.

28:43.960 --> 28:44.960
That's correct.

28:44.960 --> 28:45.960
These are salvage.

28:45.960 --> 28:46.960
Oh, really?

28:46.960 --> 28:47.960
They look like in this lighting.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.960
They could have that stretch to them.

28:49.960 --> 28:50.960
Yeah.

28:50.960 --> 28:51.960
Which is why I was like, huh?

28:51.960 --> 28:53.960
Salvage or not?

28:55.960 --> 28:57.960
It's to be a trick one.

28:57.960 --> 28:59.960
Have you been looking into buying these jeans?

28:59.960 --> 29:00.960
Yeah.

29:00.960 --> 29:01.960
Is this like, yeah.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.960
I'm never going to be into raw denim.

29:03.960 --> 29:04.960
I'm just not.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.960
I like a faded anything.

29:06.960 --> 29:07.960
Okay.

29:07.960 --> 29:08.960
Good.

29:09.960 --> 29:10.960
You're a good company.

29:13.960 --> 29:14.960
Yeah.

29:14.960 --> 29:15.960
I did.

29:15.960 --> 29:16.960
Yeah.

29:17.960 --> 29:19.960
I'm on a quest to find the perfect denim.

29:19.960 --> 29:21.960
And it has not material.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.960
It's your, what's your, like,

29:23.960 --> 29:25.960
the one that you're at now.

29:25.960 --> 29:26.960
That's fine.

29:26.960 --> 29:30.960
Kind of like English is like that kind of faded black,

29:30.960 --> 29:32.960
but like vintage.

29:32.960 --> 29:33.960
So like,

29:33.960 --> 29:34.960
uh, rigid.

29:34.960 --> 29:37.960
Like I, this, there's a fashion tick talker that I follow.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.960
Like, is it the guy that always wear slacks?

29:40.960 --> 29:41.960
Edgy Albert?

29:41.960 --> 29:43.960
I don't know.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.960
If I saw a photo of him,

29:45.960 --> 29:46.960
I had no style.

29:46.960 --> 29:49.960
So you want like real denim, but not sewage denim.

29:49.960 --> 29:51.960
So non stretch.

29:51.960 --> 29:52.960
Took so long.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.960
That was just talking.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.960
Well, so he was talking about.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.960
He's like skinny jeans aren't necessarily bad.

29:59.960 --> 30:01.960
The bad ones are the ones that I'm wearing.

30:01.960 --> 30:02.960
Where it's like, that's what these are.

30:02.960 --> 30:03.960
But I like them.

30:03.960 --> 30:04.960
They're comfortable.

30:04.960 --> 30:05.960
These are very good.

30:05.960 --> 30:06.960
I prefer actual denim.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.960
You should shop at Everlane.

30:09.960 --> 30:10.960
Everlane is good.

30:10.960 --> 30:12.960
These are Everlane.

30:12.960 --> 30:14.960
These are Everlane.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.960
That's definitely not selfish.

30:16.960 --> 30:17.960
Yeah.

30:17.960 --> 30:18.960
These are made of.

30:18.960 --> 30:19.960
Exactly.

30:19.960 --> 30:20.960
Right.

30:20.960 --> 30:21.960
And that's the way we're going to try.

30:21.960 --> 30:22.960
I like that.

30:22.960 --> 30:23.960
I like that.

30:23.960 --> 30:24.960
I like that.

30:24.960 --> 30:25.960
I like that.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.960
That is like building lace.

30:27.960 --> 30:28.960
Well, yes.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.960
Um, but he was saying that you want to get 501s or 505s,

30:31.960 --> 30:32.960
stiff rigid denim,

30:32.960 --> 30:35.960
and then just tapered or slim fit at your tailor.

30:36.960 --> 30:37.960
So what is this?

30:37.960 --> 30:39.960
What do you, that's what I'm looking for.

30:39.960 --> 30:40.960
This is the lead one.

30:40.960 --> 30:41.960
I'm a guy.

30:41.960 --> 30:42.960
And I'm excited.

30:42.960 --> 30:44.960
You've got to try it.

30:44.960 --> 30:45.960
Well, my.

30:45.960 --> 30:46.960
Why?

30:46.960 --> 30:48.960
Man handling her.

30:48.960 --> 30:49.960
And it's not cool.

30:49.960 --> 30:50.960
It's fun.

30:50.960 --> 30:51.960
It's funny.

30:53.960 --> 30:54.960
It's fun.

30:54.960 --> 30:55.960
Yes.

30:55.960 --> 30:56.960
It's fun.

30:56.960 --> 30:57.960
It's fun.

30:57.960 --> 30:58.960
It's fun.

30:58.960 --> 30:59.960
I like that.

30:59.960 --> 31:00.960
I like it.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.960
These are lead vise, but they're like,

31:02.960 --> 31:06.200
They're like, they're not five oh, I'm sorry or something.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.000
50s.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.760
No, they're like a, I can't remember the name,

31:09.760 --> 31:12.560
but they're like, flowier lately.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.080
If people didn't like when we talked about F1 on this show,

31:15.080 --> 31:17.880
people aren't like, like the seven minutes we spent

31:17.880 --> 31:19.160
talking about salvage.

31:19.160 --> 31:22.080
We just have a salvage podcast, S1.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.920
Definitely, it's a bubble in salvage.

31:23.920 --> 31:24.920
You just denim it.

31:24.920 --> 31:25.760
Yeah.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.040
That's the same thing as kind of intro.

31:27.040 --> 31:29.320
Salvage or not?

31:29.320 --> 31:31.000
Mmm, yeah.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.080
Salvage.

31:32.080 --> 31:33.640
Greg, that is salvage.

31:33.640 --> 31:35.280
I hate the cuff.

31:35.280 --> 31:38.040
Salvage or not?

31:38.040 --> 31:41.040
No, no, this looks like something I'd see it like

31:41.040 --> 31:42.040
in H&M.

31:42.040 --> 31:44.400
Yeah.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.480
It's anyone dipping this?

31:45.480 --> 31:46.880
Wow, you're from Rampie.

31:46.880 --> 31:49.320
Next time, I'm here.

31:49.320 --> 31:51.920
Abercrumbia, this is actually comes up.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.120
They put them up, yeah.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.640
Say it was your name.

31:56.640 --> 31:58.640
No, no.

31:58.640 --> 32:01.520
Look at that face, Greg.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.200
Also, they're like looseness lines where they hit,

32:04.200 --> 32:05.760
and just don't look the same as salvage.

32:05.760 --> 32:06.600
Salvage?

32:06.600 --> 32:07.600
Salvage.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.080
Wow, salvage.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.760
This definitely looks like a target.

32:14.760 --> 32:15.120
Yeah.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.280
It's no way.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.480
It's like a pulse.

32:17.480 --> 32:18.760
That's so big.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.040
Oh, that's not the case.

32:20.040 --> 32:22.040
I was going to say, I will eat your ass.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.080
Yeah, it was a mistake.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.600
That was aggressive.

32:26.600 --> 32:29.400
That was salvage or not.

32:29.400 --> 32:30.760
And he played that really well.

32:30.760 --> 32:31.760
Yeah.

32:31.760 --> 32:33.600
I think we have a pretty good hit rate on that.

32:33.600 --> 32:34.600
Yeah.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.600
What are our prizes?

32:36.600 --> 32:37.600
Sorry.

32:37.600 --> 32:38.600
I'm used to.

32:38.600 --> 32:39.600
I like space.

32:39.600 --> 32:40.600
Yeah.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.000
And you say you want to move to New York?

32:43.000 --> 32:44.400
I want to be cramped.

32:44.400 --> 32:45.400
You know?

32:45.400 --> 32:49.600
I'm claustrophobic, but I also crave cozy.

32:49.600 --> 32:50.600
Hmm.

32:50.600 --> 32:51.600
So.

32:51.600 --> 32:54.000
I like the illustration.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Yeah.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.320
Has everybody's love lives?

33:00.960 --> 33:03.440
Hmm.

33:03.440 --> 33:06.960
Did you hurt one?

33:06.960 --> 33:14.700
The following program is being bought to you in living color, on N.B.C.

33:14.700 --> 33:20.680
Well, if at this very moment you were given five seconds to choose between this or

33:20.680 --> 33:28.480
the relaxing pleasure or this or your living pleasure which one would you select?

33:28.480 --> 33:30.480
That's one of the choices to be made by today's contestants on these days.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.040
Hackers.

33:32.040 --> 33:33.000
Backers.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.400
Hackers.

33:35.400 --> 33:41.660
Hackers.

33:41.660 --> 33:45.880
Also, my voice just kind of inadvertently made the Bauba dark side.

33:45.880 --> 33:46.880
Yeah.

33:46.880 --> 33:47.880
Yeah.

33:47.880 --> 33:49.920
Open the Hackers Bagus.

33:49.920 --> 33:58.000
This is a game show from the 1950s where the objective is to identify the image of a celebrity's

33:58.000 --> 34:00.340
face, which is concealed behind it.

34:00.340 --> 34:03.940
They did five by five, but just to make it easier, we're doing three by three.

34:05.140 --> 34:10.420
With the horizontal dimension showing letters and the vertical showing categories.

34:10.420 --> 34:17.380
So I will announce a category and one of the letters and then first to, you know,

34:17.380 --> 34:21.620
I just have to give you props for having this still in Photoshop.

34:22.340 --> 34:28.660
There's no other way. The other, like there's no way to do it on the screen where I can choose which

34:28.820 --> 34:33.620
Thanks. Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay. Um, I will teach you things.

34:36.340 --> 34:40.660
Holy shit. You want to know ways to do this without having Photoshop on me.

34:41.940 --> 34:44.260
You know, I wish my therapist would, you know,

34:44.260 --> 34:49.060
approach and sketchy things. Yeah, it's just like, I learn. I don't, you know, instead of just like,

34:49.060 --> 34:53.060
you know, I need tools, you know, because not an emotional therapist. Really,

34:53.060 --> 34:56.180
giving you tools to help yourself be better. They're mostly just like,

34:58.660 --> 35:04.740
yeah, and they're on their phone the entire time. Yeah. Um, first player to solve the picture wins.

35:05.380 --> 35:11.220
So at any point, you can solve, you can just call out the picture and, uh, you know,

35:11.220 --> 35:15.540
you can win the Hagus or the bagus. The the Hagus being a luxury item that you don't need a

35:15.540 --> 35:20.660
bagus being an item that you do need. So the two prizes that I've come up with is the watchoff

35:20.660 --> 35:26.020
my wrist as the Hagus and the bagus being any one of the three cameras. Great.

35:26.900 --> 35:35.940
So we have to like name something in the category with those letters. Yes. So for example,

35:35.940 --> 35:40.580
if the category is lubricating agents, uh, and the word is J, then you could say,

35:41.300 --> 35:44.420
yeah, I'm not going to give it away. Let me get into a different category. Let's say the category

35:44.420 --> 35:49.620
is pants, right? And then the kind of, and it's, uh, J, then you could say cool lots,

35:49.620 --> 35:58.260
God, you're, can we start? You're somewhere to be, Marie? I don't want to answer free

35:58.260 --> 36:04.900
after this. I want to answer the question. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do the works of shakes.

36:04.900 --> 36:10.820
Yeah. Okay. Works. Well, can I not works of shakes, beer. Oh my god. Okay. Coralian is

36:13.220 --> 36:19.540
correct. So John. That's maybe the worst one to get first because you might get it from that square

36:20.580 --> 36:32.020
they're full fit. Yeah. It's not full. Yeah. Yeah. It is. I don't know.

36:32.980 --> 36:35.540
Julius Caesar.

36:38.180 --> 36:42.180
We don't see for months of the year.

36:42.420 --> 36:51.460
He loves like Christmas. It's not a month. But what certainly feels like it. P. P. C. A. Y.

36:53.300 --> 37:01.060
What? Isn't that how you pronounce K in what? I'm going to off myself. This is so

37:01.060 --> 37:07.860
fucked up. Emma's sitting over here smiling because I'm fucking ruining the hour and she loves

37:07.860 --> 37:13.220
my demise. Lubricating agents. We can just go through these categories. Jurgen. Yeah.

37:13.220 --> 37:23.140
I was going to say Jurgen. Yeah. Oh, oil, oil, seas, syravy, syravy, syravy, syravy, syravy, syravy.

37:23.140 --> 37:28.180
Oh, I was like, what the hell is syravy? I was also so thrown off by Jurgen.

37:28.180 --> 37:31.220
Yeah. I was thinking like, like, I don't know, like they were thinking.

37:31.220 --> 37:39.700
I'm UD 40. Yeah. I've never said syravy out loud. I don't think I have either. Yeah.

37:39.700 --> 37:47.140
Works like we have you on record of saying. Yeah. Yeah. I guess there isn't. There is not a month

37:47.140 --> 37:54.180
that starts the sea. Yeah. Cocktober. But people send that like chain text where it's like,

37:54.180 --> 37:58.580
welcome to cocktober. You hungry sluts. Like send this to 10 people or else you

37:58.580 --> 38:05.060
will be cursed. What email is that you want? Oh, I just, oh, my friends who like memes will send that.

38:05.060 --> 38:11.380
Yeah. I did receive that text one. I've never, never. This guy went way more viral than he should have, right?

38:13.860 --> 38:18.660
Yeah. Seems like a standup guy. I don't know. I haven't heard anything about him lately. But

38:20.420 --> 38:27.620
I, well, yeah. You're on a podcast with him. Yeah. I, well, no, I don't want to be mean. He's a, I'm sure he's

38:27.700 --> 38:33.140
fine. Yeah. Like he's, I don't know. He made, I don't know what the take is. I think you can't be

38:33.140 --> 38:38.260
canceled for cheating on someone. That's what I, but yeah. I don't think he's been canceled. I think

38:38.260 --> 38:43.540
he just, they were like, we don't. I think he compromised the company's values and he was fired.

38:43.540 --> 38:49.140
Great. Yeah. And, but I will say that I did get bad vibes from him on the show that I was not.

38:50.020 --> 38:53.940
He, he has like the eyes of someone who gets angry sometimes.

38:54.500 --> 38:57.140
Get angry sometimes.

38:57.140 --> 39:06.580
Gosh. Oh, yeah. I'm not going to rage where it's like this is like scary. Oh, that's different.

39:06.580 --> 39:08.020
Then get, it's angry.

39:10.020 --> 39:16.820
His eyes are gray in this photo. Yeah. Maybe that's telling graphite. I, yeah. You really know what

39:16.820 --> 39:26.820
to make me cry. We can be those graphite eyes. Those salvageeers, salvageeers.

39:26.820 --> 39:33.700
Got a raw ear. Um, well, I guess Marie, good. Do you want my watch?

39:34.740 --> 39:38.580
And now it's okay. Well, let's see how it look on your wrist. Okay. You know, this watch

39:38.580 --> 39:46.420
used to be owned by Jimmy Stewart. I didn't know that. Jimmy Stewart. Oh, God. Oh, God.

39:48.420 --> 39:53.700
God, man. Yeah. I mean, I think it was going to look good. No, I don't want it on your wrist. It's the

39:53.700 --> 39:59.140
fact that you put it up on upside down and then sort of flopped it back around. Will you hit me with

39:59.220 --> 40:13.220
that? You just kind of wanted it. Johnny loves that. Listen, we've got five minutes to kill.

40:13.220 --> 40:18.260
What do you guys want to talk about? I thought Harry's bag is going to take seven words.

40:18.260 --> 40:24.820
Yeah, of course. You put Shakespeare on. Oh, yeah. But also you did, I could have done any. I was

40:24.900 --> 40:29.380
just excited to go through the Shakespeare ones. But you said, see, and I said it, and you're like,

40:29.380 --> 40:34.580
well, that's going to ruin the entire game. And it. Yeah. My biggest fear happened. Yeah. And, uh,

40:37.460 --> 40:42.500
nice. I, I'd love to talk more about our love lives. Emma.

40:45.220 --> 40:50.740
Good. I thought I was a Patrick. How's your, I'm sorry to say, but how's your cockman?

40:51.060 --> 41:01.540
Great. Nice. That's good. I mean, you can go into detail about all of your troubles.

41:01.540 --> 41:04.020
Yeah. You'd love to hear more about you. Oh, yeah.

41:06.260 --> 41:13.780
I don't think so. I'm getting us to open up a little too personally and you don't want to do the same.

41:13.780 --> 41:18.820
I'll do the same about this time last year. Okay. This time last year. This time last year. I

41:18.900 --> 41:24.260
came to New York for the live show. Right. Like the same. Just kind of stayed. Yeah.

41:24.260 --> 41:30.100
A little too long. I'm getting the other time we actually met. No, because I came in August, too.

41:30.660 --> 41:37.060
Okay. Okay. I spent basically half of the year here last year. Anyway, um, you ever, you guys

41:37.060 --> 41:47.780
ever have like a, I'm not going to do this. Oh, Jesus. Johnny, how are you? Just in general.

41:48.420 --> 41:56.180
Specifically sexually not specifically sexually. She just asked in general. Oh, good. Just chillin. I think

41:57.140 --> 42:05.780
every day I'm chillin. And that's good. I like your bedazzled shirt. Yeah. Friends. He made it.

42:05.780 --> 42:13.220
Wow. Yeah. That's cool. Yash. Not Yash. Doesn't exist. Yeah. Johnny has a friend that I don't think exists.

42:13.940 --> 42:21.780
Everyone else has met him. Um, you ever, you ever have like a golden era. I'm just going to say it.

42:21.780 --> 42:28.020
I've never had an era. Like, are you? This is like the wrong audience for this. I like if I had

42:28.020 --> 42:32.980
it, I need like Mike and Joel to say when I was going to say it because it's pretty dirt baggy.

42:33.620 --> 42:38.660
And those two guys are dirt bags. Mike is not a dirt bag. Mike, like the nicest. Yeah.

42:38.740 --> 42:46.740
This is not, I wanted to wrap things up. Now you have to, you have to continue. Yeah.

42:46.740 --> 42:52.820
Like, are you ever like, you know, in more of like a slutty phase, right? And then you just like have a

42:52.820 --> 42:59.460
week or two where you can't miss. Yeah. I know Emma knows what I'm talking about. This happened

42:59.460 --> 43:07.700
to me last year this week. I'm reminiscing when I was here in New York for those two weeks.

43:07.780 --> 43:13.300
It was unbelievable. Yeah. Yeah. You're very happy. I was like, you're a little joy.

43:13.300 --> 43:18.900
Unbridled joy. Unbridled joy. Yeah. And the the night of the live show,

43:18.900 --> 43:25.540
Marieka's birthday last year was the best day of my life. Yeah. And this year on that day,

43:25.540 --> 43:32.900
which is what October 22nd, it's fine. You know, I'm stressed. I'm sad. I'm financially in the

43:33.060 --> 43:38.660
whole, although I'm not Jimmy Stewart's watch. So yeah, but that wasn't that expensive because

43:38.660 --> 43:46.500
they didn't have proof. So Mike, not have been James's. But the story behind it was that the Swedish

43:46.500 --> 43:52.340
woman bought it on an auction from Jimmy's daughter. And that just feels a little too specific to

43:52.340 --> 43:57.700
not be real. Also, like, it's, it's a nothing watch. It's a Lord Elgin. Okay. Yeah.

43:57.700 --> 44:09.300
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Honestly. That's all so awesome. No, I just, um, I'm not living

44:09.300 --> 44:12.980
dead anymore though. We talked about this last week that I don't have a credit card anymore. Right.

44:12.980 --> 44:20.420
Oh, wow. Which is to me a crazy choice, but yeah. I respect your idea. I respect your decision

44:20.420 --> 44:24.580
to be financially secure. It's a different kind of stress because it's like, oh,

44:24.580 --> 44:30.420
shit, I only have $200 and I have to last me the next 10 days. Yeah. Uh, yeah. I got rid of the

44:30.420 --> 44:37.940
credit card. I was in serious debt. Yeah. Really? I usually go. Yeah. Yeah. I've yet to be in credit card.

44:38.660 --> 44:43.140
My dad, but you get me. He was like, so he gave me a credit card when I was like 18 and

44:43.140 --> 44:46.580
going to college. He's like, just use this every time you need to make a purchase. Like,

44:46.580 --> 44:51.940
perfect. Free money. Yes. I was like, this is a gift card that never inspires. When didn't

44:51.940 --> 44:55.940
wait, when did you get your credit card? I got my credit card when I started working at Carpool

44:55.940 --> 45:01.380
karaoke. And that's why I had a huge credit credit limit because they said enter your income.

45:01.380 --> 45:07.620
And that my income was very different than. Yeah. And that yeah, I had like a like over $10,000

45:07.620 --> 45:13.620
limit. And so I would be in debt. Oh, $10,000 at one point. And that's why I had to sell my car and

45:13.620 --> 45:20.420
then bought my truck, which was good. But anyway. Well, and I just, yeah, they thrive off your debt.

45:21.140 --> 45:26.420
Interest, right? That's what you'll never get back. Couldn't be me. What's up? I said couldn't be me.

45:26.420 --> 45:32.740
I just I buy it with what I want when I want. And I'm not going to apologize.

45:32.740 --> 45:37.940
I'm a rickest style. Joe Biden, maybeators. You're going to do an ice cream go.

45:41.380 --> 45:43.460
Oh, I think I need to go to that sketch.

45:43.780 --> 45:49.780
I would like to see your Biden.

45:49.780 --> 45:53.780
Yes, I'm over.

45:57.780 --> 46:05.780
You don't kind of like my life and that sort of like state of fog that he is in anyways.

46:05.860 --> 46:15.380
But you've never had COVID. I had it once. Oh, right. Yeah, plugs. What do you guys have

46:15.380 --> 46:19.140
going on? What do you want to point the people to or to the floors? Johnny's then English is

46:19.140 --> 46:25.540
then Marie, because then we'll round it out with me. First plug. You got to get vaccinated for the flu.

46:26.180 --> 46:32.500
Yes. And the second COVID booster. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Because that should beat my ass.

46:33.140 --> 46:40.420
Uh, the day after you got vaccinated. Yeah, the day after I got back. I would find to a bed

46:41.220 --> 46:46.100
for lack of a better term. Wait, from COVID or from the vaccine. The vaccine is the

46:46.100 --> 46:55.060
love load. Yeah, I've yet to get symptoms from any of the vaccines. What? Yeah. You must have

46:55.060 --> 47:01.940
a crazy immune system. I don't know. I'm like, are they working? I've been eating a lot of elder

47:01.940 --> 47:08.420
berries, too. Right. You did say. Yeah. That's something that I will also plug for your immunity.

47:09.140 --> 47:13.860
That's cool. And you know what? I've been feeling terrible. That's not just eating too much.

47:13.860 --> 47:19.220
Eating a candy syrup every morning. Yeah. I did that as well. Yeah. Elder flowers,

47:19.220 --> 47:25.140
syrup. Yeah. Elder berries, syrup. Yeah. The last time I went to LA when we were still in the

47:25.140 --> 47:32.260
old office, I was like housing syrup. I really, I was like, I brought it with me. I would take it

47:32.260 --> 47:39.380
every day because I just kept having a cold. Did it help? No. The one thing that I about elder

47:39.380 --> 47:43.540
berries, syrup, I will point out though is if you're on a steroid, don't take all the berries.

47:43.540 --> 47:48.340
Yeah. It'll mess with your, like, let me just go and freak out. It's, it happened to me once.

47:48.340 --> 47:53.380
Which is crazy. Yeah. Some supplements don't interact with medication. Oh, well,

47:53.860 --> 48:00.820
it's bothering me. Oh, it's bothering me. I feel like, because it's so sweet and can be

48:00.820 --> 48:05.540
asked, you could put it into just some like smart sparkling water. Yeah. Shake it up. That's basically

48:05.540 --> 48:09.300
the soda. Yeah. Hmm. Do that, Trani. Yeah. I will.

48:13.300 --> 48:21.140
That I already said it this morning. It's like you said it sticks. Nice. Yeah. And follow me on Instagram at

Can I out you? Yeah. Go ahead. Johnny said to me last night that he's trying to game

48:31.220 --> 48:37.620
Instagram so that he is gone from it in a big long enough intervals that when he comes back, it's

48:37.620 --> 48:46.900
always a return. People get a notification saying that someone that, yeah, he's supposed to

48:46.900 --> 48:55.140
after a long time. Oh, I didn't know. Instagram did that too. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. It does

48:55.140 --> 49:01.700
crazy wonders for your engagement. But it's terrible if you want to be consistent. Right. You're

49:02.900 --> 49:12.500
actually exposed. I'm getting married. Holy shit. English. I'm going to, I'm going to reiterate

49:12.500 --> 49:18.260

49:45.700 --> 49:52.860

50:18.820 --> 50:25.220
LA New York. It's exciting. Yeah. We talked about doing this last year this week. We did. Yeah,

50:25.220 --> 50:31.220
now here we are in the play. Things take a while. Yeah. Just so everyone knows away.

50:31.540 --> 50:38.420
Yeah. But now we have 41 employees technically. Not we y'all. I'm at $1099. But um,

50:40.420 --> 50:44.260
a lot of hands on deck. So things got to, you know, let's pick up the pace pack. All right.

50:44.260 --> 50:55.140
So I'm sure she's just man. You just got here. That all. Yeah. And I'll second following these

50:55.140 --> 51:00.820
fuckers, but also Jeff Boyardy on Twitter because I'm 17 followers away from bearing ass. Yeah.

51:00.820 --> 51:09.700
Yeah. How many do you need? 10,000. All you need is another Ryan Reynolds retweet.

51:09.700 --> 51:14.740
That did nothing. I think if you will unfollowed me. Wait. When did that happen?

51:15.460 --> 51:20.340
I was in a commercial and Ryan Reynolds tweeted it yesterday. It could seem like it was his agency.

51:20.420 --> 51:25.940
Very cool. Uh, Van City Reynolds, which is I think is an objectively bad handle. Yeah. I don't

51:25.940 --> 51:30.740
know what it means. It's Vancouver. Yeah. He's from Vancouver. But that's not like part of his brand.

51:30.740 --> 51:38.580
I feel like. No. Ryan is rushing this please. Why also never reading it. I've never like registered

51:38.580 --> 51:47.220
that it's Van City. I think I always in my head was like vicinity. That's my story. Uh,

51:47.220 --> 51:54.020
Ryan Reynolds likes my succession Halloween costume. The one that went viral. Yeah. That's my

51:54.020 --> 51:58.420
biggest claim to fame. That's just more impressive. The Ryan Reynolds like was huge for me. Yeah,

51:58.420 --> 52:07.380
have it all. I'm not that active on social media. Yeah. I'm too bad. I'm deeply online. Yeah.

52:07.380 --> 52:13.060
I'm deeply deeply online. I actually deleted my Facebook was here, which I'm usually good.

52:13.060 --> 52:20.260
I do the other side is doing. Yeah. I also too many of my friends use it for Facebook events that

52:20.260 --> 52:25.620
I inevitably ignore and make someone tell me they're happening. So yeah. This is the the pro to

52:25.620 --> 52:29.620
having we have been a bunch of different places. Yeah. I'm a place where none of my actual clothes

52:29.620 --> 52:38.180
ran away. Smart. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it sucks to like to promote music or comedy though. We have to

52:38.180 --> 52:46.340
be on it. That we have to be on it on social media. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It does suck. If I did like a 95,

52:46.340 --> 52:51.140
I wouldn't have a, I wouldn't have anything. I think you would. I would maybe have be real. I think

52:51.140 --> 52:58.340
you would. I think you would still post jokes for the love of the game. I've never felt so

52:58.340 --> 53:03.780
seen. My therapist again doesn't like I do really want to have her on the show. But I feel like

53:03.780 --> 53:09.300
that's some kind of hip-hop. That is so sort of, yeah. That would not apply. Yeah. Well, we could

53:09.300 --> 53:14.980
like blur her face and you know, just change her voice. Yeah. In that case, you could just have anyone

53:14.980 --> 53:21.860
be there. Yeah. My brother-in-law got his therapy license. I might have him on. Yeah. I also think she

53:21.860 --> 53:28.420
would say no. Yeah. Of course. She 100% would say no. Yeah. Everyone, I know we have to wrap things up.

53:28.420 --> 53:33.620
But every one I meet NLA who's in therapy, I'm like, what's your therapist name? And then if they

53:33.620 --> 53:39.460
don't say, I would just want to know if I have the same therapist as anybody I know. So far. Interesting.

53:39.460 --> 53:46.020
Yeah. That's a choice. Grace cut that out. Thanks so much for listening to this episode of

53:46.020 --> 53:51.940
the headgun podcast or watching in the New York studio. And we're doing a couple more of these

53:51.940 --> 54:00.980
tomorrow. Yeah. It's got a big old New York batch. Laura Party. Nice. No. You're having engaged.

54:02.980 --> 54:07.380

54:07.380 --> 54:25.620
doll's folks. Nice.

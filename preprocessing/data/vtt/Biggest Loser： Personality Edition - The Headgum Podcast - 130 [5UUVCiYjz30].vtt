WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Yeah, that's for my big job, right?

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
At October 28th,

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
That's what I can get it over with.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Let's make the content that we have to make.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
We're banking episodes.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
So a lot of it has to do with getting work done.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
That's how it feels to me.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
At least is like,

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Oh, like the holidays are coming up.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Let's get some episodes in the bag.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
That way I'm not stressed at the beginning

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
and end of December.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
I can take some time fucking off for once, right?

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
And so you want to make sure that those are dated.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
So when people listen to them in November and December,

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
they know that it's not something that happened recently.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
I mean, again, I can edit freely too.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
So, you know, this is just so you guys know how I'm feeling.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah, I'd like to make it in.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Just feel a void stress,

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
but you seem very stressed.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
I am.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Yeah.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
But you're saying it would be more stressful to record over the holidays.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
It'd be more stressful to get six episodes done in two weeks.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
The first two weeks of December.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
I see.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Yeah.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
So now you're stressed now instead of during December 3rd.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Right.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Yeah.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Which is kind of huge for me.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Yeah.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
You got Cory Peter Lane on the fucking show.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Yeah.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
This is a rare occurrence where I have,

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
like some of my comedian best friends on the show.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I see.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Usually, it's y'all.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Best friends.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Cory's one of my best friends.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
I'd say that I'm one of them.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Jeffrey's best friends.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Never heard of Cory.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I don't talk to you about my personal life because you don't offer

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
the same in George.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I know George for sure.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
That's because he interned for you.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
You only know people you work with.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
And well, so we met through Jeff, like all those guys.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
The crew, basically.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
The crew.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Right.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Oh yeah, Riley.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Riley worked here a lot.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Yeah.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Cory hasn't really come up so for him to be your best friend feels.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
I mean, Cory, would you say that Jack is your best friend?

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Jake definitely knows about Cory.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
I'll say that.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Thanks for watching me for having to answer that question.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
I match people's level of intimacy.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Right.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
So, and vulnerability.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
They give me a lot.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Like Kayla talks to me about her emotions.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
I'll do the same.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
She knows more about me than you do.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
And she's only known me for a year and a half.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
I'm kind of feeling like we should talk more than that.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
We should, because they feel like you would offer that up.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
But I'm your sort of...

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
I want to know.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
I want to know less about you and for you to know less about you.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
So, I think what I've done is somehow not very much, but still too much.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
That makes sense.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
And then we got Alik Khan on the sex and I'm your boobin' cell on the sex.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
The couch potatoes.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Nice.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Do we have an end?

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
I don't think it's cool to have a name.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
I think we're just just...

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
We're just Jeffrey and Cory and the couch potatoes.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
You never hear of a band that's two people's proper names and then the blinks.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Right.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Like Matt and Kim and the couch potatoes.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
And Kim and Toro.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
And the couch potatoes.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
What's another example?

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
George and John and the Beatles.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
It'd be fun if like Simon and Garfunkel and Hall and Oats.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
That's like they did like a treat...

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
A quadr...

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Quadr...

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Quadr...

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Yeah.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Do you guys have a voice of God Mike today?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
We sure do.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
I feel like you guys like music.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yeah.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
No, but I mean like specifically our knowledge

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
able about knee-sure music the most.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Thanks, Jeff.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Thanks, Jeff.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
And this is a compliment coming for me.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
What would you love up as a quad?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Uh...

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Sunny and Cher and...

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
You want two more?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Sunny and Cher and Sunny Bono and Bono.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Bono and Bono.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Bono.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Bono.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Bono.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Bono.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Cher and Sunny and Bono.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
That's cool.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
That's really cool actually.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Cross-be-end stills and Nash and Bono.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
That's really when that doesn't work because it is Cross-be-still's Nash

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
and Young, so you're just adding a hand.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Yeah.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
But that's not funny.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Yeah.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Like that's pretty funny.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
His comments do serve a purpose but I don't think that they would be as popular if they

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
were Cross-be-end stills and Nash and Bono.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
And we would still love a comma is not like a famous grammatical debate.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Yeah.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Oxford comma.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Yeah.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
I'm Pearl Oxford comma.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
That's the comma beforehand.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Also, I would say that the smartest people in the world would say use the Oxford

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
comma.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Yeah.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
That's why I would agree with that.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Yeah.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Because we're all from Oxford.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
We all went to Oxford.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
To New York School.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
It lives in Oxford.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
And my brother-in-law and sister met at Oxford University.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Oh my god.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Oh my god.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Oh my god.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
They would see Tom York walking around all the time.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Who cares?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Who cares?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Who cares?

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
Someone you know is someone met Saw Tom York?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
No interaction.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
No.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
That's so removed, man.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
No.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
It's nice to see famous people walking about.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Sure.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
It's nice for us.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
But to hear that someone else did is a non-starter.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Yeah.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Back to the best friend sort of thing.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Yeah.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
I was fascinated by that.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
I was that didn't know.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
That came out of nowhere, right?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
That was like.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
That is cool.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
You guys been one on one time.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
That's cool that I think you're one of my best friends.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
No.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
No.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
I think that it's cool that your sister-in-law saw Tom York.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
You said that they pulled away.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
And I'm like, that's awesome.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
It's not.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
They saw him once.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
It's they would see him every day.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
That's really cool.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Yeah.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
I don't believe this.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
Going to the cafe shop and looking angry, I think.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
There's that Tom York song.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I don't know the title, but it's like now.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
You know who your real friends are.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Creep.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
No.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
How do you guys know each other?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I love to know your origins.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Yeah.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
I mean, this is just out of the blue for like have you ever heard of Corey?

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
I mean, I love that I know you now.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Yes.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Yeah.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
But I don't.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
You would have feel like I don't talk about you.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
You don't have to talk about me.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
No.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I don't talk about you at my job.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Corey currently works at the CDC.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
I do.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
No.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Let's talk boosters because I just got one that knocked me the fuck out.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I just got one and I didn't have any side effects.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
So they didn't work.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
You got the placebo.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Which I think they're giving out.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Yeah.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
They're giving them a sugar juice.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Yeah.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
How do you guys meet?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
We were fast friends.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
We met at a party.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Well, we met first.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
And you see LA through vaguely college comedy.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
And then didn't see each other for like three years.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
He had short short hair.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Yeah.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
And like clean shaven.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Yeah.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Remember meeting him.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
We were in a sketch.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Yeah.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
And you had long hair and sort of a facial hair.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
And then Jeff over the last few years sort of.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
So you do know sort of single white female in you.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Yeah.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Yeah.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Yeah.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
I did.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
As you guys get closer to you.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
One another.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
And together like.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Somebody compliments my outfit on my way in here.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
It's me.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Thank you.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Sorry.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I was actually kind of nervous.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
The only people by the way.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
At the studio at all are the people in this room.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
No.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
There's a lot of other people here on the way.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
There's lots of people outside.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Tom York was here.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I just didn't even think to mention it.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
And I did put on an outfit.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
I think Jeffrey dresses really nicely.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Interesting.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
I really needed to fuck him in here with that.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Yeah.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
And then I got your way before you.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
And you came in here like pretty late.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
But I was like get out of your cool car in your cool outfit.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
And I was like shit.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Yeah.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
That's cool.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
But what is he compensating for?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Interesting.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Yeah.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Like why are you just afraid to wear plain clothes and drive a normal car?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Exactly right.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Which you do.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
So I have to imagine yours.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
I mean, that's true.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
I'm sort of norm core.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Like, or a t-shirt and drive a Mazda.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
I think if you wore Chuck Taylor's, you'd be norm core.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
But the shoes make it feel like, oh, he's not confident.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Interesting.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
You also, I don't know what voice it is that you use.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
But use.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I'll wear a t-shirt and drive a Mazda.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Yeah.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
You are wearing a t-shirt.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
And you do drive a Mazda.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Yeah.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
You said it as if you were not trying hypothetical.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Yeah.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
I have to point out the promise that you made to the listeners that you made good on

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
just now, which is you'd wear the my cousin Vinny T-shirt.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Oh, yeah.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
You know what?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
And it wasn't even intentional.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Wow.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
That's really cool.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Yeah.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Thank you.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Actually, what do you kiss me after this?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
What is this?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
The rotisserie?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Is it like a chicken plate?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Yeah.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
It's a rotisserie chicken drum.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
It's a good.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
It's a hipster Zanko.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Anyway.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
It's a very hilarious.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
I feel like Beck talked about Zanko chicken.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
So Zanko is a chicken.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
And this and La saw Beck once.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
In Oxford?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Oxford.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
You can go to Oxford shirt.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
For sure.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Yeah.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
And then we met at a house party years later.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
And then I was like, I know.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
You and I don't really know anyone else at this party.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
And then we came to the head of the office that night.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Played back with him.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
No one here.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
The one here because it was over here of sunset.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
This was recent.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
And then we played basketball, I drunkenly fell into one of the agave plans, stabbed my thumb.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
It was hard to masturbate for a bit.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
And then we talked about that.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
So it was the only noticeable difference.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
And then he hosted the show and we went up on your roof.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
And we went up on my roof.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
We just had an S&H 9.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
It was kind of a wildly romantic night.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Yeah.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Meadowed a party came here to play basketball and then ended up drunk on the roof.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Yeah.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
And the injury too.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
It's various stars for it.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Yeah.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Yeah.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Yeah.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
And then I dropped it.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
I dropped it.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
I dropped it.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
We also found out that we lived like three blocks from trailers.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Who had a mirror?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
I'm here.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
I'm here.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Wow.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
It's fine.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
This show is the show to have that happen on.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Right.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Yeah.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
So weirdly nice.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
It's because he knows I don't listen to the podcast.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
His personality inside the podcast.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
He has to be outside of podcast, Jeff.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
For me right now.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
I see.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
I mean, that happens every time we have a guest for the show.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
But we found out that we lived in the same little like Canyon area.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I was going to say where, but you still live there.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
I don't.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Anyway.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
And I was like, oh, we should be friends.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
And then we became friends.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
He invited me to do stand up for the first time.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
And his garage.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
And then we merely met a party.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
What's that?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
It's rare to make a friend at a party.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Yeah.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
That's what a party is for.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Parties usually for hanging out with people that you already know.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
I rarely create new friendships at these social gathering.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
That's fair.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
I also had just broken up with my girlfriend of four years.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Like two weeks before we write.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Okay.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
So you were both available for a new connection.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
And I was like, I'm just my.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
He's friends with my front house neighbors.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
And they're like, we're going to go to a party.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
And I was like, you know what?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
I'm single.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
I'm going to go to a party.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Wow.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
You have this incredible romantic night with Jeff.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Yeah.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Have you guys seen each other since?

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Oh.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Oh.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
You really want to be good together for the last year.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
And I just seemed like the right way to do it.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And then we almost got arrested and Williamsburg.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
We got an exaggeration together.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Yeah.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
We got cited for drinking in public.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
What were you doing in New York?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
I do comedy.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I was doing a show at Union Hall.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Wow.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Yeah.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
And yeah, we were out there in like November, December.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Yeah.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
January.

12:13.000 --> 12:13.500
January.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.500
Yeah.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.500
Yeah.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.500
March.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.500
It was.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.500
It was behind.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.500
Yeah.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.500
It was really cool.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.500
And they pulled us over and Jeffrey gave them his ID.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.500
And then I gave them my student ID and a fake address.

12:25.500 --> 12:26.500
That's cool.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.500
I felt really cool.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.500
You shouldn't say that on the record.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.500
Oh, yeah.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.500
I forgot that a lot of NYPD love audio.

12:34.500 --> 12:40.500
Our biggest demos are Toronto San Francisco Bay Area New York Police Department.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.500
Yeah.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.500
Yeah.

12:42.500 --> 12:47.500
Um, we do have to move on.

12:47.500 --> 12:56.500
Let's keep it going with everybody's bond of the week.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.500
Let's start with Ali.

12:57.500 --> 12:58.500
Okay.

12:58.500 --> 12:59.500
Who do you got?

12:59.500 --> 13:00.500
This might be crazy.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.500
And this idea just popped in my head now.

13:02.500 --> 13:03.500
So I'm sorry if someone's already set it.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.500
Okay.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.500
Should we go bond?

13:05.500 --> 13:06.500
Muppet?

13:06.500 --> 13:07.500
Wow.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.500
That was good.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.500
Really?

13:09.500 --> 13:10.500
Yeah.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.500
That's really good.

13:13.500 --> 13:14.500
Yeah.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.500
Like maybe it's a Michael Cain's bond.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.500
Everybody else is a Muppet.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.500
That's good.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.500
And then who?

13:21.500 --> 13:22.500
Okay.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.500
And we should say Michael Cain's never been James Bond.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.500
No.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.500
But he has been Ebenezer's crew.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.500
She's been top of mind recently for me for other reasons.

13:31.500 --> 13:32.500
What's that reason?

13:32.500 --> 13:37.500
Because it's nowhere near like the holidays or anything.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.500
I was trying to plan a group costume for Halloween.

13:40.500 --> 13:44.500
And I was like wouldn't it be really good if we were all Ebenezer's

13:44.500 --> 13:45.500
Scruges.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.500
But my George is being Ebenezer's crew.

13:47.500 --> 13:48.500
Really?

13:48.500 --> 13:49.500
Yeah.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.500
Okay. So it's in the air.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.500
Yeah.

13:51.500 --> 13:55.500
But here's the problem is that my like this doesn't matter budget.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.500
Like a men's night cap.

13:57.500 --> 13:58.500
That's sorry.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.500
I keep bumping this.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.500
That's a triangle.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.500
It's really, it's really expensive.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.500
It's $28 to buy a men's night cap.

14:05.500 --> 14:08.500
And not that I can't, not that I can't afford it.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.500
But also it's like I'm never going to wear it.

14:10.500 --> 14:11.500
Yeah.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.500
How much should that cost?

14:13.500 --> 14:15.500
I would pay $10.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.500
Men's night cap.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.500
Yeah.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.500
Because you'll never have to literally throw it away out there.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.500
No.

14:21.500 --> 14:22.500
I will say.

14:22.500 --> 14:27.500
If you are still able to get it today, I can ask George if he found one yet.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.500
Or if that's his costume for tonight.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.500
And then if not, go in on it.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.500
It's 14 bucks.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.500
Okay.

14:33.500 --> 14:34.500
Which is much closer to your price.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.500
No.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.500
Yeah.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.500
That's negotiable.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.500
Yeah.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.500
Bond of the week.

14:41.500 --> 14:45.500
We do the segment where ever since Daniel Craig was out as Bond, we cast our, we love

14:45.500 --> 14:47.500
up our casting options for the next James.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.500
Okay.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.500
Past for now.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.500
Okay.

14:50.500 --> 14:51.500
On you and Casey.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.500
What do you guys think?

14:53.500 --> 14:55.500
Do you have something?

14:55.500 --> 14:56.500
Okay.

14:56.500 --> 14:57.500
Hear me out.

14:57.500 --> 14:58.500
Yeah.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.500
Bond.

14:59.500 --> 15:00.500
Bond.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.500
No.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.500
Bond.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.500
Bond.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.500
That's really good.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.500
I want to bond with the sunglasses that kind of just keep going.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.500
Yeah.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.500
And he's so annoying.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.500
Yeah.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.500
He shows up everywhere everyone's like, oh, yeah.

15:13.500 --> 15:14.500
He's in the movie.

15:14.500 --> 15:17.500
And then, oh, like the soundtrack is about you too.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.500
Yeah.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.500
Right.

15:19.500 --> 15:20.500
They would not have gotten that without him.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.500
Right.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.500
The, the Bond song is like the worst song you've ever heard.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.500
And it's just like already preloaded on your phone.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.500
It's so wonderful.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.500
Yeah.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.500
That's really good.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.500
Okay.

15:31.500 --> 15:32.500
I have one.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.500
A rebrand of a classic music festival.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.500
Bondaroo.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.500
Oh.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.500
Yeah.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.500
And then who's playing Bond?

15:39.500 --> 15:40.500
Uh, so.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.500
Seven thousand people in Tennessee.

15:42.500 --> 15:43.500
Yeah.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.500
In a, in a muddy field.

15:45.500 --> 15:46.500
In 70.

15:46.500 --> 15:47.500
So it's like this.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.500
Yes.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.500
Smashing Pumpkins Bond.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.500
Yeah.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.500
Yeah.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.500
And the, the, the,

15:52.500 --> 15:53.500
The, the,

15:53.500 --> 15:54.500
The,

15:54.500 --> 15:55.500
The,

15:55.500 --> 15:56.500
The,

15:56.500 --> 15:57.500
The,

15:57.500 --> 15:58.500
The,

15:58.500 --> 15:59.500
The,

15:59.500 --> 16:00.500
The,

16:00.500 --> 16:03.500
The,

16:03.500 --> 16:05.500
Yeah.

16:05.500 --> 16:06.500
Um,

16:06.500 --> 16:07.500
That's good.

16:07.500 --> 16:12.500
That would be fun if it was almost like every seen as a different band or performer.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.500
Um,

16:14.500 --> 16:15.500
My,

16:15.500 --> 16:18.500
John Runner's Week is peersp Pokémon.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.500
He's already been right,

16:19.500 --> 16:20.480
Bond,

16:20.480 --> 16:21.500
Streets,

16:21.500 --> 16:23.500
Back,

16:23.500 --> 16:26.500
Alright.

16:26.500 --> 16:30.220
and then coming back, I'm going to kill myself.

16:30.220 --> 16:34.780
He gave the culmination speech at my university.

16:34.780 --> 16:36.100
That's cool.

16:36.100 --> 16:39.460
I went to your graduation, not the one.

16:39.460 --> 16:40.980
Yeah, that's cool.

16:40.980 --> 16:43.220
My brothers, both my brothers went to UCLA.

16:43.220 --> 16:44.460
Well, you did the graduation.

16:44.460 --> 16:46.780
They're older than I.

16:46.780 --> 16:47.860
Okay, they're in their 40s.

16:47.860 --> 16:48.820
Yeah, I wasn't there then.

16:48.820 --> 16:50.620
95, 99.

16:50.620 --> 16:52.660
I dated somebody went to UCLA,

16:52.660 --> 16:54.700
and so I went to your graduation,

16:54.700 --> 16:56.660
but at different, at the calm school.

16:56.660 --> 16:57.180
Right.

16:57.180 --> 17:00.660
And so their graduation speaker,

17:00.660 --> 17:02.580
what their commencement speaker, whatever,

17:02.580 --> 17:04.780
was the CEO of Sugar Fina.

17:04.780 --> 17:05.980
Yeah.

17:05.980 --> 17:09.500
So that's cool Peter Spross, and it was yours, yeah.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.980
But I was like, when I was shooting bomb,

17:11.980 --> 17:13.780
I was like, this is awesome.

17:13.780 --> 17:15.780
This person was like, yeah,

17:15.780 --> 17:20.060
like I kind of stumbled into owning a candy company.

17:20.060 --> 17:22.620
And it was so clear she came from generational wealth.

17:22.620 --> 17:24.100
Yeah.

17:24.220 --> 17:27.460
Anyway, um, bond of the week,

17:27.460 --> 17:28.740
yours are never interesting.

17:28.740 --> 17:30.060
Well, wow.

17:30.060 --> 17:32.380
On your talking about the bond song,

17:32.380 --> 17:35.100
got me thinking maybe the bond song

17:35.100 --> 17:37.500
should be a parody of the song song.

17:37.500 --> 17:38.340
Okay.

17:38.340 --> 17:39.180
Maybe the song.

17:39.180 --> 17:43.380
So a Cisco style bond.

17:43.380 --> 17:48.380
So it's the pop singer, Cisco as bond,

17:48.380 --> 17:52.140
doing a song, parody called the bond song.

17:52.140 --> 17:53.380
But bond, bond, bond, bond.

17:53.380 --> 17:54.700
Exactly.

17:54.700 --> 17:55.540
That song's on.

17:55.540 --> 17:56.540
That was boring.

17:56.540 --> 18:00.940
So he doesn't quite remember it, but sure.

18:00.940 --> 18:02.860
Delish recently published an article

18:02.860 --> 18:05.620
about the 35 holiday pop recipes

18:05.620 --> 18:08.020
that I'll get you re-invited year after year.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.420
I'd like to talk about some recipes

18:09.420 --> 18:11.620
that will get you uninvited indefinitely.

18:11.620 --> 18:12.460
Okay.

18:12.460 --> 18:13.300
Yeah.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.540
Thinking spam, chowder.

18:16.540 --> 18:20.140
weren't you supposed to show your ass on Twitter today?

18:20.140 --> 18:22.660
Maybe a congrats on your 10k was finished?

18:22.660 --> 18:23.660
Yeah.

18:23.660 --> 18:25.940
I just think of that because when I think of spam,

18:25.940 --> 18:29.180
chowder, I think about game chowder.

18:29.180 --> 18:30.020
The gams lie.

18:30.020 --> 18:32.420
I'm not going to bear my ass on the internet.

18:32.420 --> 18:33.500
I'm not going to do it.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.620
Got it.

18:34.620 --> 18:35.300
What do you guys think?

18:35.300 --> 18:36.340
What gets you uninvited?

18:40.340 --> 18:44.860
Uninvited from, uh, I think that I recently

18:44.860 --> 18:47.820
had to make fake goo for a sketch.

18:47.820 --> 18:51.580
And so I just died putting green.

18:51.580 --> 18:52.860
But then it wasn't gooey enough.

18:52.860 --> 18:56.820
So I put a whole box of cornstarch in it.

18:56.820 --> 18:58.020
And then I ate some of it.

18:58.020 --> 18:58.860
See what it tastes like.

18:58.860 --> 19:00.900
And it was so vile.

19:00.900 --> 19:04.620
So if I brought that, just green goo.

19:04.620 --> 19:05.460
Yeah.

19:05.460 --> 19:06.300
Sugar goo.

19:06.300 --> 19:07.420
Like Mary Embroja.

19:07.420 --> 19:07.780
Yeah.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.260
Exactly.

19:09.260 --> 19:11.460
I think that I would not be invited back.

19:11.460 --> 19:12.540
Like what do you think?

19:12.540 --> 19:14.220
You know, I don't trust recipes

19:14.220 --> 19:16.460
that have the word surprise in the title.

19:16.460 --> 19:17.460
That's not what I'm looking for.

19:17.460 --> 19:18.460
Yeah.

19:18.460 --> 19:19.460
That's a surprise.

19:19.460 --> 19:20.460
It's a surprise.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.460
Yeah.

19:21.460 --> 19:22.460
It's a surprise.

19:22.460 --> 19:24.460
It's not what I'm looking for.

19:24.460 --> 19:25.460
Yeah.

19:25.460 --> 19:26.460
It's a surprise.

19:26.460 --> 19:27.460
It's vile.

19:27.460 --> 19:28.460
Yeah.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.460
Casino is also a bad one for it.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.460
I think.

19:31.460 --> 19:32.460
Claims.

19:32.460 --> 19:33.460
Casino.

19:33.460 --> 19:34.460
And even Rockefeller.

19:34.460 --> 19:35.460
Yeah.

19:35.460 --> 19:38.460
Anything shellfish related with a additive word.

19:38.460 --> 19:39.460
Anything delight?

19:39.460 --> 19:40.460
Yeah.

19:40.460 --> 19:41.460
These are all in the same bit.

19:41.460 --> 19:42.460
Yeah.

19:42.460 --> 19:44.460
What about crock pot and possible meat?

19:45.460 --> 19:52.460
That's like, that's like a set of words that should activate a sleeper cell.

19:52.460 --> 19:53.460
Yeah.

19:53.460 --> 20:00.460
Cause impossible meat is already sort of pre-cooked, right?

20:00.460 --> 20:03.460
Like if you ate impossible burgers raw, would you get sick?

20:03.460 --> 20:05.460
No, because it's vegetables.

20:05.460 --> 20:07.460
What about impossible tartar?

20:07.460 --> 20:08.460
That's really good.

20:08.460 --> 20:09.460
Oh.

20:09.460 --> 20:10.460
Impossible.

20:10.460 --> 20:11.460
Carpathio.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.460
Yeah.

20:12.460 --> 20:15.460
We've got mashed tomatoes.

20:15.460 --> 20:16.460
Pretty bad.

20:16.460 --> 20:19.460
Although kind of what ketchup is.

20:19.460 --> 20:20.460
Yeah.

20:20.460 --> 20:21.460
Or pasta sauce.

20:21.460 --> 20:22.460
Yeah.

20:22.460 --> 20:24.460
But you bring like a side of tomato.

20:24.460 --> 20:25.460
Yeah.

20:25.460 --> 20:27.460
Just a big bowl of.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.460
Yeah.

20:28.460 --> 20:29.460
I got, I brought this gaspacho.

20:29.460 --> 20:32.460
It's more like a sweet gaspacho with like some malt vinegar.

20:32.460 --> 20:34.460
It just is ketchup.

20:34.460 --> 20:35.460
Yeah.

20:35.460 --> 20:37.460
Grinola.

20:37.460 --> 20:39.460
This is to like the potluck.

20:39.460 --> 20:41.460
You bring Grinola?

20:41.460 --> 20:42.460
Yeah.

20:42.460 --> 20:44.460
I forgot that we're saying bad stuff.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.460
How's about the dunk on you?

20:46.460 --> 20:47.460
So fucking hard.

20:47.460 --> 20:49.460
I know people who make their own Grinola.

20:49.460 --> 20:50.460
It seems to be not worth it.

20:50.460 --> 20:52.460
I haven't gotten on that train.

20:52.460 --> 20:53.460
It's like oats.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.460
Plus all this other stuff.

20:54.460 --> 20:55.460
And then you bake it.

20:55.460 --> 20:56.460
And then you have Grinola.

20:56.460 --> 20:57.460
Oats and other.

20:57.460 --> 20:59.460
Grinola is almost as cheap as oats.

20:59.460 --> 21:01.460
So like you're not really saving anything.

21:01.460 --> 21:05.460
Would you say that Grinola is breakfast checks mixed?

21:06.460 --> 21:08.460
I'd refrain from saying bad stuff.

21:08.460 --> 21:11.460
I would have read it.

21:11.460 --> 21:16.460
I think that it's very a Grinola the adjective to make your own Grinola the noun.

21:16.460 --> 21:17.460
I don't know.

21:17.460 --> 21:19.460
And I think that's where it comes from now.

21:19.460 --> 21:20.460
Yeah.

21:20.460 --> 21:21.460
Well, no Grinola's a verb.

21:21.460 --> 21:23.460
Your Grinola egg, Boats.

21:23.460 --> 21:24.460
Mmm.

21:24.460 --> 21:25.460
Like that truth.

21:25.460 --> 21:26.460
No, no way.

21:26.460 --> 21:29.460
Like buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo.

21:29.460 --> 21:31.460
Let's go around all six of us.

21:31.460 --> 21:34.460
And just kind of say the first and last name of the most Grinola person we've ever seen.

21:34.460 --> 21:39.460
Grinola person we've ever slept with.

21:39.460 --> 21:42.460
I think it'll be.

21:42.460 --> 21:43.460
I'm not going to sit.

21:43.460 --> 21:44.460
I'll believe it out.

21:44.460 --> 21:46.460
But I think it's.

21:46.460 --> 21:47.460
All right.

21:47.460 --> 21:48.460
Shew tiger.

21:48.460 --> 21:50.460
My favorite thing about you.

21:50.460 --> 21:53.460
Is that you in this person you just mentioned.

21:53.460 --> 21:54.460
Yeah.

21:54.460 --> 21:55.460
Is is that.

21:55.460 --> 21:57.460
I didn't know that you two were sleeping together.

21:57.460 --> 22:00.460
And I expressed romantic interest in her.

22:00.460 --> 22:03.460
And you said and I quote, go for it, man.

22:03.460 --> 22:06.460
And you were actually sleeping together.

22:06.460 --> 22:09.460
I was like, I was like, okay.

22:09.460 --> 22:10.460
Yeah.

22:10.460 --> 22:12.460
That was before we like became exclusive.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.460
So I was like, yeah, if you want.

22:14.460 --> 22:15.460
Best friends.

22:15.460 --> 22:16.460
Yeah.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.460
What the fuck were we talking about?

22:18.460 --> 22:19.460
We don't have to do that.

22:19.460 --> 22:22.460
A recent fortune article poses the question.

22:22.460 --> 22:25.460
Can you get addicted to melatonin?

22:25.460 --> 22:29.460
The answer according to the article is not really.

22:29.460 --> 22:31.460
That's the entire article.

22:31.460 --> 22:32.460
Yeah.

22:32.460 --> 22:39.460
It's really good that an Ivy League nepotism baby got to make $25,000 writing that out.

22:39.460 --> 22:42.460
Not really.

22:42.460 --> 22:45.460
I also thought you said fortune weird.

22:45.460 --> 22:48.460
According to fortune.

22:48.460 --> 22:52.460
Per the tasting table, less is more when using Sardinian cured tunar.

22:52.460 --> 22:53.460
It's talk about it.

22:53.460 --> 22:55.460
I don't know what any of those things are.

22:55.460 --> 22:58.460
Sardinian can you got a branch out?

22:58.460 --> 23:00.460
I can't eat those.

23:00.460 --> 23:01.460
I'm sorry.

23:01.460 --> 23:04.460
I just think like, I would love to see you have a new hobby.

23:04.460 --> 23:07.460
I feel like Ellie, the last time you were talking about taking a new hobby.

23:07.460 --> 23:08.460
Yeah.

23:08.460 --> 23:10.460
I don't exactly remember what it was, but we were talking about it.

23:10.460 --> 23:12.460
It's just something that could get me some cash.

23:12.460 --> 23:13.460
That's what it was.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.460
Monetizing.

23:14.460 --> 23:15.460
Joy.

23:15.460 --> 23:18.460
It was how do I monetize joy, which I think is really interesting.

23:18.460 --> 23:20.460
Maybe I'll start selling men's nightcaps.

23:20.460 --> 23:21.460
Me caps?

23:21.460 --> 23:22.460
Nightcaps?

23:22.460 --> 23:23.460
No.

23:23.460 --> 23:24.460
My caps.

23:24.460 --> 23:26.460
I'm screwed.

23:26.460 --> 23:27.460
Yeah.

23:27.460 --> 23:29.460
You'll be like a prosthetics.

23:29.460 --> 23:35.460
Or it's you selling like summer 2020 era bottled cocktails.

23:35.460 --> 23:38.460
But really gendering whiskey.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.460
Boy drink.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.460
Yum, boy town.

23:42.460 --> 23:44.460
And we also have a gin drink.

23:44.460 --> 23:45.460
Girl.

23:45.460 --> 23:52.460
And then this one I want to talk about all together.

23:52.460 --> 23:54.460
How do winter highs?

23:54.460 --> 23:55.460
Hydrangeas.

23:55.460 --> 23:56.460
What do we think?

23:57.460 --> 23:58.460
Hydrangeas.

23:58.460 --> 24:01.460
How do winter high name?

24:01.460 --> 24:06.460
I just think of it's a wonderful life where she's like in the hydrangea bushes.

24:06.460 --> 24:11.460
My big takeaway is that this article is by Carol J. Michelle.

24:11.460 --> 24:17.460
And then who I can only assume is like a DJ with lowercase clueless.

24:17.460 --> 24:20.460
Like he is clueless.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.460
Clueless.

24:21.460 --> 24:25.460
Every time we record in the studio on a Friday morning, I don't eat breakfast.

24:25.460 --> 24:27.460
And then I have a huge pint of cold brew.

24:27.460 --> 24:28.460
And my face starts vibrating.

24:28.460 --> 24:29.460
And I'm getting shoes.

24:29.460 --> 24:30.460
Okay.

24:30.460 --> 24:32.460
This article starts vibrating.

24:32.460 --> 24:33.460
For me first two lines.

24:33.460 --> 24:35.460
This is the same thing as the melatonin.

24:35.460 --> 24:38.460
Where you don't have to do much to prepare for winter.

24:38.460 --> 24:41.460
I don't even prune my hydrangeas in the fall.

24:41.460 --> 24:42.460
Yeah.

24:42.460 --> 24:43.460
And they have a link.

24:43.460 --> 24:45.460
Can Hydrangeas survive for us?

24:45.460 --> 24:46.460
Yes.

24:46.460 --> 24:47.460
Sure.

24:47.460 --> 24:48.460
Um.

24:48.460 --> 24:50.460
How are you guys at keeping plants alive?

24:50.460 --> 24:51.460
Not good.

24:51.460 --> 24:52.460
Uh, poor.

24:52.460 --> 24:53.460
Getting better.

24:53.460 --> 24:54.460
But yeah.

24:54.460 --> 24:58.460
The plants that my ex gave me when they broke up with me.

24:58.460 --> 25:00.460
No.

25:00.460 --> 25:01.460
Um.

25:01.460 --> 25:04.460
The ones that she gave me right before she broke up with me.

25:04.460 --> 25:05.460
And then left LA forever.

25:05.460 --> 25:06.460
Um.

25:06.460 --> 25:07.460
There are still a lot.

25:07.460 --> 25:08.460
Oh, that's good.

25:08.460 --> 25:10.460
But I like haven't watered them in a while.

25:10.460 --> 25:11.460
I kind of want them to die.

25:11.460 --> 25:12.460
I'm like.

25:12.460 --> 25:13.460
I need to move on.

25:13.460 --> 25:14.460
Uh.

25:15.460 --> 25:17.460
From the swans.

25:17.460 --> 25:20.460
From the winterizing hydrangeas.

25:20.460 --> 25:22.460
Like when should you?

25:22.460 --> 25:23.460
Is my big question?

25:23.460 --> 25:24.460
Yeah.

25:24.460 --> 25:25.460
I guess the question.

25:25.460 --> 25:27.460
The golden question is why when to ride side ranges.

25:27.460 --> 25:28.460
Right.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.460
And it seems like the answers you don't have to over.

25:30.460 --> 25:31.460
Yeah.

25:31.460 --> 25:32.460
Oh, they don't need much extra attention.

25:32.460 --> 25:33.460
Good.

25:33.460 --> 25:34.460
Okay.

25:34.460 --> 25:35.460
So it's the same.

25:35.460 --> 25:36.460
Have you ever been picked?

25:36.460 --> 25:38.460
Don't look at me and say that word.

25:38.460 --> 25:40.460
We've already discussed this offline.

25:40.460 --> 25:41.460
Sorry.

25:41.460 --> 25:43.460
And I should have blown up at you.

25:43.460 --> 25:46.460
Because you know, sex positivity and all that shit.

25:46.460 --> 25:48.460
But you needle me.

25:48.460 --> 25:50.460
And at a certain point, I'm going to have to push back.

25:50.460 --> 25:51.460
Yeah.

25:51.460 --> 25:52.460
I'm poking prod to get this.

25:52.460 --> 25:53.460
Because it's sort of like there he is.

25:53.460 --> 25:54.460
Yeah.

25:54.460 --> 25:55.460
Wait, right?

25:55.460 --> 25:56.460
What's what's meddling?

25:56.460 --> 25:58.460
Is that like pegging?

25:58.460 --> 25:59.460
Yeah.

25:59.460 --> 26:00.460
But it's in here deck.

26:00.460 --> 26:01.460
Cool.

26:01.460 --> 26:02.460
Really.

26:02.460 --> 26:03.460
Yeah.

26:03.460 --> 26:04.460
That's a name.

26:04.460 --> 26:05.460
It's sounding.

26:05.460 --> 26:06.460
We've been talking a lot about sounding on the podcast.

26:06.460 --> 26:07.460
Have you?

26:07.460 --> 26:08.460
Actually, that was review.

26:08.460 --> 26:09.460
Yeah.

26:09.460 --> 26:10.460
Wait.

26:10.460 --> 26:11.460
Sound.

26:11.460 --> 26:12.460
Sound.

26:13.460 --> 26:15.460
Is when use.

26:15.460 --> 26:18.460
For lack of a better term.

26:18.460 --> 26:19.460
Fuck.

26:19.460 --> 26:20.460
You're your read through.

26:20.460 --> 26:21.460
Yeah.

26:21.460 --> 26:22.460
With like a metal rod.

26:22.460 --> 26:24.460
Why is that called sounding?

26:24.460 --> 26:25.460
Yeah.

26:25.460 --> 26:27.460
And I don't understand why people do it.

26:27.460 --> 26:28.460
I've never tried it.

26:28.460 --> 26:30.460
But there's no way that's pleasurable.

26:30.460 --> 26:31.460
Is it painful?

26:31.460 --> 26:32.460
It's probably a pain thing.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.460
There's a lot of people who are real.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.460
And this is coming from a sex positive place.

26:36.460 --> 26:38.460
Totally real fucked up in the head.

26:38.460 --> 26:39.460
Yeah.

26:39.460 --> 26:40.460
Stop it.

26:40.460 --> 26:41.460
Bad.

26:42.460 --> 26:44.460
People who should be criminals.

26:44.460 --> 26:45.460
Yeah.

26:45.460 --> 26:48.460
But I have heard that it's sort of like a runners high thing.

26:48.460 --> 26:50.460
Where if you sound for long enough.

26:50.460 --> 26:51.460
Just run.

26:51.460 --> 26:54.460
It starts to feel you get that dopamine rush.

26:54.460 --> 26:56.460
My chest is now vibrated.

26:56.460 --> 26:57.460
Yeah.

26:57.460 --> 26:58.460
Eat food, I guess.

26:58.460 --> 26:59.460
Yeah.

26:59.460 --> 27:00.460
Before having caffeine.

27:00.460 --> 27:01.460
Great.

27:01.460 --> 27:02.460
And it's also a lot of caffeine.

27:02.460 --> 27:04.460
It's probably the equivalent of four.

27:04.460 --> 27:05.460
Four coffees.

27:05.460 --> 27:07.460
Four black coffees that you're drinking.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.460
A pint of concentrate like that.

27:09.460 --> 27:10.460
Yeah.

27:10.460 --> 27:11.460
The point of best friends.

27:11.460 --> 27:12.460
I literally did the same thing.

27:12.460 --> 27:15.460
I drink a cup of coffee at my house.

27:15.460 --> 27:16.460
Eight nothing.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.460
Came here.

27:17.460 --> 27:18.460
I had a cup of coffee and a seltzer.

27:18.460 --> 27:19.460
Yeah.

27:19.460 --> 27:20.460
I'm really buzzing.

27:20.460 --> 27:21.460
I'm buzzing.

27:21.460 --> 27:22.460
And I'm in your beesing.

27:22.460 --> 27:23.460
I saw you doing that.

27:23.460 --> 27:24.460
I'm beesing.

27:24.460 --> 27:25.460
Yeah.

27:25.460 --> 27:26.460
And I did mushrooms last night.

27:26.460 --> 27:27.460
Did you actually?

27:27.460 --> 27:28.460
Just a little.

27:28.460 --> 27:29.460
That's good.

27:29.460 --> 27:30.460
I'll link grow.

27:30.460 --> 27:31.460
Have you ever packed somebody?

27:31.460 --> 27:32.460
No.

27:32.460 --> 27:33.460
Okay.

27:33.460 --> 27:37.460
We do have to take a quick break.

27:37.460 --> 27:39.460
You guys have an HR department.

27:40.460 --> 27:42.460
The HR department is Marty.

27:42.460 --> 27:45.460
And that's a real fucking problem.

27:45.460 --> 27:48.460
I'll be right back.

27:48.460 --> 27:54.460
This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.

27:54.460 --> 27:59.460
Guys, do you ever wish that life came with a user manual?

27:59.460 --> 28:00.460
I know I have.

28:00.460 --> 28:04.460
You know, sometimes when you're trying to make a decision or dealing with something difficult

28:04.460 --> 28:08.460
and your interpersonal relationships, you wish you could just be handed the answer.

28:08.460 --> 28:09.460
Right?

28:09.460 --> 28:16.460
Or at least handed a guide of filling the blank style piece that could help you get to the right answer.

28:16.460 --> 28:19.460
Well, that's where therapy comes in.

28:19.460 --> 28:26.460
And BetterHelp online therapy is the next best thing to a user manual for life.

28:26.460 --> 28:29.460
Because unfortunately, life doesn't come with a user manual.

28:29.460 --> 28:30.460
Right?

28:30.460 --> 28:32.460
So when it's not working for you, it's normal to feel stuck.

28:32.460 --> 28:37.460
And navigating any of life's challenges can help you make you feel unsure whether it's a career

28:37.460 --> 28:40.460
or a new relationship or becoming a parent.

28:40.460 --> 28:45.460
Therapists are trained to help you figure out the cause of challenging emotions and learn productive coping skills,

28:45.460 --> 28:52.460
which makes therapy the closest thing to a guided tour of the complex engine called you.

28:52.460 --> 28:54.460
I'm in therapy every week.

28:54.460 --> 28:55.460
I've said it before.

28:55.460 --> 28:56.460
I'll say it again.

28:56.460 --> 29:01.460
If you have access to it and BetterHelp makes it easier financially and otherwise.

29:01.460 --> 29:04.460
To therapy, I think you owe it to the people around you.

29:04.460 --> 29:06.460
To go through that process.

29:06.460 --> 29:07.460
To learn more about yourself.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.460
To learn more about your emotional body.

29:09.460 --> 29:13.460
So you can show up for those around you as the best version of yourself you can be.

29:13.460 --> 29:18.460
As the world's largest therapy service, BetterHelp has matched 3 million people with professionally licensed

29:18.460 --> 29:20.460
and vetted therapists available 100% online.

29:20.460 --> 29:21.460
Plus, it's affordable.

29:21.460 --> 29:24.460
Just fill out a brief questionnaire to be matched with a therapist.

29:24.460 --> 29:27.460
And if things aren't clicking, you can easily switch to a new therapist at any time.

29:27.460 --> 29:29.460
It could not be simpler.

29:29.460 --> 29:33.460
No waiting rooms, no traffic, no endless searching for the right therapist.

29:33.460 --> 29:37.460

29:37.460 --> 29:38.460
Again, that's BetterHelp.

29:38.460 --> 29:40.460
H-E-L-P dot com slash what's that?

29:40.460 --> 29:42.460
Thanks, BetterHelp.

29:46.460 --> 29:50.460
Well, this is a fucking segment that I like to call.

29:50.460 --> 29:53.460
What the cool kids are into speaking of Narcan.

29:53.460 --> 29:56.460
H-E-L-H-L-P,

30:01.460 --> 30:04.460
A reason, I guess, we should wait for this on.

30:05.460 --> 30:07.460
No one having anxiety attack.

30:07.460 --> 30:10.460
Yeah, you picked a really anxiety at least.

30:14.460 --> 30:16.460
And it's starting again?

30:16.460 --> 30:17.460
Oh, good.

30:19.460 --> 30:20.460
You really do look on the well on that.

30:20.460 --> 30:22.460
That's not ideal for me,

30:22.460 --> 30:28.180
Yeah, I want to look hot because I don't, yeah, anyway.

30:28.180 --> 30:29.540
Do I look good?

30:29.540 --> 30:30.380
No, you look great.

30:30.380 --> 30:31.380
Kidding me?

30:31.380 --> 30:33.980
Do you think you're gonna eat after this episode

30:33.980 --> 30:34.820
and before the next episode,

30:34.820 --> 30:38.540
or just keep riding the caffeine thing until three, four feet?

30:38.540 --> 30:41.060
I'm not gonna eat before the second episode.

30:41.060 --> 30:42.540
See, you'll look worse then.

30:42.540 --> 30:44.180
Yeah.

30:44.180 --> 30:45.780
Yeah, see the face of God.

30:45.780 --> 30:46.620
Yeah.

30:48.900 --> 30:52.420
This is a, well, I read in New York Times,

30:52.420 --> 30:54.660
the article called about the cool kids are super into.

30:54.660 --> 30:56.620
And they were talking about perfectly imperfect,

30:56.620 --> 31:00.260
which is a cult newsletter for downtown taste makers.

31:00.260 --> 31:04.140
And they held, you guys were looking at me like,

31:04.140 --> 31:05.340
you do not care.

31:05.340 --> 31:07.220
Or you want to hurt me physically.

31:07.220 --> 31:09.820
New's letter for downtown taste makers.

31:09.820 --> 31:11.340
He's a mother's DNA.

31:13.820 --> 31:16.460
So we're just not gonna talk about the high-drainages at all.

31:18.420 --> 31:19.420
I can't, yeah.

31:19.420 --> 31:21.420
I bought some hydrangeas at Trader Joe's

31:21.420 --> 31:23.660
and I put them in two phases of my house.

31:23.660 --> 31:24.780
I bought flowers for myself.

31:24.780 --> 31:25.620
That's cool.

31:25.620 --> 31:26.260
I think it's nice.

31:26.260 --> 31:27.100
It's an act of self-lapse.

31:27.100 --> 31:28.100
Yeah, radical.

31:28.100 --> 31:29.260
Yeah, no radicals.

31:29.260 --> 31:30.740
Nobody buys boys' flowers.

31:30.740 --> 31:31.580
Let's show them.

31:31.580 --> 31:32.580
Let's show them.

31:32.580 --> 31:34.100
What's you're gonna play?

31:34.100 --> 31:34.940
No.

31:34.940 --> 31:35.780
No.

31:35.780 --> 31:36.780
No.

31:36.780 --> 31:37.780
No.

31:37.780 --> 31:40.140
Um, this, it's, so it's sort of like,

31:40.140 --> 31:41.340
I don't know, the village voice,

31:41.340 --> 31:43.260
but hip or younger and knee-sure.

31:43.260 --> 31:44.260
Um.

31:44.260 --> 31:46.260
Fuck you guys.

31:46.260 --> 31:47.260
What?

31:47.260 --> 31:48.900
We're fucking listening to you.

31:49.860 --> 31:52.020
Again, I want to know.

31:53.660 --> 31:55.540
As a friendly and a big ol'.

31:55.540 --> 31:56.500
I need a flag ol'.

31:56.500 --> 31:57.340
Yeah.

31:57.340 --> 31:58.220
What's that?

31:58.220 --> 32:00.060
Bagels are too much bread.

32:00.060 --> 32:01.980
Flagels of flatter things.

32:01.980 --> 32:02.820
Yeah.

32:02.820 --> 32:04.260
You're fucking jittery man.

32:04.260 --> 32:05.460
You're scaring me.

32:05.460 --> 32:06.060
Yes.

32:06.060 --> 32:07.260
Just a jitter bug.

32:07.260 --> 32:08.060
Jitter bug.

32:08.060 --> 32:08.900
Not guys.

32:10.900 --> 32:14.340
So this fucking guy started this new cult newsletter

32:14.340 --> 32:15.820
talking to like, younger people.

32:15.820 --> 32:16.500
You're gonna be a part of that.

32:16.500 --> 32:17.180
Yes.

32:17.180 --> 32:18.860
My heart is beating fast.

32:19.380 --> 32:21.380
I was supposed to get cholesterol blood worked

32:21.380 --> 32:22.980
on this morning and I slept through it.

32:22.980 --> 32:23.500
Uh-huh.

32:23.500 --> 32:24.020
Yes.

32:24.020 --> 32:25.340
That's probably for the bath.

32:25.340 --> 32:30.340
I have FH, which is the meal hyper-colystralemia.

32:30.340 --> 32:33.220
My LDL is through the fucking roof on you.

32:33.220 --> 32:34.060
Is that the good one?

32:34.060 --> 32:34.580
No.

32:34.580 --> 32:36.060
It's all, uh-huh.

32:36.060 --> 32:40.420
272 MLDG by Dpergees or something.

32:40.420 --> 32:40.780
Yeah.

32:40.780 --> 32:42.500
The normal is under 200.

32:42.500 --> 32:43.020
Got it.

32:43.020 --> 32:44.900
Should we all pitch real quick on how to fix that?

32:44.900 --> 32:47.380
I think we should pitch on how to let me out of my fucking misery.

32:49.820 --> 32:52.140
I think that if you were really, really sick

32:52.140 --> 32:55.420
and you wanted to be a youth in Asia

32:55.420 --> 32:57.740
and you said, I'm the only, like, Corey,

32:57.740 --> 32:59.420
I need you to do this and you proved it.

32:59.420 --> 33:02.020
Like you did, yeah, I think I could kill you.

33:02.020 --> 33:04.580
If, if it helped you.

33:04.580 --> 33:06.380
I agree, but I think there's so many people

33:06.380 --> 33:08.180
that want to kill me like,

33:08.180 --> 33:09.180
truly homicide.

33:09.180 --> 33:10.860
You wouldn't want to take that opportunity away.

33:10.860 --> 33:13.660
If you're like, look, this will fuck up, Corey,

33:13.660 --> 33:14.500
for a long time.

33:14.500 --> 33:15.340
This will be awesome.

33:15.340 --> 33:18.180
This will be one third for a handful of four.

33:18.180 --> 33:19.020
I don't know.

33:19.020 --> 33:19.500
Name them.

33:19.500 --> 33:20.820
You, I guess.

33:20.820 --> 33:22.740
I'll take a stab, but I don't need to have

33:22.740 --> 33:24.820
go whole hog if somebody else wants to do it.

33:24.820 --> 33:27.260
I don't think youth in Asia is like stabbing someone.

33:27.260 --> 33:28.100
Oh, no.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.060
Interesting.

33:30.060 --> 33:30.900
Okay.

33:30.900 --> 33:32.380
I'll hear you out.

33:32.380 --> 33:33.220
Sorry, man.

33:33.220 --> 33:34.740
For the last few years, the cult newsletter

33:34.740 --> 33:35.900
perfectly imperfect is offered

33:35.900 --> 33:38.460
to window into the changing guard of New York City's downtown scene

33:38.460 --> 33:40.780
with a deceptively simple premise.

33:40.780 --> 33:42.540
Cool people like cool things.

33:44.540 --> 33:45.900
I'm a sad person.

33:45.900 --> 33:47.820
And they say the New York Times is a failing

33:47.820 --> 33:57.100
institution started during the longest days of the pandemic.

33:57.100 --> 34:01.180
The newsletters start offers highly curated recommendations

34:01.180 --> 34:05.900
from on the Cusp taste makers and aspiring asthites,

34:05.900 --> 34:08.820
including the synth pop singer Jake Lazovic,

34:08.820 --> 34:09.980
never heard of them.

34:09.980 --> 34:12.460
The Canadian painter Chloe Wise loved the name.

34:12.460 --> 34:12.980
Really?

34:12.980 --> 34:13.180
Yeah.

34:13.180 --> 34:14.180
Okay, cool.

34:14.180 --> 34:15.940
The model, Nica Odo.

34:16.020 --> 34:19.380
And the euphoria actress Chloe Cherry, who?

34:19.380 --> 34:20.180
Two Chloe's.

34:20.180 --> 34:20.780
Yeah.

34:20.780 --> 34:22.380
My, yeah.

34:22.380 --> 34:22.900
What?

34:22.900 --> 34:26.300
Oh, I was just going to just also say two Chloe's

34:26.300 --> 34:28.060
and then really not comment on it.

34:28.060 --> 34:29.300
I'm going to put more.

34:29.300 --> 34:31.140
Put more succinctly.

34:31.140 --> 34:32.340
Clues.

34:32.340 --> 34:32.860
Nice.

34:32.860 --> 34:34.300
Thank you.

34:34.300 --> 34:36.100
If I'm the newsletters said, I don't want to see

34:36.100 --> 34:38.140
even full of myself or anything, but perfectly imperfect

34:38.140 --> 34:40.340
is probably the most sprawling, cultural document

34:40.340 --> 34:43.820
of who and what was cool during the time we're in right now.

34:43.820 --> 34:45.060
Incredibly realistic.

34:46.020 --> 34:49.700
Also how many cultural documents are attempting

34:49.700 --> 34:52.020
to cover the moment that we're in right now?

34:52.020 --> 34:55.980
It's like, we're much better than, yeah, National Geographic.

34:55.980 --> 34:58.700
Specifically south of 10th in New York.

34:58.700 --> 35:02.300
Like, and then, so then the article sort of

35:02.300 --> 35:05.020
give us all these people a platform like this is an example,

35:05.020 --> 35:09.780
Harrison Patrick Smith, 26 indie pop prince for the dare.

35:09.780 --> 35:11.700
And then he says, August by Taylor Swift,

35:11.700 --> 35:13.260
I really like the Taylor Swift song, Karma.

35:13.260 --> 35:14.020
I think it's a great song.

35:14.020 --> 35:16.380
And like, has a paragraph about what he thinks is cool.

35:16.380 --> 35:20.500
This long-winded nonsense has been me being like,

35:20.500 --> 35:22.220
what do you guys think is cool?

35:22.220 --> 35:24.860
Mostly you too, because I feel like with you,

35:24.860 --> 35:25.700
it doesn't count.

35:25.700 --> 35:27.380
On you and Casey, I think it also counts,

35:27.380 --> 35:28.780
but they're a cusp.

35:28.780 --> 35:29.620
Oh my god.

35:29.620 --> 35:30.460
Oh my god.

35:30.460 --> 35:31.300
Oh my god.

35:31.300 --> 35:33.140
Oh my god.

35:33.140 --> 35:35.620
Their cusp was that supposed to mean.

35:35.620 --> 35:38.100
They're not as old as me, but like, I'm a Sagittarius,

35:38.100 --> 35:39.100
but Scorpio cusp.

35:39.100 --> 35:41.460
Like, I am a Sagittarius, but I'm on the cusp of Scorpio.

35:41.460 --> 35:42.820
That's why I'm so good at sex.

35:42.820 --> 35:45.500
I'm a Gemini and a Taurus cusp.

35:45.500 --> 35:49.100
And that's why, I don't know, a lot of girls

35:49.100 --> 35:50.940
who that matters to it's bad.

35:50.940 --> 35:51.940
Oh my god.

35:57.940 --> 36:00.180
I just want to say that I'm looking over your shoulder

36:00.180 --> 36:02.660
and I can see their ages.

36:02.660 --> 36:07.220
And I do want to commit acts of violence

36:07.220 --> 36:09.620
for every person that's younger than me on this.

36:09.620 --> 36:12.460
Most of them are 26 or 27, which is a great age

36:12.460 --> 36:13.300
to be.

36:13.300 --> 36:14.660
It's older than me.

36:14.660 --> 36:16.500
I think there's like 24 and 23 years.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.900
I can start because I'm kind of interested in that.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.300
And this is earnest.

36:20.300 --> 36:21.100
OK.

36:21.100 --> 36:22.900
For once.

36:22.900 --> 36:26.380
And I kind of styled it like the way that they did.

36:26.380 --> 36:29.220
So my thing is investing in glassware.

36:29.220 --> 36:32.660
You can find really great sets of high-quality vintage glassware

36:32.660 --> 36:35.220
on Etsy that elevate any drink you make at home.

36:35.220 --> 36:37.980
I also think at least in LA, it's more about having people

36:37.980 --> 36:38.740
over to your house now.

36:38.740 --> 36:41.220
It is than going out, which is probably a product

36:41.220 --> 36:45.100
of the dust finally settling on the post post-vax era of hedonism.

36:45.100 --> 36:48.460
I picked up a set of six diamond pattern crystal rocks glass

36:48.460 --> 36:50.220
as on Etsy for $59.

36:50.220 --> 36:53.580
And I know I'll probably have them for the next decade or more.

36:53.580 --> 36:55.500
That's a quote that you gave to yourself.

36:55.500 --> 36:56.500
Yeah.

36:56.500 --> 36:58.340
I found it a call.

36:58.340 --> 37:00.700
I found it a call.

37:00.700 --> 37:02.060
I love that the premise of this show

37:02.060 --> 37:05.580
is that you have the opportunity to come up with a succinct

37:05.580 --> 37:08.300
response to your own question.

37:08.300 --> 37:10.140
And then Bob, the medical people.

37:10.140 --> 37:12.340
We didn't have that to write down.

37:12.340 --> 37:15.300
I haven't been thinking about it for the last day.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.740
But nice.

37:16.740 --> 37:20.980
So in 45 words or less, what have you been doing

37:20.980 --> 37:22.660
that's cool and how?

37:22.660 --> 37:23.180
Yeah.

37:23.180 --> 37:24.940
You're still not to be so succinctly.

37:24.940 --> 37:28.060
So you're saying that post-post-vaccine is like,

37:28.060 --> 37:30.300
when the vaccine first came out, people were going out

37:30.300 --> 37:34.460
and being hedonistic, like in the summer of 2021 or whatever.

37:34.460 --> 37:35.300
Yep.

37:35.300 --> 37:37.060
And the dust has already settled on that.

37:37.060 --> 37:41.300
And people are moving back towards a home party environment.

37:41.300 --> 37:44.460
And thus, they're investing more in how swear?

37:47.340 --> 37:50.620
I think that it's also coming at a time in our lives

37:50.620 --> 37:53.140
where we're valuing those sorts of things.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.460
We're like, yeah, the pandemic, we were like,

37:55.460 --> 37:57.140
oh, I really wish that I could go out.

37:57.140 --> 37:59.340
Yeah, because that's when we would have been going up.

37:59.340 --> 38:02.500
And now it's like, oh, we're, yeah,

38:02.500 --> 38:03.980
we can have a dinner party.

38:03.980 --> 38:08.340
And we're not having it under the premise that this is the only thing

38:08.340 --> 38:09.540
we're actually allowed to do.

38:09.540 --> 38:10.020
Yeah.

38:10.020 --> 38:11.900
Like we could do a decision to stay home.

38:11.900 --> 38:13.340
Yeah, we're supposed to be forced to stay home.

38:13.340 --> 38:16.260
I also feel like that's a reflection of your age in a good way.

38:16.260 --> 38:20.380
We're like, okay, I kind of hit like my early mid 20s window

38:20.380 --> 38:22.620
and let's get some good play.

38:22.620 --> 38:23.900
Yeah, I agree.

38:23.900 --> 38:25.900
Let's figure out what my style is in my kitchen.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.540
Who am I at this party?

38:27.540 --> 38:29.340
My style is Italian air.

38:30.180 --> 38:31.980
H-H-H-H-H.

38:31.980 --> 38:34.340
So you're like, yeah, okay, not air.

38:34.340 --> 38:38.060
Yeah, your passionately wealthy Italian estate owner, right.

38:38.060 --> 38:40.300
With glassware and China to match.

38:40.300 --> 38:41.180
Love it.

38:41.180 --> 38:42.460
And so, as far as generational wealth,

38:42.460 --> 38:45.260
how is that wealth, like, you know,

38:45.260 --> 38:47.980
kept during like the 1930s, 1940s?

38:47.980 --> 38:48.980
Yeah.

38:48.980 --> 38:54.380
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

38:54.380 --> 38:56.380
How was that maintainer?

38:56.380 --> 38:56.940
I thought.

38:56.940 --> 39:03.440
We've, we've almost never do this, but we have to take another break.

39:03.440 --> 39:05.940
This is so fucked up.

39:05.940 --> 39:06.940
Oh, right.

39:06.940 --> 39:07.940
Yeah.

39:15.940 --> 39:18.940
What I will say is the man I was specifically thinking of, uh,

39:18.940 --> 39:23.940
R.O. Montenar, aka John Goldberger, is a Jewish Italian man.

39:23.940 --> 39:25.940
R.O. Montenara.

39:25.940 --> 39:26.940
Montenari.

39:26.940 --> 39:27.940
No.

39:27.940 --> 39:28.940
Okay.

39:28.940 --> 39:30.940
I just wanted to make sure it wasn't a generational thing.

39:30.940 --> 39:31.940
Yeah.

39:33.940 --> 39:39.940
Welcome to the biggest loser personality addition.

39:39.940 --> 39:42.940
Introducing our judges.

39:42.940 --> 39:43.940
On you.

39:43.940 --> 39:44.940
Okay.

39:44.940 --> 39:45.940
Speedkaser.

39:45.940 --> 39:46.940
Great.

39:46.940 --> 39:49.940
And well, me.

39:49.940 --> 39:52.940
Let's be our contestants.

39:53.940 --> 39:55.940
Amir Blumenfeld.

39:55.940 --> 39:58.940
Kind of the fan favorite to win this.

39:58.940 --> 40:01.940
Ali Khan, not quite sure why she's on this show.

40:01.940 --> 40:04.940
Not the episode of the podcast, but this specifically.

40:04.940 --> 40:08.940
And Cory Peter Lane could go either way.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.940
Um, this is biggest loser personality addition.

40:11.940 --> 40:14.940
So, uh, the judge panel is made up of me on your Casey.

40:14.940 --> 40:19.940
I'm going to ask you guys a series of probing questions that are going to sort of

40:20.940 --> 40:22.940
get to the bottom of how big a loser y'all are.

40:22.940 --> 40:23.940
Okay.

40:23.940 --> 40:27.940
And, uh, this is for genuinely a hundred dollars cash.

40:27.940 --> 40:28.940
Oh, hell yeah.

40:28.940 --> 40:29.940
Yeah.

40:29.940 --> 40:30.940
This is like, I will.

40:30.940 --> 40:31.940
Yeah, I will then go you a hundred dollars.

40:31.940 --> 40:33.940
It's, it is funny because Amir needs that money the less.

40:33.940 --> 40:34.940
The least out of the three of us.

40:34.940 --> 40:36.940
So it goes to the biggest loser.

40:36.940 --> 40:37.940
Yeah.

40:37.940 --> 40:39.940
Also, according to financial charts, you are a millionaire.

40:39.940 --> 40:41.940
I want to make that clear.

40:41.940 --> 40:42.940
Yeah.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.940
Um, anyway.

40:44.940 --> 40:47.940
Uh, it's uncomfortable to talk about money.

40:47.940 --> 40:48.940
Uh, I'm fine talking about it.

40:48.940 --> 40:49.940
That's because you don't have any money.

40:49.940 --> 40:50.940
Yeah.

40:50.940 --> 40:51.940
I don't have any.

40:51.940 --> 40:52.940
I don't mind talking about it.

40:52.940 --> 40:53.940
Yeah.

40:53.940 --> 40:54.940
You guys.

40:54.940 --> 40:55.940
Yeah.

40:55.940 --> 40:58.940
So I'm going to throw this and answer in a way that reflects really poorly on me,

40:58.940 --> 40:59.940
because I love that hundred dollars.

40:59.940 --> 41:00.940
Exactly.

41:00.940 --> 41:01.940
Okay.

41:01.940 --> 41:02.940
Um, here we go.

41:02.940 --> 41:03.940
What's your guilty?

41:03.940 --> 41:04.940
Oh, and then.

41:04.940 --> 41:05.940
So they're going to answer the questions.

41:05.940 --> 41:06.940
Right.

41:06.940 --> 41:09.940
And then the three of us have to be like, which one of that is the biggest loser answer?

41:09.940 --> 41:10.940
Great.

41:10.940 --> 41:12.940
That's kind of what I do all day.

41:12.940 --> 41:15.940
So instead of silently judging us, you're going to have to actually sit up.

41:16.940 --> 41:18.940
What's your guiltyous pleasure?

41:18.940 --> 41:25.940
Uh, what's my guiltyous pleasure?

41:25.940 --> 41:27.940
Daily fantasy basketball.

41:27.940 --> 41:30.940
Oh, you're making it so easy.

41:30.940 --> 41:32.940
Yeah, I do.

41:32.940 --> 41:33.940
Um, do you have one?

41:33.940 --> 41:34.940
I'm thinking.

41:34.940 --> 41:35.940
Yeah, I do.

41:35.940 --> 41:40.940
Um, I love videos on TikTok of kids falling down or giving her.

41:40.940 --> 41:43.940
Like, it's mad with a plastic bag.

41:43.940 --> 41:45.940
The America's funniest home videos, though.

41:45.940 --> 41:48.940
But like, cinema very day.

41:48.940 --> 41:52.940
Like, like, do the one of the guy who like kicked a fake soccer ball in a string and then the

41:52.940 --> 41:57.940
Russian looking lady went to kick it and missed and then fell on her ass.

41:57.940 --> 41:58.940
No.

41:58.940 --> 42:02.940
I want to kind of circle back to the Russian looking lady.

42:02.940 --> 42:03.940
I love these.

42:03.940 --> 42:06.940
You, you got a little bit of Russian looking.

42:06.940 --> 42:10.940
It seemed Russian, but it might have just been a Russian looking lady.

42:10.940 --> 42:11.940
Right.

42:11.940 --> 42:15.940
I've been getting into like, I get very like hyper fixated on certain pop culture figures.

42:15.940 --> 42:18.940
And then I deep dive sometimes for months at a time right now.

42:18.940 --> 42:19.940
It's Carrie Fisher.

42:19.940 --> 42:22.940
So I'm reading every single novel Carrie Fisher's ever in.

42:22.940 --> 42:24.940
Wow.

42:24.940 --> 42:25.940
Wow.

42:25.940 --> 42:27.940
So, you know, I'm putting adding that to the table.

42:27.940 --> 42:28.940
That's really good.

42:28.940 --> 42:30.940
I think that's cool.

42:30.940 --> 42:32.940
I think that's neutral.

42:32.940 --> 42:36.940
And I think that daily, but fantasy anything is kind of.

42:37.940 --> 42:40.940
You suck.

42:40.940 --> 42:42.940
Well, you're just one judge.

42:42.940 --> 42:43.940
I like 40.

42:43.940 --> 42:44.940
Yeah.

42:44.940 --> 42:47.940
Because, you know, sports is relatively at least cool.

42:47.940 --> 42:48.940
It's cool to watch.

42:48.940 --> 42:49.940
It's cool to better.

42:49.940 --> 42:50.940
Or be in them.

42:50.940 --> 42:51.940
Yeah.

42:51.940 --> 42:52.940
Yeah.

42:52.940 --> 42:53.940
It's really cool to be in sports.

42:53.940 --> 42:54.940
Yeah.

42:54.940 --> 42:55.940
To be in athlete would be cool.

42:55.940 --> 42:56.940
Yeah.

42:56.940 --> 42:58.940
Do you, what do you do when there's no basketball happening?

42:58.940 --> 43:02.940
A lot's different sport like football or tennis.

43:02.940 --> 43:04.940
On your Casey.

43:05.940 --> 43:11.940
I'm going to have to say the biggest loser in this category is, is Corey.

43:11.940 --> 43:16.940
It's the only because it's, it's a very passive thing.

43:16.940 --> 43:21.940
A mayor's active, you know, setting lineups.

43:21.940 --> 43:23.940
Ali is learning.

43:23.940 --> 43:26.940
And Corey is laughing at other people's pain.

43:26.940 --> 43:27.940
Interesting.

43:27.940 --> 43:28.940
Children's pain.

43:28.940 --> 43:29.940
Children's pain specifically.

43:29.940 --> 43:32.940
So that's a loser activity if you ask.

43:32.940 --> 43:35.940
And you know, Casey's telling the truth, because you guys just met.

43:35.940 --> 43:37.940
So he's not like trying to be polite to you.

43:37.940 --> 43:38.940
Right.

43:38.940 --> 43:39.940
Yeah.

43:39.940 --> 43:40.940
So, sorry.

43:40.940 --> 43:41.940
When you meet someone, you're not trying to be polite.

43:41.940 --> 43:43.940
I feel like I get rude or the more I know someone.

43:43.940 --> 43:45.940
Fearing this means it's real honesty.

43:45.940 --> 43:47.940
Otherwise he would just be like, I think.

43:47.940 --> 43:48.940
I mean, yours is the worst.

43:48.940 --> 43:50.940
Because like, we go back the furthest of that make.

43:50.940 --> 43:51.940
Yes.

43:51.940 --> 43:52.940
Yeah.

43:52.940 --> 43:53.940
Yeah.

43:53.940 --> 43:54.940
He doesn't, there's no, there's no.

43:54.940 --> 43:55.940
We could never see each other again.

43:55.940 --> 43:57.940
And you could just tell me how you really feel.

43:57.940 --> 43:59.940
And I appreciate the honesty.

43:59.940 --> 44:00.940
The candor.

44:00.940 --> 44:01.940
Yeah.

44:01.940 --> 44:03.940
That's not for me because I break her right here.

44:03.940 --> 44:05.940
My boyfriend also loves to watch.

44:05.940 --> 44:07.940
Little children getting hurt on the internet.

44:07.940 --> 44:09.940
And I think it's really messed up.

44:09.940 --> 44:10.940
Mm-hmm.

44:10.940 --> 44:11.940
But that's not the cat.

44:11.940 --> 44:12.940
It's not like who's is most messed up.

44:12.940 --> 44:13.940
Yeah.

44:13.940 --> 44:14.940
There's most messed up.

44:14.940 --> 44:17.940
Fantasy anything to me is an automatic.

44:17.940 --> 44:18.940
It's a no.

44:18.940 --> 44:19.940
One for a mirror.

44:19.940 --> 44:20.940
All right.

44:20.940 --> 44:21.940
Let's fair.

44:21.940 --> 44:22.940
What's the last thing you googled on your phone?

44:22.940 --> 44:23.940
Look it up right now.

44:23.940 --> 44:24.940
Ooh.

44:24.940 --> 44:25.940
This is fun.

44:25.940 --> 44:26.940
Hey.

44:26.940 --> 44:27.940
I found.

44:27.940 --> 44:28.940
All right.

44:28.940 --> 44:30.940
That's a mirror for this one.

44:31.940 --> 44:33.940
Oh, whoa.

44:33.940 --> 44:36.940
How to donate cash when your dick is big.

44:36.940 --> 44:37.940
That's me.

44:37.940 --> 44:38.940
Whoa.

44:38.940 --> 44:41.940
Well, here we are.

44:41.940 --> 44:44.940
Uh, I got a bunch of good ones.

44:44.940 --> 44:46.940
Some of them are boring.

44:46.940 --> 44:47.940
Just the most recent one.

44:47.940 --> 44:48.940
Thanks so much.

44:48.940 --> 44:50.940
The most recent one just says TW.

44:50.940 --> 44:51.940
And I don't know why.

44:51.940 --> 44:52.940
Charger warning?

44:52.940 --> 44:53.940
Yeah, maybe.

44:53.940 --> 44:55.940
The one before that is king of wishful thinking,

44:55.940 --> 44:57.940
which is a song I wanted to hear on YouTube.

44:57.940 --> 44:59.940
Adam Sandler movies streaming.

44:59.940 --> 45:02.940
Hahaha.

45:02.940 --> 45:03.940
Uh.

45:03.940 --> 45:07.940
I think you don't even have to say anything.

45:07.940 --> 45:10.940
Yeah, um, mine is vangenberg launch schedule.

45:10.940 --> 45:12.940
What the fuck is vangenberg.

45:12.940 --> 45:15.940
So there's a military base in like,

45:15.940 --> 45:16.940
Get off of it.

45:16.940 --> 45:17.940
Wait.

45:17.940 --> 45:22.940
I need to explain that they launched a satellite yesterday.

45:22.940 --> 45:23.940
Space X.

45:23.940 --> 45:24.940
Yeah.

45:24.940 --> 45:26.940
But I didn't know that was happening.

45:26.940 --> 45:30.740
And she and you and Lee like thought we were not to get new

45:31.540 --> 45:33.540
Like Korea

45:33.540 --> 45:38.340
And I was watching because the way that we were like, is that a plane that's not a plane and it had like a jet stream

45:38.340 --> 45:41.540
It was a rocket and I was like I accepted it

45:41.540 --> 45:45.300
Like the idea of you holing up in our little our old neighborhood

45:45.300 --> 45:49.060
Your well your neighborhood which is like very much so like a secluded area

45:50.180 --> 45:54.860
Looking up in this guy and having nuclear anxiety is that your loser for that by going to

45:57.540 --> 45:59.540
You're doing

46:02.340 --> 46:05.540
They're nuking a chic east side neighborhood

46:08.940 --> 46:10.940
On your case. You what do you think?

46:12.220 --> 46:17.780
Do you have one ready? You'll go ahead. Okay. Oh, I have a question for Cory if that's a lab

46:21.380 --> 46:25.940
In the in the moment when you thought you were going to die. How did you feel?

46:26.940 --> 46:32.540
Well, I actually had just had lunch with a friend who I hadn't seen in a while and it was a yummy lunch

46:32.540 --> 46:37.260
And we were hanging out with his dog and I did have the thought like this is okay

46:38.820 --> 46:42.940
It's a nice way to go. Yeah, you've experienced the most fun part of your life

46:43.540 --> 46:47.500
Now we can call it a day and you might be missing out because everybody's dying

46:47.780 --> 46:50.780
Everybody's dying, but it's not even that it was the most fun. It was just that that was like oh

46:50.780 --> 46:52.780
That's what these it's these little moments

46:53.340 --> 46:59.980
It's beautiful. Yeah, I'd have to say because of that answer because of accepting your mortality

46:59.980 --> 47:02.220
Is a great personality trait

47:02.620 --> 47:04.620
So I'm gonna have to go with a mirror on this one

47:07.900 --> 47:09.900
I'm real

47:09.900 --> 47:11.900
It wasn't even fantasy basketball related

47:12.860 --> 47:18.060
Yeah, mine is Cory because I'm not 100% convinced that you don't want to just see what SpaceX is doing

47:18.940 --> 47:27.100
You must fan before you voted me on the off chance. I was googling it just out of curiosity

47:27.660 --> 47:29.660
And I made up the

47:34.700 --> 47:38.140
All right, we got to go through these fast has a partner ever embarrassed you and front of your friends

47:39.980 --> 47:41.980
Yeah

47:41.980 --> 47:43.980
Oh, okay

47:44.700 --> 47:49.180
Forget it most shameful romantic versus experience or sexual

47:50.940 --> 47:55.180
I'm sure prematurely ejaculating at some in some way shape or form

47:58.220 --> 48:00.220
Like cycling through too many

48:01.180 --> 48:07.100
I got walked in on the first time that I'd ever had sex like the first one and it was her best friend

48:08.060 --> 48:15.340
And her best friend's nickname was Kirby so at the point of my first climax I said no Kirby no

48:17.100 --> 48:20.460
You were coming. Yeah, that's what climax means

48:29.980 --> 48:36.940
One time someone came over to my house that was like it was a date and I opened the door and they were

48:36.940 --> 48:41.980
wearing flip flops and I immediately was like oh but then I was like well they're here

48:46.540 --> 48:50.700
That's just embarrassing for them. No, I know well it's embarrassing for me that I would didn't wrap it up

48:52.060 --> 48:56.700
Yeah, I think if his answer wasn't so specifically no Kirby no

48:58.140 --> 49:00.140
I would vote you

49:00.140 --> 49:04.620
So I'm gonna go Cory. Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna have to say Cory's

49:05.260 --> 49:08.300
Essentially living a American pie

49:10.300 --> 49:14.380
Therefore I got to give it to him. Yeah, I don't know why I thought you're gonna say yeah

49:14.380 --> 49:17.340
I think it's clear that Cory is living a bad life

49:18.540 --> 49:21.580
Kind of a loser the title of this game

49:23.740 --> 49:25.740
Yeah, Cory same nice of us to not

49:26.860 --> 49:31.820
We're doing all the men in the world who are listening a real favorite by not acknowledging a mirrors and just saying that that's fine

49:32.060 --> 49:38.700
I don't know if this is a shameful normalizing prematurely Jack. Yeah, but I did when I was in college because

49:39.580 --> 49:42.460
It was hit or miss but I was like, yeah, sometimes I wouldn't last that long

49:42.780 --> 49:45.260
I did get a flashlight trainer thing

49:45.820 --> 49:51.820
Wait, this is your second time getting a flashlight? Yeah, well the first time I didn't actually get it second time telling the story

49:55.020 --> 49:58.060
So yeah, mental out there train brother

49:58.380 --> 50:04.780
I think most men there problem now is that they're all an anti-depressants in it. Yeah. Oh, then get on well butron the happy horny pill

50:04.780 --> 50:06.780
According to the journey for not joining a chill

50:11.180 --> 50:14.140
Michelle filet Michelle filet Michelle filet

50:14.780 --> 50:18.940
Gloria Steinem when called well butron the happy horny pill

50:20.380 --> 50:23.340
In her 90 51 essay yeah mother Teresa

50:25.500 --> 50:27.500
What the dumbest person

50:29.020 --> 50:31.020
The dumbest person you've ever met

50:31.820 --> 50:34.060
Who the fuck is calling me?

50:35.340 --> 50:39.340
Oh, I think it's my phone vibration. What's the dumbest purchase you've ever made?

50:41.340 --> 50:44.700
Probably cryptocurrency related. Yeah

50:45.660 --> 50:53.500
Okay during like early early days of the pandemic I was living with my parents and I was need deep in season one Dickinson and

50:53.820 --> 51:01.660
Hi, I bought a Victorian night gown. I got a brass candle holder and a long candlestick and I walked around my parents house at night

51:02.460 --> 51:07.020
Haunting it was just like a for me to meet so no one else was there

51:08.220 --> 51:10.940
Wow, those are really too hard ones to judge

51:11.660 --> 51:17.660
I want to hear stories for this round, but I am gonna veto any judgment. That's gonna be two things for how

51:19.900 --> 51:21.900
That's crazy

51:22.540 --> 51:24.540
Brass candle hold

51:28.540 --> 51:36.460
I think the dumbest purchase that I made the one that most recently comes to mind is that my cat was peeing on my bed a lot

51:37.260 --> 51:39.260
And I got about a straw

51:42.140 --> 51:44.140
I

51:44.140 --> 51:48.060
I was peeing he was peeing on my bed and I was like well now he like thinks that

51:48.620 --> 51:56.300
The bed is like his litter box, so I'm just gonna get a new bed so I spent like I went I took a nap appointment at the Casper store

51:58.380 --> 52:01.340
You can set up $800 it was like $1300

52:02.380 --> 52:05.100
You're not your for the mattress for the nap appointment

52:07.100 --> 52:09.900
But we should say that you're the CDC making $73,000 a year

52:13.500 --> 52:17.100
I went and took a nap appointment and then was upsold by the mattress person

52:17.340 --> 52:21.340
Got a 12 $1300 mattress and then my cat peed on it day one

52:23.420 --> 52:27.340
And I was like oh cool, so it's not the smell. It's the it's that you're a fucker

52:28.060 --> 52:33.340
Again, that is almost good enough to take the cake for this round, but allies was just better. Yeah, 100%

52:33.820 --> 52:35.820
Biggest sexual insecurity

52:36.620 --> 52:38.620
Why is it always sexual with you

52:39.980 --> 52:45.900
It's probably the same answer. I'm sexy positive. Same answer as the the other sex one. Okay

52:46.540 --> 52:48.540
premature

52:48.540 --> 52:50.540
Planax probably that I'm too good at it

52:51.900 --> 52:55.260
I guess that's pretty cool. You're seeding this round to Corey

52:56.780 --> 52:59.980
I actually have to rethink because I was gonna go for a joke like that

53:01.020 --> 53:04.060
I was gonna say that I enjoy four play too much and I'm too giving

53:05.820 --> 53:07.820
All right skipping this one

53:08.140 --> 53:10.540
We're just thing you've done in front of a mirror this year

53:11.180 --> 53:13.180
Oh

53:14.860 --> 53:22.300
I can answer to start us off. Sure. I've been working on my body. I think it looks really good naked and

53:23.180 --> 53:26.620
I was sort of like I wonder what people see when I'm

53:27.980 --> 53:33.500
In them and so I positioned a mirror and then sort of fucked my bed

53:34.380 --> 53:39.820
To see what that looked like and it looked pretty good. Can we all skip? What could we possibly say?

53:40.620 --> 53:46.140
That's that's the lame or something that what's the meanest thing anyone's ever said to you mine is what he just did

53:51.580 --> 53:53.580
This thing anyone's ever said

53:54.860 --> 53:57.100
Oh, one time somebody it was a teacher

53:58.540 --> 54:03.420
And he said you're not as charming as you think you are you told me that and that's fucked up. Yeah, it's pretty good

54:04.300 --> 54:06.780
Teachers don't like when people kids are charming

54:07.340 --> 54:12.540
I think that sometimes they see a young person who's gonna grow up to be more important than them

54:13.260 --> 54:17.900
And then they're like I'm gonna take you down a peg you heard it here first had gumpodcastfuck teachers

54:17.900 --> 54:20.460
Fuck teachers. Fuck them all. I'm gonna say that every camera

54:21.340 --> 54:23.340
Unless you were gonna private school. Let's see we're gonna

54:26.380 --> 54:28.780
I can't remember a specific mean thing. No, yeah

54:31.020 --> 54:34.860
Is the next round what's the thing that first came to your mind before you started thinking of

54:35.340 --> 54:37.980
The one you were more comfortable saying yeah

54:39.420 --> 54:43.100
Let's skip this one for time. What's the most childish thing you still do?

54:46.940 --> 54:48.940
Play video games okay

54:49.740 --> 54:52.780
Probably like an active Victorian ghost fantasy

54:55.100 --> 54:57.580
I still get cranky and bored

54:59.580 --> 55:01.580
I'll still cry when I'm angry

55:05.260 --> 55:07.260
Okay, my vote's chore on that one

55:08.380 --> 55:15.020
Yeah, throwing a tantrum that's uh, that's a chore for me. I threw a temper tantrum last night because I was like

55:15.740 --> 55:19.660
I didn't plan well enough for my Halloween costume and now I'd have to be hot rod

55:21.260 --> 55:23.260
Yeah, I guess

55:23.260 --> 55:27.100
Fuck you man. What fuck you

55:28.140 --> 55:30.140
Man man

55:31.580 --> 55:33.580
What do you guys think

55:33.660 --> 55:37.340
Casey give it to me. Oh, right. Okay. I'm just kidding. I kind of give it to Jeff

55:40.620 --> 55:44.940
Yeah, uh, have you ever looked a salt lamp? Yes, no, what is that?

55:45.820 --> 55:54.620
It's like uh, like possible. I actually think a mere not knowing what it is makes him like a loser

55:55.420 --> 55:59.260
Salt lamp. Yeah, they're like it's like a himaly and salt lamp. It's like a pink

55:59.900 --> 56:04.220
Rock that you plug in and there's a light bulb inside of it lights up and people who have like

56:04.700 --> 56:06.700
Exima really enjoy it. I think

56:08.060 --> 56:10.060
Exima or is that a personality

56:12.060 --> 56:13.340
This

56:13.340 --> 56:18.540
Maybe I'm just drawing a connection that a lot of my friends who are fighting that Exima fight also have salt lamps

56:18.540 --> 56:20.540
Maybe I'm making it

56:20.540 --> 56:27.100
I also love the way that Amir said a salt lamp imagining a lamp with like an extended magazine on it

56:27.660 --> 56:29.660
I'm quite understand

56:30.220 --> 56:34.460
Rapid fire these last five what's the biggest lie you tell you tell yourself five

56:37.740 --> 56:42.060
It's not gonna get funnier than that uh the biggest loser is Cory. Yes

56:43.420 --> 56:45.420
We do have to wrap it up. So

56:57.580 --> 56:59.580
That was easy

57:04.620 --> 57:06.620
Plus

57:07.420 --> 57:11.980
Sorry just felt what do you guys have going on what do you want to point the people to the floor is yours? Oh

57:12.860 --> 57:15.020

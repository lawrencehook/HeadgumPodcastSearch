00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
That was easy.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
What if you just never played the music and this is how it started?

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
I was sort of like in this headspace today where nothing matters.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Which is dangerous for this show because any...

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
It's already a thesis of nihilism, right?

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Have you seen the form?

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
What's that?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Yes.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I couldn't hear a theme song.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I don't know if you guys can hear it if Jeff gets you.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
No, we couldn't hear it at all.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I couldn't hear it at all.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
I guess that's fine because ultimately it doesn't matter.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
You said, but...

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I guess you're not at least a bit.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
Oh, I played the theme song and that was easy.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
That was easy.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I heard that.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
It's weird because I said nothing matters but it bothers me that it started that way.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
So you're both thinking that nothing matters but then also getting upset because everything does.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Yeah.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Um...

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Please welcome to the show.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
This is her head-gum podcast debut.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Ali, it's a con or...

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Yeah.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
It's con.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
It's con.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Okay.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
It's an offer too.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
I've never read it.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
It's only ever read it on Slack.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
It's hard.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Ali con!

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
We should say it's about...

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
It's about...

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
It's about CON, so you're way off.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
That's why you...

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Um...

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Ali, how long have you been working in head-gum?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
It's been a month now, right?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Yeah, just over a month.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Damn.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
You're kidding.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Who...

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Like, do you have any office...

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Like, rivalries?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Any kind of...

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Alliance is that it formed?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Who do you...

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Like, who do you not like?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Who do you think we should put on the chopping block?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Uh...

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Great question.

02:24.000 --> 02:31.000
I take entering every new job as though I am a newcomer on the tribe and survivor.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
And so these first few weeks, I'm just getting a lay of the land.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
I am an observer.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
I'm feeling everyone's vibes, and I'm cool with everybody.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
But whose vibes are the most sour, even if they're all good?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Because my vote...

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
I think would be...

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
It's you, man.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
You're vibes are the worst.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Maybe you were trying to instigate drama.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
No, no.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
No, no.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
There's already drama.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
That's my point.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
I'm not starting anything.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
There's just already these, like, neuro networks of, like, tension.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Well, okay, yeah.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
I have yet to...

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
I have yet to experience anything that I would deem as sus.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
I think that's so, so far so good.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
I would say on the opposite end of the spectrum,

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
I knew that Marika was cool when she wore a dev petal shirt the other day.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
I mean, I knew you were cool before that, but that was, like, I was, like, confirmed.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Marika, would you ever wear a watch?

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
You would be friends if we met in our world.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
I've run a dev petal, some, like, around the grove, like, three times.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Have you really?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
So 12.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
And handsome.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah, really.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Yeah.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Like gorgeous, gorgeous person.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Did you see him when he was wearing a big time-rush shirt?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
No.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
I would have called you.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
Also, I feel like we should say that Sam last week came into the office for,

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
into the LA office, not last week, two weeks ago.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Time is meaningless.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
And had some great lunch suggestions.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
So she's doing great.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
She's not assess it all.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Yeah, we got sandwiches for two different places.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
And they were both kind of hits.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Really?

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
Also, it was the first time I met her in the two years that I've been working with her.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
So huge, huge day.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Sam innocent.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Yeah, I guess.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I guess Sam's pretty cool.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
And Jeff was a New York at the time.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
But I don't know the vibes.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Post.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Mm-hmm.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Yeah.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
There was a light nest in the air.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Right.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Everything was a little easier.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
We didn't totally figure out why.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
It was something.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Jeff casts a poll.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
And it makes us a poll.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
In fact, your name should be poll going forward.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Every time I'm in the office, everyone else is a poll bearer.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
Because they have to bear the weight of me.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
What a dead weight of you.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
What was New York?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Holy shit.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Let's hear it.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
That question cut through me.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
New York was great.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
I was staying near Fire Island with my family, which I think is very funny.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
That is really funny.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
And so, but we went to the beach.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
And it was fun.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
We went to beach a couple times.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Long walks, 10,000 steps.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Celebrating my mother's birthday.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
And I mean, what an incredible woman.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Right.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
She raised me well.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
She raised me well.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Good.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
And I am the man I am today because of her.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
I've never met either of your parents, I think.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
I mean, you love your parents.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Yeah, she.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
I think your mom and maybe also your dad went to one of our headgum shows in L.A.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Once right.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Yeah.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
I was.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Yeah.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
It was a very sweet moment.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
I realized I was, I think closer to her age than yours, Jeffrey.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I think it's exactly equal.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Because she's 55.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
And I'm 24.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
I was 15 years in between you and your mom.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
You and your mother.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
It's kind of cool.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Is that it?

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Let's keep it going with everyone's.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Oh, shit.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Do they listen to this show?

06:58.000 --> 07:08.000
No, they don't.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
They listen to the humble episode.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
They used to listen to review review, but I mean, every week and hour that's going to ask of either.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Do they watch the sketches?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
They love the sketches.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Interesting.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
They were very, my mom called me when we brought them back and was like happy crying.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Wow.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
That's actually.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
No, she was just really excited.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
She liked the Jeffrey the dumbest thing or does that kind of break her heart?

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
When we first started them in 2016, she was like, does it have to be called Jeffrey the dumbest?

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
It doesn't have to be, but I think it's fun.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Yeah.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
That was the weird feeling.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
I'm trying to imagine what it's like to have a child raised them and then like their first job is like,

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
I'm this person that you raised the dumbass and I'm eating it.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
And do you feel like kind of like, oh, that's not, they're not being nice to him or something like protective.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Also, it was fine.

08:12.000 --> 08:20.000
It was Jeffrey the dumbass, the series that you had to like go to the Ohio film something for.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
Getting way too personal, Ali knows none of this.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Yeah, it was.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Did they go to that?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
No.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
You went to a film festival.

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
Like a couple episodes of Jeffrey the dumbass got screened at the Cleveland International Film Festival

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
and this like digital creators thing.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
But that was like, well, the share.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
What's on our Instagram?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
You're like, that's too personal.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
That's what I'm talking about.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Not really.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I mean, I didn't submit it.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Let me see if it's a podium.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Yeah, I felt so awkward at that podium.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
You can see it in my eyes.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Oh, my God.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Great.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
That's not necessarily dad.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
That was six years ago.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
I just found this on my phone.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Oh, let's talk about you guys.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Ali, where did you grow up?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
You grew up around New York, right?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
No.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
I didn't know.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
I was like, I grew up.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
I grew up like right outside of Chicago.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
North Shore verbs.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Okay.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Where?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Glemvio.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
So not like, I think the North Shore.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Ali, this would say that doesn't count as North Shore.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
But it's around there.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
All right.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
My grandmother was from Walmart.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
So I used to go.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
They were a lot.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Like the the reference that I give.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
That is that like the fair spula school where they cut school.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
That was my rival high schools.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Like exterior.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
So I felt a lot of anger growing up that I wasn't.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I was a culture one.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I was having people.

10:10.000 --> 10:19.000
I keep having to stop a mirror's video because he's just still holding his phone.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Um, cubs.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Oh, my socks.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
White socks.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
White socks.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Really?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Yeah.

10:27.000 --> 10:35.000
I thought that it was like if you're North, your cubs, if you're South, your white socks.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Yeah.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
I just feel like I can't like in good faith support.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
A wriggly bill.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Like the whole fan culture.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Like I can't hang out with you.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
It's not for me.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
But I'm not like the crowd.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
I'm not going to add anything like to whatever you guys are doing.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Yeah.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
There's like no fan culture by the white socks standing up.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
It's just.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
It's just baseball.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Yeah.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
We're all serious.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Um.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
What's everybody's bond of the week?

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
So this the every week until the next James bond is cast.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
We're loving up our casting choice for the next James.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Um.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Amir.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
What about the original James your mother?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Okay.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Because that's the last name.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
She's not the original because her maiden name is not James.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
I'm wondering what it is.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.600
Well, I don't want to say her my mother's maiden name because I already have

11:42.600 --> 11:44.000
docs myself enough on the show.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
Well, you don't have to say her exact maiden name but just like give us a vibe.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Oh, it's like a.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Strasinski.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
I see sort of like Polish adjacent.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Yeah.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Lithuanian.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Yeah.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Lithuanian.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Yeah.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
So yeah.

12:01.000 --> 12:10.000
Like if I'm not that her name is Linda, but if it is Linda, it could be like Linda James Bond.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Is it Linda?

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
It's pretty close.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Marika.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Um.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
I don't know.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
I was thinking about Ben Barnes earlier.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
So I'm going to go with him.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Who's Ben Barnes?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Is that the chef in the the bear?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
No.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
That's that's Jeremy Allen White.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Yeah, not even close.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Yeah.

12:32.000 --> 12:42.000
But Ben Barnes was in a Punisher Netflix series with the other chef, not Io Ebon Moss.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
I don't know what pronounced this last name.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
And John Bernthal.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
We're both on the bear.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
So did you guys like the bear?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I love that.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I love that.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
Nice nice glasses.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Didn't Ben Barnes also feature on Punisher.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
Like I think he did like horns or something on that album.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
It does.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
It does.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
He does have he does have an album like he does sing.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Oh, no.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Really funny.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
Um, he was also a Prince Casphian in the lion, the witch in the wardrobe.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Um, movies.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Yeah.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
Um, he's in shadow and bone on Netflix.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
He's around.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Yeah.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
No, he's he stays booking.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Yeah.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
He's stay for sure.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Stay isn't that good.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Because he's happy and wealthy.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Yeah.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Yeah.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Always.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Ale, who's your bond to the week?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Your first ever bond to the week?

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
My first ever bond to the week.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
I think it's going to be Joey Comer.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Holy shit.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
I'm going to do it.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
I'm going to talk.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
I.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I want more villain.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
And I want it now.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And I want it for three hour of time.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Black.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
That's actually really good.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Like she can do it.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Oh, for sure.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
I feel like they actually have a conversation in the room about this.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
If it's brought up.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
I hope, I'm maybe this will get something going because I'm so far a campaign of one.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
That's how it starts.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
I was tired.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
One voice can change the world.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
My.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
My pick is a headgun post podcast or a little real.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I think it's time for a funny bond.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Like where he's just like can't believe it's all happening.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Instead of every other bond where they're like,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
we got to figure this out.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
He's like, what the hell was that?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
That's good.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Out of this.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
How was it?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
How often would he be in like on the phone?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
I feel like that's a comment.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I was a common thing for real.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
He's always on the phone.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
He's always on the phone.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Yeah.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Yeah.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
And I think there's another movie.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
I think is he in good boys.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
There's one more movie where he's like talking to people on the phone a lot.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
I think I think he's on the phone with M almost and every scene.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Yeah.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Constant updates.

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
But he's never maybe maybe we find a way where he's like never actually there.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
Maybe he just has to be at in order to keep up the bit.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
That could be good.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Yeah.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
Little Rell is M and then who would be a good foil as James?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
No way.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
There's no way.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
You're not even 40 and you're falling apart at the seams.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
I've noticed you like tennis now.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
I'm playing tennis.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
I don't know if that could be written into the story.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
But imagine like James won plays tennis.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
You're a serve Mr. Bond.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
So it's like something happening in the pool.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
That's really good actually.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Oh my god.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
Because the queen or whoever the fuck is there watching the match, right?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Yeah.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
And it could even be like a British tennis.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Like what's an example?

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
Jeffrey have a British tennis player that could be in the Wimbledon final.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
No.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
I don't follow tennis.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Yeah.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
British.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Is Roger Fetter British?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
No.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
He's Swiss.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Andy Murray.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Oh.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Good.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Yeah. Like this. This is good.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I'm here. Are you going to get a physical soon though?

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Because I feel like every time I watch you go downstairs.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
You go like one step and pause.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
One step and pause.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Like that's American nonsense.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
It's funny.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
Because I am getting a physical for the first time in years.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Since I think since the pandemic tomorrow.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
So I guess I'll have an update.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Oh, did we talk about that on one episode where I like.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Oh, yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
I did blood test.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Yeah.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Yeah.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Yeah.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Yeah.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
I'm here.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Wait. What is it called?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Gil Bear syndrome.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Yeah.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Well, that's a possibility.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
But I think.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I'll discuss with the doctor tomorrow.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
And I'll hit you guys up with the update.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
In fact, we can live stream the bitch.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
So you can.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Yeah.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
You can.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
The horses.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
You can.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
People are going to hear a bunch of sensitive medical information that you cannot disclose.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
You should.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
You should.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
I'm sort of an open book.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Yeah.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
All right.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Oh, yeah.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Anything.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Oh, you know what?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
What Roger LZU.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Nice.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
I get.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
Adiopathic allergic reactions.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Which is.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
I'm not allergic to anything technically.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I've been to an allergist many times.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
And they haven't deduced.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
But about maybe once a year, every two years.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
My body will have a really severe allergic reaction.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Like just spontaneously because of nothing.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
And then I have to go and get an emergency IV of anti histamines until I calm down.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Wow.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Wow.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
When was the last time that happened?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Yeah.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
The last time that happened.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I studied abroad in college.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
And it happened.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
I was in Croatia.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
And I had to go to a Croatian hospital.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
And no one spoke English.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
But they were very, very nice and helpful.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
And I was able to like mind my way through the crowd.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
Also my face looked like very everything looked very puppy and

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
deformed at that point.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
So they kind of got the picture.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
They got what they think I can guess what's going on.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
But they couldn't act like because they didn't know what you usually look like.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
So it had been insensitive of them to be like, oh my god.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
You look so puffy and deformed.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Oh yeah.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
I came in here because I stopped my elbow.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I woke up that morning and felt it.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
I was like, I think something like you just feel different.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
You looked different.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
And how my lips were very, very puppy.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
And I looked at this girl that I was on a trip with.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
And I was like, do you?

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Do I look different to you?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
I feel different.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
She goes nuts.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
So he always looked like, wow.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
I'm terrified.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
She's like, he's so busy.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
It's obvious she poisoned you.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Yeah.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
And you know how much I could walk us to do all that?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
$1100.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
$30.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Oh, that's it.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Yeah.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Wow.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
That's crazy.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
We should help care.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
Um, let's talk about dating in LA.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Alley.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
So far, this is the exact same episode as always.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
The final week.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
The last thing that dating in LA.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
I'm getting them all out.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
I'm getting them all out at first.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
And then we go into the more specifics.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
You want to go with something more specific?

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Oh, let's see.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
About dating in LA for the 19th time.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Me?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
No, he's just upset.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
I don't let anyone else talk to me that way.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
For some reason, you get some free pass.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I guess it's because you sell me.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
It must be the money.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Um, Ali,

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
we knew each other before you started working at head go.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Yes, we do.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
We go back a couple years.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
Yeah, when I signed with my managers,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
you had just become their assistant.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
I think.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Yeah.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Um, so I thought we could get into some specifics.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
What do they like about me?

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Are you still with them?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Yeah.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Yes.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Why?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I asked them.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Like there's nothing in the marriage.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
There's no dare there.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Correct me if I'm wrong.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
But aren't you dead weight in the industry?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
I wonder.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
No, Jeffrey's not dead weight.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
I could fall on the other side and hearing all the secret conversations.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Jeffrey was always in a good standing with me.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Wow.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
Does that make you feel good?

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
I did genuinely think they were going to soft drop me this year.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
But I just sent them an outline for a new pilot.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
But yet, like personality wise, what do they like about me?

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
Personality wise, you know what?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
You are good.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
You're going to pre-limm shit chat on the phone.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
You know how to start off a convo.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
And then you get right down to business.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And then.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Yeah, that's pretty much all I remember.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
And then what do they hate about me?

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
No.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Personality.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
That's the answer.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Yeah, you know, I know you're good.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Well, I can speak for myself.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
I think that you're, I thought that you were a lovely gift giver.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
You were so thoughtful.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
The most thoughtful of any of the clients for me as the assistant.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
So Jeffrey always looked out for the little guy, which I was the little guy.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Well, yeah.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
No, I didn't need cash.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I didn't give them a briefcase.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
No, you gave, no, you gave like really, really thoughtful thoughtful presence.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
Where you were like, I felt like you took time and you thought about everyone's personalities.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
And then came up with something that was specific for them that meant something.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
And I thought that's really nice.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
People don't do that much anymore.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Well, thanks.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
And then the last question.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
Is, uh, am I going to be a star?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Yes.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Yeah.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Um, all right.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
We do have to take a break.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Uh, I'm soaring off that.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
I mean, there's only a few taste makers that had come out.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
You'd be joined the ranks.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Let me tell you who's not a taste maker.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Uh, Angie.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Sorry.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
Oh, Mike, Mike doesn't get it.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
You know what I mean?

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Yeah, he does.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Really?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
And she and Mike are great at their jobs.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
All right.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Well, we'll be right back.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Now a word from our sponsor.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Better help.

23:03.000 --> 23:09.000
Guys, how would you take care of your car if you had to keep the same one your entire life?

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Right?

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Well, that's why our brain works.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
So why don't we treat them that way?

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
How we care for our minds affects how we go about life.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
And it's important to invest the time and care into keeping them healthy.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
There are plenty of ways to support a healthy brain, like learning a new language, taking power and apps.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
And there's also a better help online therapy.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I'm in therapy every week.

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
Uh, I could do life without it, but it would make it a lot more difficult for no reason.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
And I truly believe that everyone who has access to better earth to therapy, which better

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
help makes it easier and more affordable for should be in therapy.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
Better help is online therapy that offers video, phone, and even live chat sessions with

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
your therapist.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
So you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
It's also much more affordable than in person therapy.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
So they're expanding access.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
So if you've been considering therapy, give better help a shot because you can be

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
matched with a therapist in under 48 hours.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
And also listeners at the headgum podcast get 10% off their first month at betterhelp.com slash

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
What's that?

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Again, that's better help.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
What's that?

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Thanks, better help.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
And this is the song.

24:23.000 --> 24:40.000
That's really good, I'm here.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
That's really good, I'm here.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
So long.

24:49.000 --> 24:57.000
One, two, a segment that I like to call, can you help me move?

24:57.000 --> 25:02.000
In 12 days, I get the keys for my new place because I'm being kicked out of my current house

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
because my landlord is selling the house because he's dying.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
And he needs the money to pay for a spectacle bills.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
I didn't want to move.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
This place was incredibly affordable and it was a single family house.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
But here we are moving into a duplex.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Here's how we're going to play.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
I go one, I'm just going to point to you and be like, can you help me?

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
What's that?

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
It's really loud with the song.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
Like that, but the word loud instead of wow.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Okay.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
Yeah, this is much more manageable.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
The game is simple, it's just I point to you and say your name and you tell me whether or not you can help me move.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
Are you moving into one unit of a duplex or you guys taking over both?

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
One unit of a duplex.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
So three of you and one unit of a duplex.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Yeah.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Top bottom left, right?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Bottom.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
You guys are in the bottom of a duplex.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Yeah.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Are three people on top?

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Yeah, there's three tops in one bottom unit.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Three people in the top unit.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Three people in the bottom unit.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
No.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
It's just you and the bottom.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
It's me and my roommates in a bottom unit of a duplex.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
And then the top is how many people.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
It's a couple.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
A couple people are a couple.

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
It's the same two people who are in a relationship.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
They own the joint too.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Wow, that's really good for them.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Yeah.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
When you buy it.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
This is not what the game is.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
The game is I point to you.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I'm curious about the situation.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
They bought it.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Would you want me to look it up?

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
I'll look up the property records.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Where they fucking bought this.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
Yeah, because they could be making a profit and living for free.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
But they bought it last year.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Wow, recent.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Yeah.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Last year.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
How much was it?

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I don't want to say because then if so.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Gotta be close to two though, right?

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
It was for a duplex.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Woo.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Mosultoves.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
They renovated or sort of came.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I think they renovated.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
That's really nice.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Yeah.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
All right.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Continue.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Uh.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
All right.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Here we go.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
This is Cannot.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Can you help me move?

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Maria, can you help me move?

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
No, I don't live in LA.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
That's true.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
All right.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Can you help me move?

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I'm moving on August 12th.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Hmm.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
No, I have plans.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
I'm here.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Can you help me move?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
No.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
You should hire movers.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
Moveers are expensive though.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
And we're already overextending yourselves on rent.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
Are you getting your own room into three bedroom?

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Yeah, I'm getting my own room.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
We're not going to be three twenty five and twenty six year olds.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
I'm bunked.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Why?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
That's cool.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
No, that's awesome.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Yeah.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
I didn't consider it.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Actually, maybe we have an office.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Um.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
That was that.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
All right.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
The next segment.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
Welcome to Steel or Nah.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
We got a cat in the frame.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
This is chicken.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
She wanted to sit with me.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
She's a little chicken.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Does she hairless or is she?

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Yeah.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Yeah.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
She, she's half hairless.

28:49.000 --> 28:58.000
So that's why I named her chicken because she kind of looked like an uncooked chicken breast.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Oh, yes.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
As a baby.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Uh, that's amazing.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
How long have you had her?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
I, I fostered a cat and you did.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Yes.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
I saw an Instagram.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I love cats.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Me too.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
So why can you give them away?

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
Uh, she bit me a lot.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Oh.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
They were like loving me.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
You didn't want to give it away.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I did at the end.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
No.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
She's all.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
Sorry.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
I don't know.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I'm going to say chickens from college.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
Uh, she was originally one of my other college roommates.

29:34.000 --> 29:40.000
But, uh, she asked me to watch her count one day and then never came back.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Never saw her again.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Are you kidding?

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
No.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Not kidding.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
So I like to say.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Oh, really?

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Yeah.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
I saw a cat with a cat.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Yeah.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
That's like, coddock.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Yeah.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Yeah.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
I need, I need to know more about those.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Yeah.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Remember that.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Um, it was.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Yeah.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
It was my junior year of college.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
And, you know, how you have a front, a fun front.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Yeah.

30:06.000 --> 30:12.000
And it was like, we're, you're like, oh, they're going to help make college like a fun experience for me.

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
Like, I'm going to, they're going to push my, like, I'm going to push myself to be more fun than maybe I would be on my own.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
I'm going to push myself socially.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Yeah.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I'm going to push myself socially.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
And so, yeah.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
So, but then it over the course of the year.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
It's stopping fun and started getting a little too real.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Just like the real world.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Yeah.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Just like the real world.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Everyone stopped being polite.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
And then I was like, I don't know.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
This seems a little much.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
And then, uh, so I was because I was pushing myself socially.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
I spent a lot of time at home being myself.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
And then that's when I really bonded with chicken the cat.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
And she started hanging out with me all the time.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
And then one day the roommate came and said,

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
I got to go home for the weekend.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
I know it's been really crazy.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
We got a lot of stuff to discuss.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
Um, can you take care of the cat until I come back?

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
I said, sure.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
And then she never came back.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
Return to didn't return your calls, text.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Nothing.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
No.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
I found out if she, I found out because she posted an Instagram saying,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
I decided that I don't want to go to school anymore.

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
I'm going to go pursue my Michigan and Detroit.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
My Michigan.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
My, or sorry, my Michigan and Detroit.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
My music in Detroit, my music in Detroit.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
God.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
That was amazing.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
That was amazing.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
She's seeking pure Michigan.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Yeah.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
You're Michigan was like, I got to go work on my sound.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
And I said, all right.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
I guess I'm a single mom.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
That's crazy.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Wow.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Good for you.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Bad for them.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Thank you.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
This is steel or not.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
Um, basically I'm going to show you guys photos of various

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
colors.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
And you have to tell me whether it's steel or not.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
You guys ready?

31:51.000 --> 31:56.000
This is for actual cash.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
$10 for every right answer.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
$10 is owed to me for every wrong answer.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Here we go.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
I'm going to go down for this one.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
No.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Correct.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
This is aluminum.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
So, two of us are correct.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Marie was wrong.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Yeah.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
So, Marie goes me $10.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
You guys, I owe both of you.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
$10.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Here we go.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Ooh.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
That looks pretty hard.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
I'm really tough.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
I'm going to say steel.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I'm going to go not.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
It is steel.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Alley's back to zero.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Marie goes back to zero.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Amir is up 20.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Here we go.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Wait.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Why don't you call this segment steel

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
or no steel?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Yeah.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Yeah.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
That's.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
That would have been better.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
I'm going to go not.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Yeah.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
This one looks like silver almost.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
I'm going to go not as well.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
I'm going to.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Correct.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
This is not silver.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
It's silver, but platinum.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Oh.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Well, we should.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
A ring.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Hmm.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
I'll say steel.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Why not?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Yeah, same.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Yeah.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Ring around the rosy.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
Try ring around the white gold.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
This wedding band is for someone really special.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
18 carat.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
I think.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
Amir, you're at 10.

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
And Marika and Ali are both at zero again.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
Hmm.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
What do we think about this wheel?

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
This hub cap.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
No.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
No.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
No.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
No.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Okay.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
I too feel not.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
I'll go against the grain and go steel.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
It's steel, baby.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
All the way.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Marie and Ali now owe me 10 dollars.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Amir, you're back to 20.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Oh, man.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
It's steel, baby.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Yeah.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
I have another cat.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Oh, my god.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
That one is a chicken.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Wait.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
That one is too.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
This one is.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
This one's fully hairless.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
This is my sister's cat, Lupi.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
No.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
When you guys see a hairless cat.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
Do you guys think that I wouldn't like the touch it's gummy body?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Or you're like, I would like that.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
And I don't care that it's hairless.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
Because when I see it, I'm like, oh, I don't know if I want to touch it's gummy.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Yeah.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
That's kind of where I am at as well.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
I understand.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
I understand.

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
I would say it's it's more like a velvet team.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
That's good.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Okay.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
So it's still used to look at the softness.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
It's not like a rat.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
No, not like a rat.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Well, rat tofu.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Grat tofu for.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Yeah.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
I thought you were going to say, well, rats have redeeming qualities.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Yeah.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
They're so smart and they love science.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Yeah.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Do you have two hairless cats?

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Yeah.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Yeah.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
I live with my sister and we have half hairless.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
And she has fully hairless.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Wow.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
Cats.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
That's a vibe.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
No, that works.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
It's coming on strong.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Where do you guys live?

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
We live in Hollywood.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
They live in Hollywood.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Sorry.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
I wasn't specific enough.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Address.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
I'll fly.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I'll fly.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Not even offline.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Because then I'll share it online.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Here we go.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
What do you know?

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
No steel.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
It's an earring bag.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
No.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Oh.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Yes.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
No.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Wait.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
No.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
No.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
Three.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
No.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Correct.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
This is white gold.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
A white gold earring bag.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Yeah.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
Right.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Like notice.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
You're going to see it.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Yes.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Yes.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
This is steel.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Same.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
This is still.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Pretty.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
This is pretty steel.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Steel.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Steel.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
This is going to be tungsten titanium alloy.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Oh my god.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Okay.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
I have titanium alloy.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
Steel or no.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
This one's kind of interesting.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
Well, can you.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
What is it?

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
I think it's just industrial.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Take it.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Take it.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Looks like duct tape.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
I'm going to go on.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
It's steel duct.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Yeah.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
It's a rim of tin.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
I'm going to go.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Yes.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Steel.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
It is not steel.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
It's nickel silver alloy.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
So a mirror is at 30.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
I think you're in the red owing me $10.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
No.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
I think that's true.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
You'll think one of the cats is payment.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Or at least a tin of.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
River.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
River.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
River.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
We're.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
It's.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Sorry.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Thank you.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
That's what gets me fired.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
All right.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Here we go.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Steel or not.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Sand.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Sand.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Go.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Amir.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Venmo.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Let's do this.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
That's more difficult.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Our wire transfer.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
If you want a wire transfer, I'm doing it later.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Yeah.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Let's do an ACH wire transfer.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
I was oddly good at that game.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
What's.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
It's you quickly realize that we do know what steel looks like.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
You know what I mean?

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
And like there is.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
You tested our metal.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
I tested Bosnese.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
I'm so sorry to hear that.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
That was steel or not.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
I thought Marika was going to throw a fit for that one.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Why?

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
This is the first really.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Yeah.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Hissier otherwise.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
That's like the first really dumb one I've done in a while.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
I would say.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
I don't know.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
I don't know.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Thanks.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I don't know.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
I don't know.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
I don't know.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
I don't know.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
I don't know.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
I don't know.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
I don't know.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Yeah.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
I'd rather be bad than fine.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
But that being said.

38:51.000 --> 39:00.000
Well, welcome to couch critiques.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Another one.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
I feel like that was the end of the show.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Right?

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
A little tear amount.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Let's tear them out.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
Yeah.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
I should have a lot of it only time for this one.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
This is couch critiques.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
I was going.

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
Basically we're going to watch some late night interviews and grade them on their

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
performance.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
But I was going to do three of them.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Yeah.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
It was like a lot.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Four of them actually.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
And I think we only have time for.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
For one.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
So I'm actually going to go with this, which is not a talk show.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
It's morning.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Joe on MSVC.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
But it's Russell Brand in 2013 promoting his.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Messiah complex.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
Stand up to her.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Any more.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Any other questions?

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
He's become nervous.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
I can't.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Why are you nervous?

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
I've got a powerful woman.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
I've got lovely Joe.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
It seems to be the trouble.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
I don't know.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
You've got hair like princess Diana.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Wow.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Okay.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I've never been a fan of her.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Who's a late subter?

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Yes.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
I'm petrified of her.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
She's just moved down the house.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
I absolutely love this.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
You really want that one?

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
It seems to be the trouble.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
No, I'm good.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
I'm.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
We're now going to be the therapist.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Would you do therapy with Willie Brand with whom?

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Willie Brand.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Would you do therapy with him?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
I don't.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Because that's where he's heading.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Okay.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
I'm all right.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
You shouldn't say he when a person is present.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
You should refer to the person by the name.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
That's basically good manners.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
That is where Willie is heading.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Who is Willie?

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Things are falling apart on motor.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
Gordon Joe.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
I think there's another guy.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
The fact that he was like, I'm petrified of her.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Is a worse than anything.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
Russell.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
I don't know.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
I don't know.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
That's bad.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
I just.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
They're all fucking up.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
Also, she's just like with Willie Brand with Willie Brand with Willie Brand.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
And he's like, who is Willie?

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
That's the part I wanted to show you guys.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
I guess.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
So they're weird part of that to highlight.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
You know, this was a, this was a wash.

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
I thought we were just going to be looking at couches.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
That would have probably been better.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
That would have probably been better.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
We'll do that next week.

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
You didn't think we'd be dissecting a Russell Brand interview from 2016.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
13.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
So unnecessary.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
What made you think of that?

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I, he watched the clip.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
And I was like, this is funny.

41:27.000 --> 41:36.000
How can I share it with three other people in a way that they have to watch it?

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
So what do you guys have going on?

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
What do you want to point the people to have come related or not?

41:41.000 --> 41:46.000
Let's start with the alley.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
I had come related.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
We are.

41:48.000 --> 41:55.000
We are in the process of producing a had come live stand-up show.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Probably in September.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
So stay tuned for that.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
And my personal plugs are just.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Everybody go watch speed before it gets off.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
The Amazon Prime.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
It's great.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
I just discovered it.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Love that.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Speed is very good.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Maria.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Um.

42:19.000 --> 42:26.000
Dido on the had come live in the backyard situation.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
Looking forward to that.

42:30.000 --> 42:35.000
And follow me on Twitter Instagram and letterbox.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Oh, bit.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Boom and fell.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
You know, I'm getting kicked out of this room.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
So I got to just keep it brief.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Thank you for having me.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Um.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Ultimately.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
I can take away.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
Is.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
I have to leave, Matt.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
Yeah.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
This whole thing was does.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
That was a hit them original.

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a headgum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.680
Thank you to Pixar for sponsoring this episode of our show, guys.

00:09.680 --> 00:14.520
I have had a trouble history, hiring and firing graphic designers and headshot photographers

00:14.520 --> 00:18.520
that do photo retouching, and it's all stuff where I'm being overcharged that I could

00:18.520 --> 00:22.920
probably do that was on the other photo design editing app that we all know, but I just

00:22.920 --> 00:27.760
don't want to, because that one's complicated, and that's why Pixar entered the game.

00:27.760 --> 00:30.960
Pixar is an easy to use photo editing and design app.

00:30.960 --> 00:36.520
With Pixar, almost anyone can create professional level designs with no art school needed.

00:36.520 --> 00:39.840
When you've got a side hustle, right, a small business, and you don't have a ton of

00:39.840 --> 00:44.840
time to design or create ads that look great and make sales, Pixar enters the picture

00:44.840 --> 00:50.360
and makes the process simple and fast and not only design, but also lay out and export

00:50.360 --> 00:52.640
the right-size files that you need.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.680
Let's say your musician or comedian, you need to promote a show or a tour or a gig, right?

00:56.680 --> 01:03.960
You don't have killer social media etiquette, honestly, design wise.

01:03.960 --> 01:11.560
Pixar, again, makes things simple by creating amazing posters, advertising the gig, advertising

01:11.560 --> 01:14.440
the tour, and getting your audience interested.

01:14.440 --> 01:18.760
You can quickly create or update a design, choosing from hundreds of fonts, making it perfect

01:18.760 --> 01:22.320
and posting it to your socials, or maybe have a product, right, and you have a couple

01:22.320 --> 01:26.200
of great photos of it, but you can't keep using them over and over on their own.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.200
That's boring.

01:27.200 --> 01:32.560
The Pixar background removal tool lets you isolate your product and just one tap and put

01:32.560 --> 01:37.440
it on any background you like, keeping your product photography always looking fresh.

01:37.440 --> 01:43.480
And hey, who doesn't like messing around with filters, retouch tools, or even stickers on

01:43.480 --> 01:44.480
their selfies?

01:44.480 --> 01:49.040
Well, Pixar has an infinite number of ways to make your edits look as natural or as wild

01:49.040 --> 01:53.320
as you want, and they're always updating with new stuff, with 150 million other creators

01:53.320 --> 01:58.840
around the world using Pixar, you'll find relevant content you can't find anywhere else.

01:58.840 --> 02:02.720
I have been using Pixar ever since we got this ad, a placement.

02:02.720 --> 02:07.800
I used it to create some promotional materials for the headgum live show, New York City,

02:07.800 --> 02:13.400
October 22nd, 7pm Grammarcy Theater, and I think they look great.

02:13.400 --> 02:17.240
I did show them to Marika, you guys will see them on this episode, and she had some notes,

02:17.240 --> 02:21.080
but I not on the design, because the design was amazing using Pixar.

02:21.080 --> 02:25.160
I also have been using them in my personal life, just creating little invitations for parties

02:25.160 --> 02:26.160
and get together.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.560
I had a bar crawl, I created a Pixar invitation for that.

02:28.560 --> 02:33.720
I'm having people over for a little Halloween horror night's watch party, and I created

02:33.720 --> 02:36.440
a little invitation for that, using Pixar.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.440
Looked awesome.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.600
Looked like I spent hours on it.

02:38.600 --> 02:39.440
I didn't.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.280
I spent 10 minutes on it tops.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.560
I really, really liked this product, guys.

02:43.560 --> 02:44.560
So really check it out.

02:44.560 --> 02:48.920
If this is any of this sounds like things that you would have to normally do in a design app,

02:48.920 --> 02:51.040
please check out Pixar.

02:51.040 --> 02:54.720
So whether you're editing selfies or trying to make your passion, your profession, you can

02:54.720 --> 02:56.280

02:56.280 --> 03:00.520

03:00.520 --> 03:01.520
Thanks, Pixar.

03:01.520 --> 03:17.160
I forget every time, as a video.

03:17.160 --> 03:47.160
I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will

03:47.160 --> 04:07.040
I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will see what's going on because of this

04:07.040 --> 04:15.480
I thought a mirror was brown.

04:15.480 --> 04:16.840
Yeah.

04:16.840 --> 04:19.840
Already lost?

04:19.840 --> 04:20.840
Mr. Andrew.

04:20.840 --> 04:24.080
I'm really nervous.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.280
Danny fucking sellers on the show.

04:26.280 --> 04:28.560
Hey, man brother.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.560
Doing fantastic.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.960
Your hair looks like it has more volume up top.

04:31.960 --> 04:32.960
Yeah.

04:32.960 --> 04:33.960
And I have the headphones on.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.560
I can kind of push it forward.

04:35.560 --> 04:40.800
They're going to be in your pilot, whatever the fuck.

04:40.800 --> 04:41.800
Rieke Brown is.

04:41.800 --> 04:42.800
Thanks.

04:42.800 --> 04:43.800
Wow.

04:43.800 --> 04:44.800
How's the house?

04:44.800 --> 04:45.800
Is it just so?

04:45.800 --> 04:47.800
Because I feel like I'm going to never be good.

04:47.800 --> 04:48.800
It's okay.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.800
There's been a lot of stuff going on.

04:50.800 --> 04:51.800
Probably.

04:51.800 --> 04:52.800
Yeah.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.960
I'm avoiding their little woes by basically taking out DIY projects.

04:56.960 --> 04:57.960
We should say.

04:57.960 --> 04:58.960
Exactly.

04:58.960 --> 04:59.960
Yeah.

04:59.960 --> 05:00.960
Precisely.

05:00.960 --> 05:05.200
That's the best house to kind of keep things.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.680
Keep like, you know, I mean, even keel as they say.

05:07.680 --> 05:08.680
Yes.

05:08.680 --> 05:12.240
The common enemy is the project and then you're not the kind of in the dollhouse.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.240
Right exactly.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.240
Precisely.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.240
Yeah.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.880
And you had skabies, right?

05:17.880 --> 05:18.880
Yeah.

05:18.880 --> 05:19.880
What?

05:19.880 --> 05:20.880
What?

05:20.880 --> 05:21.880
What?

05:21.880 --> 05:22.880
What?

05:22.880 --> 05:23.880
What are skabies?

05:23.880 --> 05:24.880
What's that?

05:24.880 --> 05:25.880
Is it?

05:25.880 --> 05:28.880
I don't know.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.920
It's, I think it's like some, because it grabs no.

05:32.920 --> 05:36.440
I think it's at some kind of a skin condition that babies get.

05:36.440 --> 05:37.440
Hmm.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.920
That sounds like babies.

05:39.920 --> 05:40.920
This is the name.

05:40.920 --> 05:41.920
Yeah.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.920
The last episode was that one of the nastiest things of everything.

05:44.920 --> 05:45.920
Thank you.

05:45.920 --> 05:46.920
Thank you.

05:46.920 --> 05:47.920
Thank you.

05:47.920 --> 05:48.920
Wow.

05:48.920 --> 05:49.920
Yes.

05:49.920 --> 05:50.920
It was disgusting.

05:50.920 --> 05:51.920
Wow.

05:51.920 --> 05:55.920
That was so nasty.

05:55.920 --> 05:56.920
Yeah.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.880
That one is one that I actually do regret.

05:59.880 --> 06:04.640
I shouldn't have done the visual gags surrounding rashes.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.080
That one would have been better for before.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.080
We did the, sorry.

06:07.080 --> 06:08.080
I'm sorry.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.080
Jesus.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.800
I'm waiting one day for you to just like pull down the curtain.

06:20.800 --> 06:26.240
And you're like under that bridge that is at a tarmac.

06:26.240 --> 06:27.240
Yeah.

06:27.240 --> 06:28.240
Yeah.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.800
Oh, that'd be good.

06:30.800 --> 06:35.640
I, people like me can't do that around airports is the thing.

06:35.640 --> 06:40.320
Like I will be, if I'm not already on a list, I'll get put on a list.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.320
Everybody.

06:42.320 --> 06:48.560
Pile, I have avoided talking to you for the better part of a decade, but what's, what's

06:48.560 --> 06:51.960
been going on and since like, with the last time I saw you, which is probably the Christmas

06:51.960 --> 06:53.960
party.

06:54.040 --> 06:57.640
Uh, the Christmas party, the fucking white elephant.

06:59.640 --> 07:00.640
Oh, yeah.

07:00.640 --> 07:01.640
Yeah.

07:01.640 --> 07:02.640
Yeah.

07:02.640 --> 07:03.640
I totally forgot about that.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.640
Yeah.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.520
I was thinking like, last time I was on this podcast, that was always, with Claire.

07:06.520 --> 07:10.600
And I don't think there are any, I don't think there are any drops or, I don't know, there's

07:10.600 --> 07:11.600
even intro music.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.600
Yeah.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.520
There's a very different animal.

07:14.520 --> 07:15.520
Sure.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.520
It evolves.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.520
It's a quarterly evolution.

07:18.520 --> 07:21.920
Claire, Claire does not work at the company anymore.

07:21.920 --> 07:25.040
So that's like a good point of reference for the last time you were on this show.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.040
She got a better job.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.040
It's, we just shouldn't get laid off.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.040
Um, it's hard for you now.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.040
Right.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.040
We know.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.680
Yeah.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.840
Any office gossip, Danny?

07:35.840 --> 07:37.840
Oh, there's so much tea.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.800
It's time for the Danny tea report.

07:39.800 --> 07:45.040
So, yes, you may have heard.

07:45.040 --> 07:51.760
So yesterday I overheard Marty's told, Angie, that Sam told,

07:51.840 --> 07:56.160
Marty, that the refrigerator was broken.

07:56.160 --> 08:00.760
And then I also heard that, not, I don't know, I was going to keep going, but I feel like,

08:00.760 --> 08:02.680
I want to see how long you could go.

08:02.680 --> 08:03.680
Yeah.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.760
It would have been stupid, I'm sorry.

08:05.760 --> 08:11.760
We did get a working dishwasher finally in the kitchen at the L.A. office pile in

08:11.760 --> 08:14.080
where you can, you guys haven't been to the L.A. office.

08:14.080 --> 08:17.920
It was a broken when you moved in, or did you guys break it already?

08:17.920 --> 08:19.520
It was broken when we moved in.

08:19.520 --> 08:20.520
Or there wasn't.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.360
No, that wasn't.

08:22.360 --> 08:23.960
Jeff, are you just lied?

08:23.960 --> 08:29.080
No, that was not because I was unpacking a bunch of shit with Marty.

08:29.080 --> 08:32.640
And he was like, we got to replace this thing because it doesn't work.

08:32.640 --> 08:36.600
I'm pretty sure they're fridge word for like a hat for, oh, no, the fridge work.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.840
The dish, I meant to say the dishwasher.

08:38.840 --> 08:39.840
Oh, okay.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.680
Because I was unpacking all the glasses.

08:41.680 --> 08:44.120
And then he was like, I was like, it was probably washed these, right?

08:44.120 --> 08:46.360
And he's like, we don't have a dishwasher, or it was broken.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.760
I forget which.

08:47.840 --> 08:48.720
You don't have a dishwasher.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.640
I think you're just making stuff up.

08:50.640 --> 08:53.600
No, that's why all the glasses are still on the kitchen,

08:53.600 --> 08:54.800
the break room table.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.040
No, this is the end of the tea report.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.720
Office drama.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.600
Last thing, we should open it up with that one.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.440
I know.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.280
What?

09:11.280 --> 09:12.280
My refrigerator.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.600
Yeah, my refrigerator, sorry.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.560
My refrigerator was just broken too.

09:17.560 --> 09:21.960
So, you know, he spends less than, yeah, nice.

09:21.960 --> 09:25.800
Just a person, I'll not hear you, I haven't been at the office in months.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.120
The drain was plugged.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.200
And I had to get a guy to come in.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.640
He had to come back because he needed another guy to help him.

09:33.640 --> 09:38.880
And what they pulled out, they could not identify.

09:38.880 --> 09:44.560
They were like, it looks biologic.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.280
Like they were like, fetus?

09:47.240 --> 09:51.080
It's like, the drain tube is like a small tube of plastic,

09:51.080 --> 09:53.000
like a straw type thing.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.400
And they were like, yeah, it's usually some, you know,

09:57.400 --> 10:00.840
like lettuce or like a paper towel piece or something,

10:00.840 --> 10:03.800
because people clean out their fridge and it goes down the tube.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.400
This was like a life, they think.

10:05.400 --> 10:10.600
And it was, it had like a vein in it.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.920
And I don't know, so I don't know what it could have been.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.560
But it basically like broke my fridge because when the drain tube doesn't work,

10:17.560 --> 10:21.480
it does the thing where it sucks and like traced the vacuum and you can't open again.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.880
So every time I took something out of my fridge and the fridge closed,

10:23.880 --> 10:25.480
I couldn't open it again for like 15 minutes.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.880
It was torture.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.160
Anyway, Jeff, you asked what's going on since like the last time.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.280
If I look like a year ago, that's what I did.

10:32.280 --> 10:35.000
No, does anybody else want to get point this bullshit out of the way?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.520
Before we get to the room, either the spot.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.040
Let's go.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.320
Oh, it's a drama.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.200
No, that's my new course.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.320
You should, are you going to submit it to a lab and like get it tested?

10:47.320 --> 10:49.960
I threw it out. I'm kind of bummed I did because I really wonder,

10:49.960 --> 10:52.840
I've been thinking like, oh, we kept you know, yeast in there.

10:52.840 --> 10:55.480
Like, could it be like some sort of yeast thing?

10:55.480 --> 10:56.040
Monstrous.

10:56.040 --> 11:00.760
Yeah, like we're growing sourdough in our, like, drain.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.120
Is that for me? Is that for me?

11:02.120 --> 11:04.520
A yeast culture to grow a vein?

11:05.960 --> 11:06.760
It was broken.

11:06.760 --> 11:07.000
Not.

11:07.880 --> 11:08.840
I really hope not.

11:09.320 --> 11:09.960
Absolutely.

11:09.960 --> 11:10.760
And running down.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.920
It was, it was so nasty we toss it right away.

11:12.920 --> 11:18.120
I mean, the like, the refrigerator guys were discussed it.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.320
Like, that's how bad it was.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.960
You got to imagine they see like a good amount of shit.

11:21.960 --> 11:25.880
So yeah, you know, it was, uh, anyway.

11:25.880 --> 11:30.520
I don't know if you like to learn home upkeep and maintenance.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.200
Don't let it get ahead of you.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.120
Be ahead of it and the game.

11:35.560 --> 11:36.280
It's a good one.

11:38.840 --> 11:40.120
Watch it.

11:43.720 --> 11:45.720
Danny, you got a really good set on Wednesday.

11:45.720 --> 11:48.920
I've been going to this open like Danny goes to tons of open makes.

11:48.920 --> 11:50.120
And they go to one a week.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.440
That's all I can handle at this point because I'm still,

11:52.440 --> 11:53.800
get it, trying to get better at it.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.000
But um, there was this like really drunk,

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
calculator who was just being really mad.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
Who's, he was, he was turned up like black out drunk,

12:05.000 --> 12:08.200
which is like no one else was like, that wasn't the vibe.

12:08.280 --> 12:11.240
But he was also, uh, he was a friend of a comic that had already gone.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.960
And I'm like, all right, the first two times, if you like,

12:13.960 --> 12:15.880
you know, it would just be like, hey, can you chill?

12:15.880 --> 12:17.240
But then he, like, they didn't leave.

12:17.240 --> 12:18.120
I'm like, go.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.400
Like, you already did your set.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.640
Like, you know, and like, you handled it really well.

12:21.640 --> 12:24.120
But for some people, I think it, like, really threw them off.

12:24.120 --> 12:28.440
But you were, yeah, like, you, I was dialafing the way you were like,

12:28.440 --> 12:31.000
you know, I don't remember what you said, but I was so funny.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.600
I'll call him the zodiac killer.

12:32.600 --> 12:33.000
Yeah.

12:35.240 --> 12:36.280
You found him.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.800
He looked like a school shooter.

12:38.280 --> 12:39.480
Yeah, he was just like, yeah, like a,

12:39.480 --> 12:40.520
he had a quarters of the point.

12:40.520 --> 12:41.560
It was just like hammer.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.880
But I'm like, bro, you're, you've killed somebody before.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.120
Yeah, and you didn't tread lightly.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.800
So you're definitely on his list now.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.160
Oh, 100% yeah.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.760
That would be armed at all time.

12:52.760 --> 12:53.400
Yeah.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.360
But those have been fun.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.160
Those have been fun, like.

12:56.040 --> 12:57.400
Yeah, you gotta just keep going up.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.560
You know, you know, it was, you had to go to different rooms, too.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.160
That forces him to life.

13:01.960 --> 13:06.440
Be better and, uh, and if it allows you to try new jokes, too.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.800
Because you go to the same room.

13:07.800 --> 13:08.520
You see the same people.

13:08.520 --> 13:11.640
We don't want to, um, try our certain things.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.880
Are you to also, sometimes you don't want to like repeat the same jokes.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.400
Cause I don't know these jokes.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.240
So doing multiple rooms helps.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.000
Yeah, I want to go to the offbeat.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.760
And then there's that other one on the other day.

13:20.760 --> 13:21.240
Yeah, I forget.

13:21.240 --> 13:21.720
Awesome.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.720
I think it's that a brewery, if we're going to, which one?

13:23.720 --> 13:25.080
Boom down, boom down.

13:25.080 --> 13:25.960
Have you been to that one?

13:26.280 --> 13:26.840
Yeah.

13:26.840 --> 13:27.400
It's good.

13:28.200 --> 13:28.600
Yeah.

13:29.240 --> 13:29.640
It's fine.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.200
Um, you went viral.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.680
You went kind of, you kind of started an online, uh,

13:34.680 --> 13:36.040
you started a discordus really.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.800
And what you ended up being a dialogue.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.360
Yeah, I didn't, yeah, I don't know if it's viral, but yeah,

13:40.360 --> 13:41.320
people were talking about it.

13:41.320 --> 13:41.720
Yeah.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.600
Uh, you tweeted a series of tweets or was it just one tweet?

13:44.600 --> 13:46.680
That was talking about these pay-to-play, L.A.

13:46.680 --> 13:50.120
Open mics for, um, and like how that's fucked up.

13:50.520 --> 13:51.160
It makes no sense.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.440
Yeah, I mean, I was, I literally said,

13:52.440 --> 13:55.160
was we need to start having a conversation about open mics.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.160
And then we ran with it.

13:58.440 --> 14:01.160
But it was, what he said is what I was going to say.

14:01.160 --> 14:02.280
Yeah, or would have said.

14:06.120 --> 14:10.280
Upstate mental health check pile your so geographically isolated.

14:10.280 --> 14:10.760
Are you good?

14:12.200 --> 14:13.560
Uh, yeah, no, it's true.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.400
I am kind of worried about the winter.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.640
Like, I think it's going to feel pretty good.

14:17.640 --> 14:18.440
Do you say things in all?

14:19.720 --> 14:21.720
No, more just kind of like, once you get snow,

14:22.680 --> 14:26.120
you know, starting it around and like, I don't know, the,

14:26.120 --> 14:29.000
the weekenders probably stop coming up here and start going skiing,

14:29.000 --> 14:30.040
which we're really half here.

14:30.040 --> 14:34.200
So yeah, I think it's going to become a little remote feeling.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.240
Right now, it feels okay.

14:37.000 --> 14:37.800
All right.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.160
Are you going to try to go to Florida?

14:40.440 --> 14:41.000
No.

14:41.000 --> 14:41.560
I don't know.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.240
It's for just like kind of a shit show.

14:43.240 --> 14:44.040
I think it's like, I think it's like,

14:45.080 --> 14:47.240
I think it's always been kind of a shit show.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.560
Yeah, when you weren't vaccinated,

14:49.560 --> 14:51.480
now you're vaccinated and you don't want to go.

14:52.040 --> 14:56.920
But it feels like it got worse even since I have come back.

14:56.920 --> 14:59.800
Like, I came back in like April and uh,

14:59.800 --> 15:02.920
I thought it was like before Delta and I think the Delta stuff was crazy.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.120
And I don't know.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.840
We also go like one episode without talking about fucking COVID.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.520
Go off.

15:08.520 --> 15:09.880
She's gone.

15:10.840 --> 15:11.560
We have.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.640
What, are you moving to LA or not?

15:15.640 --> 15:16.680
You said you were going to?

15:17.320 --> 15:20.520
I was thinking about it and now with like, you know,

15:20.520 --> 15:23.320
there's a lot of DIY projects around the house that we haven't got to yet.

15:23.320 --> 15:27.480
So I think how is that, uh, the moldy wood that you found?

15:27.480 --> 15:29.080
Yeah, black moldy should say.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.360
Black moldy.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.480
Yeah, so that was that was consequence of the aforementioned leak.

15:33.560 --> 15:37.800
So, uh, yeah, it was some bleached shit with the mold killer.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.720
Put up some drywall, spackled it.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.880
Oh shit, you made it it.

15:42.360 --> 15:43.640
Word of the absolute week.

15:44.840 --> 15:45.240
Spackled.

15:45.240 --> 15:45.960
Spackle.

15:45.960 --> 15:46.600
Nice.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.640
All right, here we go.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.120
Do you have that Venmo, my ass?

15:52.120 --> 15:55.960
Are you, we're tweeting to try and get Venmo money so that you can.

15:56.760 --> 16:01.720
Yeah, but you know, if I win that, I will genuinely come up with a game.

16:01.800 --> 16:06.360
I really hope I win it so that for the live show, I can actually give that money away.

16:07.320 --> 16:08.760
Give it to audience members.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.200
Uh, I don't know.

16:11.480 --> 16:12.440
Have like a briefcase.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.000
Just give us cash, like a strip club or something.

16:15.000 --> 16:15.720
I'll be tight.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.280
Pile, is your, is your handle Andrew Dashpile?

16:18.280 --> 16:18.920
I'm so scared.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.200
I'm going to send this to the wrong person.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.480
I'm guessing it is.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.680
I haven't received it.

16:22.680 --> 16:23.640
Have I been in a while?

16:25.080 --> 16:27.080
This is just a misunderstanding.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.040
I'm your piles in the world.

16:28.040 --> 16:28.920
There's only a couple.

16:28.920 --> 16:29.720
There's like two.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.280
There's me and there's like a volleyball coach.

16:32.280 --> 16:35.960
Like if this gets a volleyball coach, I'll force Marty to comp me.

16:35.960 --> 16:37.960
Confirmed Andrew Dashpile.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.520
Jeff, he says to me, I am not saying it back.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.440
I will talk to him with that money.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.720
Oh my god, I'm a child.

16:49.720 --> 16:50.920
Siri screwed me on that one.

16:50.920 --> 16:51.800
I was supposed to be speckled.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.040
I'm a chef.

16:54.040 --> 16:54.840
That was easy.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.880
Listen, let's be honest, we got to get to the bottom of some shit.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.120
First of all, we have our first segment here.

17:04.120 --> 17:07.400
I wasn't sure till this moment if that was actually a better knock.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.560
It's been a fucking year that you've been doing this.

17:09.560 --> 17:10.760
And I still love this door.

17:10.760 --> 17:11.720
Yeah, god damn.

17:12.840 --> 17:13.400
I'm rich.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.000
It's a lot of money.

17:20.280 --> 17:22.520
How, how, where would it be if you really did some effects?

17:22.520 --> 17:23.720
Like super awkward, like,

17:24.520 --> 17:27.480
if what if he just didn't, he just never stood back.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.600
Like he just died.

17:28.600 --> 17:31.480
Oh, I would be, I would, it's not even my money.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.240
That's George Sobba's rent money.

17:33.240 --> 17:37.560
That he been modes to me, that I have to go get money from the bank later today.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.680
Yeah, our landlord lives in the desert.

17:42.680 --> 17:45.800
And we pay rent and cash because he doesn't want the government to know that he's a landlord.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.400
So he got a discount on utilities.

17:49.080 --> 17:52.520
He drives in usually a week after the first for whatever reason.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.400
Welcome to Bond of the Week.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.280
This is where, so Daniel Craig is out.

17:58.280 --> 17:59.320
The movie came out today.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.760
No time to die, but there is time to cast.

18:03.880 --> 18:07.320
And I'm wondering who the next Bond might be this week in your head.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.440
For me, it's Jeff Kina.

18:09.080 --> 18:09.880
It too.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.240
Daniel Kaluya.

18:11.880 --> 18:12.600
It's fun.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.560
I do want to point out that last week,

18:15.560 --> 18:18.440
your pick was Jillian Anderson, who's not British.

18:18.440 --> 18:21.080
I thought she was because of sex education.

18:21.080 --> 18:23.320
Yeah, really good accents.

18:23.320 --> 18:23.720
Yeah.

18:24.680 --> 18:25.400
Great act.

18:25.400 --> 18:29.320
I think she does kind of talk that way now in real life.

18:29.320 --> 18:30.200
Yeah, she does.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.560
She has a lot of stuff.

18:31.560 --> 18:33.800
Because she also did like the fall.

18:33.800 --> 18:37.880
She, you know, her Hannibal character kind of at a weird

18:38.680 --> 18:39.320
time.

18:39.320 --> 18:39.560
Yeah.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.520
Who are your guys' bonds of the week?

18:43.720 --> 18:49.240
My pick is Tyler Perry as Medea within British accent.

18:51.000 --> 18:51.880
Can you do that?

18:51.880 --> 18:52.680
That's so good.

18:53.560 --> 18:54.760
No, I can't.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.360
But I'm sure he can't.

18:56.360 --> 18:59.800
Could you imagine like a British black ass big Medea?

18:59.800 --> 19:00.760
Like, that would be tough.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.360
The first one, they shoot in Atlanta.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.320
No time to die.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.600
Hey, Larry.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.760
Then, Kyle, can you do the Tyler Perry

19:18.760 --> 19:19.800
and pressure in the Medea?

19:19.800 --> 19:21.160
No, I see it.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.160
I won't be doing that.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.360
Kyle, who's your bond of the week?

19:24.360 --> 19:25.960
Man, come on, let's actually participate.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.120
Man, I don't know.

19:28.120 --> 19:28.520
I don't know.

19:28.520 --> 19:29.960
I feel like I need to think about this more.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.320
But obviously, whatever I've been even watching on TV,

19:34.920 --> 19:36.120
watching the O.C.

19:36.120 --> 19:38.200
I'm trying to think if there's anybody in the O.C.

19:38.200 --> 19:38.600
Yeah, I would.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.120
Brody would be an interesting bond.

19:44.440 --> 19:44.920
They do.

19:44.920 --> 19:45.400
Exactly.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.440
They break their bond.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.640
I don't have to be British.

19:48.760 --> 19:49.720
Is that a rule?

19:49.720 --> 19:50.040
Yep.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.760
I mean, it's just kind of a rule in the sense

19:52.760 --> 19:54.440
that that's just how it's been before, right?

19:54.440 --> 19:55.720
I think rules are ready to be broken.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.160
So, yeah, I don't know.

19:57.160 --> 19:58.680
Tradition, there's something to be said for it.

19:58.680 --> 19:59.000
So.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.320
Um, all right, this week.

20:07.320 --> 20:08.120
Oh, see.

20:09.480 --> 20:10.280
I'm trying it.

20:10.280 --> 20:14.520
So one time I tweeted what if bond was like 23?

20:14.520 --> 20:16.680
So I'm trying to think of a younger person.

20:16.680 --> 20:17.880
Because I think that would be funny.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.400
That's why I think it should be Daniel Cleo, though.

20:19.480 --> 20:20.680
I'd love if it was either cell.

20:20.680 --> 20:23.480
But I feel like he's only going to get like two, like if it's him,

20:23.480 --> 20:25.160
it's got to be one of those transitional bonds.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.520
Because he's like 50.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.680
Daniel Craig was 37 when he got it.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.160
So I think they need to give it to someone like around 30.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.240
And I think Daniel Cleo is like 32.

20:33.240 --> 20:36.760
Well, going off, Daniel Cleo, uh, skins cast.

20:36.760 --> 20:37.960
Dev Patel would be fun.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.200
Dev Patel would be awesome.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.320
I would love that.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.440
That would be great.

20:42.440 --> 20:45.720
I saw him at Arrow on once and he was so tall.

20:46.040 --> 20:50.840
And he was wearing an IWC pilot's mark 18.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.440
And I just like, my guy.

20:52.440 --> 20:56.920
Oh, what if we did a Patrick Stewart to do from?

20:56.920 --> 21:00.440
Yeah, I just watched him for a while.

21:00.440 --> 21:01.440
Absolutely.

21:01.440 --> 21:02.440
I'm not going to do that.

21:02.440 --> 21:06.440
He does his own stunts and dies in the first shot.

21:06.440 --> 21:09.720
I'm really pulling the children's hands.

21:09.720 --> 21:10.720
Oh, my god.

21:10.720 --> 21:11.720
It's so cool.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.720
Yeah, it's so cool.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.560
We do have to take a quick break.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.480
Wait, did everybody get their bond picking?

21:17.480 --> 21:18.280
We all did, right?

21:18.280 --> 21:19.400
It doesn't fucking matter.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.360
That's going to be a big.

21:20.360 --> 21:21.240
Let's go to you didn't?

21:21.240 --> 21:21.720
No, I did.

21:21.720 --> 21:22.200
I'll do it.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.880
I mean, Adam Brody sounds good to me.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.160
You can do a pretty check set.

21:25.160 --> 21:25.320
Yeah.

21:25.320 --> 21:26.200
Who is Adam Brody?

21:26.200 --> 21:28.040
Because I think it wasn't that your answer last week?

21:28.840 --> 21:29.320
No.

21:29.320 --> 21:29.480
My.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.400
I mean, Adam Brody is not British.

21:35.240 --> 21:37.160
My answer last week was Aaron Taylor Johnson.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.200
Adam Brody was pretty fire on Kilmer Girls.

21:40.200 --> 21:40.920
We'll be right back.

21:46.200 --> 21:59.160
And we're back at it again with the light bands.

21:59.160 --> 22:04.040
Daniel, back at it again with the wide bands.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.400
E a sports.

22:10.600 --> 22:11.800
We're ready for our next segment.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.960
Everybody say yes on 31, 2, 3.

22:13.960 --> 22:14.600
Yes.

22:14.680 --> 22:15.560
We'll figure it out.

22:15.560 --> 22:16.120
Here we go.

22:25.960 --> 22:26.360
It's gone.

22:28.520 --> 22:32.840
I feel like eventually we're going to have a compilation of people walking off-screen

22:32.840 --> 22:36.280
during this video, but that's sometimes a mangrove.

22:37.640 --> 22:38.600
Is that a coffee?

22:38.600 --> 22:39.320
Ice coffee?

22:39.960 --> 22:40.600
God of being.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.400
Isn't Jeff a like a young Gallagher?

22:48.520 --> 22:49.960
The kid can log out too.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.120
Name that drier.

22:56.360 --> 22:56.840
Okay.

22:58.680 --> 22:59.240
Natalie.

22:59.880 --> 23:00.680
That's 1008.

23:02.680 --> 23:06.600
It's um, it's not quite that kind of game.

23:08.680 --> 23:11.960
The New York Times just released a list of the four best

23:12.040 --> 23:13.480
haired driers on the market.

23:14.360 --> 23:17.480
And I'm basically going to see if you can

23:18.600 --> 23:20.680
using only your oral skills.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.000
decipher which drier is which.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.320
Here we go.

23:29.320 --> 23:29.640
Ready?

23:30.440 --> 23:32.920
Can we know the options?

23:35.880 --> 23:37.720
Yeah, I guess that makes it more fun, doesn't it?

23:37.720 --> 23:38.040
Okay.

23:38.120 --> 23:39.000
Yeah.

23:41.720 --> 23:44.280
Paris absolutely cut this out.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.640
All right, your options are.

23:49.640 --> 23:51.160
I'm going to drop them in the chat.

23:51.160 --> 23:51.640
Okay.

23:52.200 --> 23:52.920
The rust,

23:53.880 --> 23:55.480
weightless professional.

24:00.360 --> 24:01.960
The rev air.

24:05.240 --> 24:06.440
The Dyson.

24:06.520 --> 24:09.400
Super sonic haired drier.

24:11.240 --> 24:14.520
And the infinity pro.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.760
By con air.

24:17.560 --> 24:18.520
haired drier.

24:28.360 --> 24:29.480
That's a hand.

24:29.480 --> 24:30.760
Something with the hands, right?

24:30.760 --> 24:32.360
That's the rev air.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.160
No way, run one.

24:36.120 --> 24:36.680
That's wrong.

24:36.680 --> 24:37.880
It's not the rev air.

24:37.880 --> 24:38.680
Is it the Dyson?

24:44.120 --> 24:44.600
Rasc.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.120
That's correct.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.440
The rust weightless.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.280
Keep in mind not something there there might be

24:54.280 --> 24:55.000
repeats.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
So that this is not a process of elimination.

24:57.000 --> 24:57.320
Here we go.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.520
We're going to go to the second here drier.

25:05.800 --> 25:11.000
The rev air.

25:13.560 --> 25:14.920
Wait, there might be repeats.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.560
Like they made multiple videos of each error.

25:18.280 --> 25:21.000
No, that doesn't mean I got these from YouTube.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.200
Like there could be repeats.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.800
Like I just want you to know that just because there's already been the

25:25.800 --> 25:28.680
the weightless doesn't mean that I won't do the weightless again.

25:28.680 --> 25:29.240
Does that make sense?

25:29.240 --> 25:32.440
So I don't want you to think that you're going to narrow it down the further we get into this.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.920
That was really backing on that so this sucks.

25:39.400 --> 25:40.520
Do you guys need to hear it again?

25:40.520 --> 25:41.240
This is crazy.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.520
Yeah, yeah, heavy again, heavy again, heavy again.

25:46.360 --> 25:49.400
The pire pitch, so it's not, it's not the rev again.

25:50.360 --> 25:51.800
That's telling it two different gears.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.080
It shifts gears.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.040
Let me get away through.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.000
Isn't it cold and hot?

25:55.000 --> 25:55.560
Does that?

25:55.560 --> 25:58.280
Don't most air driers have like kind of a hot

25:59.240 --> 26:01.000
And then there's like the modes.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.440
But that infinity pro.

26:05.720 --> 26:09.960
Correct the infinity pro by Con air hair drier.

26:10.680 --> 26:16.200
All right, these all Jeff are these all hair driers or some of them like ones that have brushes.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.400
These are all hair driers.

26:19.400 --> 26:22.760
The rev air is actually a reverse hair dryer.

26:22.760 --> 26:27.880
So basically you put your hair into it and then it like warms it around it.

26:27.960 --> 26:28.600
Does that make sense?

26:31.480 --> 26:32.280
I think you're here wet.

26:32.280 --> 26:33.160
It's whoever is here dry.

26:37.960 --> 26:41.720
Wait, it's a shower head.

26:42.680 --> 26:48.360
Why is there a lot for other right?

26:50.360 --> 26:51.880
Searching for videos.

26:54.280 --> 26:57.640
That's really searching for the dice at different Sonic.

27:02.040 --> 27:03.640
Town of the keys are to shit.

27:05.640 --> 27:08.280
He's having a wave for the pre-roll ads to add.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.960
So we have two second video.

27:12.760 --> 27:15.480
Okay, um, here we go, ready?

27:20.920 --> 27:22.280
Gotta be the Dyson.

27:22.280 --> 27:24.680
Holy shit, Marieka's cleaning us.

27:24.680 --> 27:26.680
That's the Dyson Super Sonic.

27:26.680 --> 27:27.880
All right, here we go, you ready?

27:31.880 --> 27:32.280
Harsh.

27:33.560 --> 27:37.160
Sounds like the hand dryer in the LA office.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.640
That's your hand.

27:44.840 --> 27:46.040
Wait, can I hear that one again?

27:46.040 --> 27:49.160
Because though if it's reverse, it would sound like a backing cleaner, right?

27:51.880 --> 27:53.400
To me, that sounds like it's sucking in.

27:53.400 --> 27:54.440
I think that's the rev air.

27:56.920 --> 27:57.400
Fuck.

27:58.280 --> 27:58.760
Russ.

28:00.760 --> 28:01.720
Correct!

28:01.720 --> 28:03.160
This is fucking weird.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.560
Why are you reacting to this?

28:05.560 --> 28:07.880
Your oral skills are off the charts.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.520
Here we go, last one, ready?

28:13.960 --> 28:14.600
We're out of the air.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.080
Insane.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.320
Actually, insane.

28:22.760 --> 28:25.080
Marieka, this is a huge shout out of air.

28:28.680 --> 28:29.880
All right, well, that was.

28:38.920 --> 28:45.240
Are you a shame that you didn't best to me?

28:49.320 --> 28:51.400
It's all good for audio.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.080
Like at the end of the day, it's just entertainment.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.520
We shouldn't take it that serious.

28:55.480 --> 28:56.600
We're out of the air.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.000
All right, I just wanted to take a moment in the middle of the show.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.800
And so instead of at the end to plug our live show,

29:11.800 --> 29:13.720
this episode's coming out on October 15th,

29:13.720 --> 29:20.200
which means that next Friday, the first ever headgum podcast live, October 22nd,

29:20.280 --> 29:23.400
Friday night, 7 p.m. New York City,

29:23.400 --> 29:28.360
Grammarcy Theater on East 23rd, Danny is going to be on the show.

29:28.360 --> 29:29.800
Marieka is going to be on the show.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.560
And that's all I'll say about the lineup.

29:31.560 --> 29:34.040
All right, it's going to be gangbusters.

29:34.760 --> 29:39.320
But we still have a couple more tickets to sell out.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.320
The venue, we're very close to selling out.

29:41.320 --> 29:45.000
At the time of recording, there are 69 tickets left, I believe.

29:45.000 --> 29:45.960
And nice.

29:48.200 --> 29:48.600
Sorry.

29:49.560 --> 29:50.360
You're not that guy.

29:56.360 --> 29:59.640
But anyway, so in order to sell those last couple tickets out,

29:59.640 --> 30:00.920
I made a couple posters.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.600
And I wanted to show them to you guys.

30:02.600 --> 30:03.640
Is that helpful?

30:03.640 --> 30:04.680
Yeah, thank you.

30:04.680 --> 30:08.920
All right, I think you're going to like, um, I worked hard on them.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.200
And I think they look good.

30:10.200 --> 30:10.680
Here we go.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.920
If you guys have any notes, let me know because, uh,

30:14.920 --> 30:16.680
Marieka, you obviously are social media director.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.680
So I just kind of want to include you on this process.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.840
But I welcome any notes.

30:20.840 --> 30:22.280
But I think they all should be good to go.

30:22.280 --> 30:22.680
Here we go.

30:25.080 --> 30:28.840
So this one's sort of like, it's basically like turning it into a

30:28.840 --> 30:29.800
people show almost.

30:30.520 --> 30:31.080
What?

30:31.080 --> 30:32.680
Oh no, no.

30:32.680 --> 30:34.280
Why is it plastic?

30:34.280 --> 30:36.200
This is, yeah, for sure.

30:37.640 --> 30:38.760
How do you have that picture?

30:40.040 --> 30:41.800
I just searched Google, uh, Google,

30:41.800 --> 30:44.280
Marieka Brownlee on Google images hunting.

30:44.280 --> 30:46.520
Uh, yeah, obviously the show is not

30:47.480 --> 30:51.640
um, well, you, it doesn't matter if the show ends up being this.

30:51.640 --> 30:54.040
It's like if we advertise this, it'll get people in seats.

30:54.040 --> 30:55.320
And all we need to do is sell tickets.

30:55.320 --> 30:56.840
That's false advertising.

30:56.840 --> 30:57.800
I'd never do that.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.840
All right, we can mix that one because we have a couple more options.

31:00.840 --> 31:05.560
But let's just look at these with not only a discerning eye, but a positive lens.

31:06.840 --> 31:07.480
How about this?

31:12.360 --> 31:13.480
What about it?

31:13.640 --> 31:16.520
Um, obviously has nothing to do with the show, right?

31:17.560 --> 31:19.960
Again, you just have to get asses in seats.

31:20.680 --> 31:24.680
It doesn't matter whether you solve the opioid crisis or not, which by the way, I did spell it wrong.

31:25.400 --> 31:29.240
But I think this sells those last couple of tickets.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.640
And I'm not going to apologize for putting this on a poster.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.520
I mean, I think you should.

31:34.520 --> 31:36.040
You can't tell me it doesn't look good.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.880
Yeah, yeah, great design work.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.080
Then what's your issue with it?

31:41.720 --> 31:47.000
It all it needs is I'm going to podcast live October 22nd 7 p.m.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.120
Okay, if that's all it needs, then you're not going to like any of these.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.000
Here's the next one.

31:56.200 --> 31:59.000
Nice little strange design looks great.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.040
Yeah, but again, the messaging is there.

32:02.040 --> 32:03.400
Had gone podcast live.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.240
It's almost too simple.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.640
And also, yeah, like what does that mean?

32:08.600 --> 32:10.600
I don't know, like, don't be shy.

32:10.600 --> 32:11.400
Don't be a stranger.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.280
Come to the show.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.280
But I tickets get your ass in seats.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.480
Let's do this, man.

32:18.040 --> 32:19.560
I think it looks good.

32:19.560 --> 32:25.560
And by the way, I made this on this thing called Pixar, which is, uh, it's like a super easy to use

32:25.560 --> 32:27.000
photo design app.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.600
And so I know that it looks like I spent a lot of time on this, but I didn't.

32:31.160 --> 32:34.280
So I don't know if you should give me daps for that or if you should give

32:34.280 --> 32:35.480
Pixar daps for that.

32:36.440 --> 32:39.960
And we can, you know, you can, you can use a bunch of different backgrounds.

32:39.960 --> 32:42.040
You can, there's different templates to choose from.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.400
You just drag and drop photos.

32:43.400 --> 32:44.440
You edit text.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.880
And it's so easy, even.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.080
I can use it.

32:47.080 --> 32:47.960
And add it.

32:47.960 --> 32:49.240
Let's see what?

32:49.240 --> 32:50.600
Is this an ad?

32:50.600 --> 32:52.760
No, because you already have the ad break.

32:52.760 --> 32:53.720
You can do cool things too.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.240
You can even add stickers like this.

33:00.920 --> 33:01.720
Nice brown.

33:01.720 --> 33:03.320
So way too aggressive.

33:03.320 --> 33:08.040
I can, threatening the audience, which I don't think will sell tickets.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.840
We have two weeks to sell this thing out.

33:10.840 --> 33:12.280
The last 70 aren't going.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.280
So if this is what it takes, I'm down.

33:14.280 --> 33:15.560
I'm fucking down.

33:15.560 --> 33:16.680
And I am that guy, pal.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.400
Let's just simplify it.

33:19.400 --> 33:20.520
This is the last one.

33:20.520 --> 33:23.080
I thought we were going to use all of these, but maybe we will just use this last one.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.520
I mean, it has all the info.

33:29.160 --> 33:33.560
I don't really know why I'm like a thumbnail on it.

33:34.840 --> 33:39.080
I ran on some of those on Google Images to you.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.280
Yeah, that's fair.

33:40.280 --> 33:42.440
It could last me for images.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.920
Yeah, like sure, I don't know.

33:48.280 --> 33:49.560
What a love to prove all.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.800
This is a prove all right.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.880
I just had hard to get you on the horn sometimes.

33:54.680 --> 33:55.400
But anyway.

33:56.040 --> 33:59.240
I did use Pixar for all of those.

33:59.240 --> 34:00.440
And I had a ton of fun using it.

34:00.440 --> 34:03.640
So if you guys ever need to use posters or make posters

34:03.640 --> 34:05.880
or any promotional materials in photographs,

34:07.480 --> 34:08.120
use Pixar.

34:13.560 --> 34:14.360
Everybody.

34:17.080 --> 34:19.400
Full steam ahead, Danny.

34:19.560 --> 34:20.840
Yeah, we don't know.

34:23.080 --> 34:25.240
This show is going really well.

34:25.240 --> 34:26.920
I just feel like we're teeter tottering.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.120
It feels fragile to me.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.480
So let's go into the next segment.

34:29.480 --> 34:30.200
Are you guys ready?

34:31.160 --> 34:31.560
Yep.

34:31.560 --> 34:32.280
Yes, sir.

34:32.280 --> 34:32.920
In car.

34:39.560 --> 34:43.240
Welcome to true or nearer.

34:45.640 --> 34:46.840
Have you guys played Truth or Dare?

34:48.200 --> 34:48.680
Yes.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.040
Well, that's truth or dare.

34:50.040 --> 34:52.600
Where do you ask either answer something honestly

34:52.600 --> 34:54.040
or have to do with dare?

34:54.040 --> 34:55.160
This is truth or nearer.

34:55.880 --> 34:59.400
So the name of the game is truth or nearer.

34:59.400 --> 35:03.240
And basically the idea behind it is I'm going to ask you guys questions.

35:03.240 --> 35:07.000
But we're well, I go around to you guys and you say truth or nearer.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.200
Actually, it's not really that it's I'm going to ask you a question

35:12.200 --> 35:15.000
and you either tell the truth and answer it honestly.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.240
And you have to be really honest or

35:19.640 --> 35:22.200
I'm going to show you a photo of a child.

35:22.200 --> 35:25.480
And you're going to have to say, I near that kid.

35:26.680 --> 35:31.800
So basically, you'd be rubbing nearer on a child getting rid of all its hair.

35:34.280 --> 35:37.720
Instead of just answering a simple fucking question here we go.

35:41.320 --> 35:42.520
Let's start with Maria.

35:42.520 --> 35:44.600
Maria truth or nearer.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.800
And this is the question.

35:45.800 --> 35:47.400
Have you ever eaten ass?

35:49.640 --> 35:50.360
Nearer.

35:51.160 --> 35:53.160
All right. Here we go.

35:55.480 --> 35:55.880
Sit.

35:57.320 --> 35:58.280
What is it?

35:58.280 --> 36:00.120
You just have to say, I near this.

36:00.120 --> 36:01.560
I'm going to near this kid.

36:02.840 --> 36:04.120
I'm going to near this kid.

36:08.600 --> 36:12.920
You are not the angel that everyone thinks you are.

36:13.640 --> 36:15.400
Wait, what's up?

36:15.400 --> 36:18.600
I'm just trying to be with holding a personal information

36:18.600 --> 36:23.560
but no, you want a fucking give this kid a bold arm.

36:23.560 --> 36:24.600
Sure.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.760
I mean, you probably doesn't have arm hair.

36:26.760 --> 36:27.640
It's a kid.

36:27.640 --> 36:28.360
All right.

36:28.360 --> 36:28.760
All right.

36:28.760 --> 36:29.960
That's a fly near game.

36:29.960 --> 36:32.040
That's pretty easy to like near a child.

36:32.040 --> 36:32.680
They don't care.

36:33.240 --> 36:35.080
That's good going to get her account.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.040
I'm sure.

36:36.040 --> 36:38.600
All right, Danny, truth or nearer.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.040
And this is the question.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.280
How many people have you had sex with in your entire life?

36:43.240 --> 36:46.040
Ha ha ha ha ha.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.840
Nearer, please.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.280
All right.

36:50.280 --> 36:52.040
Why are all these babies black?

36:52.040 --> 36:53.240
Roast it not.

36:53.240 --> 36:54.760
There's so many more.

36:54.760 --> 36:55.720
There's just two more.

36:55.720 --> 36:56.680
Roast it.

36:56.680 --> 36:58.200
All these black babies.

36:58.200 --> 36:59.000
All right, Danny.

37:00.040 --> 37:00.760
You got to say it.

37:00.760 --> 37:01.720
I'm going to near this kid.

37:05.320 --> 37:06.360
I don't know what was going on.

37:06.360 --> 37:08.520
This is the hip of isolation.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.960
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

37:11.960 --> 37:14.040
I guess if we're gun to my head.

37:14.040 --> 37:14.680
I'll

37:15.080 --> 37:17.000
near the elbow.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.120
No, but that's not true, Danny,

37:18.120 --> 37:19.160
because it wasn't gunned to your head.

37:19.160 --> 37:20.440
It was just a simple question.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.360
And you would rather nare a kid.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.080
And I think that makes you sort

37:25.080 --> 37:26.280
of a scondrel almost.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.600
I'll take it.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.080
That was easy.

37:35.080 --> 37:35.560
Okay.

37:35.560 --> 37:37.480
Um, pile, you're ready.

37:38.520 --> 37:45.000
Truth or narrow, and this is your question. Is your wife the best sexual partner you've ever had?

37:46.520 --> 37:48.520
Yes. Really?

37:51.000 --> 37:53.160
Pile, holy shit. Oh, baby. Yes.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.680
That's really awesome, actually.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.680
Just show me a kid anyway. I'll do it.

38:02.680 --> 38:07.160
This is fucked up, but all right. I want to say that you'll narrow this kid.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.800
No, I'm not going to say that. That's fucked up.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.880
That's where you draw the line. Don't say it's fucked up.

38:15.480 --> 38:17.880
Naren, kids. It's terrible. I would.

38:20.760 --> 38:23.480
What did you do to put this to find these little kids?

38:26.120 --> 38:27.400
All right. Marie, go back to you.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.760
Truth or narrow, and your question is weirdest, kink.

38:33.160 --> 38:36.440
Not a true false question. Yeah, not a truth.

38:36.440 --> 38:39.880
It's not a truth. It's barely a question, but again, Nare.

38:40.600 --> 38:44.600
All right. Here you go. I'm going to narrow this kid.

38:48.920 --> 38:55.240
I came up with this game last night at 345 in the goddamn morning. Yeah, you can't. We can tell. Yeah.

38:56.040 --> 38:58.200
Here we go. Back to Danny.

38:58.840 --> 39:06.440
What's your personal record for Times Climaxing in a day?

39:08.200 --> 39:11.880
Truth or narrow? I really don't want to see any more babies.

39:13.480 --> 39:15.480
This one's not that hard to answer.

39:16.680 --> 39:26.360
Yeah, two to three, maybe. I had sex four times in a night two weeks ago, and I was so so

39:27.320 --> 39:32.600
were. That doesn't actually sound bad fun. It was in the fourth time. It was tough.

39:33.880 --> 39:39.240
You outside like this. Yeah, you got this moment like four weeks ago.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.880
Drop it. It was four times the second. Wow.

39:47.160 --> 39:52.200
All right. The thing about it is back then you had like the real like red eyes to that thing. That's a

39:52.200 --> 39:58.440
wild picture of just just in the middle of night. It was starting that.

40:00.680 --> 40:05.480
I don't like that. This baby is still looking at this.

40:05.480 --> 40:10.040
I can't believe it. Are you really worse than me saying I'd narrow this kid? It was having

40:10.040 --> 40:14.920
it just up during this conversation. You're exactly right. Here we go. Back to pile.

40:15.640 --> 40:20.680
What's the closest? I don't know why I said it British. What's the closest you've come to

40:20.680 --> 40:44.840
cheating on your betrothed? I don't know what would be the closest that if it wasn't like

40:44.840 --> 40:56.040
overtly something. You know what I mean? I wouldn't consider that an answer to the

40:56.040 --> 41:01.480
questions, so you're going to have to, you're going to have to narrow this kid. Okay, I'll narrow this kid.

41:02.680 --> 41:07.160
I will eat your ass. I hit the wrong button. It was supposed to be.

41:07.480 --> 41:17.000
All right. Okay, so are you just doing Google searches to find these kids?

41:17.000 --> 41:21.560
Because the websites that are coming up are like insane. I just looked up children.

41:21.560 --> 41:25.080
It was very pediatric then told me.

41:26.360 --> 41:30.600
Maria come back to you. Who's the most problematic celebrity that you would want to have sex with?

41:30.760 --> 41:45.240
It's not a thing that I can even come up with, I think. Here you go. Yeah, I'm going to narrow this kid.

41:46.200 --> 41:48.680
Oh, no, no, no, no.

41:48.680 --> 41:51.720
The fight on this pig tail. So fucked up.

41:55.960 --> 41:57.480
That's dance break.

42:02.040 --> 42:03.640
Weird PBS sound right.

42:10.520 --> 42:15.080
We made it. Another video episode of the

42:15.720 --> 42:22.200
podcast in. The bank. Ajiえー, is what I

42:22.200 --> 42:25.080
would have, I don't have that sound up, and I don't want to search for it, because everybody

42:25.080 --> 42:30.120
gives me shit for the way I search with my eyes and we can't edit that out.

42:33.720 --> 42:37.800
Do you guys remember Lionel Coinbank?

42:37.800 --> 42:41.800
No, no, you guys do remember. What is that? Lionel Coinbank. Lionel Coinbank.

42:41.800 --> 42:48.240
Save your money, save your money, and it was like a Lionel train coin bank for kids

42:50.680 --> 42:52.680
Was it like a connoissele?

42:53.320 --> 42:54.520
It's like a toy or something?

42:54.520 --> 42:58.680
I feel like I heard you talk about this recently, but I don't know what it is

43:02.360 --> 43:04.600
I don't fucking know how did you have Jeff?

43:06.760 --> 43:10.360
I was talking to my friend about this and she also remembered it, so

43:11.160 --> 43:16.200
But I maybe it was like a region at one note because Danny you're also from Ohio you would have gotten that that ad

43:18.040 --> 43:20.040
Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about, bro

43:21.400 --> 43:25.320
Very good either way. I believe you're not supporting I appreciate that

43:26.200 --> 43:30.040
I mean that was all I had we're at 41 minutes. Is that fine? Is that good?

43:31.000 --> 43:32.200
Course

43:32.200 --> 43:35.640
Let's end it here better than some episodes. I agree. I agree

43:37.640 --> 43:39.000
All right

43:39.960 --> 43:41.960
Better than some episodes

43:44.280 --> 43:48.920
No, let's go to plugs. Let's go to plugs and let I'll get a little thing to get us into them. Here we go

43:50.120 --> 43:53.320
Jeff with your hair like that you look like

43:53.880 --> 43:55.880
Little Richard right now to me

43:57.160 --> 44:02.440
And the mustache. It's the mustache too. I guess. Yeah, but this really high like that is like

44:03.160 --> 44:06.760
I think you should I think you should I think you should I think you should

44:06.760 --> 44:12.360
Really like clock your hair just for the fun of it see what happens. I don't

44:13.160 --> 44:15.160
Like having hair product in my hair

44:15.560 --> 44:20.360
But I'll do it for you guys. Wow. You want to end this show so badly you keep getting upset

44:25.880 --> 44:30.520
Plus, Danny, what do you got going on? What do you want to point to people to the foreseers?

44:31.160 --> 44:39.000
Man a podcast thing and doing shows here in LA follow me at follow sellers on Instagram and Twitter

44:39.000 --> 44:43.240

There's a new head gun podcast called senior superlatives with Greta title men

45:03.720 --> 45:09.480
That'll be really fun. So we're talking about high school experiences with guests and friends

45:10.840 --> 45:15.720
So I'm sure it'll be very cringe-worthy and good

45:15.960 --> 45:17.320
Um

45:17.320 --> 45:19.320
The first episode comes out

45:20.040 --> 45:23.320
The day before this comes out so it'll be live and you can listen to it

45:24.120 --> 45:27.000

Welcome to the Overlapping Dialogue Special.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Two hundred episodes in the can.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000

Emma Willie.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Marisa Brownlee.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Joel Dunn-Off.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
And the car.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
You know what I mean?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
I don't know what I mean.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
I don't know what I mean.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I don't know what I mean.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
And I don't know what I mean.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
And I don't know what I mean.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
And I don't understand.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
And I don't understand.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
And we please count somebody count.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
From the top.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
All right.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
We've got one.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Two.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Three.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Four.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Five.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Seven.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Eight.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Nine.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Ten.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Ten.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Ten.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Ten.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Twenty-two.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.240
I mean, it has to be on at once.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.840
Jeff said, somebody, please count one, two, three.

02:24.840 --> 02:27.640
That's supposed to mean that.

02:27.640 --> 02:30.720
Thank you, just means you count.

02:30.720 --> 02:35.160
Okay, so I feel like it's gonna be a whole garage.

02:35.160 --> 02:36.160
Yeah.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.160
Zack, you have a heart out, right?

02:38.160 --> 02:39.480
I don't, it's fine.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.480
Don't worry about it.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.920
I just say, you know, because I told you it's fine.

02:43.920 --> 02:44.920
It's about you.

02:44.920 --> 02:45.920
It's fine.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.560
You made it quite clear that you're working on a big Hollywood

02:49.560 --> 02:50.960
production in Atlanta.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.280
He's coming in from a trailer, which you're not even

02:53.280 --> 02:54.240
called to set today.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.280
You just wanted to breath.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.080
I rented a trailer just to be.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.080
Do whatever schedule you want.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.640
Okay, I appreciate that.

03:04.640 --> 03:05.880
Emma, you've never been on the show.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.560
You're the only one on here who's never been on the show.

03:07.560 --> 03:08.680
Yeah, I'm cut, you feel.

03:08.680 --> 03:09.800
But that's okay.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.200
And all are.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.520
Let's, who do we think looks the most upset to be here?

03:15.520 --> 03:16.760
I think it's Jake.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.520
I'm watching a soccer game.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.960
I'm really checked out.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.720
I totally, I don't know, I believe.

03:23.720 --> 03:27.520
Listen, I constantly tell overlapping dialogue on this show.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.560
I say that eight of make it easier in the edit

03:29.560 --> 03:32.560
and be to kind of keep that energy up.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.840
We should always be constantly not interrupting necessarily,

03:35.840 --> 03:38.440
but kind of catching each other's tail into their sentences

03:38.440 --> 03:42.200
and starting our own, starting a new and here we are

03:42.200 --> 03:44.360
with almost 20 people, I think I already forgot.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.360
22, yeah.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.360
22.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.360
Yeah.

03:47.360 --> 03:51.160
I think it's going to be easy for us to overlap dialogue

03:51.160 --> 03:54.960
today or really hard because everyone's waiting for the other person.

03:54.960 --> 03:55.960
That's, yeah.

03:55.960 --> 03:56.960
Yeah.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.160
It's hard because already there's way more silence than I thought

03:59.160 --> 04:00.160
there's going to be.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.640
The show is really, how many people can you steam roll?

04:02.640 --> 04:08.600
Fairies, you're making your, your return to the show.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.600
I've been trying to get you on the show for like a few weeks.

04:10.600 --> 04:14.000
And then the schedules have been lined up and now here you are on one of the most important

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
episodes ever.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Yes, sir.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Good to be back.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
God, I do not envy Grace on the, you know, miss on this one.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
I'm sorry.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Jesus Christ.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
God, I'm goal, baby.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
I run in Johnson at the back post with a team of Werner Cross.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I mean, I love to see that show.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
I mean, I love to see that show.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
All right.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
You want to see that show.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
But it's over laughing.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Is it not?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
It's overlapping.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
It is dialogue.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I'm trying to figure out because there is one.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
We do have to continue.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
We have a lot to see in the celebration.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Sorry.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Just one second.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
Joel and John are sharing a sort of headphone.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Yeah.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Yeah.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
And I'm like, this whole room is sharing a headphone.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
It was on Joel's last account.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
We started recording.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
You got it.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
You got a lot to do there.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Who's the thing I was here?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Actually invited to be here.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Marie get texted me 15 minutes before the start time.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
She says, are you going to be here?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
And I just kind of work.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I'm here.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Actually, I'm a bit bone to pick with Wilcon over.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Well, I think it was yesterday.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
I posted a photo on my story.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Oh, yeah.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
We'll said this.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
First time ever.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
First ever.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
He said such a warm smile with a heart.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
It was a cute picture.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
I hope you edited it in because it's a very sweet picture.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
You look handsome.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
What?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
But were you being facetious?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
No.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
No.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I'm not jumping down.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
You're reacting.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
I was going to be here today.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
So I want to start off on a good footage.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
It was a warm to pick.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
Here we go.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
We're jumping straight into it.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
We're going to be bonfire.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
We're circling the fucking new 007.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Barbara Brockley might be hiring Aaron Taylor Joy.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
What is it?

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
My bond of the week is Bruce Boxleitner.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
Because it's time for a 73-year-old James Tron.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Boo!

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
He grabbed the office.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
He grabbed the office.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
He grabbed the office.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
He grabbed the office.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
He's Welsh not British.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
But he opened the scoring against West Ham.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
So I kind of respect him.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
22-year-old Welsh footballer.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Casey, who's your bond of the week?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Pass.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
I might pass.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
I might pass too.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
No, no, you could do that.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
That's all.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Jeff Stair.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Jeff Stair is such a freaky stare for those at home.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Who don't get to give this to you?

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
He says these things so loud and just Stair is at you.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
It's like a dog who needs to go out.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
And listen to you.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
I just hear you.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Yeah, bond of the week.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Correct.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Correct.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I kind of love Shrek for bond.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
That's cool.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Amir?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Ah, Ferris.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Ferris is good.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Yeah.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Wow.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
No, Ferris is going to say Jack Black.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
But I'll take it.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
I'll take it.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
Everybody just say you're bond of the week at once.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Three, two, one.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
That's it.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Sorry.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Sorry.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Sorry.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Sorry.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Sorry.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Oh, so.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Jeff does this thing for those of you who don't know because Jeff,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
there are people on the show who have never been on the show before.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Just Emma.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Just Emma.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
If you want to explain what bond of the week is to Emma.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Okay.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
It wasn't even hearing that.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Daniel Craig is out.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Daniel Craig is out as bond.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
So every week until the next James is cast.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
We are casting our vote for who should be casting the next double.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
It's been going on forever.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
Probably just to the place of this segment when the bond is officially cast.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Indiana Jones.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Definitely.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Jones of the year.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I don't know if it's quite been.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I don't know if we've done bond of the week every episode.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
But how many bonds do you think we've done?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Because you know, this is a pretty big episode.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
It's number.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
It's about one on two.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Episode 72.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Okay.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Marike coming in with the fact.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Not only the fact.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
So like there's like 120 episodes.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
You've done ish with bond of the week.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Correct.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Like four people.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
The answer is too many.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
It's been.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
It's been.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
It's been two years.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Yes.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
I get that.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
I mean, this is.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
But this is a monumental episode.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Whether we've done bond of the week for every single week.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
I mean, again, it's episode number.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
What is it?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Two hundred.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Two hundred.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
One hundred.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Where do the day?

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Two hundred.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
That's exactly right.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
It's both off.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Where do the day is two hundred.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Was that Marie conceded?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Yeah.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
All right.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
I'm going to let me cash.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
I'm going to let you cash.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
This is kind of a throwback to an old segment we used to do before.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Billy actually told me that.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
No.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Chainsax repercussions.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Choke.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
It's crazy.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Wow.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Oh.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Oh.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
This is the wife.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
You can do a wife.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Do it again.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Oh.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Oh.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Oh.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Yes.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Yeah.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Brut shell.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Oh.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Oh.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Oh.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Why for the week?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Oh.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Oh.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Oh.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Oh.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Oh.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Don't go.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Why for the week?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Oh.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Oh.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Oh.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Wow.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
These are all very good.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Oh.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Oh.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Oh.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
We're squeezing it out.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
We're squeezing it out.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
We're squeezing it out.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
We're squeezing it out.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Oh.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Did you get it?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Sorry.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Go ahead of me.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Is there a star wipe?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Is all I'm just curious.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Look.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
There.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
No.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
No.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
No.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
No.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
No.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
No.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
No.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
No.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
No.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
No.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
No.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
No.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
No.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
No.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
No.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
No.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
No.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
No.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
No.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
No.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
No.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
No.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
No.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
No.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
All right.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
It wouldn't be a headgun podcast episode without a little bit of wax.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Right.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Two hundred episodes.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
I think they said it could be done and would again.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
There will probably be a four hundred episode.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
But, Mereka, do you want to talk about the.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
The origins of the show.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
I mean, this kind of was a.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
It was a pandemic podcast.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Yeah.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
A fashion project.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
It was a pandemic podcast.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
I wanted a staff podcast for a long time.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
It's originally called headgun happy hour now.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Yeah, it was.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yes.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
I remember doing a couple episodes in my closet with a margarita.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
The saddest I've ever been.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
I'm wondering how is ever going to leave my house again.

11:06.000 --> 11:14.000
And then being drunk on a zoom in a hot closet trying to report oddying with my bosses.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
That was really a year ago.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
I had a story, and in a room that would have given you the virus four years ago.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Absolutely.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
This is also technically a corporate podcast.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Oh, X and trouble.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
X and trouble.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Sorry.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
I think kicked out.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Yeah.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Really good.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
I don't have that towards.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
It's hard.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
It's been sold to the past.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I had a segment prepared just for that.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
You know what, let's, we'll wax throughout the episode.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.480
Let's get to our first segments ladies and gentlemen.

11:50.480 --> 11:54.960
This one is kind of a fan favorite for Zack Dunn.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.160
A fan favorite guest.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.000
It's what, like, a six-fiever?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.760
What do you mean?

12:00.760 --> 12:04.400
I mean that every time you're on, I ask you if you could give me

12:04.400 --> 12:05.400
some writing advice.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.400
Yeah.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.400
Right.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.400
Exactly.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.400
Right.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.520
And we should sit, you're on location for a writing job right now.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.520
This is proof that you're a whole different type of person.

12:13.520 --> 12:14.520
Sorry.

12:14.520 --> 12:15.520
Just let me in.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.520
You get a trailer for that.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.520
You do when you're a colleague.

12:20.520 --> 12:25.520
I Jeffrey loves trying to talk about my specific titles on things I work on.

12:25.520 --> 12:27.520
It makes me very uncomfortable.

12:27.520 --> 12:31.520
What goes you, not splitting that, going to a J-A rate with Jack,

12:31.520 --> 12:32.520
Jake Bender anymore, right?

12:32.520 --> 12:34.520
You're getting the deal seven down.

12:34.520 --> 12:38.520
I was just, first, I just got kicked out of the trailers.

12:38.520 --> 12:43.520
I don't, I'm not, this is a really bi-trailer.

12:43.520 --> 12:49.520
I'm going to be at this writing segment goes well.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.520
Yeah.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.520
You know, I could talk to someone on the set of this show.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.520
I'd be amazing about it.

12:53.520 --> 12:56.520
Because Zack, you and I did improv and college together.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.520
Almost eight years ago.

12:58.520 --> 13:03.520
And, you know, I have aspirations to, you know, write little jokes on a computer

13:03.520 --> 13:06.520
and maybe get, what is it?

13:07.520 --> 13:10.520
The official WGA minimum in the schedule is what?

13:10.520 --> 13:12.520
7200 a week.

13:12.520 --> 13:15.520
I don't think you know what those words.

13:15.520 --> 13:21.520
There's a strike since we've last podcast that you know,

13:21.520 --> 13:24.520
you might want to refresh on some of those things.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.520
But that's, we're not here to talk about stuff like that.

13:26.520 --> 13:29.520
We're here to see if you could give me notes on my writing.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.520
Yeah.

13:30.520 --> 13:31.520
Exactly.

13:31.520 --> 13:35.520
And I've written two scenes.

13:35.520 --> 13:40.520
And I was wondering if maybe we could do, we could do a live reading of these

13:40.520 --> 13:42.520
and then Zack could give me notes.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.520
Katie, I feel like you're not going to talk for the entire hour.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.520
So do you want to play a part?

13:45.520 --> 13:46.520
Absolutely.

13:46.520 --> 13:47.520
Yeah.

13:47.520 --> 13:53.520
It was an honor to be considered as ultimately a past for me.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.520
Riley, you're an actor.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.520
Would you like to read one of these scenes?

13:58.520 --> 14:00.520
I am a sag actor.

14:00.520 --> 14:04.520
So I don't know if this is union or if I'm getting paid.

14:05.520 --> 14:07.520
You're not.

14:07.520 --> 14:08.520
So is that a yes?

14:08.520 --> 14:09.520
I'll do it.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.520
But don't tell my reps.

14:11.520 --> 14:12.520
No.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.520
I am calling.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.520
I am calling the union right now.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.520
You're going to bust this podcast.

14:18.520 --> 14:22.520
Nothing more than to read whatever the fuck you wrote.

14:22.520 --> 14:26.520
Johnny, would you like to read opposite Riley?

14:26.520 --> 14:27.520
Okay.

14:27.520 --> 14:28.520
Yeah.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.520
Get my phone because I feel like you're going to send it to me there.

14:30.520 --> 14:33.520
I just texted it to Riley and Johnny.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.520
You can read scene direction to be great.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.520
Yeah, you got it.

14:36.520 --> 14:37.520
All right.

14:37.520 --> 14:38.520
This is scene one.

14:38.520 --> 14:39.520
Sorry.

14:39.520 --> 14:40.520
Sorry.

14:40.520 --> 14:41.520
I just got a text from the Democrats.

14:41.520 --> 14:42.520
I just need to like.

14:42.520 --> 14:43.520
Don't hate real fast.

14:43.520 --> 14:44.520
Don't hate it.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.520
Who's right?

14:46.520 --> 14:47.520
Wait.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.520
Let's have Johnny be customs officer and Riley you be passenger.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.520
Okay.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.520
And whenever you guys are ready.

14:53.520 --> 14:54.520
Okay.

14:54.520 --> 14:55.520
Actors.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.520
You guys ready?

14:56.520 --> 14:57.520
Yeah.

14:57.520 --> 14:58.520
Actors ready.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.520
All right.

14:59.520 --> 15:00.520
Let's do it.

15:00.520 --> 15:01.520
Okay.

15:02.520 --> 15:03.520
Action.

15:03.520 --> 15:09.520
Interior airport day passenger return to the US approaches a customs officer.

15:09.520 --> 15:13.520
The passenger sluggishly hands their passport to the officer.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.520
How is it true?

15:14.520 --> 15:16.520
It's terrible.

15:16.520 --> 15:18.520
I'm sorry to hear that.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.520
Do you have anything to declare?

15:20.520 --> 15:25.520
Only that I had a terrible trip.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.520
I don't was wise though.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.520
Didn't buy anything overseas.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.520
Sorry.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.520
Even if I did buy stuff.

15:33.520 --> 15:38.520
It would probably be just as terrible as this trip was for me.

15:38.520 --> 15:39.520
Hey.

15:39.520 --> 15:40.520
Don't say that.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.520
I look.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.520
We do need to keep the line moving.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.520
So.

15:44.520 --> 15:45.520
Right.

15:45.520 --> 15:46.520
Yes.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.520
I didn't mean to ruin your date too.

15:48.520 --> 15:51.520
Just put down bad vibes and durian.

15:51.520 --> 15:58.520
I'm afraid you can't bring fruit or vegetables in from other countries.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.520
This sucks.

16:00.520 --> 16:04.520
I literally didn't think this trip could get any worse.

16:04.520 --> 16:08.520
The passenger takes a durian out of their bag and throws it away.

16:08.520 --> 16:11.520
Sorry about that.

16:11.520 --> 16:12.520
But yeah.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.520
It's on the prohibited items list.

16:14.520 --> 16:18.520
The customs officer points at a poster with a list of items.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.520
Anyway.

16:19.520 --> 16:24.520
I can't bring my Haitian animal hide comes either.

16:24.520 --> 16:25.520
No.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.520
No you can't.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.520
This sucks.

16:29.520 --> 16:33.520
How did you know about Haitian animal hide drums?

16:33.520 --> 16:36.520
But not know that you can't import them to the US.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.520
Great.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.520
This is just great.

16:40.520 --> 16:44.520
Next you're going to tell me that I can't bring this big ass gun either.

16:44.520 --> 16:45.520
I swear.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.520
I'm having the weirdest year.

16:47.520 --> 16:48.520
All right.

16:48.520 --> 16:49.520
You're being detained.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.520
This sucks.

16:52.520 --> 16:53.520
Okay.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.520
That's the end.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.520
Wow.

16:56.520 --> 16:59.520
I mean wow.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.520
Yeah.

17:00.520 --> 17:04.520
I feel like my already really interesting.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.520
It was really cool.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.520
It was tight.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.520
I mean case year.

17:08.520 --> 17:09.520
It was director.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.520
What do you think?

17:11.520 --> 17:13.520
It's in the sack segment.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.520
I'd like to hear it.

17:14.520 --> 17:17.520
Sorry.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.520
Sorry.

17:18.520 --> 17:19.520
Yeah.

17:19.520 --> 17:20.520
Yeah.

17:21.520 --> 17:22.520
Okay.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.520
Some pacing issues.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.520
You know, we could get that on the second take.

17:28.520 --> 17:29.520
Yeah.

17:29.520 --> 17:30.520
I think that chalked up to Zoom delay.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.520
Exactly.

17:32.520 --> 17:33.520
Yeah.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.520
No.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.520
I thought it was interesting.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.520
It was very similar to some of your past writing sample.

17:38.520 --> 17:39.520
You've shown.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.520
There was a.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.520
Which is hot.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.520
You don't have a voice.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.520
You know.

17:44.520 --> 17:45.520
That's good.

17:45.520 --> 17:46.520
Right.

17:46.520 --> 17:47.520
You know exactly right.

17:47.520 --> 17:48.520
Erica.

17:48.520 --> 17:49.520
Yeah.

17:50.520 --> 17:51.520
You.

17:51.520 --> 17:52.520
You're wasn't.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.520
I wanted to ask something to the title or not.

17:54.520 --> 17:57.520
Because we're really correctly said.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.520
I want to know this too.

17:59.520 --> 18:00.520
Well, she.

18:00.520 --> 18:01.520
Correct.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.520
Yeah.

18:02.520 --> 18:03.520
The passion.

18:03.520 --> 18:04.520
The line.

18:04.520 --> 18:05.520
The past.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.520
This.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.520
So I want to know.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.520
Was that a writerly choice because right.

18:10.520 --> 18:11.520
Sometimes you don't.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.520
Right.

18:12.520 --> 18:13.520
How people actually talk.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.520
You know.

18:14.520 --> 18:15.520
Like it.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.520
Not always word perfect grammar.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.520
So I want to know what you were thinking.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.520
And you know, Zach, you and I went to the same school.

18:20.520 --> 18:21.520
And you know, they were teaching.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.520
I don't know if you ever did this exercise.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.520
But they had us go to a public place and listen to other people talk.

18:26.520 --> 18:27.520
Right.

18:27.520 --> 18:28.520
Because dialogue.

18:28.520 --> 18:29.520
Yeah.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.520
I wasn't even close to.

18:31.520 --> 18:32.520
Christ.

18:32.520 --> 18:33.520
Zach or other.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.520
I.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.520
I.

18:35.520 --> 18:36.520
I.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.520
No.

18:38.520 --> 18:39.520
Yeah.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.520
Where you go into public.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.520
And you listen to people's conversation.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.520
Because people are constantly overlapping their dialogue.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.520
And interrupting each other.

18:44.520 --> 18:47.520
And there's, you know, there's a lot of imperfections in the way people speak.

18:47.520 --> 18:48.520
It's all picture perfect.

18:48.520 --> 18:49.520
You know, it's all the silver screen.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.520
It's all the great white way.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.520
And I think the next.

18:52.520 --> 18:53.520
So was it a typo or not?

18:53.520 --> 18:54.520
I think it was.

18:54.520 --> 18:55.520
It was.

18:55.520 --> 18:56.520
Quickly.

18:56.520 --> 18:57.520
My only review.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.520
I'll say on this.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.520
Of this scene is that I do think it suck.

19:00.520 --> 19:01.520
So.

19:01.520 --> 19:02.520
It's like.

19:02.520 --> 19:03.520
All right.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.520
Let's maybe move out of the next scene.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.520
I thought Johnny did great.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.520
Can I?

19:07.520 --> 19:08.520
Performances were amazing.

19:08.520 --> 19:09.520
Okay.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.520
Yeah.

19:10.520 --> 19:11.520
Not quite word perfect.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.520
No, Riley.

19:12.520 --> 19:13.520
It's hard.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.520
It's like there's only two people in scene.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.520
You're like, oh, well, this one person did great.

19:15.520 --> 19:19.520
So even if you're not directly saying like Riley was asked, it's like, in leaving, in

19:19.520 --> 19:22.520
omitting that, it's like, silence speaks volumes in a lot of ways.

19:22.520 --> 19:23.520
And like, I've always said that.

19:23.520 --> 19:24.520
And so that's fair.

19:24.520 --> 19:25.520
That's fair.

19:25.520 --> 19:26.520
Have always said that.

19:26.520 --> 19:27.520
MR.

19:27.520 --> 19:28.520
Are we boring you?

19:28.520 --> 19:29.520
What?

19:29.520 --> 19:30.520
I'm just a few.

19:30.520 --> 19:31.520
So it's all.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.520
This is like a word.

19:32.520 --> 19:33.520
We added a third person.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.520
Which is like a little bit show miles bouncing your way.

19:36.520 --> 19:37.520
We added.

19:37.520 --> 19:38.520
Let's go.

19:38.520 --> 19:39.520
Have we plugged the backsters yet?

19:39.520 --> 19:40.520
We have the year.

19:40.520 --> 19:41.520
There will be bugs.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.520
That will start off with a quote of yours.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.520
Yep.

19:45.520 --> 19:47.520
Just let's get it started here.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.520
It's like favorite miles segment.

19:49.520 --> 19:52.520
And this is something that you said in the interview.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.520
This is a little bit scary.

19:54.520 --> 19:55.520
Sorry.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.520
Yeah.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.520
You said let's get it started.

19:58.520 --> 19:59.520
Let's get it started.

19:59.520 --> 20:00.520
Let's get it started.

20:00.520 --> 20:01.520
And not the other one.

20:01.520 --> 20:02.520
We've had this conversation.

20:02.520 --> 20:03.520
Sorry.

20:03.520 --> 20:04.520
Just going to interview.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.520
Just go to the library.

20:06.520 --> 20:07.520
I would now.

20:07.520 --> 20:10.520
So when you asked, what is life giving to you?

20:10.520 --> 20:13.520
You said the music of steely day.

20:13.520 --> 20:16.520
And drinking could wine.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.520
Was it like proving to you?

20:18.520 --> 20:20.520
It sounds like you're in your field.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.520
Yeah.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.520
That looked deep in them.

20:23.520 --> 20:27.520
So let's go on to the second scene.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.520
Miles.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.520
How many segments?

20:29.520 --> 20:30.520
We have four.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.520
This is one.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.520
This is segment one.

20:33.520 --> 20:34.520
Seen one.

20:34.520 --> 20:35.520
Segment one.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.520
Segment one of four.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.520
Okay.

20:38.520 --> 20:39.520
Here we go.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.520
On this one.

20:41.520 --> 20:42.520
Let's have Miles.

20:42.520 --> 20:44.520
You're kind of, you're also a performer.

20:44.520 --> 20:45.520
And let's see.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.520
Yeah.

20:46.520 --> 20:47.520
Actually.

20:47.520 --> 20:48.520
Yeah.

20:48.520 --> 20:49.520
Let's have you read Jeffrey in this scene.

20:49.520 --> 20:50.520
Okay.

20:50.520 --> 20:52.520
Can we get?

20:52.520 --> 20:53.520
It's going to be a sense.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.520
I was woman one.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.520
I don't have my phone on me.

20:56.520 --> 20:57.520
Sorry.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.520
And we're in my game.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.520
I haven't received sides.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.520
Okay.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.520
You know what?

21:01.520 --> 21:02.520
And I'll text these to you.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.520
Okay.

21:03.520 --> 21:04.520
Let me, let me cast this.

21:04.520 --> 21:05.520
Actually, you know what?

21:05.520 --> 21:06.520
Casey.

21:06.520 --> 21:07.520
Let's have you cast this because you're a director as we said.

21:07.520 --> 21:08.520
There's woman one.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.520
Woman two and Jeffrey.

21:10.520 --> 21:11.520
Okay.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.520
It's going to be deeply massages.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.520
It's going to be offensive.

21:16.520 --> 21:17.520
Yeah.

21:17.520 --> 21:18.520
Jeffrey.

21:18.520 --> 21:20.520
Let's have a replay Jeffrey.

21:20.520 --> 21:21.520
Okay.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.520
Never mind.

21:22.520 --> 21:23.520
I just sent it to Miles.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.520
Okay.

21:24.520 --> 21:25.520
Sorry.

21:25.520 --> 21:26.520
So yeah.

21:26.520 --> 21:27.520
And I'll just read over it.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.520

21:29.520 --> 21:30.520
Okay.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.520
Woman one.

21:31.520 --> 21:32.520
Let's go.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.520
Preferably somebody's phone number.

21:33.520 --> 21:35.520
I have second sentence them fast.

21:35.520 --> 21:36.520
Okay.

21:36.520 --> 21:37.520
Who has Jeff's phone number?

21:37.520 --> 21:38.520
I did receive the script.

21:38.520 --> 21:40.520
I don't even have a phone with me.

21:40.520 --> 21:41.520
Okay.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.520
Let's have Miles be woman one.

21:43.520 --> 21:44.520
And let's just.

21:44.520 --> 21:45.520
I got it.

21:45.520 --> 21:46.520
I have it.

21:46.520 --> 21:47.520
It's okay.

21:47.520 --> 21:48.520
I have the phone too.

21:48.520 --> 21:49.520
Okay.

21:49.520 --> 21:50.520
Howly you'll be woman two.

21:50.520 --> 21:51.520
All right.

21:51.520 --> 21:52.520
Great.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.520
Finally.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.520
I really can't.

21:54.520 --> 21:55.520

21:55.520 --> 21:56.520
All right.

21:56.520 --> 21:57.520

22:02.520 --> 22:03.520
And then Zach you're on scene direction.

22:03.520 --> 22:04.520
Yeah.

22:04.520 --> 22:05.520
Everybody have the script.

22:05.520 --> 22:06.520

22:06.520 --> 22:07.520
I'm going to ask you just a couple.

22:07.520 --> 22:10.520
Am I Italian in this or?

22:10.520 --> 22:11.520
Um.

22:11.520 --> 22:12.520
Played straight.

22:12.520 --> 22:13.520
Played straight.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.520
The comedy's supposed to come from kind of like the realism.

22:15.520 --> 22:16.520
A realism.

22:16.520 --> 22:17.520
Okay.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.520
So there's not a real Italian.

22:18.520 --> 22:20.520
So I'm like.

22:42.520 --> 22:43.520

Okay.

22:47.520 --> 22:48.520
See you soon.

22:48.520 --> 22:49.520

22:49.520 --> 22:50.520
Here we go.

22:50.520 --> 22:51.520

22:52.520 --> 22:54.520

22:54.520 --> 22:55.520
Sipping coffee.

22:55.520 --> 22:56.520
What?

22:56.520 --> 22:59.520
I think this guy next to us is listening to our conversation.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.520
What makes you say that?

23:01.520 --> 23:03.520
Well, for one, he's been making direct eye contact.

23:03.520 --> 23:04.520
Each time one of us speaks.

23:04.520 --> 23:07.520
Maybe he has a lazy eye.

23:07.520 --> 23:12.520
Just sort of able us.

23:12.520 --> 23:15.520
He's also been taking vigorous notes this whole time.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.520
He could be studying for an exam.

23:18.520 --> 23:22.520
When you got up to the bathroom, he had a panic attack, seemingly not knowing whether

23:22.520 --> 23:23.520
to stay put.

23:23.520 --> 23:26.520
Or the follow you to the least human transcribe your shit.

23:26.520 --> 23:27.520
I know.

23:27.520 --> 23:28.520
Sorry.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.520
Easy does it.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.520
I only peed.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.520
Easy does it is the expectation.

23:33.520 --> 23:34.520
Yeah.

23:34.520 --> 23:36.520
That's the direction.

23:36.520 --> 23:39.520
My point is he's making me uncomfortable.

23:39.520 --> 23:40.520
Would you lighten up?

23:40.520 --> 23:41.520
Oh, my God.

23:41.520 --> 23:42.520
But he would or not.

23:42.520 --> 23:46.520
Everyone in the world is interested in what do you have to say.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.520
A man chimes in.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.520
Sorry to chime in here.

23:50.520 --> 23:55.520
But the correct version just actually not everyone in the world is interested in what

23:55.520 --> 23:56.520
you have to say.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.520
Oh, I got my face.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.520
Thanks so much.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.520
Hang on.

24:00.520 --> 24:01.520
Your face.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.520
He just proved my point.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.520
Well, I've got your attention.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.520
Can I have both of your numbers?

24:07.520 --> 24:09.520
Of course not.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.520
Just the one is fine, man.

24:12.520 --> 24:16.520
Women too writes down her number and hands at the Jeffrey.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.520
Two and two, huh?

24:18.520 --> 24:20.520
Let me guess.

24:20.520 --> 24:23.520
Most famous area code in the country.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.520
Dublin.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.520
Idiot.

24:28.520 --> 24:29.520
End of scene.

24:29.520 --> 24:30.520
Sorry.

24:30.520 --> 24:31.520
Can we take that last beat again?

24:31.520 --> 24:33.520
I feel like it wasn't clear what just happened.

24:33.520 --> 24:34.520
Just read it.

24:34.520 --> 24:35.520
You know, with some pace.

24:35.520 --> 24:36.520
All right.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.520
And whenever you guys are ready from the woman,

24:38.520 --> 24:39.520
jot's down her number.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.520
From the top of scene one.

24:41.520 --> 24:44.520
This is still the first segment.

24:44.520 --> 24:46.520
So women when I said her number and his is Jeffrey.

24:46.520 --> 24:47.520
Two and two, huh?

24:47.520 --> 24:49.520
Let me guess.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.520
Most famous area code in the country.

24:51.520 --> 24:52.520
Dublin.

24:52.520 --> 24:53.520
Idiot.

24:53.520 --> 24:58.520
So, she didn't work any better than the second half.

24:58.520 --> 25:01.520
Did you have her?

25:01.520 --> 25:02.520
What?

25:02.520 --> 25:03.520
That was a whole big one.

25:03.520 --> 25:05.520
He said it didn't feel better.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.520
It didn't.

25:06.520 --> 25:07.520
Didn't.

25:07.520 --> 25:08.520
I don't look at it.

25:08.520 --> 25:09.520
You'll see.

25:09.520 --> 25:10.520
No, sir.

25:10.520 --> 25:12.520
Judges, is this something you actually

25:12.520 --> 25:14.520
good to woman named the woman?

25:14.520 --> 25:17.520
This was during my school assignment,

25:17.520 --> 25:19.520
where I had to go in public in this interview.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.520
We met.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.520
So did you purposely set that up in the previous part of your talking?

25:22.520 --> 25:23.520
Was that when you were talking?

25:23.520 --> 25:24.520
Was that when you were playing?

25:24.520 --> 25:25.520
I got lucky.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.520
I got lucky.

25:26.520 --> 25:27.520
I got lucky.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.520
That was the worst part of the conversation.

25:29.520 --> 25:30.520
No.

25:30.520 --> 25:32.520
Definitely not.

25:32.520 --> 25:33.520
Definitely not.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.520
What is the parenthetical easy does it?

25:35.520 --> 25:36.520
What is that?

25:36.520 --> 25:37.520
Yeah.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.520
And I don't want to give a line read.

25:39.520 --> 25:45.520
But just because the writer is kind of the master of the domain of

25:45.520 --> 25:46.520
television.

25:46.520 --> 25:49.520
Whereas in film, it's obviously Casey and Billy.

25:49.520 --> 25:50.520
And you see, this is a TV show.

25:50.520 --> 25:51.520
This scene we read.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.520
I see this is a cold open.

25:53.520 --> 25:54.520
What?

25:54.520 --> 25:56.520
I had a question about one of the lines.

25:56.520 --> 25:57.520
And we do have to move on.

25:57.520 --> 25:58.520
Okay.

25:58.520 --> 25:59.520
Yeah.

25:59.520 --> 26:02.520
I actually have a question about your inspiration, Jeffrey,

26:02.520 --> 26:05.520
because yeah, I understand that you take a lot of inspiration from music.

26:05.520 --> 26:06.520
New York, exactly.

26:06.520 --> 26:11.520
When I write, I usually hop back and forth between my laptop and my guitar.

26:11.520 --> 26:15.520
That's my favorite.

26:15.520 --> 26:17.520
That's your problem.

26:17.520 --> 26:20.520
That's your problem.

26:20.520 --> 26:21.520
That's your problem.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.520
I'm just more on comedy writing.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.520
Just that general concept.

26:25.520 --> 26:28.520
He's still writing, but it's like cumbersome.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.520
I thought on speed dial.

26:30.520 --> 26:31.520
It's so lucky.

26:31.520 --> 26:32.520
Awesome.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.520
Oh.

26:34.520 --> 26:37.520
200 episodes, right?

26:37.520 --> 26:39.520
How have we done?

26:41.520 --> 26:43.520
We've never looked again.

26:44.520 --> 26:45.520
Just talk.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.520
Just needs to go outside.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.520
Just open the back door.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.520
It's been a long journey.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.520
There's been a lot of mistakes made.

26:53.520 --> 26:56.520
There's been a lot of pleasure given.

26:56.520 --> 26:57.520
Yeah.

26:57.520 --> 27:00.520
Just like on the post-Nutral episode episode.

27:00.520 --> 27:04.520
I believe it was 178, where we graded a mirror's wedding.

27:04.520 --> 27:08.520
I want to grade the first 200 episodes of the show.

27:08.520 --> 27:09.520
That's right.

27:09.520 --> 27:12.520
On this custom rubric, Jake, would you do the honors of reading this?

27:12.520 --> 27:15.520
Pretty engrossed in this game.

27:15.520 --> 27:18.520
All right.

27:18.520 --> 27:21.520
It's nine two West Ham at this point.

27:21.520 --> 27:22.520
It's one one.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.520
West Ham's really grown into it.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.520
Oh, you didn't mention that goal.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.520
Did you?

27:28.520 --> 27:30.520
You were here with us from the beginning.

27:30.520 --> 27:32.520
Would you like to do the honors?

27:32.520 --> 27:33.520
Sure.

27:33.520 --> 27:35.520
I'm going to text this rubric to you.

27:35.520 --> 27:39.520
This is going to be out of a possible 21 points.

27:39.520 --> 27:41.520
And we're going to give it a letter grade.

27:42.520 --> 27:45.520
Just read every column by row.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.520
And I don't mean salmon.

27:47.520 --> 27:49.520
Oh, commercial.

27:58.520 --> 27:59.520
And we're back.

27:59.520 --> 28:00.520
All right.

28:00.520 --> 28:01.520
Ferris.

28:01.520 --> 28:02.520
Let's just steal.

28:02.520 --> 28:04.520
That's industrial steel hitting.

28:04.520 --> 28:05.520
Yeah.

28:05.520 --> 28:07.520
All right.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.520
Ferris, whenever you're ready and guys, everybody chime in here.

28:10.520 --> 28:11.520
Everybody's opinions.

28:11.520 --> 28:18.520
And we'll put together an amalgam of what score will land for each category.

28:18.520 --> 28:20.520
Ferris, whenever you're ready.

28:20.520 --> 28:21.520
All right.

28:21.520 --> 28:22.520
Yeah.

28:22.520 --> 28:23.520
Looks like we've got seven categories.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.520
And we can there are three scores.

28:25.520 --> 28:26.520
You can give each one.

28:26.520 --> 28:31.520
So category one readiness of host.

28:31.520 --> 28:33.520
A Bob standard.

28:33.520 --> 28:34.520
This is for three points.

28:34.520 --> 28:36.520
I think we could just skip this one.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.520
And it's, you know, the lowest possible.

28:38.520 --> 28:40.520
And we need one.

28:40.520 --> 28:43.520
This whole rubric took me three hours yesterday.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.520
Sorry to hear that.

28:45.520 --> 28:46.520
Yeah.

28:46.520 --> 28:47.520
That's too long.

28:47.520 --> 28:49.520
You might need to work on your time in it.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.520
And that's why you were late.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.520
Well, I was hopping back and forth by the guitar.

28:52.520 --> 28:54.520
Very loud.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.520
Very loud was a song.

28:56.520 --> 29:02.520
Well, if this, if your score was to be a Bob standard, which I think it's unanimously not.

29:02.520 --> 29:04.520
But here's the description.

29:04.520 --> 29:07.520
This demonstrated a consistent and profound work ethic.

29:07.520 --> 29:13.520
He worked tirelessly and without error to create an area of playfulness that put all that ease

29:13.520 --> 29:19.520
Engagingness of content, positivity of mind and frequency of joy.

29:19.520 --> 29:22.520
Came to be expected by guests and audience alike.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.520
Freely wild to know this.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.520
I don't think engagingness is a word.

29:26.520 --> 29:31.520
There's nothing in there that's the best part.

29:32.520 --> 29:37.520
If this was, if this meets the standard, this is the middle grade.

29:37.520 --> 29:40.520
The description is host was present for records.

29:40.520 --> 29:41.520
Yes.

29:41.520 --> 29:43.520
Records.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.520
Sorry, I haven't read in a while.

29:46.520 --> 29:49.520
It should be recording.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.520
Yeah.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.520
I just watched a lot of YouTube nowadays.

29:52.520 --> 29:53.520
All right.

29:53.520 --> 29:57.520
You're not used to folding your phone horizontally, I think.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.520
Yeah, exactly.

29:58.520 --> 29:59.520
Yeah.

29:59.520 --> 30:00.520
You got to watch widescreen.

30:00.520 --> 30:01.520
Okay.

30:01.520 --> 30:07.520
So below standard, host shamelessly flew by the seat of his pants for four-year straight,

30:07.520 --> 30:13.520
tens of thousands of hours of listeners' time were wasted and cold blood slashed with a smile.

30:13.520 --> 30:19.520
The majority of the show consisted of flimsyly-premised segments such as thin-cankle energy

30:19.520 --> 30:23.520
or nah and the price of rice.

30:24.520 --> 30:30.520
Some episodes lovingly referred to by the host as wax episodes were bereft of preparation

30:30.520 --> 30:36.520
entirely, amounting to dead-air written periods of life's conversation.

30:36.520 --> 30:41.520
While it's presumed that the show will continue past episode 200, history will ultimately

30:41.520 --> 30:45.520
remember the host for what he is a fraud.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.520
What's the fuck?

30:47.520 --> 30:49.520
You're a pro.

30:49.520 --> 30:52.520
I know I wrote it, but everybody's nodding and agreement with below standards.

30:52.520 --> 30:56.520
I was going to say two, but if people all veto me, I think it might be over.

30:56.520 --> 30:59.520
Raise your hand if you think it's three.

30:59.520 --> 31:02.520
We're reigning all two hundred collectibles.

31:02.520 --> 31:04.520
Yeah, just the show so far.

31:04.520 --> 31:05.520
All right.

31:05.520 --> 31:06.520
I'm the only one who fucking said three.

31:06.520 --> 31:07.520
Two.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.520
Raise your hand if you think it's two.

31:08.520 --> 31:10.520
That's so just a mirror.

31:10.520 --> 31:11.520
Sorry, man.

31:11.520 --> 31:13.520
And one below standard.

31:13.520 --> 31:14.520
Kidding me.

31:14.520 --> 31:15.520
All right.

31:15.520 --> 31:16.520
Fine.

31:16.520 --> 31:17.520
All right.

31:17.520 --> 31:18.520
Various next category.

31:18.520 --> 31:19.520
All right.

31:19.520 --> 31:21.520
Next category is appearance of host.

31:21.520 --> 31:23.520
There's so much text.

31:23.520 --> 31:26.520
That's just the other word.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.520
Seven categories.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.520
Oh, my God.

31:29.520 --> 31:30.520
Jesus.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.520
We can pick up the pace a little bit.

31:32.520 --> 31:33.520
All right.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.520
We're ready.

31:34.520 --> 31:35.520
All right.

31:35.520 --> 31:38.520
Pop score for appearance of host would be host came to the show.

31:38.520 --> 31:41.520
Dress to the nine slash serving.

31:41.520 --> 31:42.520
Oh, my God.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.520
On you.

31:45.520 --> 31:47.520
Do you want to take that one?

31:47.520 --> 31:50.520
I'm not going to say it.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.520
I was going to get somebody who I feel like can say it.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.520
You want me to say it?

31:54.520 --> 31:55.520
You want me to say it?

31:55.520 --> 31:56.520
If you were to say it.

31:56.520 --> 31:57.520
Give me the time.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.520
I'm going to say it.

31:59.520 --> 32:00.520
Thank you.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.520
Various heads turned on swivels as he approached the studio.

32:03.520 --> 32:06.520
Often causing multi vehicle pilots.

32:06.520 --> 32:12.520
Once inside, he was faced with the impossible task of deflecting HR violation after HR

32:12.520 --> 32:15.520
violation from his lustre boss, Marty Michael.

32:15.520 --> 32:18.520
All right.

32:18.520 --> 32:19.520
So that's the top score.

32:19.520 --> 32:30.520
Middle score is host war average attire for records.

32:30.520 --> 32:35.520
And bottom score would be the degeneration of the host's ocular lipid glances representative

32:35.520 --> 32:37.520
of his appearance at large.

32:37.520 --> 32:45.520
Red eyed thin angled and rotted through the host embodied rumple.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.520
Can I say can I?

32:46.520 --> 32:47.520
All right.

32:47.520 --> 32:48.520
That's three.

32:48.520 --> 32:49.520
I don't know if they can hear me.

32:49.520 --> 32:50.520
Rumple?

32:50.520 --> 32:51.520
No.

32:51.520 --> 32:52.520
That's right.

32:52.520 --> 32:53.520
That's right.

32:53.520 --> 32:54.520
What's that?

32:54.520 --> 32:57.520
I came dressed to the nine slash serving hunt.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.520
Yeah.

32:58.520 --> 32:59.520
Yeah.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.520
There's three.

33:01.520 --> 33:02.520
Jeff.

33:02.520 --> 33:03.520
Yeah.

33:03.520 --> 33:07.520
We have a theory that last time you didn't turn on the video because you didn't think you

33:07.520 --> 33:08.520
looked good.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.520
I did look like shit that episode.

33:10.520 --> 33:11.520
Yeah.

33:11.520 --> 33:12.520
But it wasn't on purpose.

33:12.520 --> 33:13.520
No.

33:13.520 --> 33:14.520
I don't think you looked like shit on purpose.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.520
I think you didn't turn on the video because you looked like shit.

33:16.520 --> 33:17.520
Yeah.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.520
You think I tried to dress well and didn't.

33:19.520 --> 33:20.520
I didn't record.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.520
I think your default state might be just looking at it.

33:22.520 --> 33:24.520
Anyone think I dressed to the nine?

33:24.520 --> 33:25.520
I think so.

33:25.520 --> 33:28.520
But there's never been a pile up because of how you dress.

33:28.520 --> 33:29.520
All right.

33:29.520 --> 33:30.520
Fine.

33:30.520 --> 33:31.520
Who thinks that I just dressed fine?

33:31.520 --> 33:32.520
Yeah.

33:32.520 --> 33:33.520
Yeah.

33:33.520 --> 33:34.520
All right.

33:34.520 --> 33:35.520
Two out of five.

33:35.520 --> 33:40.520
But the bottom score including your your fucked up dry eyes.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.520
That's really.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.520
It was swaying me.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.520
I did say too.

33:43.520 --> 33:44.520
Yeah.

33:44.520 --> 33:45.520
But I will say.

33:45.520 --> 33:46.520
It's kind of a combo.

33:46.520 --> 33:47.520
It's a combo one and two.

33:47.520 --> 33:48.520
It's like one and a half.

33:48.520 --> 33:49.520
Can we do it one and a half?

33:49.520 --> 33:50.520
Yeah.

33:50.520 --> 33:51.520
Yeah.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.520
One and a half.

33:52.520 --> 33:53.520
I'll give one and a half.

33:53.520 --> 33:56.520
Sometimes it's sort of like an air one smoothie guy.

33:56.520 --> 33:57.520
Yeah.

33:57.520 --> 33:58.520
Yeah.

33:58.520 --> 33:59.520
I feel like.

33:59.520 --> 34:00.520
You know what?

34:00.520 --> 34:01.520
You're also going to try to carry Bradshaw.

34:01.520 --> 34:03.520
Set it in an episode of Sex in the City.

34:03.520 --> 34:05.520
Sometimes the girl just needs a half.

34:05.520 --> 34:06.520
Right.

34:06.520 --> 34:07.520
Right.

34:07.520 --> 34:08.520
Right.

34:08.520 --> 34:09.520
Right.

34:09.520 --> 34:10.520
Right.

34:10.520 --> 34:11.520
Right.

34:11.520 --> 34:12.520
Right.

34:12.520 --> 34:13.520
Right.

34:13.520 --> 34:14.520
Right.

34:14.520 --> 34:15.520
Right.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.520
Right.

34:16.520 --> 34:17.520
Right.

34:17.520 --> 34:18.520
Right.

34:18.520 --> 34:19.520
Farast category.

34:19.520 --> 34:20.520
Next category.

34:20.520 --> 34:21.520
Do we.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.520
You're going to do all the categories.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.520
Let's keep it.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.520
Let's keep it going faster.

34:25.520 --> 34:26.520
You know.

34:26.520 --> 34:27.520
Farast.

34:27.520 --> 34:30.520
Every second is just things you wrote.

34:30.520 --> 34:31.520
Yeah.

34:31.520 --> 34:32.520
People.

34:32.520 --> 34:33.520
I know.

34:33.520 --> 34:34.520
Some.

34:34.520 --> 34:35.520
You know.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.520
I feel like anxiety that causes the pace to kind of quick.

34:37.520 --> 34:38.520
And so on.

34:38.520 --> 34:39.520
Why don't you.

34:39.520 --> 34:40.520
Why don't you take this up.

34:40.520 --> 34:41.520
On your.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.520
Wait.

34:43.520 --> 34:44.520
I don't know.

34:44.520 --> 34:45.520
All right.

34:45.520 --> 34:46.520
I'm going to text it to you.

34:46.520 --> 34:47.520
And we'll pass it off.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.520
Because I don't want to keep burdening Ferris.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.520
I'm.

34:50.520 --> 34:51.520
This is.

34:51.520 --> 34:52.520
There's.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.520
There's.

34:54.520 --> 34:55.520
Okay.

34:55.520 --> 34:56.520
Then let's do Ferris.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.520
And just like let's double time.

34:58.520 --> 34:59.520
All right.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.520
Timeliness of host.

35:01.520 --> 35:02.520
This top score.

35:02.520 --> 35:03.520
You don't.

35:03.520 --> 35:06.520
The host is suggested a personal adoption of the motto.

35:06.520 --> 35:07.520
If you're on time, you're late.

35:07.520 --> 35:11.520
He displayed an obvious respect for his guest time and the studio calendar.

35:12.520 --> 35:13.520
Category.

35:13.520 --> 35:14.520
Score score.

35:14.520 --> 35:17.520
Middle score is the host was on time for records.

35:17.520 --> 35:18.520
Number.

35:18.520 --> 35:19.520
Number three.

35:19.520 --> 35:20.520
Number three.

35:20.520 --> 35:24.520
Bottom score is the host pushed the boundaries of what it means to be tardy.

35:24.520 --> 35:26.520
Well, sometimes 15 minutes late.

35:26.520 --> 35:27.520
Oh, yeah.

35:27.520 --> 35:31.520
Other times missing in person records all together without warning.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.520
Leaving his guests in the studio.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.520
Shocked and upset wondering if everything was okay.

35:35.520 --> 35:36.520
Week by week.

35:36.520 --> 35:40.520
He carved a perfect statue of complete disregard out of the marble of.

35:40.520 --> 35:41.520
For others time.

35:41.520 --> 35:42.520
Yeah.

35:42.520 --> 35:43.520
Yeah.

35:43.520 --> 35:44.520
You can add this one.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.520
Next down on the road.

35:45.520 --> 35:46.520
You didn't show up.

35:46.520 --> 35:47.520
Okay.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.520
So three out of nine so far.

35:48.520 --> 35:49.520
This is obviously not.

35:49.520 --> 35:50.520
Right.

35:50.520 --> 35:51.520
Right.

35:51.520 --> 35:52.520
Yeah.

35:52.520 --> 35:53.520
There.

35:53.520 --> 35:54.520
Did you show up in your car was just in the lot.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.520
That's.

35:55.520 --> 35:56.520
Yeah.

35:56.520 --> 35:57.520
How do you sound.

35:57.520 --> 35:58.520
Quality of sound.

35:58.520 --> 35:59.520
Yeah.

35:59.520 --> 36:00.520
Yeah.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.520
A quality of sound.

36:01.520 --> 36:02.520
Top score.

36:02.520 --> 36:04.520
Audio levels during records were mixed to a T.

36:04.520 --> 36:06.520
Ultimately earning the badge of high fidelity.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.520
Sound effects were used sparingly.

36:08.520 --> 36:09.520
Improving upon each episode's direction.

36:09.520 --> 36:11.520
Without interrupting it.

36:11.520 --> 36:12.520
All right.

36:12.520 --> 36:13.520
Middle score would be.

36:13.520 --> 36:16.520
Listeners could hear the show.

36:16.520 --> 36:20.520
Bottom score is despite supervising editors best efforts.

36:20.520 --> 36:23.520
Every single episode of the show contains clipping.

36:23.520 --> 36:26.520
Bizarre and grading sounds such as the limited two.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.520
Industrial steel hitting concrete floors.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.520
Hevegum CTO Andrew Pile.

36:31.520 --> 36:32.520
Shocking on a bagel.

36:32.520 --> 36:33.520
And again.

36:33.520 --> 36:35.520
You're song.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.520
You had a bad day.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.520
They had hazard leave throughout the show.

36:39.520 --> 36:44.520
Often interrupting the few rare instances of pleasant conversation.

36:44.520 --> 36:46.520
It can't be one because I feel like.

36:46.520 --> 36:48.520
Showing on a bagel is so specific.

36:48.520 --> 36:49.520
You have that.

36:49.520 --> 36:50.520
You have that.

36:50.520 --> 36:51.520
I don't.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.520
You constantly replay the.

36:53.520 --> 36:54.520
Also.

36:54.520 --> 36:56.520
All right.

36:56.520 --> 36:57.520
I mean.

36:57.520 --> 36:58.520
I'm crazy.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.520
I'm crazy.

36:59.520 --> 37:00.520
Better than I thought.

37:00.520 --> 37:02.520
Tell people to locally record.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.520
I believe one raise your hand.

37:04.520 --> 37:05.520
Why?

37:05.520 --> 37:06.520
We know.

37:06.520 --> 37:07.520
So we're at four out of twelve.

37:07.520 --> 37:08.520
Just keep it going.

37:08.520 --> 37:09.520
Ferris.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.520
Two more.

37:10.520 --> 37:11.520
Three more.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.520
Next category is joy had.

37:13.520 --> 37:14.520
All right.

37:14.520 --> 37:16.520
Top score is carnival.

37:16.520 --> 37:17.520
Marry grog.

37:17.520 --> 37:18.520
Diwali.

37:18.520 --> 37:21.520
All of these pale and comparison to the glee.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.520
The show has brought to all.

37:23.520 --> 37:27.520
Despite all of the LA studios being sort of a charcoal.

37:27.520 --> 37:28.520
And not something choice.

37:28.520 --> 37:31.520
Sir like a child green or a cola.

37:31.520 --> 37:34.520
The show has a beautiful sense of elation.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.520
That has brought people together.

37:36.520 --> 37:41.520
Not separated them like other shows see segments.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.520
Unbelievable.

37:43.520 --> 37:48.520
Middle score is the show has been chuckle funny.

37:48.520 --> 37:53.520
Bottom score is the host has consistently chosen violence over joy.

37:53.520 --> 37:58.520
Whether he's sending out people's biggest insecurities on camera or doxing where guests

37:58.520 --> 38:00.520
children go to school.

38:00.520 --> 38:02.520
The show is terrifying to be a part of.

38:02.520 --> 38:05.520
The show is a very special point.

38:05.520 --> 38:06.520
Forget laughter for now.

38:06.520 --> 38:09.520
A good starting point for this show would be getting to a place where people's physical

38:09.520 --> 38:11.520
safety isn't endangered.

38:11.520 --> 38:12.520
Definitely.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.520
I want to tell you what it's like.

38:14.520 --> 38:17.520
The job thing is going to be taking.

38:17.520 --> 38:18.520
Alright Johnny.

38:18.520 --> 38:19.520
Three.

38:19.520 --> 38:20.520
Three.

38:20.520 --> 38:21.520
Three.

38:21.520 --> 38:24.520
I've never celebrated to all.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.520
So.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.520
I definitely have more joy from the.

38:28.520 --> 38:29.520
Three for the second.

38:29.520 --> 38:30.520
Two or one.

38:30.520 --> 38:31.520
Two.

38:31.520 --> 38:32.360
Give it a two.

38:32.360 --> 38:33.200
All right.

38:33.200 --> 38:34.040
Yeah, somewhere in the middle.

38:34.040 --> 38:34.880
What is that?

38:34.880 --> 38:35.880
Six out of 15.

38:35.880 --> 38:36.880
Yeah.

38:36.880 --> 38:37.880
Moving on.

38:37.880 --> 38:38.880
Two more.

38:38.880 --> 38:39.880
Let's go round it out.

38:39.880 --> 38:41.880
You write in very passive voice for these by the way.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.560
So, two, three, four, four.

38:43.560 --> 38:46.200
That's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.200
Oh, there's.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.200
Next category is wisdom gotten.

38:48.200 --> 38:51.200
So, I am not sure what you had.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.200
We have a good time.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.480
Everything is so passive and passive.

38:54.480 --> 38:55.480
And then.

38:55.480 --> 38:56.480
That's awesome.

38:56.480 --> 38:57.480
What is awesome?

38:57.480 --> 38:59.360
Can you just put a movie on?

38:59.360 --> 39:00.360
Yeah.

39:00.360 --> 39:05.560
Top score for wisdom gotten is when speaking on important subjects, the host made a concerted effort

39:05.560 --> 39:09.360
to cite established experts and peer-reviewed studies.

39:09.360 --> 39:14.360
While truth was occasionally exaggerated for comedic effect, the vast majority of the show

39:14.360 --> 39:16.360
was educational in nature.

39:16.360 --> 39:20.360
The host's savvy went beyond the odd-yall plane.

39:20.360 --> 39:21.360
Oh, God.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.360
Fuck is that.

39:22.360 --> 39:27.320
Elevating the consciousness of the collect lotting up, so I think that's very impossible

39:27.320 --> 39:28.320
to get three points.

39:28.320 --> 39:29.320
Yeah.

39:29.320 --> 39:30.120
It's��, essentially.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.120
University.

39:31.120 --> 39:39.040
Middle score facts were said during the first 200 episodes that is indisputable and indisputable

39:39.040 --> 39:40.040
proof.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.040
.

39:41.040 --> 39:47.180
And the bottom wrong for wisdom gotten is the host spun a complex and indesir enjoyable

39:47.180 --> 39:52.320
web of life, and then Ms. Biden didn't vague pursuit to get wise.

39:52.320 --> 39:57.720
The host would often monologue nonsense at guests uninterrupted until he tired himself

39:57.720 --> 39:58.720
out.

39:58.720 --> 40:01.940
phrase word salad would be an understatement.

40:01.940 --> 40:04.440
Maybe word bombets better.

40:04.440 --> 40:05.440
Maybe Joe.

40:05.440 --> 40:06.680
Yeah, I think we're going to go one.

40:06.680 --> 40:07.680
Me.

40:07.680 --> 40:08.680
One again.

40:08.680 --> 40:09.680
Yeah.

40:09.680 --> 40:10.680
All right.

40:10.680 --> 40:13.680
What are you saying nonsense or writing nonsense for us to say?

40:13.680 --> 40:14.680
Yeah.

40:14.680 --> 40:15.680
That's all right.

40:15.680 --> 40:16.680
It's fine.

40:16.680 --> 40:17.680
It's all right.

40:17.680 --> 40:18.680
It's fine.

40:18.680 --> 40:19.680
It's fine.

40:19.680 --> 40:20.680
It's fine.

40:20.680 --> 40:21.680
It's fine.

40:21.680 --> 40:22.680
It's fine.

40:22.680 --> 40:23.680
It's fine.

40:23.680 --> 40:24.680
It's fine.

40:24.680 --> 40:25.680
It's fine.

40:25.680 --> 40:26.680
It's fine.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.680
It's probably a top.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.240
It's a top score, it's a top score.

40:30.240 --> 40:31.040
It is commonly known.

40:31.040 --> 40:32.200
If Oh, sorry.

40:32.200 --> 40:32.880
Yeah.

40:32.880 --> 40:33.880
Fear conquered.

40:33.880 --> 40:38.160
It is commonly known that fear is the opposite of love by this logic.

40:38.160 --> 40:42.700
If one wants to become more loving, one must first conquer their fear.

40:42.700 --> 40:48.720
This show has held tens of thousands of people and countless others to just that.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.720
tens of thousands and countless others.

40:50.720 --> 40:55.720
Just a little bit of a discussion between those two groups.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.720
Maybe leaving three for this one.

40:57.720 --> 40:58.720
No.

40:58.720 --> 40:59.720
Well, let's see.

40:59.720 --> 41:00.720
Middle score would be.

41:00.720 --> 41:03.720
Fear was neither conquered nor furthered.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.720
Bottom score would be.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.720
This show makes the world worse.

41:07.720 --> 41:10.720
It is without question.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.720
Arral terrorism.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.720
Oh, you got arral.

41:14.720 --> 41:15.720
No audio.

41:15.720 --> 41:16.720
I'm so proud of you.

41:16.720 --> 41:17.720
All right.

41:17.720 --> 41:18.720
Raise your hand if you think it's three.

41:20.720 --> 41:21.720
It's a stage.

41:24.720 --> 41:25.720
So it's an obvious one.

41:25.720 --> 41:26.720
Yeah.

41:26.720 --> 41:27.720
All right.

41:27.720 --> 41:28.720
So we all think the show is arral terrorism.

41:28.720 --> 41:29.720
No, I like I thought it was fine.

41:29.720 --> 41:30.720
I think too.

41:30.720 --> 41:31.720
Yeah.

41:31.720 --> 41:32.720
I think it's too hard.

41:32.720 --> 41:33.720
I think it's too hard.

41:33.720 --> 41:34.720
I think it's too hard.

41:34.720 --> 41:35.720
I think it's too hard.

41:35.720 --> 41:36.720
Ultimately.

41:36.720 --> 41:38.720
We ended with a score of nine out of twenty one,

41:38.720 --> 41:39.720
which is a complete fail.

41:39.720 --> 41:40.720
Nine point five.

41:40.720 --> 41:41.720
Which you could run by.

41:41.720 --> 41:43.720
We got a point five.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.720
Is that a score?

41:46.720 --> 41:47.720
Or are you just dancing?

41:47.720 --> 41:48.720
It's awesome.

41:48.720 --> 41:49.720
It's awesome.

41:49.720 --> 41:50.720
It's awesome.

41:50.720 --> 41:51.720
It's awesome.

41:51.720 --> 41:52.720
It's unbelievable.

41:52.720 --> 41:54.720
We've been ripping this down.

41:54.720 --> 41:55.720
Yeah.

41:55.720 --> 41:57.720
Maybe it's awesome too.

41:57.720 --> 41:58.720
Yeah.

41:58.720 --> 41:59.720
It's so much right.

41:59.720 --> 42:00.720
Yeah.

42:00.720 --> 42:01.720
You like it?

42:01.720 --> 42:02.720
It's incredible.

42:02.720 --> 42:03.720
It's incredible.

42:03.720 --> 42:04.720
It's incredible.

42:04.720 --> 42:05.720
It's incredible.

42:05.720 --> 42:06.720
It's incredible.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.720
You're going to get to head to him channel reps.

42:08.720 --> 42:09.720
I have to go.

42:09.720 --> 42:10.720
I have to go.

42:10.720 --> 42:11.720
I have to go.

42:11.720 --> 42:12.720
I have to go.

42:12.720 --> 42:13.720
I have to go.

42:13.720 --> 42:14.720
I have to go.

42:14.720 --> 42:15.720
I have to go.

42:15.720 --> 42:16.720
I have to go.

42:16.720 --> 42:18.720
I have to go.

42:18.720 --> 42:19.720
I have to go.

42:19.720 --> 42:20.720
I have to go.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.720
I have to go.

42:22.720 --> 42:23.720
I have to go.

42:23.720 --> 42:24.720
I have to go.

42:24.720 --> 42:25.720
I have to go.

42:25.720 --> 42:26.720
I have to go.

42:26.720 --> 42:27.720
What's that?

42:27.720 --> 42:28.720
Here.

42:28.720 --> 42:29.720
I can't hear anyone either.

42:29.720 --> 42:30.720
Guys.

42:30.720 --> 42:31.720
This is high stakes, Jeffordie.

42:31.720 --> 42:32.720
Oh.

42:32.720 --> 42:33.720
For the first time ever.

42:33.720 --> 42:35.720
Tournament of Champions.

42:35.720 --> 42:36.720
Oh, this show.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.720
We just got the people that won Jeffordie.

42:38.720 --> 42:39.720
No.

42:39.720 --> 42:41.720
It's even weirder than that.

42:41.720 --> 42:44.720
For some reason.

42:44.720 --> 42:49.720
The prize is a $500 Airbnb gift card.

42:49.720 --> 42:50.720
Jesus.

42:50.720 --> 42:51.720
I don't want to do this.

42:51.720 --> 42:52.720
Oh my God.

42:52.720 --> 42:53.720
You can't make it.

42:53.720 --> 42:54.720
Jesus.

42:54.720 --> 42:55.720
I am charged with this.

42:55.720 --> 42:56.720
Listen.

42:56.720 --> 42:59.720
It's been 200 episodes of me putting people in tough spots.

42:59.720 --> 43:02.720
And so one out of 21 people today.

43:02.720 --> 43:03.720
20.

43:03.720 --> 43:04.720
Because I'm not playing.

43:04.720 --> 43:07.720
We'll go home with an actual Airbnb gift card.

43:07.720 --> 43:09.720
And by the way, everyone's staring at me blankly.

43:09.720 --> 43:11.720
Not excited about the potential prize.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.720
I never know how to do it.

43:13.720 --> 43:15.720
You guys, it's real.

43:15.720 --> 43:17.720
I've gotten gift cards from there from him before.

43:17.720 --> 43:18.720
Really?

43:18.720 --> 43:19.720
Did you guys stay?

43:19.720 --> 43:20.720
Yeah, it was amazing.

43:20.720 --> 43:22.720
Someone asked him if he's planning to put this on.

43:22.720 --> 43:23.720
Are you putting this on the headgum card?

43:23.720 --> 43:24.720
Or is this going to be on the headgum card?

43:24.720 --> 43:25.720
Or is this going to be on the headgum card?

43:25.720 --> 43:26.720
Or is this going to be on the headgum card?

43:26.720 --> 43:27.720
Or is this going to be on the headgum card?

43:27.720 --> 43:28.720
Or is this going to be on the headgum card?

43:28.720 --> 43:29.720
All right.

43:29.720 --> 43:30.720
Here we go.

43:30.720 --> 43:31.720
Oh, fucker.

43:31.720 --> 43:33.720
This is Jeffordie.

43:33.720 --> 43:35.720
Okay.

43:36.720 --> 43:38.720
Let's start with Erika.

43:38.720 --> 43:39.720
What?

43:39.720 --> 43:40.720
Erika.

43:40.720 --> 43:41.720
Erika.

43:41.720 --> 43:43.720
Do you want to pick something first?

43:43.720 --> 43:44.720
Pick a category.

43:44.720 --> 43:45.720
Sure.

43:45.720 --> 43:46.720
Or Alex?

43:46.720 --> 43:47.720
Sure.

43:47.720 --> 43:51.720
I'll do the best headgum guests for 300.

43:51.720 --> 43:52.720
Wow.

43:52.720 --> 43:54.720
That's 10-gum podcasts.

43:54.720 --> 43:55.720
That's for 300.

43:55.720 --> 43:57.720
But we share everyone can guess.

43:57.720 --> 43:59.720
But you have to buzz like buzz.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.720
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.

44:01.720 --> 44:02.720
We'll count over.

44:02.720 --> 44:03.720
We'll count over.

44:03.720 --> 44:04.720
Buzz, buzz, buzz.

44:04.720 --> 44:05.720
It was real count over.

44:05.720 --> 44:06.720
Okay.

44:06.720 --> 44:12.720
This straight shooting ad saleswoman only need to guess one time to become a headgum podcast

44:12.720 --> 44:13.720
of the legend.

44:13.720 --> 44:16.720
This is, I believe you'll have it as Sam Shackle.

44:16.720 --> 44:17.720
But Sam.

44:17.720 --> 44:18.720
Yeah.

44:18.720 --> 44:19.720
Let's go.

44:19.720 --> 44:20.720
Let's see.

44:20.720 --> 44:21.720
What is?

44:21.720 --> 44:22.720
Why do I do it?

44:22.720 --> 44:23.720
Wait.

44:23.720 --> 44:24.720
You didn't say what?

44:24.720 --> 44:25.720
Are you serious?

44:25.720 --> 44:26.720
I don't know.

44:26.720 --> 44:27.720
I don't know.

44:27.720 --> 44:28.720
I don't know.

44:28.720 --> 44:29.720
Are you serious?

44:29.720 --> 44:30.720
Can I see?

44:30.720 --> 44:31.720
No.

44:31.720 --> 44:32.720
I buzz before.

44:33.720 --> 44:34.720
What is Sam Shackle?

44:34.720 --> 44:35.720
What is Sam Shackle?

44:35.720 --> 44:36.720
What is Sam Shackle?

44:36.720 --> 44:37.720
Well, that's good.

44:37.720 --> 44:38.720
We're coming over depending on what you're calling.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.720
How do you remember which team is which person?

44:40.720 --> 44:41.720
Because there's 20.

44:41.720 --> 44:45.720
I'm writing it down to h-

44:45.720 --> 44:46.720
300 for well.

44:46.720 --> 44:48.720
You know, I'm gonna have to give it to Will.

44:48.720 --> 44:49.700
Because Jacob's rich.

44:49.700 --> 44:50.700
So, like, we don't.

44:50.700 --> 44:52.700
You're not on the list yet.

44:52.700 --> 44:53.700
You're not on the list yet.

44:54.700 --> 44:55.700
You just came from X-AMondo.

44:55.700 --> 44:57.580
I think I wanted

44:57.580 --> 44:58.680
if I ever-

44:58.720 --> 45:00.700
I guess that's what he said bright.

45:00.700 --> 45:07.180
Okay, we'll control the board.

45:07.180 --> 45:12.540
Okay, oh my shit, sorry, I have to add this to somebody's team.

45:33.700 --> 45:36.460

On your buzz.

46:43.140 --> 46:44.220
There's 20 of you.

46:44.220 --> 46:45.900
You got buzz if you know this shit.

46:45.900 --> 46:47.740
People are probably not going to bring you to the point.

46:47.740 --> 46:48.900
I know, well, you know what?

46:48.900 --> 46:50.300
That's how it's got to, you know?

46:50.300 --> 46:52.620
This is why Jeopardy doesn't have like 20 guests on it.

46:52.620 --> 46:53.620
Yeah.

46:53.620 --> 46:54.460
Right.

46:54.540 --> 46:57.300
Everyone knows every episode of the board.

46:57.300 --> 46:58.300
This is fucking shit.

46:58.300 --> 47:00.580
All right, Marika controls the board.

47:00.580 --> 47:06.260
Let's go avoidable mistakes for 300, but buzz, buzz.

47:06.260 --> 47:07.460
I love the fact of the great.

47:07.460 --> 47:08.460
All right.

47:08.460 --> 47:13.020
OK, you can't buzz before you even read it.

47:13.020 --> 47:15.620
How the fuck do you do it where it's like horizontal to have?

47:15.620 --> 47:16.940
OK, there we go.

47:16.940 --> 47:18.780
Avoidable mistakes for 300.

47:18.780 --> 47:19.780
Buzz.

47:19.780 --> 47:21.980
OK, let's implement a new rule.

47:21.980 --> 47:23.660
I have to read the whole thing out because maybe not

47:23.660 --> 47:24.700
everybody can see equally.

47:24.700 --> 47:27.340
Also, but you can buzz as soon as they finish.

47:27.340 --> 47:28.380
The reason the big-

47:28.380 --> 47:32.100
So the new rule is just how Jeopardy actually works.

47:32.100 --> 47:33.260
All right, new rule.

47:33.260 --> 47:35.860
You have to praise the answer in the form of a question.

47:35.860 --> 47:37.060
Dane.

47:37.060 --> 47:37.420
Why?

47:37.420 --> 47:39.020
I really can let him talk to me like that.

47:39.020 --> 47:39.580
Who?

47:39.580 --> 47:40.220
Dane.

47:40.220 --> 47:41.020
Oh, yeah.

47:41.020 --> 47:41.420
All right.

47:41.420 --> 47:43.660
OK, so close.

47:43.660 --> 47:45.460
The reason the beginning of the show

47:45.460 --> 47:47.380
had a sort of frantic energy to it.

47:47.380 --> 47:48.380
Buzz.

47:48.380 --> 47:49.900
Casey.

47:49.900 --> 47:51.740
What is the pandemic?

47:51.740 --> 47:52.940
That's incorrect.

47:52.940 --> 47:53.940
Buzz.

47:53.940 --> 47:54.940
Buzz.

47:54.940 --> 47:55.940
Marika.

47:55.940 --> 47:58.540
What is the fact that we didn't get approval to film

47:58.540 --> 48:00.540
until day off?

48:00.540 --> 48:01.540
Incorrect.

48:01.540 --> 48:03.540
Dane, but Dane, but Dane, but Dane, but Dane.

48:03.540 --> 48:05.540
Dane, Dane.

48:05.540 --> 48:06.540
Dane.

48:06.540 --> 48:07.540
Dane.

48:07.540 --> 48:08.940
Mine also had to do with the video, not finishing it on time.

48:08.940 --> 48:10.940
But we'll get something else because he buzz.

48:10.940 --> 48:11.940
Buzz.

48:11.940 --> 48:12.940
Alex.

48:12.940 --> 48:13.940
What is because Jeff is involved?

48:13.940 --> 48:19.940
I mean, that's circling the brain.

48:19.940 --> 48:22.140
I don't think anyone's going to get it.

48:22.140 --> 48:23.540
And I'm going to have to give it to Alex.

48:23.540 --> 48:26.860
The correct answer was what?

48:26.860 --> 48:27.860
Oh, no, sorry.

48:27.860 --> 48:28.860
That's not the right answer.

48:28.860 --> 48:29.860
I changed it.

48:29.860 --> 48:36.700
Jeff had too much cold brew day off.

48:36.700 --> 48:37.700
Incorrect.

48:37.700 --> 48:38.700
Buzz.

48:38.700 --> 48:41.460
There were poppers from Gabris's show.

48:41.460 --> 48:42.460
Correct.

48:42.460 --> 48:43.460
Buzz.

48:43.460 --> 48:44.460
Jeff was here.

48:44.460 --> 48:45.460
Good.

48:45.460 --> 48:46.460
Correct.

48:46.460 --> 48:50.660
But it is about, it's about me being sour.

48:50.660 --> 48:51.660
That's your hand.

48:51.700 --> 48:52.660
Buzz.

48:52.660 --> 48:56.660
You didn't get enough sleep tonight before.

48:56.660 --> 48:57.660
No.

48:57.660 --> 48:58.660
Buzz.

48:58.660 --> 48:59.660
Wasn't there like, your laptop?

48:59.660 --> 49:00.660
No.

49:00.660 --> 49:03.660
The dongle of your laptop didn't work.

49:03.660 --> 49:04.660
Wrong.

49:04.660 --> 49:05.660
Your shirt wasn't dry.

49:05.660 --> 49:06.660
You did that.

49:06.660 --> 49:07.660
Wrong.

49:07.660 --> 49:08.660
Wrong.

49:08.660 --> 49:09.660
Wrong.

49:09.660 --> 49:10.660
It was your correct answer.

49:10.660 --> 49:11.660
It was someone.

49:11.660 --> 49:12.660
Well, wrong.

49:12.660 --> 49:13.660
Buzz.

49:13.660 --> 49:15.660
Jeff's eyelids were bothering him.

49:15.660 --> 49:16.660
Wrong.

49:16.660 --> 49:18.660
Did you see it?

49:19.660 --> 49:20.660
Be the egg?

49:20.660 --> 49:21.660
And nobody got it.

49:21.660 --> 49:26.660
The correct answer is, what is Jeff was upset that the venue was so sour!

49:26.660 --> 49:28.660
You're a basic anybody.

49:28.660 --> 49:30.540
Alright he says it wasn't just fine.

49:30.540 --> 49:31.540
Jeff was a honest one.

49:31.540 --> 49:35.060
How dangerous does he got all these carsthyvias.

49:35.060 --> 49:37.660
Isn't it all so going to surprise?

49:37.660 --> 49:38.660
Haha.

49:38.660 --> 49:40.940
Let's go stage, controls the board.

49:40.940 --> 49:44.980
Why?

49:44.980 --> 49:45.980
Joel.

49:45.980 --> 49:46.980
Joel controls the board.

49:46.980 --> 49:52.420
300. Headgun podcast trivia with 300. Jake's walkout song at the Grammar Street

49:52.420 --> 49:58.180
theater show. This isn't a wrong category. No, this wasn't a mistake. This isn't a

49:58.180 --> 50:02.820
mistake. I was bad day. Yeah, correct. No, that was a mirror. Was it? Yeah,

50:02.820 --> 50:07.580
Marieka's was daddy. I didn't know where you were. I think he was. Was it

50:07.580 --> 50:15.660
Gangnam style? No, it was a punk song. Jake, you should know this. What's a

50:15.660 --> 50:23.260
song that you would come out to? Is it Blake, what did he do song? No. Was it Wonderwall? No.

50:23.260 --> 50:30.300
No one's buzzing. All right. Nobody got it right. The correct answer is what is

50:30.300 --> 50:41.100
high. Jake, what's your song? Yeah. Yeah. He was controls the board. Oh, sweet. Let's do headgun podcast trivia.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.820

50:45.820 --> 50:52.620
Okay. Tarzan, you were too happy. Oh, let's do a. Go tell him. Let's do Rice

50:52.620 --> 50:57.420
Songs 100. Rice Songs for 100. This low read parody produced one of the most

50:57.420 --> 51:02.060
king's coughing his hook to date. Bye. On yourUh Us. It's sitting.

51:02.620 --> 51:06.900
Which the walk on the wild side. One walk on the wild side? Ooh? Okay. But

51:06.900 --> 51:10.140
what's the actual title of the actual song? Walk in the wild

51:10.140 --> 51:15.140
and walk on wild race. What's the actual parody title?

51:15.140 --> 51:17.140
Walk on the wild race?

51:17.140 --> 51:20.140
It's a good guess.

51:20.140 --> 51:21.140
It's a good guess.

51:21.140 --> 51:23.140
It's on the wild side.

51:23.140 --> 51:24.140
I know I'll be right.

51:24.140 --> 51:25.140
It's a wild side.

51:25.140 --> 51:26.140
WK.

51:26.140 --> 51:27.140
WK.

51:27.140 --> 51:28.140
Yeah.

51:28.140 --> 51:29.140
A wild race?

51:29.140 --> 51:30.140
Nope.

51:30.140 --> 51:32.140
On the wild grains.

51:32.140 --> 51:33.140
All right. You know what?

51:33.140 --> 51:34.140
No one is getting me right.

51:34.140 --> 51:38.140
What is use of walks to ensure for sure?

51:39.140 --> 51:41.140
I'm not even a parody.

51:41.140 --> 51:43.140
This is the title.

51:43.140 --> 51:44.140
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

51:44.140 --> 51:45.140
I don't want to miss you.

51:45.140 --> 51:46.140
I don't want to miss you.

51:46.140 --> 51:47.140
I don't want to miss you.

51:47.140 --> 51:48.140
I don't want to miss you.

51:48.140 --> 51:49.140
I don't want to miss you.

51:49.140 --> 51:50.140
Alice controls the board.

51:50.140 --> 51:51.140
Me?

51:51.140 --> 51:52.140
Let's go.

51:52.140 --> 51:53.140
Right songs.

51:53.140 --> 51:54.140
300.

51:54.140 --> 51:55.140
Right songs for 300.

51:55.140 --> 51:57.140
I was loving this.

51:57.140 --> 51:58.140
I was.

51:58.140 --> 51:59.140
This burnt right.

51:59.140 --> 52:01.140
Ginny went swimming during the fan favorite.

52:01.140 --> 52:03.140
All women episode.

52:03.140 --> 52:05.140
The rice bit is the one that I saw because I watched the live

52:05.140 --> 52:08.140
stream because the door was crying.

52:08.140 --> 52:11.140
You're obsessed with the voice.

52:11.140 --> 52:13.140
Yes, yes, yes.

52:13.140 --> 52:16.140
But I care about all of the rice and a man.

52:16.140 --> 52:17.140
Oh, no.

52:17.140 --> 52:19.140
Yeah, very good.

52:19.140 --> 52:20.140
That's right.

52:20.140 --> 52:22.140
Burning all the rain.

52:22.140 --> 52:24.140
Burning all the rain.

52:24.140 --> 52:25.140
Burning all the rain.

52:25.140 --> 52:26.140
It's different.

52:26.140 --> 52:27.140
Don't forget it.

52:27.140 --> 52:32.140
You should have some negative.

52:32.140 --> 52:33.140
Yeah.

52:33.140 --> 52:34.140
Yeah.

52:34.140 --> 52:35.140
I'm zero.

52:35.140 --> 52:36.140
Everybody's guessing wrong.

52:36.140 --> 52:37.140
That's not part of it.

52:37.140 --> 52:39.140
All right, Marieka's in the lead with 600.

52:39.140 --> 52:41.140
Will as 300 on you has 200.

52:41.140 --> 52:42.140
Everybody else is at zero.

52:42.140 --> 52:43.140
Got it.

52:43.140 --> 52:44.140
We're only halfway done.

52:44.140 --> 52:45.140
We're making control of the board.

52:45.140 --> 52:46.140
Avoidable mistakes.

52:46.140 --> 52:47.140
200.

52:47.140 --> 52:48.140
Avoidable mistakes.

52:48.140 --> 52:50.140
The other live show for 200.

52:50.140 --> 52:53.140
The biggest complaint amongst audience members about the show.

52:53.140 --> 52:54.140
Ball.

52:54.140 --> 52:55.140
Ball.

52:55.140 --> 52:56.140
Too many guests.

52:56.140 --> 52:57.140
You had too many guests.

52:57.140 --> 52:58.140
Not enough microphones.

52:58.140 --> 53:01.140
You really, really invited people back to the stage.

53:02.140 --> 53:04.140
Did we give you some of such headphones?

53:04.140 --> 53:05.140
You wasn't free.

53:05.140 --> 53:06.140
You didn't.

53:06.140 --> 53:07.140
Wait, Johnny.

53:07.140 --> 53:08.140
What was your guess?

53:08.140 --> 53:10.140
I didn't say a single thing.

53:10.140 --> 53:14.140
I'm really this whole episode.

53:14.140 --> 53:17.140
I think that I wanted Johnny's number.

53:17.140 --> 53:19.140
But we didn't actually give it to them.

53:19.140 --> 53:20.140
All right.

53:20.140 --> 53:21.140
Okay, Joel.

53:21.140 --> 53:22.140
Joel said something.

53:22.140 --> 53:23.140
What did you say?

53:23.140 --> 53:24.140
I said the venue was too small.

53:24.140 --> 53:25.140
That's I agree.

53:25.140 --> 53:28.140
But no, that was just another party.

53:28.140 --> 53:30.140
Was it because I wasn't there, Jeff?

53:31.140 --> 53:33.140
Uh, it's what is that Andrew Piles.

53:33.140 --> 53:36.140
Didn't exactly bring it up.

53:36.140 --> 53:37.140
Yes.

53:37.140 --> 53:38.140
Andrew didn't bring it.

53:38.140 --> 53:40.140
What is?

53:40.140 --> 53:41.140
What is about it?

53:41.140 --> 53:42.140
All right, Rochelle.

53:42.140 --> 53:44.140
When you got, you can throw the board.

53:44.140 --> 53:45.140
Rochelle, too.

53:45.140 --> 53:46.140
Rochelle.

53:46.140 --> 53:47.140
Rochelle.

53:47.140 --> 53:48.140
Yeah.

53:48.140 --> 53:49.140
No.

53:49.140 --> 53:50.140
Let's go.

53:50.140 --> 53:51.140
Avoidable mistake.

53:51.140 --> 53:52.140
100.

53:52.140 --> 53:53.140
Avoidable mistakes.

53:53.140 --> 53:55.140
May it at the grammar see theater live show for 100.

53:55.140 --> 53:56.140
What?

53:56.140 --> 53:57.140
What is the group?

53:57.140 --> 53:58.140
Sorry.

53:59.140 --> 54:00.140
Emma.

54:00.140 --> 54:03.140
Because it's for birthday and you ate all the cookies.

54:03.140 --> 54:05.140
Correct.

54:05.140 --> 54:08.140
I was so fucked up.

54:08.140 --> 54:10.140
We ate all the cookies.

54:10.140 --> 54:12.140
I didn't eat all the cookies.

54:12.140 --> 54:13.140
I bought the cookies for her.

54:13.140 --> 54:15.140
And then you ate all the cookies.

54:15.140 --> 54:16.140
That's my favorite.

54:16.140 --> 54:17.140
All right.

54:17.140 --> 54:20.140
Emma controls the board.

54:20.140 --> 54:21.140
Score update.

54:21.140 --> 54:22.140
Emma has 100.

54:22.140 --> 54:24.140
The rest is very similar to what I said earlier.

54:24.140 --> 54:25.140
Emily.

54:25.140 --> 54:26.140
I have 100.

54:26.140 --> 54:27.140
Cool.

54:27.140 --> 54:29.140
Let's do race on for two weeks.

54:29.140 --> 54:30.140
I'm going to have a folium.

54:30.140 --> 54:31.140
I'm going to have a folium.

54:31.140 --> 54:33.140
I'm going to go by last week.

54:33.140 --> 54:34.140
Folium control.

54:34.140 --> 54:35.140
People email me for that.

54:35.140 --> 54:36.140
Emma sometimes do.

54:36.140 --> 54:37.140
So I guess.

54:37.140 --> 54:38.140
Yeah.

54:38.140 --> 54:39.140
Yeah.

54:39.140 --> 54:40.140
I do.

54:40.140 --> 54:42.140
Best head gun podcast.

54:42.140 --> 54:43.140
Best for 200.

54:43.140 --> 54:44.140
Best head gun podcast.

54:44.140 --> 54:45.140
Guess what you wanted.

54:45.140 --> 54:46.140
Not.

54:46.140 --> 54:48.140
In Ivy League or Emma.

54:48.140 --> 54:50.140
You didn't have a guess.

54:50.140 --> 54:51.140
It was me.

54:51.140 --> 54:53.140
It was me.

54:53.140 --> 54:54.140
It was me.

54:54.140 --> 54:55.140
Oh, say.

54:55.140 --> 54:56.140
I was going to say.

54:56.140 --> 54:57.140
Maria.

54:57.140 --> 54:58.140
Shirin.

54:59.140 --> 55:00.140
No.

55:00.140 --> 55:04.780
telling you to give entrance is

55:04.780 --> 55:08.780
I'll do a head comb, head comb, pod cast, trivia for 200.

55:08.780 --> 55:12.140
Head comb, pod cast, trivia for 200. Sage edits a lot of the social question.

55:12.140 --> 55:13.140
She knows a lot of the social questions.

55:13.140 --> 55:15.140
I can't believe I can't believe I can't believe it.

55:15.140 --> 55:19.380
The specific venue on your old home style live show.

55:19.380 --> 55:21.180
I'm sure it's a fuck off.

55:21.180 --> 55:23.180
I'm sure it's a fuck off.

55:23.180 --> 55:24.180
I'm sure it's a fuck off.

55:24.180 --> 55:25.180
On your bed.

55:25.180 --> 55:27.380
I have to read the comments.

55:27.380 --> 55:29.980
I have to read the question before you can pause.

55:29.980 --> 55:30.980
Are you ready already?

55:30.980 --> 55:31.980
You can read it.

55:31.980 --> 55:33.980
I have to read the question before you can pause.

55:34.780 --> 55:37.380
Onus, probably the only one who knows the exact.

55:37.380 --> 55:39.380
Not the one at the arjun.

55:39.380 --> 55:41.380
Jeff, we don't even know.

55:42.580 --> 55:44.180
You're saying the name of, okay.

55:44.180 --> 55:47.580
So it was the Madison Square guard and conference room.

55:47.580 --> 55:50.580
Okay, but what was the name of the conference room?

55:50.580 --> 55:51.180
Fuck.

55:51.180 --> 55:52.180
You have to remember this.

55:52.180 --> 55:53.780
You're the only one who's going to remember.

55:53.780 --> 55:55.780
Can I look at my email?

55:56.780 --> 55:57.980
I got a letter.

55:57.980 --> 55:58.980
You got a letter.

55:58.980 --> 56:00.380
I can read your email.

56:00.380 --> 56:01.780
You can read your email.

56:01.780 --> 56:03.780
That's the same as just saying correct, right?

56:03.780 --> 56:11.180
Yeah, the correct answer was the legend's room.

56:11.180 --> 56:21.780
I was in talks with MSG to host a live record of the show at a conference room at

56:21.780 --> 56:22.780
Madison Square guard.

56:22.780 --> 56:26.780
So the poster is going to say that you're going to say that you're going to say that you're

56:26.780 --> 56:32.780
going to say that you're going to say that you're going to say that you're going to say that.

56:32.780 --> 56:34.780
But it would have been another one.

56:34.780 --> 56:35.780
Yeah.

56:35.780 --> 56:38.780
A business under the street up arena.

56:38.780 --> 56:39.780
Yeah.

56:39.780 --> 56:40.780
All right.

56:40.780 --> 56:43.780
The score to beat is Marieka at 600 onus closest with 400.

56:43.780 --> 56:44.780
Here we go on.

56:44.780 --> 56:45.780
You controls the board.

56:45.780 --> 56:46.780
I'll do best podcast.

56:46.780 --> 56:47.780
Yes.

56:47.780 --> 56:48.780
No.

56:48.780 --> 56:49.780
I'll do right songs to 100.

56:49.780 --> 56:50.780
Right songs for 200.

56:50.780 --> 56:54.780
The one rice song, Marieka was forced to sing on her week.

56:54.780 --> 56:55.780
Yes.

56:55.780 --> 56:57.780
When Jeff had was Wi-Fi less in Kentucky.

56:57.780 --> 56:58.780
Marika.

56:58.780 --> 57:00.780
Rice burn.

57:00.780 --> 57:03.780
That is correct.

57:03.780 --> 57:05.780
What is rice burn?

57:05.780 --> 57:06.780
Raika.

57:06.780 --> 57:08.780
Can you give us a little preview of that?

57:08.780 --> 57:10.780
For those who forgot.

57:10.780 --> 57:12.780
Let the rice burn.

57:12.780 --> 57:13.780
No.

57:13.780 --> 57:14.780
Sing it.

57:14.780 --> 57:15.780
It was Skyfall.

57:15.780 --> 57:17.780
Otherwise, I'm not going to be happy.

57:17.780 --> 57:19.780
Why does it burn?

57:19.780 --> 57:20.780
It was a big deal.

57:20.780 --> 57:21.780
It was a big deal.

57:21.780 --> 57:22.780
It was last night.

57:22.780 --> 57:24.780
It was a rice ball.

57:24.780 --> 57:25.780
It was a rice ball.

57:25.780 --> 57:26.780
It was a rice ball.

57:26.780 --> 57:27.780
It was a rice ball.

57:27.780 --> 57:29.780
Marika controls the board.

57:30.780 --> 57:31.780
And the game.

57:31.780 --> 57:32.780
Marika is pulling away.

57:32.780 --> 57:33.780
Yeah.

57:33.780 --> 57:34.780
Bring us 800.

57:34.780 --> 57:35.780
Yeah.

57:35.780 --> 57:37.780
Because I would.

57:37.780 --> 57:38.780
I think I would.

57:38.780 --> 57:39.780
I would.

57:39.780 --> 57:40.780
I don't know.

57:40.780 --> 57:41.780
Yeah.

57:41.780 --> 57:42.780
Yeah.

57:42.780 --> 57:44.780
Let's do double jeopardy for these double jeopardy.

57:44.780 --> 57:45.780
Double jeopardy.

57:45.780 --> 57:46.780
All right.

57:46.780 --> 57:47.780
I think it's just.

57:47.780 --> 57:48.780
I know.

57:48.780 --> 57:50.780
I think it's been the most abuse by this podcast.

57:50.780 --> 57:51.780
I think it's been.

57:51.780 --> 57:52.780
Yeah.

57:52.780 --> 57:54.780
I think it's been the most abuse by this podcast.

57:54.780 --> 57:56.780
I think it's been the most abuse I've ever done.

57:56.780 --> 57:57.780
Thank you.

57:57.780 --> 57:58.780
Thanks.

57:58.780 --> 57:59.780
That's all.

57:59.780 --> 58:00.780
We'll get back to that.

58:00.780 --> 58:01.780
Thank you.

58:01.780 --> 58:02.780
Thanks.

58:07.800 --> 58:08.780
The location.

58:08.780 --> 58:10.780
The location of Jeff's first 14 appears on the show.

58:10.780 --> 58:11.780
Yes.

58:11.780 --> 58:12.780
His house.

58:12.780 --> 58:13.780
His closet.

58:13.780 --> 58:14.780
Buzz buzz buzz.

58:14.780 --> 58:15.780
Okay.

58:15.780 --> 58:16.780
Close.

58:16.780 --> 58:17.780
Who else?

58:17.780 --> 58:18.780
Buzz buzz.

58:18.780 --> 58:19.780
Who's that?

58:19.780 --> 58:20.780
Oh, Ferris.

58:20.780 --> 58:22.780
What is a basement?

58:22.780 --> 58:24.780
It was a closet.

58:24.780 --> 58:25.780
But where is the closet?

58:25.780 --> 58:26.780
It was.

58:26.780 --> 58:27.780
It was.

58:27.780 --> 58:29.780
Where in the world?

58:29.780 --> 58:30.780
Your mommy's house?

58:30.780 --> 58:32.780
I am not.

58:32.780 --> 58:33.780
Actually, Joel got it.

58:33.780 --> 58:34.780
Give it to Joel.

58:34.780 --> 58:35.780
Kind of shot.

58:35.780 --> 58:36.780
Yeah.

58:36.780 --> 58:37.780
All right.

58:37.780 --> 58:38.780
Joel, you're on the board.

58:38.780 --> 58:39.780
You're not going to win.

58:39.780 --> 58:41.780
And that was double jeopardy, right?

58:41.780 --> 58:42.780
Yeah, you got 200.

58:42.780 --> 58:43.780
Double jeopardy.

58:43.780 --> 58:45.780
Do you need two headphones and anything's possible?

58:45.780 --> 58:46.780
All right, here we go.

58:46.780 --> 58:50.780
Jeff, what was that one episode where you wore a Tuxedo in your parents' closet?

58:50.780 --> 58:51.780
The Huskers.

58:51.780 --> 58:53.780
Oh, the head gaskers.

58:53.780 --> 58:55.780
That's right.

58:55.780 --> 58:57.780
That was an undeniable shirt.

58:57.780 --> 58:58.780
It's a very good shirt.

58:58.780 --> 58:59.780
It's a very good shirt.

58:59.780 --> 59:00.780
It's a very good shirt.

59:00.780 --> 59:01.780
That's good shirt.

59:01.780 --> 59:02.780
The board, let's finish the shit out.

59:02.780 --> 59:03.780
Best guess.

59:03.780 --> 59:04.780
Best guess for 100.

59:04.780 --> 59:07.780
This red-headed Floridian won't rest until everyone on the offensive.

59:07.780 --> 59:09.780
That's right.

59:09.780 --> 59:10.780
That's right.

59:10.780 --> 59:12.780
It's Casey Donnie here.

59:14.780 --> 59:17.780
Casey, where in the border are you from?

59:17.780 --> 59:20.780
I'm from a crowsprings who ever asked that.

59:20.780 --> 59:23.780
That was well, not that it matters.

59:24.780 --> 59:26.780
All right, last one.

59:26.780 --> 59:27.780
Head gaskers alumni club.

59:27.780 --> 59:30.780
The this former head gump podcast Frequenter.

59:30.780 --> 59:31.780
Went down to work.

59:31.780 --> 59:32.780
It went hard.

59:32.780 --> 59:33.780
It went hard.

59:33.780 --> 59:35.780
It was work on this show.

59:35.780 --> 59:38.780
I heard Emma Foley first.

59:38.780 --> 59:40.780
No, I heard Emma Foley first.

59:40.780 --> 59:42.780
No, you heard this Emma Foley.

59:42.780 --> 59:44.780
I was buzzing on behalf of Vanya.

59:44.780 --> 59:45.780
Thank you.

59:45.780 --> 59:46.780
Sage.

59:46.780 --> 59:47.780
My com is hanging.

59:49.780 --> 59:51.780
This is fucking bullshit.

59:52.780 --> 59:56.780
Final scores are Emma with 100.

59:56.780 --> 59:58.780
Joel with 200.

59:58.780 --> 59:59.780
Will with 300.

59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.780
Sage and Ania tied for second with 400.

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:05.780
And winning fucking jeopardy.

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:07.780
It's Marie from Brownway.

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:15.780
She's also the first.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:17.780
There's another segment still, right?

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:18.780
Exactly.

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:19.780
Yeah.

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:20.780
Of course now.

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:23.780
This one's the longest one.

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:24.780
Those ones are short.

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:25.780
Those ones are short.

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:26.780
Yeah.

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:36.780
Let's let's let's all just take a minute.

01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:37.780
All right.

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:38.780
First of all, plugs.

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:39.780
First of all, plug.

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:40.780
Second of all, buddy.

01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:43.780
200 episodes.

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:45.780
Can we treat it with the reverence that it deserves?

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:47.780
I feel like everybody's here to just get in and get out.

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:49.780
It feels like everybody's doing me a favor,

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.780
which I don't appreciate, but I do appreciate that you are here.

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:53.780
What?

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:55.780
Let's everyone go around.

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.780
Very quickly and just say one nice thing about this show.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.780
Let's start with a minute.

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:04.780
Everybody on the show seems to like it.

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:09.780
And the super fans of the show really love it.

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:12.780
They are all in on this inside joke.

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.780
And it's a tight rope to walk.

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.780
Hosting the show because you have to be likable.

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:21.780
But really unlikable at the same time.

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:26.780
So I think only Jeff and probably like six other people at the company could pull it off.

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.780
And a lot of people.

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:31.780
But it's exciting to see it all come together.

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:32.780
200.

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:33.780
What a fucking honor.

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:34.780
Let's give it up.

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:35.780
Back in.

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:42.780
Just to piggyback on me, you are such a unique person.

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.780
And some of you, the show.

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:46.780
Jeff is such a unique person.

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:49.780
Just me, favorite thing in the world is to become a lens.

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:50.780
Let's kill everybody.

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:52.780
Go around and compliment Jeff.

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:53.780
Yeah.

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:57.780
And I think that it takes perseverance to do anything for as long as you've done it.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.780
And sometimes you can get tired.

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:02.780
I'm sure so much that you don't want to do it.

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:08.780
I think it's so impressive that you put your best foot forward and always try and create a unique experience with each new episode.

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:13.780
And I think as much as much negativity as we throw your way.

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:16.780
I think at the end of the day, we enjoy your company.

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.780
We enjoy the show and kudos.

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:21.780
This wasn't what this was supposed to be.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.780
It was supposed to be like everybody razzing the show one last time.

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:25.780
Great how to hair.

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:26.780
Good skin.

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:27.780
Katie.

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:28.780
I can't follow that.

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:29.780
That was Ernest.

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:30.780
It's sincere.

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:31.780
So say something disarrest.

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:33.780
Your eyelids actually.

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:36.780
I haven't noticed them to be very dry when I watched the video episode.

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:37.780
So.

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:41.780
Literally the one thing.

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:42.780
Splash water.

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:43.780
This one way.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:44.780
Jeff.

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.780
What else is there to say?

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:49.780
You to host the show every week.

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:50.780
And.

01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:51.780
And.

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:52.780
And.

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:53.780
And.

01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:54.780
Not.

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.780
What is going to be you.

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:57.780
All right.

01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:58.780
We got a.

01:02:58.780 --> 01:02:59.780
Yeah.

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:00.780
On you for show.

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:01.780
Can you hear me, Jeff?

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:02.780
Fairly.

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:03.780
If you want to open the door.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:04.780
Do you want to come in here?

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:05.780
I can hear you.

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:06.780
I can.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:07.780
We have to.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:08.780
We love working with you.

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.780
And even though like your absolute nightmare in every way.

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:12.780
Like production wise.

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:14.780
You're such a charming and good person.

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:16.780
And you like genuinely care about this company.

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:17.780
And that's right.

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.780
And that's why we like kind of forgive you anything.

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:21.780
And like it's been such an honor to be your.

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:24.780
Like supervising producer and clean up your mistakes.

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:26.780
And we like really we really love you.

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:27.780
And we're sorry.

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.780
We locked you in this studio for a day.

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:30.780
Don't be.

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:32.780
On you had to print out steps.

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:33.780
And recording.

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:35.780
And you still fuck it up.

01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:36.780
And you still.

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:37.780
Yeah.

01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:40.780
I think you have a beautiful singing voice.

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:45.780
That's right.

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.780
Guys, we got to figure this.

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:48.780
We got to finish this up.

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:50.780
But just one word to describe the show.

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:51.780
Erica.

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:53.780
Great.

01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.780
So so.

01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:00.780
I feel terrible for Alex Erica and Dan.

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:02.780
I feel like they didn't have headphones.

01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:03.780
And I wasted an hour.

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:04.780
I had headphones.

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:11.780
I feel like, you know, the amount of user generated content you get is surprising.

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:17.780
Like the fans really love you to the point where they'll dedicate hours of their own time.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:21.780
To put together videos that a hundred people will watch.

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.780
That's nice.

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:24.780
Why do we?

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:25.780
It's not like that.

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:27.780
The fans are the fans are great.

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:29.780
Good fans are good.

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:31.780
This.

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:34.780
This show is just so.

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:37.780
Well said.

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:38.780
Very good.

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:39.780
Yeah.

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:40.780
I passed.

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:46.780
I ran into Jeff yesterday in the street.

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:51.780
And he was exiting a grocery store.

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:53.780
And the clerk.

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:58.780
He had forgotten a big parcel of meat inside the store.

01:04:58.780 --> 01:04:59.780
The clerk chased him.

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:00.780
This is true.

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:01.780
Chase him back.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:02.780
True.

01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:04.780
And to which he was she said, you left your meat in the store.

01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:06.780
He said, I'm not going back in there.

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:09.780
And that's the lover of mine is in the store.

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:12.780
And he made his girlfriend go get it.

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:13.780
Oh.

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:14.780
Oh.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:15.780
Oh.

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:17.780
And that's how I feel about the show.

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:21.780
What did you forget?

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:22.780
It's nice.

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.780
Why wouldn't you go back in?

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:26.780
Yeah.

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:29.780
I was going to have to say hi to her.

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:33.780
And then it would be like the awkward thing of like I'm with my current girlfriend

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:34.780
talking to her.

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:35.780
Which is fine.

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:37.780
But like I just didn't want to put her in that position.

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:38.780
I didn't hear that.

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:40.780
Because I didn't hear a former lover mentioned at all.

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.780
I thought you were just refusing.

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:44.780
That's not my meat.

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:46.780
That's not my meat.

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:48.780
That's not my meat.

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:49.780
That's not my meat.

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.780
That's not my meat.

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:52.780
Every.

01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:54.780
Every is so much joy.

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:55.780
So much joy.

01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:58.780
Physicians.

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:01.780
You skipped Alex over there.

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:03.780
Thanks a lot.

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:07.780
I really love the rice songs.

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:09.780
I think you get really creative on the lyrics.

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:10.780
I'm a little confused.

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:12.780
Why do you think it tastes like sand though?

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:15.780
I think I might be consisting of wrong things.

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:16.780
It doesn't taste easy.

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:17.780
It doesn't taste easy.

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:18.780
It doesn't taste easy.

01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:19.780
It doesn't taste easy.

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:21.780
It doesn't taste easy.

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:24.780
It doesn't taste easy.

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:25.780
I'm sorry.

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:26.780
It's not easy.

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:27.780
I'm sorry.

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:28.780
From yalls right to left.

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:29.780
Let's start with Marika.

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:31.780
You skipped fares.

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:32.780
Oh, fares.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:33.780
Oh, sure.

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:38.780
I'd say this show unites us all against Jeff.

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:40.780
But yeah, it brings people together.

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:41.780
Common enemy.

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:42.780
Yeah.

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:46.780
On a real note, this is one of the best things I've ever been a part of.

01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:50.780
Oh, I don't know how to figure out how to insult you after I say that.

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:52.780
So I'll just leave it at that.

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:55.180
This was truly one of the greatest things.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:55.980
Oh, it's incredible.

01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:57.380
I mean, first of all,

01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:01.780
huge shout out to Ferris and Marieka for getting this show off the ground more than anyone else.

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:03.580
Like, well, that's putting other people down.

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:04.180
I didn't mean that.

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:07.780
I mean, I just mean they worked really hard at the beginning to make it something cool,

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:10.580
especially with Marieka recording the saxophone lick,

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:12.780
which I don't know if everybody knows or if they forgotten,

01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:14.980
but yeah, Marieka recorded that sax.

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.380
Ferris, I think mixed it.

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:16.980
Is that true?

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:17.580
That's true.

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:18.180
Oh my God.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.180
And, you know, the whole thing.

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:20.980
I don't know if we even still do this on the audio,

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:23.580
but the sax fillers was Ferris' idea.

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:27.580
And he also would used to comb through and create it to cold open ideas.

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:31.180
So this show is mostly the work of Ferris and Marieka.

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:32.780
So shout out to you all.

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.780
And let's go to Sweden over to Marieka.

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:37.780
I was so refreshing to hear you just speak honestly for a second.

01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:39.980
You know, the first time I ever met Jeffrey J.

01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:43.980
I was like, this guy's, this guy's really nice.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.980
Back to your regularly scheduled album.

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:48.980
Yeah, Eric.

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:54.380
Um, I mean, I think picking piggybacking off of what Ferris said.

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:58.580
I think the show ultimately does what I wanted it to do,

01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:00.980
which is like bringing everyone together,

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:04.380
people that like don't really interact at work all the time.

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.780
Like having them have a chance to talk to each other.

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:11.580
And I think you're the force that is able to do that.

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:14.580
And like make everyone comfortable,

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:18.580
even if it's like comfortable in their discomfort or their anger

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:19.580
at you can.

01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:24.780
So I think you're, you're the only one that can pull it off.

01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:26.580
And you do consistently.

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.580
And I'm proud of you for that show.

01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:29.580
Not a lot.

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:32.580
With the consistency of sand and consistency.

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.580
It's hard to increase.

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:36.580
I can't believe this is the last episode.

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:40.580
The show's canceled.

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:42.580
Oh, sure.

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:43.580
Okay.

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:44.580
That's why we like.

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:46.580
I don't know.

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:47.580
Not the show.

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:50.580
Jake left the room to go delete the RSS.

01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:52.580
I believe he's a back catalogue.

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.580
This is the last live show.

01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:55.580
It erased.

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:56.580
Now I this one's for you.

01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:57.580
Oh, my god.

01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:58.580
He's getting from France.

01:08:58.580 --> 01:08:59.580
Yes.

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:02.580
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:03.580
Shepherd on it.

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:08.580
Right.

01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:11.580
You have to cut this out, right?

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:12.580
I don't know.

01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:13.580
Obviously.

01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:14.580
I think he has the monetization.

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:15.580
Charming.

01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:18.580
Basmati could be your new addiction.

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:19.580
It's solid in the cinch.

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:21.580
We used to walk for friction.

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.580
Don't want soft skin.

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:23.580
So I'll cinch.

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:24.580
Bernie.

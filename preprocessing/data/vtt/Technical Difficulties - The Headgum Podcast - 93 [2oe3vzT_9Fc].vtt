WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Let me tell you what's not going to happen today.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
See that everybody versus Jeff show.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Not today.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
I can't fucking handle it.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
I'm off two coffees.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
I'm having a great day and if this sours it,

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
it's going to be because of you guys.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Because I'm prepared.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
I'm glad.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
You stopped a sentence before a period.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
They didn't end.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Because we have so much to get to.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
I'm stressed a little bit.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Let's get started then.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Let's get started.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Let's get started.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Let's get started.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
We should say that on the show is Grace and Wise at Great KY's.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Shelby Wolstein at Shelby J. Wolstein.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Just Shelby Wolstein.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
But J is my middle-next show.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
That's ****.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Oh my god.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
And I'm here blue and filled bringing up the rear.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Let's start ourselves off with a bond of the week.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
My pick is going to be Lucy and Baj.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
The late Lucy and Baj.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
I should say.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Nice.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I'm checking to ask who that is.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
You guys aren't interested at all.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Grace and kind of did.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Grace and you just might.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I don't know who that is.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
But I'm not interested in finding out.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Okay.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I think I, I think I'll hear it.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Hear it.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Tell us.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
You don't know.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Now I don't think you know.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
I'm here.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
You used to live at First and First in New York, right?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Uh-huh.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Across the street from where you used to live.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
As far as I understand it.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Is.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
New York's last bastion of writer's salons.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
All right.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Artists and hangouts.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
We're talking Lucy and.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Started by the one and only late Lucy and Baj.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
This was the art worlds.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Hangout during the naughty oddies.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
The thousands.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
People would go curators.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Visual artists, writers, actors, musicians.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
All of downtown's denizens of your.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Would congregate.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
At a Parisian.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Brassory.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm sorry to even say.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
But like the wine flowed as free as conversation.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
And Lucy and would kind of house it.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Not all.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
Reading a New Yorker article from 1998.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
I this morning read an article on garage.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
By one of their great writers, Nate Freeman.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
And it really kind of is an oral history of Lucy and.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
But how she curated not only art.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
But an environment to discuss it.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
This is no offense to Nate the writer.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
But I didn't care about it at all.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Yeah.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
I think it's interesting enough that the dead man who.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Did tell a lot of tales at his own restaurant.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Which would be the next James.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Devilos 7.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Great.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Some who's your pick for bond of the week.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Also Shelby we should say that bond of the week is.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
It's like we've been doing on and off.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
We're every week.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
We're going to.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Pick our.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Personal casting decision on who should be the next.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
James Bond.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
On and out.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
It's feels like every week for the last six months.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
We're scraping the bottom of the barrel for weeks and weeks at this.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
At this point.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Well, casting is yet to make a decision.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
You know that they're probably actually doing this at MGM by the way.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah, I'm gonna buy that one.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Lance Bass, Lance Bass.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Wow, I got one.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
I got one.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
I got one.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
In sync.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Lance Bass.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Yeah.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I think.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
He was gonna be an astronaut for a minute.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
A bass.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
He's cutting.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
He was getting.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Oh, what?

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
He was gonna be a bass astronaut.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Lance Bass.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Bass, astronaut.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Let's play Bass, throw not.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
So we have to decide whether this person is coming on.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
That's 10 times better than any shitty game you've come up with.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Oh, my god.

04:53.000 --> 05:01.000
All the greatest hits are happening right now.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Do you have a reason or do you just want to leave it at Bass?

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
No, I want Lance Bass to be the new bond.

05:08.000 --> 05:16.000
Because I think that he was going to like go to space gives him sort of the air of mystery

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
that a bond needs to have.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Yeah, like he was down for the adventure or not.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
Yeah, but I think like his energy is far more approachable than other bonds in the past

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
and in that way, you might get in a whole new viewership.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Okay.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
Maybe you're more welcome in to watching the bond movies.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Bass, double of seven, you know.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Amir says keep going.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
My zoom just died new batteries.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
My bond is Quincy Isaiah.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Who is that?

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
He's typing in the chat.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
This is, yeah, he's in the winning time.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Is that a movie or?

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
It just sounds like, yeah.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Oh, a new show.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Got it.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
All right.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Great.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Okay.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Watch.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Yep.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I'm going to go with James A. Castor.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Just mostly because he's already got the name down.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Right.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Like a big part of it.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Well, it could be any James.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Because it's not like his name is James Bond.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
No, but it's close.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
So on set, they could just say James and he's already in character.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Thank you to that with James Baldwin.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
They could do it with James Baldwin.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Whoa.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I almost hit something so dark, which is that it should be James Baldwin.

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
Because he can already handle it gun.

06:39.000 --> 06:49.000
If we're going to go with the James thing from before.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
I have a few things that I wanted to just wax about.

06:52.000 --> 06:58.000
We kind of already talked about this off air shall be.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Never.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
What?

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
It was, I was going to say Shelby's, the waxing point is Shelby's new digs.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
And I wanted to talk about your new house.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
But you already got to tell me about it.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
And I don't, I don't want to simply hear it again.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
It's so funny to say new house.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
And this is all I have.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
It's like a complete wall.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
No art.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I'm like, we've really done it up.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
I love the place.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Yeah.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Let's talk about this instead.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
You kicked it off in terms of recording at the new headgun.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Physical studio at the LA studio.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
It looks great.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
It sounds great.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
How did you feel any advice for me?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
I loved it.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
It's a blast in there.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
My one word of advice would be, don't put a drink where the microphone on the table where the microphones are.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Because it is not stable at all.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Right.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
And in that way, it'll fall over.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
With just a gust of wind.

07:55.000 --> 08:02.000
So having a drink there makes it really dangerous for ruining equipment that costs a lot of money.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Hmm.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
How windy is the studio?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
It is.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
It's life.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Like have you ever been in like Iowa and tornado season?

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
So the windy is possible place on the face of the earth.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
And your text is I'm back, but it doesn't seem like it.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
No, yeah, I'm here now.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
I'm doing good.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Oh, I'm looking at the rain.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
This is the rain out of bed.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
This is the weather.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Watch out, watch out.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Watch out.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
That's the weather.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
That's sort of what it felt like when you were coming back was like, watch out, watch out, watch out.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
It's the rain.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Watch out, watch out.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Watch out, watch out.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Watch out.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Watch out.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Watch out.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
So.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Yeah.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
I'm really confident.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
It's really good.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Oh, really.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
It's a.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
It's cold brew that I buy in a jar and then I add full fat.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
And it's almost like a creamer.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
There's so it's such a thick oat milk that like you don't have to add a lot.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
And it goes the long way.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
You don't have to add sugar because it's already sweetened.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Yeah.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
And you don't have to add canola oil either because that's in there.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Excuse me.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Canola oil isn't an oatmeal, which is one of the reasons why it's so thick and

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
congealed because it's actually really bad for you.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Your body can't physically break down.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Canola oil vegetable oil in any way.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
So unless you're taking vitamin E.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
You're actually poisoning yourself.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Um.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Yeah.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
It doesn't feel like I'm poisoning myself.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
It isn't.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
So that's small amounts.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
But.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
It's not.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
We're always poisoning ourselves.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Whether it's through food, gastronomy, really, or.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Conversation.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Like right now.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Gray.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
It's in KY's.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Um, let's talk about your gym.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Do you want to plug your gym?

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
We've never given you the platform really to tell people in the Denver area.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Well, typically bulldozer color auto.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Yeah.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
It's basically Johnny right now because he's in Colorado.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Did you go to the gym?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Sorry.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
I mean, yeah.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
No.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
He hasn't.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Even though we definitely talked about it.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
But yeah.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Rocky Mountain Athletics.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Mountain spelled MTN.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
So just get rid of all the vowels in there.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
That's cool.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Check it out on Instagram.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Or if you're in the Denver area at 1921 Federal Boulevard.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
You're missing an end.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
What's that?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
If you take all the vowels out of mountain.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
There's two S.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Yeah.

10:15.000 --> 10:22.000
Well, we're not going to change it at this point.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
No, that's totally fair.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
And I think probably like the more common one is to say MTN.

10:27.000 --> 10:34.000
And I guess it's always sort of one of your vowels and one of the consequences in Venice.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Okay.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
So I want to talk about that.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Do you want to say anything more about it?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Okay.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Blacks point here is Grayson's gym slash habits.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Because if not, we'll move on to your habits.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Oh, yeah.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
No.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
I guess I could just just try to delay talking about my habits for as long as possible now.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Well, we don't want to eat up too much time because the next one is a mirror's fears.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Okay.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Okay.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
I'm just going to get through it.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I guess get through it as fast as you want.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Okay.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
What do your habits?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
You know, wake up.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
That's a big habit of mind.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Do that.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
I do that every day.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
How do you stay consistent with shut up over here?

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
How do you stay consistent with that?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
With waking up?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Hell.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Yeah.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Because like, one of the, for me, the hardest part about like staying fit is like,

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
consistency.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
So how do you stay consistent with that first habit?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Yeah.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
I would, I don't know if waking up is sort of like a fitness habit.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
So those things.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
But sleep is like the most important thing I thought.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Yeah.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
But sleep.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
The waking up is the opposite of sleep.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
So that's actually unhealthy.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Yeah.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
And I guess if you never wake up, it doesn't matter if your body's good.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Exactly.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Okay.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Second habit.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Work out.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
That one is that is that one's fitness related.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
That's tough.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Yeah.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Do you do that one?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Or sometimes.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
You need, should I be like your personal trainer?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Should we talk about this offline?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
We should talk about it online and yeah.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Okay.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
All right.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
All right.

12:03.000 --> 12:09.000
It's like three to four times a week until they got really cold in New York.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
And I wasn't living near the gym.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
So then I started going once a week.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
And now I haven't been in almost three weeks.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
So again, consistency.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
I know.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
That's like that's fucked up about it.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
I've been going to vital.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
But in LA, I go to a basically equivalent of that.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Gotcha.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
You're a big climber.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Yeah.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Socialy specifically.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Yeah.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Not with me.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I've never been invited.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Invitaled.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
But I see.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
That's also not true.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
We've been there together.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Yeah.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
That was an accident.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Jake invited me.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
And I didn't know you were going to be there.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Oh.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Let's wrap it up with one last habit that you do.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
That's healthy or not.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Oh, healthy or not.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
We'll go in the knot side and drinking alcohol.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Because that's sort of that truly is poison.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Yeah.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Yeah.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Bring it full circle to poisoning.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Yeah.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Do drink every day?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Uh, no.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I mean, well, I drink every day.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
I don't drink alcohol every day.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
That was easy.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Nice.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
You're going to be singing a different tune in a couple seconds here.

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
I mean, because we have to actually dive into your spheres.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
We don't actually have to do anything.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Just because you said that doesn't mean we actually have to do it.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
I mean, I'm down to discuss spheres.

13:35.000 --> 13:42.000
But like, I don't want you to think you're forcing my hand or requiring anything of me.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
I don't respect you.

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
I don't care for you or for what you have to say.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
I'll do it if it means the end product of the show is better.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
But it's not because you've sort of asked me to.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
But right.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
If anything, I'm doing it.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
You care about the show.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Because the show, yes, I care about the vice versa.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
You sort of cornered me into a checkmate situation where I'm accidentally forced to care

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
about your opinion.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
So I will talk about my, I guess one of my fears is trying to is giving you the respect slash

14:16.000 --> 14:22.000
confidence you need to succeed because I don't want to have a part in that if that makes sense.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Okay.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Yeah.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
I don't want one day for you to have gotten further ahead.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
In this or any business and think back, I'm glad I'm your help to you get there.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
I don't want to give you that adaboy that praise.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I don't want to like pat your back.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
I want to stand on your shoulders and keep you down.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
I want to push you lower.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I love you backwards.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Sure.

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
My goal is that when I leave this here earth, you're back to being ahead of you.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
I'm in turn.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Unpaid.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Really?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Yeah.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
How do you escape like the legality of that?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Because like, I'm down for that.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
But like, I'm just going to put the cost.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
I want this to be your peak right now or you are right now.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
I want this to be the highlight of your Lord.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Because it's not even going.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
That's right.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
It's going fine.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Exactly.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
And I want this to be the halfway point you turn around and you start marching a

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
slag back towards the beginning of wherever you were at like an age 12.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Okay.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Because I got a raise.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I got a raise in October after like years.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Yes.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Having any raise.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
And so then you don't get.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Let's the opposite of a raise.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
A demotion.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Yeah.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Demotion.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Yes.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
But like, demotion is the opposite of promotion.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I want to give you a lower motion.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
I want to give you a lower.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I think I want to give you a lower.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Okay.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Yeah.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
My other view is mice.

15:49.000 --> 15:57.000
Not really a fan of the skiddish sort of like quick little quick twitch nature of

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
something like a mouse.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
We have to give on.

16:00.000 --> 16:11.000
Welcome to Frojo or not.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Okay.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
So.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
These are folks.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
I'm not Frojo.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Next.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I'm here.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Come on.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Let's fucking play along a little bit.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
You don't have to go on.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
I did.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
That's ice cream.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Incorrect.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
This is going to be Frojo.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
It's going to be.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
That's also ice cream.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
There's no way.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Frojo does not.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Correct.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
That's ice cream.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
What about this?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
That's so bad.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
That's raspberry.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Frozen yogurt.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
See?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
That's ice cream.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Nutella Frojo.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
By the way, just because it's not soft serve doesn't mean that it's not frozen yogurt.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Fucking idiot.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Frozen.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Major killer.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
This one feels like frozen yogurt.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
That one is correct.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Frozen yogurt.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
That's exactly rice.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Speaking of rice milk.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
That's rice.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
That's right.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
That's cream.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Absolutely correct.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
It's going to be hard.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Chotto rice milk ice cream.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
This one stuff.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Are you guys seeing like multiple like pictures like there's

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Yeah, but that's actually sort of fun to me.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
That's what you guys agree.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Sort of like a mosaic.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Nice.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Yes.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
I'm going to say ice cream again.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Correct.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Here we go.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Fuck.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Looks a little creamy in a way that makes me think this is Frojo.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
That's correct.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
What about this?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
This is a no alternative.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Mass.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
This is not correct.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
That's an old milk.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Mass.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Let's see.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
The game's not Frojo or ice cream.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
It's just Frojo or not.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
So that is actually that is mass potatoes.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Was it?

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
I don't know.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
No.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
It's banana.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Ice cream.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
That looks good actually.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
This is ice cream.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Correct.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
This is whipped cream.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
That's coconut.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Yeah.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Coconut.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
It's really what?

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
Oh, are you mad at us for laughing?

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
That's ice cream.

18:33.000 --> 18:39.000
We finally got to a place where we were giggling.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Thanks for playing.

18:40.000 --> 18:47.000
I think you got mad at me the game.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
That's supposed to take fucking ten minutes.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
It took three to half.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
You have to relax at all.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Let's go back to Grace's habits.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Grace and another habit.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
I gave you all my habits.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
Well, then Shelby's habits.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Let's fucking feel time again.

19:04.000 --> 19:11.000
Shelby's fears.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Being put on the spot.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
And now we can't hear.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
And now we can hear.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
And this one's not even my fault.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
She's muted in the audience.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
I'm here.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
How do you feel about rats?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Scary as well.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
There's never been a rat in my apartment.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
But like when you walk by like a pile of trash in New York City.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
And you just see one just like dart out.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
That's fucking terrifying.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
Well, there can't be a rat inside because rats are outside and mice are inside.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Yeah.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
I mean, I guess there could be like rats can find a way.

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
But usually mice are the ones that are like small enough to fit through the cracks.

19:53.000 --> 19:58.000
But I think like if one comes inside, it then is a mouse.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
So as soon as they enter.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Yeah.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
By definition, right?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Yeah.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
Kind of like how cats are just female dogs.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Exactly.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
It's Jeff gone.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I feel like if rats wanted you that could take over.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Like if rats were able to communicate and mobilize,

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
that could probably take over the very least Manhattan.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
Like they all find the way inside and bite people in their sleep.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
That would sort of create a new mass pandemic.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
It would seem it would be like a plague.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
I think it might actually be a plague because don't rats.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Didn't rats like carry the plague in the first place?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Yeah.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
The bubonic plague.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
That's true.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
It was like it was rats.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
So yeah, that could actually just be the plague.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
In the first plague.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
In the first.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
In the first.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Carried.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
All right.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
No.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Turn your camera back up.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Wait.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Shelby, we still can't hear you.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
We can.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
You might be recording locally.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
People can hear you.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
But we can't hear you right now.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
I don't know why.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Jeff, it's happy or something.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Full steam ahead.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
A lot of technical difficulties.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Just like they did.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
You might be able to get the dust in the middle of the show.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Yeah.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Now we can't quite hear Shelby.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
My headphones weren't working earlier.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
I don't know.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
This is one of few.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
You're gonna run.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
No.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
No.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
It's not.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
No.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
By the way.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
I was gonna say this is one of a few episodes

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
where it's going poorly because of the guests.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
All right.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
You were going to say what you said it.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Oh, what is this?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
This is a new Shelby.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Double Shelby.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
She's connecting with the house.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.160
She's connecting with audio, separate from the video.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.160
This is incredible.

21:59.160 --> 22:03.960
Well, she's back.

22:03.960 --> 22:05.400
Can you hear me now?

22:05.400 --> 22:06.200
Yeah.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.600
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.

22:13.480 --> 22:15.080
Shelby, you missed a dance break.

22:15.080 --> 22:18.280
And then us talking about how this is kind of heading south,

22:18.280 --> 22:21.000
not because it may be because of technical difficulties.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.160
Well, before I left and had to come back,

22:23.160 --> 22:24.680
they were talking about a lot about rats.

22:24.680 --> 22:27.320
And what I want to say is the reason I don't think rats can take

22:27.320 --> 22:30.680
over the world is because of the way that they accidentally

22:30.680 --> 22:35.240
get their little tails tangled up and then that kills them.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.680
I mean, rat kings.

22:36.680 --> 22:39.480
The rat, when a rat came and created that is, yes,

22:39.480 --> 22:42.520
I am discussing rat kings, but I'm discussing how rat kings

22:42.520 --> 22:49.960
actually take the ability for a rat uprising out of the equation.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.560
Interesting.

22:51.560 --> 22:52.680
What about let's go back?

22:52.680 --> 22:53.320
Sorry, I'm here.

22:53.320 --> 22:53.880
Yeah.

22:53.880 --> 22:54.200
Great.

22:54.200 --> 22:54.600
Let's go to you.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.760
I was going to in response.

22:56.760 --> 22:58.440
I'm not familiar with this phenomenon.

22:58.440 --> 23:00.440
I was going to ask for a clarification.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.680
Oh, it's really, truly haunting.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.040
Does that answer your question?

23:04.040 --> 23:04.680
Yep.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.280
I'm here.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.120
What about rat king coal?

23:12.200 --> 23:14.920
What about me?

23:14.920 --> 23:17.160
That.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.480
It's so it's the rat king, right?

23:19.480 --> 23:21.960
So like five rats with their tails tied together.

23:22.840 --> 23:23.560
Yeah.

23:23.560 --> 23:23.960
Yeah.

23:23.960 --> 23:25.720
But it's rat king coal.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.400
So they're singing that low V.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.960
Yes, yes, or whatever, whatever song that like

23:31.960 --> 23:35.720
rat king coal is known for, but it's five rats sort of

23:35.720 --> 23:40.840
picks our style in a wheel spinning around,

23:40.840 --> 23:43.400
building a tune spinning a yarn.

23:43.400 --> 23:46.920
I like it.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.240
Is there anything to that?

23:49.240 --> 23:51.400
There's maybe like a merch opportunity, but we'd

23:51.400 --> 23:53.480
have to turn it into like an actual bit in the next

23:53.480 --> 23:55.400
probably five-day minutes where people like think

23:55.400 --> 23:57.160
it's really funny.

23:57.160 --> 23:57.720
Interesting.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.560
So like sort of hammer home, the fact that it's an

23:59.560 --> 24:00.920
inside joke of sorts.

24:00.920 --> 24:01.720
Yeah.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.960
It's like, oh, and then, oh, what's rat and then they want it?

24:03.960 --> 24:04.520
Yeah.

24:04.520 --> 24:05.720
And there's like, oh, it's this podcast.

24:05.720 --> 24:06.280
I wasn't too.

24:06.280 --> 24:07.160
They had gun podcast.

24:07.160 --> 24:08.120
They did this bit.

24:08.120 --> 24:09.080
And sometimes they bring it back.

24:09.080 --> 24:09.880
They call back to it.

24:09.880 --> 24:11.320
And it's like this really funny.

24:11.320 --> 24:12.760
You know, play on words sure, but then they

24:12.760 --> 24:14.280
turn it into like a really smart bit.

24:14.280 --> 24:15.640
That's like just kind of funny.

24:15.640 --> 24:17.320
But we didn't do that because it's like, you said,

24:17.320 --> 24:23.640
rat, you said rat king coal, and that was all you had.

24:25.960 --> 24:30.280
As a starting point, and then we can take it from there,

24:31.160 --> 24:34.840
waxing or waiting philosophical about it.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.040
I think there's something there.

24:40.040 --> 24:42.440
And I'll say, I'll say, I'll back a mirror up on that.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.120
We all think there's something there, but it's like,

24:44.120 --> 24:46.120
it's on one of those, so it doesn't matter who, but like,

24:46.120 --> 24:47.720
to kind of take it forward a little bit.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.640
Isn't this your podcast in a way?

24:49.640 --> 24:51.640
Yeah, but that's why I didn't do it by myself.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.760
You know, you can't have a podcast.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.600
You didn't build that.

25:01.640 --> 25:04.600
That was a Barack Obama reference when did you know we know.

25:04.600 --> 25:04.840
Yeah.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.760
He was just saying teamwork makes the dream work.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.040
Basically, what he should have said.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.720
I mean, he said, hold on, I'm getting a call.

25:11.800 --> 25:12.760
There's no way it's important.

25:14.040 --> 25:17.800
I might, I famously might get a call during this podcast.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.280
Yeah, we should also say that a, tell me, you might have a mattress.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.400
You said, Hicked up.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.640
So not even dropped off.

25:25.640 --> 25:27.800
What do you mean picked, who's picking up a mattress?

25:30.040 --> 25:31.080
Also, she's freezing.

25:31.960 --> 25:35.160
Grayson, so we should also say that Grayson edits the video aspect

25:35.160 --> 25:36.040
of the headgon podcast.

25:36.040 --> 25:37.720
So like, this is our worst nightmare.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.080
This is going terribly.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.320
And it's recorded locally on my laptop, which means that

25:41.400 --> 25:43.240
we're not going to get sourced video from her.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.200
Am I still freezing?

25:44.200 --> 25:44.680
I picked up.

25:44.680 --> 25:45.800
Yes, you are.

25:46.760 --> 25:49.240
And we have to power through because otherwise it's going to be harder to edit.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.120
I'm here's on a good.

25:50.120 --> 25:50.520
I'm good right now.

25:51.320 --> 25:52.520
I'm here's on a phone call.

25:52.520 --> 25:52.920
Shelby.

25:52.920 --> 25:53.800
Am I good?

25:53.800 --> 25:55.160
Am I good right now?

25:55.880 --> 25:57.320
Kind of, not really.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.080
I can't tell you why this would be happening.

26:01.080 --> 26:02.120
Do you understand that?

26:03.560 --> 26:04.920
Why you directly anger at me?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.240
Because where else would it go?

26:09.240 --> 26:09.800
You know what I mean?

26:11.320 --> 26:14.200
If you're in Los Angeles on Thursday, I'm back.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.000
Sorry.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.400
I was, I got a, I got a call.

26:20.600 --> 26:23.720
Fairly important when you re-enter from that.

26:24.680 --> 26:29.000
When you re-enter from a call, don't unmute and immediately start talking.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.920
Unmute and listen to see if something else is happening.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.720
Because I was about to just plug Shelby and I show at Lyric Hyperion

26:33.720 --> 26:35.400
on Thursday, March 24th.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.360
I thought you wanted to be your frozen.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.320
I don't live in New York.

26:39.400 --> 26:42.200
I'm going back in a week, not even six days.

26:47.000 --> 26:47.240
Why?

26:52.120 --> 26:59.080
Don't like, there's, all you would chewed you up and spit you out.

26:59.080 --> 27:00.520
You moved in New York for a reason.

27:00.520 --> 27:04.520
There's no reason to, uh, I'm sorry if I'm,

27:04.520 --> 27:07.000
I'm not meaning this to sound like rooted all,

27:07.960 --> 27:11.160
you shouldn't, there's nothing for you here and you shouldn't be here.

27:11.160 --> 27:15.240
You should be, yeah, I mean, if the same thing will happen in New York

27:15.240 --> 27:18.440
and hasn't happened yet, so enjoy that little fucking fantasy

27:18.440 --> 27:22.440
that you're playing out, but I don't see a world where you're not back in Ohio

27:23.400 --> 27:25.640
by the end of this year early next.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.040
Don't, yeah, the show sounds fun.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.240
I guess Shelby feels bad for you in a way.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.080
She definitely doesn't need you to do it.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.160
She, this isn't like the headgump podcast or anything.

27:38.120 --> 27:43.400
And Shelby, I will do the show with you, um, instead, just a sort of

27:43.400 --> 27:48.200
give Jeffrey an out or to give, if you don't want necessarily you have to be there.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.560
You have to come, but he doesn't need to host, obviously.

27:53.560 --> 27:54.280
Oh my god.

27:54.280 --> 27:56.840
We're starting the fucking show all over.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.960
No, we still have to do what we've done.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.120
We're still doing, probably, or not.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.640
Oh, I spun his spin for that diet drive.

28:07.880 --> 28:10.360
Welcome to another edition of the headgump podcast on this week's episode.

28:10.360 --> 28:12.600
We have Grace and Wise, Acric Gay Wise.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.040
We have Shelby, we will soon as an adjective.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.080
Shelby, Jay Westy.

28:16.600 --> 28:17.640
Half an hour in.

28:17.640 --> 28:18.920
Oh, wait, no, that.

28:22.520 --> 28:24.360
Can we have a mirror blue and fell, bringing up the rear?

28:25.000 --> 28:26.760
I think we lost Shelby again, by the way.

28:27.560 --> 28:28.040
Yeah.

28:28.040 --> 28:28.760
Can't hear you, yeah.

28:28.760 --> 28:29.320
This is crazy.

28:29.960 --> 28:30.760
Oh, she's gone.

28:30.760 --> 28:31.800
Yeah, she'll be back.

28:31.880 --> 28:32.840
Just pushing those.

28:32.840 --> 28:37.080
Oh, she can hear about technical difficulties for the name of this episode.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.520
Yeah, we can probably punch it up.

28:40.520 --> 28:42.840
What about, um, hang on.

28:44.440 --> 28:45.320
Am I back?

28:45.320 --> 28:46.360
Yeah, you're back, baby.

28:46.360 --> 28:46.760
You're back.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.800
Who knows why this is happening?

28:49.800 --> 28:52.360
And I can't wait to find out after this recording.

28:52.920 --> 28:57.480
We'll do it during the headgump podcast post game show.

28:58.440 --> 28:59.400
Okay, perfect.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.760
Shelby and I host that and we sort of go over what went wrong and why.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.360
And Wise, with Grace.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.280
So a lot, we, we've been working on gay.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.400
If you guys know any psychologists that want to talk about what's going on with Jeff,

29:09.400 --> 29:13.800
that's been a big thing that we've been trying to hunt down for that podcast.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.000
Let's diagnose him.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.720
Yeah, well, just see what's going on.

29:17.720 --> 29:19.320
I don't want to say diagnose.

29:19.720 --> 29:23.000
He has only child syndrome, but also a sister.

29:23.000 --> 29:23.960
So it doesn't wait.

29:24.840 --> 29:25.800
Makes sense.

29:27.400 --> 29:27.800
Yeah.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.000
Trying to get to the bottom of that.

29:31.320 --> 29:31.960
Your needy.

29:31.960 --> 29:35.160
Some people have supportive friends and I wonder what that feels like.

29:37.000 --> 29:37.640
Co-workers.

29:42.600 --> 29:43.000
Yeah.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.040
What's the, uh,

29:50.360 --> 29:51.480
Shelby, what's the show?

29:52.440 --> 29:54.040
He said Lyric Hyperion.

29:54.040 --> 29:55.000
Jeopardy!

29:56.520 --> 29:57.560
Yeah, Lyric Hyperion.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.280
March 24.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.000
Are you hearing this?

30:04.200 --> 30:05.160
Yeah, we hear you.

30:05.160 --> 30:05.880
Yeah.

30:05.880 --> 30:06.440
Okay.

30:08.520 --> 30:10.760
Welcome to Jeff Hardy's springtime edition.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.200
This, uh, our categories are

30:17.160 --> 30:26.360
Tax Day, dieting ideas, spring break, French nonsense, and, uh, naughty Grayson.

30:30.120 --> 30:30.920
Who starts?

30:32.040 --> 30:33.560
Shelby, you muted yourself.

30:33.560 --> 30:34.280
Who starts?

30:34.920 --> 30:36.120
Let's start with you now.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.720
Diding ideas for 200.

30:39.720 --> 30:40.520
Are you sure?

30:41.720 --> 30:43.560
That one's the hardest one on the board.

30:44.120 --> 30:46.120
Well, that doesn't make sense because of the scoring system.

30:46.920 --> 30:48.120
Diding for 200.

30:48.120 --> 30:50.600
The ideal body fat percentage for Jeff.

30:52.360 --> 30:52.840
I'm here.

30:54.840 --> 30:55.640
Two for that.

30:56.040 --> 30:57.720
That would result in my death.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.320
If I maintain that for more than a day.

31:01.080 --> 31:01.960
15%.

31:04.840 --> 31:05.320
Forty.

31:06.360 --> 31:07.080
Forty.

31:07.080 --> 31:09.000
I would also be at risk five.

31:09.800 --> 31:12.360
The correct answer was what is a hurtful thing to wax about?

31:14.040 --> 31:15.320
Yeah, it's not going to go right.

31:15.320 --> 31:16.280
It's like kind of a game.

31:16.280 --> 31:16.680
It's Jeff.

31:16.680 --> 31:19.080
I forgot to put it in the form of a question.

31:19.720 --> 31:20.920
Why won't you die?

31:21.720 --> 31:24.280
All right, uh, Grayson controls the board for no reason.

31:24.920 --> 31:27.000
Uh, French nonsense for 100, please.

31:27.000 --> 31:27.480
Really?

31:29.480 --> 31:31.560
No, uh, spring break for 200.

31:31.560 --> 31:32.440
Really?

31:35.720 --> 31:37.800
Brace break, have this lunched out.

31:37.800 --> 31:38.200
Yeah.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.120
Bechimi line.

31:43.640 --> 31:44.040
Shelby.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.760
What is the line outside that store?

31:47.880 --> 31:48.440
That's good.

31:49.560 --> 31:50.360
Good. Sure.

31:50.360 --> 31:50.920
But um,

31:52.920 --> 31:55.240
the problem with this game is you have to think how you think,

31:55.240 --> 31:56.840
which is an impossible feat.

31:56.840 --> 31:57.960
That's not an easy act.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.920
In fact, that you think that there's a category of how I would think would be

32:02.040 --> 32:02.920
kind of interesting.

32:03.160 --> 32:04.280
Thank you.

32:06.760 --> 32:07.880
Up, go, Bob, decided.

32:11.880 --> 32:12.680
The kimi line.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.160
Do we all have to guess?

32:19.160 --> 32:20.600
Because that's not, how do you ever do you work?

32:22.440 --> 32:24.440
What does Jeff wax on the rat?

32:24.440 --> 32:25.560
I meant to say on the reg.

32:28.920 --> 32:31.400
What does Jeff wax on the rag is?

32:31.400 --> 32:32.840
These are waxing related.

32:33.240 --> 32:33.560
No.

32:36.920 --> 32:38.680
American trolls are the board,

32:38.680 --> 32:41.240
because he's losing interest and I need to keep his attention.

32:42.360 --> 32:45.080
Let's try wax day for 200.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.440
Oh, sorry, tax day.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.320
Tax day for 200.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.000
Tuesday, April 19th.

32:59.720 --> 33:00.280
What is?

33:03.400 --> 33:09.720
When Jeff will do his taxes and it'll result in him getting elite penalties.

33:09.720 --> 33:10.760
This is crazy.

33:13.320 --> 33:14.840
Yes, that's correct.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.040
Or sorry, I meant to do this.

33:16.840 --> 33:17.400
There you go.

33:17.400 --> 33:18.040
Yeah.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.560
I hate that I got it right.

33:19.560 --> 33:20.760
Yeah, I'm here patrols the board.

33:20.760 --> 33:21.320
Here we go.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.560
You're turning me into you,

33:23.560 --> 33:27.160
because the first step is trying to get me to think like you.

33:27.160 --> 33:28.600
And you're turning me into you.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.440
Yeah, once I'm stuck there,

33:30.440 --> 33:32.360
you can pull some sort of switcheru.

33:33.080 --> 33:36.040
Let's try French nonsense for 100.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.720
French nonsense for 100.

33:37.720 --> 33:39.720
One of France's biggest exports.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.080
Please silence your phones.

33:50.920 --> 33:52.600
I'll ask his 50 minutes out of here,

33:52.600 --> 33:55.400
guys is fucking entire week in this.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.760
You can't even silence your phone.

33:56.760 --> 33:57.800
You can check your phone,

33:57.800 --> 33:59.240
but fucking put it on silence.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.640
What is we forgot to do?

34:05.640 --> 34:06.280
I think we'll be right back.

34:16.280 --> 34:17.080
And we're back.

34:17.080 --> 34:17.880
I'm here.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.120
One of France's biggest exports.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.360
This is French nonsense for 100.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.160
Fucking with Jack Ricker.

34:23.160 --> 34:26.600
Um, sexual confidence.

34:26.600 --> 34:27.480
What is sexual?

34:27.480 --> 34:28.680
C'mon.

34:28.680 --> 34:29.720
Anybody else want to guess?

34:29.720 --> 34:30.440
You don't have to.

34:30.440 --> 34:31.560
According to Grayson.

34:31.560 --> 34:32.520
What is wax?

34:33.560 --> 34:34.520
Hmm.

34:37.240 --> 34:39.720
Was that the first half second of the curb theme song?

34:41.240 --> 34:41.720
I'm sorry.

34:44.760 --> 34:47.400
Wait, was it was that right?

34:48.440 --> 34:53.320
No, it was the first half second of the curb theme song.

34:53.320 --> 34:55.560
Okay, a little sub-jeopardy happening.

34:56.280 --> 34:57.080
Correct.

34:57.080 --> 34:57.960
Double-jeopardy, really?

35:00.760 --> 35:01.560
Grayson.

35:01.640 --> 35:02.600
Anybody's nonsense?

35:05.640 --> 35:06.040
Shelby?

35:07.240 --> 35:11.320
I already guessed wax, given the sort of theme that's been going on.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.320
The cred answer is, what are lazy bricks?

35:16.920 --> 35:17.320
Okay.

35:19.320 --> 35:20.840
All right, Shelby seems upset.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.120
So let's give her control of the board.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.440
Spring break 100.

35:30.440 --> 35:31.480
Spring break for 100.

35:31.480 --> 35:33.000
Payed Patron for sure.

35:34.040 --> 35:35.960
What's Jeff ordering at the bar?

35:35.960 --> 35:37.640
I guess I'll give you that one.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.200
Uh, it's what is the coolest to kill it to own.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.000
I don't want the point.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.120
You wouldn't order that.

35:44.120 --> 35:48.280
Shelby controls the board yet again.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.400
And might I add?

35:50.680 --> 35:51.480
That was easy.

35:57.160 --> 35:59.320
Diding ideas for 100.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.440
Diding ideas for 100.

36:00.440 --> 36:02.840
The best way to shed some LBs.

36:10.840 --> 36:12.840
Move to New York for a couple weeks.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.080
I'm reading it as linebackers and I'm going to say,

36:19.080 --> 36:20.120
what is cut them?

36:20.520 --> 36:21.240
Oh, that's good.

36:21.880 --> 36:22.520
That's good.

36:22.520 --> 36:22.920
That's good.

36:22.920 --> 36:24.520
Incorrect, but I'm going to give it to you.

36:24.520 --> 36:27.880
What is any way that's sustainable and makes you feel good in your body?

36:28.840 --> 36:31.000
Uh, giving it to Grayson just for creativity.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.800
I guess also kind of make the game kind of fair.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.000
Yeah, that's what a Grayson can.

36:37.080 --> 36:38.840
Uh, French nonsense for 300.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.040
French nonsense for 300.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.120
The hardest thing to find in France.

36:42.920 --> 36:44.360
What is not a lazy prick?

36:45.640 --> 36:47.480
Uh, again, I'll give it to him.

36:47.480 --> 36:48.920
It's what is a good time.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.320
What's wrong with France to you?

36:51.320 --> 36:51.880
What's that?

36:51.880 --> 36:55.560
It seems awesome to be there between Paris and like,

36:55.560 --> 36:57.960
when I say what's that, I sometimes can't hear you.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.160
So maybe you say it a little louder.

37:00.920 --> 37:04.440
What did you have a bad time in France once?

37:04.440 --> 37:05.800
Why are you mad at them?

37:05.800 --> 37:07.720
I got yelled at by a shaperum.

37:10.280 --> 37:11.080
A shaperum.

37:11.080 --> 37:12.520
So it's always a high school trip.

37:13.400 --> 37:14.600
It was a high school trip.

37:14.600 --> 37:19.560
It was an extra curricular trip where you could pay money to go on a school trip

37:19.560 --> 37:21.560
to go to France and learn.

37:21.560 --> 37:23.480
It was like immersion, not therapy.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.320
So your shaper isn't a lenders.

37:30.760 --> 37:33.560
Starting a border on what I said this show wasn't going to be today,

37:33.560 --> 37:34.840
which is everybody versus Jeff.

37:34.840 --> 37:35.960
Shelby controls the board.

37:35.960 --> 37:36.920
Let's fucking go.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.760
Was the shaperone French?

37:38.760 --> 37:40.520
She was my French teacher.

37:40.520 --> 37:41.240
And she was like, okay.

37:41.240 --> 37:42.600
Fucking delight in class.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.600
And then suddenly she thought that I did something that I didn't do.

37:44.600 --> 37:45.400
I don't even remember what it was.

37:45.400 --> 37:46.440
But she pulled me aside.

37:46.440 --> 37:47.480
She yelled at me.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.880
And I said, oh, that, like, that's, I didn't do that.

37:49.880 --> 37:51.800
That wasn't, even if I did, I would never do that.

37:52.600 --> 37:53.240
Right?

37:53.240 --> 37:55.240
All right, spring break for 300.

37:55.400 --> 37:56.520
This is fucked.

37:56.520 --> 37:57.720
Spring break for 300.

37:57.720 --> 38:01.400
Watching spring breakers from afar because you went to Punta Kana by himself.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.200
Who is Jeff?

38:03.400 --> 38:04.040
That's correct.

38:04.040 --> 38:06.360
It's what is Jeff's favorite spring break memory.

38:06.360 --> 38:07.720
Shelby controls the board.

38:07.720 --> 38:10.360
Just a little score update for our audio listeners.

38:10.360 --> 38:12.680
Grayson and Shelby tie for first and 400.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.760
Amir Blumenfeld bring up the rear 200.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.520
Which, by the way, that means he mirrors in third place,

38:16.520 --> 38:18.760
because when there's a tie, you have to skip the next one.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.440
French nonsense for 200.

38:23.400 --> 38:24.600
French nonsense for 200.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.520
A French tradition.

38:26.520 --> 38:27.240
Yelling a Jeff.

38:33.960 --> 38:37.640
What is, and again, I'm just quoting Jeff quote,

38:37.640 --> 38:39.320
being a lazy prick.

38:39.320 --> 38:40.840
But that's not actually what I think.

38:47.480 --> 38:48.120
Ask cargo.

38:48.680 --> 38:49.800
I'll give you that one.

38:49.800 --> 38:50.280
Oh, sorry.

38:51.080 --> 38:51.640
What?

38:51.720 --> 38:53.320
What is smelling like utter ass?

38:55.880 --> 38:57.160
I don't want points for that.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.000
Grayson just wants to go over it.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.360
Diding ideas for 300.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.640
It's interesting that we've been wholly avoiding.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.400
No, he won't be run out of time.

39:11.400 --> 39:14.840
I think Grayson's the only one that can say naughty Grayson's.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.200
Diding ideas for 300.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.640
Nice beach body.

39:22.600 --> 39:27.400
What is something Jeff's never heard in his life?

39:27.400 --> 39:31.560
Because he's constantly struggling with the ability

39:31.560 --> 39:34.600
to consistently exercise or some shit like that.

39:39.160 --> 39:41.240
What is any body that you're comfortable in?

39:41.240 --> 39:43.640
That's the best.

39:43.640 --> 39:45.480
Oh, the points, but that's incorrect.

39:45.480 --> 39:48.280
Oh, I thought that based on your last one, I thought it was going to be right.

39:52.600 --> 39:53.960
What is what a mirror has?

39:56.600 --> 40:00.760
We were looking for what is an inappropriate thing for Jeff to send a Casey Donahue.

40:00.760 --> 40:03.320
One of the headgums newest hires over Slack.

40:03.320 --> 40:04.520
Private message, by the way.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.800
Yeah, that would be.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.160
Yeah, that was.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.280
Shelby controls the board.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.560
Okay, seems crazy.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.880
Tax day for 100.

40:19.960 --> 40:23.240
Tax day for 100, aiming low, Monday, April 18th.

40:23.240 --> 40:25.400
When Jeff should have done his taxes, bye.

40:25.400 --> 40:27.320
I'll give you that. It's when his tax day.

40:29.080 --> 40:31.080
Shelby's still controls the board.

40:33.080 --> 40:34.600
Tax day for 300.

40:34.600 --> 40:35.800
Tax day for three young.

40:36.600 --> 40:37.400
I nine.

40:40.840 --> 40:41.800
A form.

40:41.800 --> 40:44.840
Uh, what is how a nine year old tells you how old.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.200
That was to Shelby Grayson, let's hear it.

40:46.760 --> 40:49.480
What is how a nine year old tells you his age?

40:50.040 --> 40:54.120
I'll give you that.

40:54.120 --> 40:54.760
It's close enough.

40:54.760 --> 40:57.080
It's actually one of the ideal initials to have.

40:58.040 --> 40:58.840
No way.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.360
What would that person's name be?

41:01.320 --> 41:02.680
Isaiah nine.

41:03.800 --> 41:06.520
You have to be like Elon Musk.

41:06.520 --> 41:17.240
So I say, I say, and then the number nine, but initialize, it would be the number.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.160
Yeah.

41:20.440 --> 41:21.400
Isaiah nine.

41:21.400 --> 41:21.800
I see.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.600
So worst time to control the board.

41:24.600 --> 41:27.640
Isaiah, yeah, Grayson controls the board.

41:27.640 --> 41:30.520
Let's, uh, could I have, could I have naughty for 100?

41:30.520 --> 41:31.960
Not a Grayson 200.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.480
Got pegs probably.

41:36.040 --> 41:37.160
Who is Johnny Villa?

41:39.880 --> 41:40.600
In fact.

41:48.200 --> 41:51.960
40 minutes of silence.

41:53.960 --> 41:56.120
Is the answer just Grayson?

41:56.120 --> 41:57.320
I'll give you that one.

41:57.320 --> 42:01.640
Shelby, uh, the answer is we were like, what did Grayson do on his 21st birthday?

42:01.640 --> 42:02.680
Okay.

42:04.520 --> 42:05.560
Shelby controls the board.

42:06.280 --> 42:07.720
By the way, score out of it.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.480
Shelby and Grayson neck and neck.

42:09.480 --> 42:11.320
Grayson in 1st with 900 Shelby.

42:11.320 --> 42:15.400
And second with 800, it's impossible at this point for a year to catch up.

42:16.360 --> 42:19.480
I want to defer my choice to amere.

42:19.480 --> 42:20.360
This is Grayson.

42:20.360 --> 42:27.320
I'm here control, let's go, uh, and G for 200.

42:28.600 --> 42:37.240
That's not a category on which one of me naughty for 2, not what Grayson for 200.

42:40.680 --> 42:41.080
All right.

42:41.080 --> 42:44.040
Because the second bedroom is his red room, so to speak.

42:46.360 --> 42:48.680
Why does Grayson live in a 2 bedroom?

42:48.680 --> 42:50.040
That's correct.

42:51.080 --> 42:54.680
That's a 2 that we've actually gotten word for word today.

42:54.680 --> 42:56.280
Shelby, how many of you know that?

42:57.480 --> 42:58.760
That it context close.

42:59.880 --> 43:03.000
Not a Grayson for 300 did E probably.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.240
What did Grayson do for his 22nd birthday?

43:08.920 --> 43:10.040
Incorrect, but close.

43:10.680 --> 43:13.160
What did Grayson do for his 21st birthday?

43:15.640 --> 43:16.920
Incorrect, but in colder.

43:18.040 --> 43:20.200
What did Grayson do for his 30th birthday?

43:23.240 --> 43:24.280
Right track, though.

43:27.720 --> 43:28.520
Wait, who?

43:28.520 --> 43:29.960
I can't because Grayson you're 26.

43:29.960 --> 43:30.920
5 26.

43:30.920 --> 43:31.800
I'm 25.

43:31.800 --> 43:34.680
Oh, what did Grayson do for his 25th birthday?

43:34.680 --> 43:35.400
26.

43:36.840 --> 43:38.040
Just like us, yeah.

43:40.360 --> 43:41.320
27.

43:41.320 --> 43:41.960
28.

43:43.160 --> 43:44.360
It's past tense.

43:44.360 --> 43:45.240
It's past tense.

43:47.320 --> 43:47.880
18.

43:50.440 --> 43:53.000
What happened the night Grayson's future?

43:54.200 --> 43:55.320
Herobard.

43:55.320 --> 43:56.680
Concealed for child.

43:58.680 --> 43:59.960
Stop it.

44:02.520 --> 44:04.040
Oh, Lord.

44:04.040 --> 44:04.760
Come on.

44:05.880 --> 44:08.840
What did Grayson do for his 24th birthday?

44:08.840 --> 44:10.120
Correct.

44:10.120 --> 44:11.320
That was easy.

44:12.120 --> 44:17.400
That's going to conclude for lack of better term, Jeopardy.

44:22.440 --> 44:26.360
And I'm going to call it Jeopardy.

44:26.360 --> 44:27.000
Jeopardy.

44:27.000 --> 44:27.640
I misspoke.

44:33.880 --> 44:36.600
That was Jeopardy.

44:37.560 --> 44:42.280
She'll be one with a thousand points.

44:44.440 --> 44:46.440
I have a hundred and seventy dollars in my bank account,

44:46.440 --> 44:48.440
so I cannot spend more you than a thousand dollars,

44:48.440 --> 44:51.000
but let's just act like it was a fun time.

44:54.360 --> 44:56.280
Sorry, she's fucking Christ.

45:00.600 --> 45:01.640
Plugs.

45:01.640 --> 45:02.360
What do you guys have going on?

45:02.360 --> 45:04.120
What do you want to point to people to the floor?

45:04.120 --> 45:07.880
All of yours, let's go at once and then I'll somehow edit it out.

45:07.880 --> 45:14.440
So that is kind of linear, because she'll be as a hard out in a minute and a half.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.720
Three, two, one, all at once.

45:19.560 --> 45:20.600
Check out.

45:20.600 --> 45:21.640
Get what's the background.

45:21.640 --> 45:22.840
Yes, I chose.

45:23.640 --> 45:25.800
I have somebody who's a lot Gaston.

45:25.800 --> 45:28.040
I know you're not a fan of Dungeons and Dragons.

45:28.040 --> 45:29.400
I know you're a Gaston.

45:29.400 --> 45:32.440
And then the inferior dungeon you'll show.

45:32.440 --> 45:33.480
I should get some point.

45:34.440 --> 45:35.640
Television shows.

45:35.640 --> 45:36.440
Movie.

45:36.440 --> 45:37.160
I hear anything.

45:37.160 --> 45:38.440
I should fucking post.

45:38.440 --> 45:41.000
There's something so just DM me, because I'm one way.

46:00.200 --> 46:01.880
That was a hit them original.

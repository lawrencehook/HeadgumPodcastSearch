00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
No music is playing.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
No music is playing, right?

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Tuesday October 4th, it's a moment in time.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
They will always remember, because it's the debut of Anja.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Not Taylor Joy.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
But here I go.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Kenneth Skya.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
That was beautiful, Jeff. Thank you.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
I've never said your last name.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Out loud or typed it.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
There's no reason to.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Did I nail it?

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Yeah, you did really good.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Yes.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
I want to congratulate you on taking a chance on me finally.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
As a guest, we're saying my name.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
As a guest.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Yeah.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
Anja, chided me after the head-gum happy hour because I'd never invited her on.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
I didn't think you wanted to be on the show.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Why wouldn't I want to be on the show?

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
I had a specific member of you saying never invite me on the show.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Something to the effect are like, keep me away from this shit.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
Well, it is because you invite people on their first week working here.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
That's true.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
It's like a some sort of hazing ritual.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
My onboarding process at head-gum was short, but almost every person told me to be careful about this.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
So maybe that's really when you can't be.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
You might have said people told me to be careful about this.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
And then I telephoned that in my mind into meaning you didn't want to be on the show.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
But here we are.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
We've got a great show planned.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
I'm stressed as hell. How are you guys feeling?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Sorry, heck.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
I'm just thinking about someone commented recently on the head-gum podcast.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
I assume you too, but I don't know where else I would've been reading comments.

02:04.000 --> 02:14.000
And it was like someone needs to teach this show that number one rule of podcasting is that you don't name the date that you record.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
No, it's to keep it timeless.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Evergreen.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
We definitely at this point it's like a bit for sure, but I mean, I think of that every time.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
Any podcast convention ideally is broken during this hour.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
So yeah, it's Tuesday, October 4th at 3.24 pm.

02:39.000 --> 02:48.000
You're hearing this on whenever you're listening to it, but at the earliest, October 7th at 1 a.m. Pacific.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
I mean, I think it's good because what if you say something like problematic and something happens.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Yeah.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
At least Wayne.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
What?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Sorry.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
I was really distracted by my own video.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Oh, I see it.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
There's a lot of claims going overhead for me recently.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
We got to figure this shit out, guys.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
On just the only one bringing the heat today.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
I'm sorry.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Ali, I know you're just kind of gearing up, but Maria, you're fucking up.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
Can I say, can I tell you as a secret?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Yeah.

03:17.000 --> 03:26.000
Right before I hopped in the Zoom, I put five tick tags in my mouth, and I can't chew them.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Or it's going to be really loud in my microphone.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
So I'm just kind of like squirling away tick tags until they dissolve.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Or orange or green.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Winter green.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
I have to say in my anticipation of how this would go, I didn't think Maria could be this chaotic.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
This is different.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Yeah.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
That's fair.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Maria.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Is it just today?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Wow.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
I've been on so, so many calls today.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Ali, on at least two of them.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Two more.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
I don't know.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
And we keep running into each other.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
When you guys are on calls, are you guys actively engaging your brains?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Or are you sometimes turning them off?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Like, what do you find more exhausting?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Calls are not.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Calls.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Calls.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
For sure.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Definitely.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
I do my best when I don't feel I'm being perceived.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Like any good science experiment.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
You are the control.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
This is you at your lowest.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Immediately change everything.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
One to five has everybody feeling, because I think I'm at a two or one.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Probably.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Like a three.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Probably worse.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Yeah.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
On you.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
I'm going to lie and say I'm out of five, so that I can kind of have that on your

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
G for the rest of the show.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Man, if that's for yourself.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
What's the real answer?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I would say two point five.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Okay.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
That's good.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
That's not good.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
It's not good or bad.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Like, if you're doing above a three in the world today.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Yeah.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
So is your path?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Come on.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
I'm like at a two point five, too.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
I'll two, T-O-O.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
You're right.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Okay.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
So I thought it was like, you added a decimal point.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
No, not like trying to be edgy with my numbers.

05:27.000 --> 05:38.000
Honestly, the thing just tipping me up to the three is like the fact that once I'm done with this, my work days over, but you guys have at least two more hours.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Yeah.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I have to edit this immediately after.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
So it's five more hours probably.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
And by my work days over, I mean, I will just lay on my couch with the TV on, but also still do it works.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
You know, watching the TV or maybe.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Green dot on Slack.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
From right go, always.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Um.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Tomorrow is Yom Kippur.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Um.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
I thought Amir was going to be on this episode or any of you guys Jewish.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Okay.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Great.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
So Yom wears the day of atonement, right?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Yeah.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
So I thought we could wax about what the worst atonement.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Yeah.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Sorry.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
You think you can go in here and I leave?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
No.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
I know.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Sorry.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
I was just thinking about the library scene.

06:33.000 --> 06:40.000
Yeah.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
No, I thought we could talk about like what the worst thing we did in the last week was.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
And then we could have done for it.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
I can start just because it's hard to admit wrongdoing.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
What was it actually?

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
I think it was this morning and this was an accident.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
But I had a meeting with Connie about a gum ball blog post at 11.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
And I set my alarm for what I thought was 10 30 a.m.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
10 30 p.m.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
So I woke up at 11.08.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I immediately got on the zoom.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
So I was only 8 or 9 minutes late.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
But I did waste 10 minutes of her time.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
And I kind of spiraled about that afterwards.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
And I never miss.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I said, I'm so sorry.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I set my alarm for what I thought was 10 a.m.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
But it was actually 10 30 p.m.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
I am so sorry.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Ring late.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
This is a horrible first impression.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
What do you need?

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
Was it hard for you to understand or like to kind of gauge how much to apologize for

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
because then you're wasting more of her time in the apology?

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
It was a very efficient apology.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
I would say.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
And she didn't.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
That was it.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
And she didn't seem to care all that much.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
She kind of chuckled.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
But the chuckle was also an acknowledgement

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
that it was a bad first impression.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
So that's I would like to say formally.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Connie, if you're listening, which isn't.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
I'm sorry.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Yet again, for wasting your time.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Your energy, your value.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
On my over sleeping dumb ass.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
It's really kind of you.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah, I guess it is.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
That was really big of you to oversleep.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
It was brave.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Yeah.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Is that what you said?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I said big.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Like big.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Well, why?

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
And I'm sure moral come up.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Maybe for every one that you guys do all the tone for something else bad

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
that I did last week.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Anybody else want to take it away.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
In terms of repentance.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
I can do it.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
I had to have people over my house this weekend.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Well, describing hosting as I had to add people over.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
If I had a choice, I wouldn't have.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
But I did have to do it.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
And I don't.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I guess because I'm Jewish.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
I was like, I don't want to pay for a bunch of beer.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Everybody else is going to bring beer.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Then there's going to be a bunch of beer left over.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I don't want to deal with kind of any of this.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
I don't want to invest any money in this event.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
So I went to the head come offices on Saturday.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
And I took beer from our fridge.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Oh.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Yeah.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Thank you.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
And that's just beer.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Well.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Was it near Genset?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
I took some near Genset.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And I also took some new Belgium.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
That was donated for the headgum happy hour.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
That we had so much left over.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
That I don't want to shit.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I actually don't appreciate it.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
They assortment that you laid out.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
It should be near Genset.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Narraganset.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Narraganset.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Maybe a canned Amaro spritz.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
But if it's beer, we're talking Gensets.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
I do love Genset as a new Adam person.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Of course.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
However, I had to like impress people.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
So I wanted to make sure that like cool people saw the Narraganset.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
And then like my neighbors.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I want them to think I'm like an adult.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Like fancy IPA.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
And nobody drank any of it.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Which is the thing.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
You're being environmentally conscious.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
I don't think anybody can fault you for that.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Thank you.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Do I have to apologize to someone specifically like you did?

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
I'd love if you could apologize to me for including new Belgium.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
I get your reasoning, but I would really appreciate that.

10:29.000 --> 10:37.000
No, I am sorry, Jeff, for diluting the experience of my party that I didn't want to have.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
And you know what, immediate forgiveness.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
That's what it's all about.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
You're from New England too.

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
I've never been challenged like this in front of people.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
I'm not from New England, but I live there for enough time.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
You don't claim it though.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
I would like to, but I don't think I lived there long enough.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
That's what I was going to say.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
No, so mean.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Actually, I take it back.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
I'm from New England.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Just because I'm Jeff, saying that.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I feel like why is it left, Mark?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Hmm, for sure.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Yeah, you definitely don't scream Savannah.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
No, I don't have a southern accent.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Really at all.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
You sort of have a northeastern draw, though.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
At least I have a Boston accent.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Can you imagine?

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
I have one word that I say rum.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Oh God.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Yeah.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
What about bag?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Is it bag or bag?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
No bag is regular.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Roof is regular.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
I think it's just rum.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
And then when I say rotary or whatever people are like, what are you talking about?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
How often are you saying rotary?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Often enough.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Like a rotary spell.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
No, like a rotary spell.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Around about.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Oh.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
That's rotary.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Well.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I forgive you for the new Belgians.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Atonement is about forgiveness closure.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Close.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Sorry.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Real quick.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Are you Jewish, Jeff?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
What's that?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Are you Jewish?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Uh-uh.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I let's know a lot of rum does.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
I'm probably closest to a Zen Buddhist.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Okay.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
I have the book.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Okay.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Be here now.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Yeah, it's like right here.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
That's great.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
I have a dick out.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
So.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Great.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
I just wanted to kind of state that for the record for anyone who's listening.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
It doesn't know whether or not the person kind of giving us forgiveness on the show.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
It's really weird.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Oh, shit.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
No, no, no.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
I truly just.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
No.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
I just, I wanted to know for me in front of anyone listening.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
No.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
And I, that's, it's important to state.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
But, um, you know, Jake, if you want to strike that from record.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Um.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Let's see.

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
Who have I wronged in this past week?

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
Um, I, I told a lie.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
I don't know if I really wronged.

13:16.000 --> 13:23.000
But I, I, so I, I lied to someone at, uh, the, this car repair shop.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I need to get my car taken in.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Someone backed into me.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
That part is truthful while I was parked.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
And this lady who gave me the estimate.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
She texted me and needed a picture of my car registration.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
So she could do the billing.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
And I didn't feel like doing that and said, I, I, so I said, I'm sorry.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
I'm a way for my car at the moment.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
Can I do this when I take my car into the shop?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
I don't want to, I don't want to text you a picture.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
And she said, sure.

13:49.000 --> 13:58.000
A ton of time.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
A ton of time.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
A ton of.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Oh, you are down.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Okay.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
That's it.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Um.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
That's fine.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
It's fine.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Yeah.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
It's fine.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
But who do you want to apologize to, specifically?

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Uh, Natalie at Collider Collision.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
I'm really sorry that I, I was, I didn't want to walk to my car and take a picture when you asked.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
I'm really sorry.

14:21.000 --> 14:27.000
Collider Collision is the same name for an olive body shop.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
I know.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
And I felt really bad too because I have a sister named Natalie.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
And I thought, Oh, God.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
That's not good.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Not good.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
No, it's not good.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
It's not good when you lie to someone who's,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
imagine a big leave from earlier.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Imagine if Jeff added her to the zoom.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
How did you know?

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
How would you feel if Natalie was backstage right now?

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
I think the one we've all been waiting for Maria could Brownlee.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
I'm going to be the biggest rat scoundrel.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
It's kind of on the zoom.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Yeah.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
I definitely am a scoundrel in a scallywag.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Um.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Kind of a scamp for sure.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Or at least a scampy.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
There was a foster there.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Sure.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
It's giving shrimp.

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
I would like to apologize to the three of you.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
Um, because I was a few minutes late to the zoom.

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
And it was because I was in line at CVS to buy candy corn.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
And for that, I am sorry.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
This girl is on fire.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
I forgive Maria.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
What about you guys?

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
I have to give a apology of my own from Maria.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
You message me right before this.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
And I ignored what you asked.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
And I owe you an answer.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
And I know that.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
And it's kind of.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
I'm going to be thinking about it this whole time.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Oh, please.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Please don't let me out of this whole time.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
It's okay.

15:55.000 --> 16:01.000
I knew that you were busy when I sent it to you because you asked for 15 more minutes before this recording.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
So.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Don't.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
You're forgiven.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
But it's not your fault.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
That's I think we did a lot here.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
You know, it's only seven minutes.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
But I think that I feel a way to lift it off my chest.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
And I have candy corn now.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Oh.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
It is that time of the year.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Should we talk about Halloween?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
How do you guys feel about it?

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Hate it.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Really.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
On you and I.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
We both learned that we don't like.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Costumes.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Right.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Yeah.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I have like lots of reasons.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I don't know if we want to get into it.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Well, let's get into it.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Yeah.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Um.

16:37.000 --> 16:44.000
Up up top, I guess, is that I've always had a fear of people in full cost it.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Like, check each cheese.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
I used to cry when you.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I call it all the other little kids would run to him.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
And I would just be like hanging back with the parents.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
They'd be like, no, go say hi.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
And I'd be like, I'm actually okay.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
I'm good.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Literally me.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Yeah.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Um, because like, who's under there?

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Like, I knew.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Like, there's no, no good person could possibly.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
I had no.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
No.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
My reasoning wasn't even that deep.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
I just didn't like, I like how big they were.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
I don't like them.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I don't like people on stilts.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Yeah.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Me.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Um.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Also, my brother was Chuck E.T.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Is at one point.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
So at that point, I was like, too old to be scared.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
I'm sorry.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Just said that my brother.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
No.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Bureka's brother's a piece of shit.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
He's a human garbage.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Reincarnate incarnate.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Um.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
But I think the Halloween thing more importantly is like,

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
I don't think, I'm like, if you want to be weird and crazy, you can be weird and crazy

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
year round.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
You don't have to like have your one night where you get to like really let loose.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
And you know what I mean?

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
I feel like people get this like evil energy.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Like, not like Satanic, but like people are like,

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
Oh, this is my one night of the year where I'm like,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I'm gonna become a different version of myself.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
And it's like just be who you are.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
365.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
You don't have to like, let it all out on Halloween.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
But wouldn't that be an argument for Halloween that you don't like people in full

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
costume.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
And if that's who people are like if they would be doing it round the clock,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
that they get it all out on one night.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
And you can just kind of have a night in.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
But I don't, I guess on Halloween when you go out, you don't see,

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
you see people just like being in a complete different version of themselves.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
And you're just like, you could just be this person,

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
if this is who you want to be.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
You can live a little bit.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Weird air like.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
That's, that's, I can agree with that.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I might be Marieka for Halloween.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
How?

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
I probably do like the, well, I need the phone case with like the Jake Gillen Hall pop out.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
I would need glasses that look similar to it now.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
But okay, Robert Pattinson.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
But then you could just send me the Jake Gillen Hall when it's the same thing.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
You know, it's like season one, Marieka, whatever.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Hair back in a ponytail instead of an bun.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
Some kind of pop culture reference graphic tea or sweatshirt.

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
And shoes that I medically have to wear for my back.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
That's so hard.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I don't.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
She wears normal shoes.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
Yeah.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Sorry.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
This is where this is taking a turn.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
Would you put it like a playbell in your,

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
and a playbell sticking out of my back pocket?

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
Or more specifically, but rush tickets, I should say.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Yeah.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Yeah.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
That's cool.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Are you going to tuck me to the theater when she was here?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
And a trivia trophy.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
True.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Although we don't really get trophies.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
We haven't won really up.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Yes.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
We never discussed how was, how was the play?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I had a great time.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
We had a great time.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
We were almost late.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
But you know, it's LA's track.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
It's LA traffic.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Good wild.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I told, at least I was about.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
I will say, our night was almost ruined by those people in costume.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
How's that.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
The people on the stage?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
No.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
People in the audience.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
This isn't about you.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
But where people in cowboy bats.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
It was.

20:07.000 --> 20:15.000
I felt like a trial of divorce because I was with Casey in the, on your pick me up.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
And I went to the theater.

20:18.000 --> 20:24.520
I loved it. I was great. I love Oklahoma. I had a great time. I'm

20:24.520 --> 20:31.640
left to see it in a different setting with different staging. Cast was great.

20:31.640 --> 20:38.240
That the score, those orchestrations, my Daniel Cougar, beautiful, should have

20:38.240 --> 20:42.360
won the Tony Award. My friend was the assistant director, not to

20:42.360 --> 20:57.960
brag about it. Of the show? I'm fine about it. I don't love being scared and

20:57.960 --> 21:03.320
I'm not interested in that adrenaline rush. I'm not someone that you should take

21:03.320 --> 21:09.360
to the Halloween horror nights or whatever. I don't care. That's not how I like to

21:09.360 --> 21:16.120
live my life. But I don't like the terms spooky season, but I love I don't

21:16.120 --> 21:22.520
like that, but I love Christina Ritchie and Adam's family values. Okay. And I love

21:22.520 --> 21:30.080
some of the things like that. Adam's. Yeah, yeah. I love a camp nod to the spirit of

21:30.080 --> 21:34.480
Halloween. Do you guys like over the garden wall? Have we talked about the

21:34.600 --> 21:40.800
love over the garden wall? Have you watched it? It's this cartoon network mini

21:40.800 --> 21:47.560
series, but it's more, it's pretty like, it's not for kids. It's not for kids, but

21:47.560 --> 21:53.680
it's kind of dark and it is not scary, but spooky. Sorry to use that word. And it's

21:53.680 --> 21:58.680
just great. There's music in it. The music's really good. Sometimes it's funny.

21:58.680 --> 22:04.520
It's one of the voices. Yeah. Oh, that's really, it's really, really good. I made my

22:04.520 --> 22:12.520
question for Lloyd. Oh, love that guy. Is he still alive? Yeah. Yeah. That's nice.

22:12.520 --> 22:21.000
The hacker from Cyber Chase. We came also. Sorry. Oh, no, you go. You go. Oh, he came to a

22:21.000 --> 22:28.480
middle school play of line once. Really? I don't know why it was in Cleveland. Not

22:28.480 --> 22:33.040
for you. Well, might have been a little bit, you know, maybe might not have come for

22:33.040 --> 22:35.760
me, but he stayed for me. You know what I mean? He probably came for his like, you know,

22:35.760 --> 22:44.480
grandson or whatever. Is that why he wants to? Yeah. Sort of like went to attack you. Yeah,

22:44.480 --> 22:50.800
he lunged it my eyes. And that's part of the reason why they're always so blood shut. So

22:51.760 --> 22:58.640
it was physically accustomed. Lloyd, um, that was the first Lloyd night I ever experienced.

23:00.160 --> 23:09.520
Wow. Allie, you're saying. Oh, I was going to say Chuck Eachie's had a memory

23:09.520 --> 23:14.320
flash into my mind. Did you guys have to take consumer education in high school? Ever as a

23:14.320 --> 23:20.320
class where they teach you how to like fill out a W2? No, that's so I'm sorry. We were just

23:20.320 --> 23:25.040
talking with this last week that that's what we need. Really? Yeah. So I had a, I don't remember any

23:25.040 --> 23:31.360
of it. I wish I did, but we had a class called consumer ed and there was one project that was all

23:31.360 --> 23:37.520
about stocks and you had to pick companies and they gave you fake money and you had to like

23:37.520 --> 23:43.920
track the stocks every day and do a report and everybody in my class. Yeah. And which, by the way,

23:43.920 --> 23:51.200
I had a mildly lucrative store, um, of course you did. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, but that's for another

23:51.200 --> 23:58.240
circle back. Yeah. But, uh, I put, everybody else took it so seriously and I put 100% of my money

23:58.240 --> 24:05.200
in Chuck Eachie's and every, every day, the stocks got lower. It wasn't doing well and so my entire

24:05.200 --> 24:10.400
project was just being like, um, my teacher was like, take it, take your money out, do something else

24:10.400 --> 24:15.280
and I refused. I committed to the bed. Damn. I think that's admirable. So that's just what

24:15.280 --> 24:20.400
that made me think of. How do you think those products are doing now? Like, we'll now that my fake

24:20.400 --> 24:27.360
funds aren't in there. Even worse. Um, we do have to take a quick break, but we'll be right back

24:27.360 --> 24:34.400
with something even scarier than what we've been talking about. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

24:34.480 --> 24:41.120
Yeah. Guys, lately I've been listening to a lot of the velvet underground, right? And it's

24:41.120 --> 24:46.560
great. And one reason it's been great to listen to is because I listened to it on my rake on

24:46.560 --> 24:52.800
wireless earbuds. All right. Rake on's every day. Your buds look feel and sound better than ever

24:52.800 --> 24:59.040
with optimized gel tips for the perfect inner fit. I've been walking around a lot with them in my

24:59.040 --> 25:08.240
ears, walking up hills, streets, sidewalks. And they don't budge. They really don't trust me on this one.

25:08.240 --> 25:13.600
Rake on's give you eight hours of playtime with a 32-hour battery life. I find myself charging

25:13.600 --> 25:20.400
these things way less than other leading brands that I've used before. Rake on's are also price just

25:20.400 --> 25:24.880
right. All right. It's really easy to lose these those little earbud things, right? And if you're

25:24.880 --> 25:30.640
going to have to re-up every couple years or months or whatever, why not get it at half the price,

25:30.640 --> 25:35.920
right, of other premium audio brands. It's no wonder Rake on's every day earbuds have over 50,000

25:35.920 --> 25:42.880
five-star reviews. I really love, like I said, the inner fit. It really is just right because you

25:42.880 --> 25:50.480
have multiple sized earbud gel tip things. You can also customize the sound profiles. So if you're

25:50.560 --> 25:54.560
listening to podcasts, you can keep it on the normal mode. If you need to be able to hear your

25:54.560 --> 25:59.760
surroundings, you can use this awareness mode. And then there's like a base boosting one. It's just

25:59.760 --> 26:06.320
overall really nice, very high-fi, and I love music. So I love Rake on. So we're going to buy

26:06.320 --> 26:13.440

26:13.520 --> 26:21.120

26:21.120 --> 26:24.000
Code. What's that 15? Thanks Rake on.

26:44.400 --> 27:00.800
Welcome to Real or Fake Gun Edition. This is a game where I'm going to show you, or sorry,

27:00.800 --> 27:07.360
the game's actually called Was This Game Gun 3D Printed. Been in the news recently.

27:08.000 --> 27:17.120
Because that's, I said the title wrong. The title of the segment is Was This Gun 3D Printed. This

27:17.120 --> 27:26.320
was concocted by my friend Eli, actually. So I wanted to get his title credit. But yeah,

27:26.320 --> 27:33.840
lots of news stories recently about 3D Printed Guns. It's a real issue. So I thought that we could

27:33.920 --> 27:39.760
see if we have a trained eye for spotting this stuff. Number one, this is just to get us warmed up.

27:41.760 --> 27:49.840
Fake. Correct. Fake. That's going to be an improv real.

27:49.840 --> 27:59.920
Real or fake? Fake. Well, it is really nerve gun.

28:02.320 --> 28:06.400
Modded. Maria, please. Telling on yourself with that.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.760
I turned my camera my entire what page just read it.

28:13.760 --> 28:22.480
There's a Mr. Beastberger bag in the background. This is a real gun.

28:23.120 --> 28:25.680
Yeah, I had this is a real gun.

28:27.520 --> 28:30.880
Are we not going to, is this the first time you've had all women on the head of gun pod?

28:30.880 --> 28:34.960
Just wondering. I don't think so. Okay. Just wondering about that. If you're doing the gun,

28:34.960 --> 28:40.240
bit kind of the first time you have all of them. I just thought we did an alley Caleb Maria

28:40.240 --> 28:45.760
episode once. But I might be wrong. All right. No, probably. Maybe we did.

28:46.960 --> 28:56.480
Wait, so go back to that gun. It was in fact a modded Nerf gun or yeah, it was a modded Nerf gun.

28:56.480 --> 28:59.600
You're exactly right. You can't even say that you're going to be put on a watch list.

29:00.480 --> 29:06.960
Really fake. Was this gun 3D printed?

29:08.160 --> 29:15.600
It's a different game. So the last one was not 3D printed. It was a modded. I think this is real.

29:15.600 --> 29:24.560
It says it's made in Austria. That's a real gun correct. Covered in Lagos. Was this gun 3D printed?

29:24.640 --> 29:31.040
Really fake. Yes. It was really printed. Yes. It was 3D printed. That's correct. That was 3D printed. Was this 3D printed?

29:32.640 --> 29:36.720
No, by God. It doesn't count. Which God?

29:38.560 --> 29:50.800
Jewish God today. Yahweh. Yeah. Was this gun 3D printed? Yes. Yes. It was. Was this gun 3D printed? No.

29:51.040 --> 29:56.320
Yes. Are all glocks made in Austria? I think we're learning that.

29:57.200 --> 30:02.640
I think it was not. You guys' attention to detail is making this game way easier.

30:04.320 --> 30:16.080
Was this gun 3D printed? Yes. No, no, no. I've heard you say no, but I was voting. No.

30:16.080 --> 30:21.120
This is a real gun. Okay, I voted. Yes, and I'm wrong. And I own it. You can see what's 3D printed.

30:21.120 --> 30:28.800
Oh, I thought you meant you owned the gun. Well, sometimes there's better 3D printers that are like they that don't have that pattern.

30:28.800 --> 30:34.160
I've been looking for. So I thought maybe it was one of them. Oh, but for now for guns. I just don't know.

30:35.440 --> 30:43.600
Was this gun 3D printed? Yes. No. No. It was. I know.

30:44.480 --> 30:52.560
Was this gun 3D printed? I know. Yeah. How so? Like by air.

30:53.760 --> 31:00.400
Where you get, do you think I'm sorry we do this, but do you think balloons are 3D printed? That's latex man.

31:02.320 --> 31:11.520
Is air 3D? No. I know what it is. That's a whole other segment that we should do next week.

31:11.520 --> 31:20.640
Is air 3D? And then just discuss. Yeah. A real rom-doss moment. Was this gun 3D printed? Sure.

31:21.520 --> 31:30.160
Yeah, I'm going to say that. It was. Was this gun 3D printed? Yes. No. It was not.

31:30.160 --> 31:37.360
Onions really get at this game. Was this gun looking for it? That's the pattern. It's just brain.

31:37.360 --> 31:42.160
It's what you're looking for. No, no. If it's 3D printed, like you won't see the metal won't look like metal.

31:43.040 --> 31:52.080
Oh, I'm just looking for Austria. And also, I mean, you know, with cosplayers and stuff,

31:52.080 --> 31:57.600
they're painting things all kinds of colors. You remember? Yeah. No one says that good though,

31:57.600 --> 32:04.960
maybe. Was this gun 3D printed? No. It looks like a gun that would have been in

32:05.920 --> 32:13.840
clay gems. I'm going to say no to you. It was not. It was. Oh, shit. Sorry.

32:22.080 --> 32:31.040
Chicken. Do I get anything as the winner? He could Venmo you. You haven't been loads of

32:31.040 --> 32:36.960
a month in a while. Yeah, because of the taxes, man. Yeah, I'll take some money. I also don't have a

32:36.960 --> 32:42.320
credit card anymore. I close my credit card account. What are you used to do? What's that? Why?

32:42.320 --> 32:48.080
Close your credit card account because they gave me way too big of a credit card limit for me

32:48.080 --> 32:55.280
an irresponsible person to handle. Then you go, you go down in credit cards. You don't close

32:55.280 --> 32:59.680
out the account. You just get a lower credit card score. You just tanked your credit score.

33:00.480 --> 33:04.480
No, my credit score. I can check my credit score right now. I think it's still in. It won't

33:04.480 --> 33:10.560
reflect for like every day's. I close my credit card like two months ago. Let's see what

33:10.560 --> 33:14.960
my credit score. Let's get a check in on Jeff's credit score. It's nice. That's a good thing. It really

33:14.960 --> 33:23.200
needs to know. I know she just really needed to be here. It's a temporary change. Like, I just

33:23.200 --> 33:27.600
was like, I can't have a credit card right now. I need to just live off the money that I have.

33:27.600 --> 33:30.880
Because when you can just give me a credit card and I'll hold it for you and I won't use it.

33:30.880 --> 33:34.320
No, I memorize the number. My credit score is 799.

33:36.560 --> 33:46.960
I free you. But I don't know if that's going to go down later. Anyway, I just, I was like, I keep,

33:46.960 --> 33:51.440
I keep a massing debt and then I have to like liquidate my assets to pay it off.

33:51.520 --> 33:55.280
They do like when you am asked at the or like they love a debt. Exactly. I don't want

33:55.280 --> 34:00.560
out of your credit score. I don't want to play into the corporate man's hand on you. I mean,

34:00.560 --> 34:08.880
I do you know when do you know when credit scores were invented? I just saw 7. It was a little

34:08.880 --> 34:12.560
bit earlier, but still. Where are the only people? Our generations are the only people

34:12.560 --> 34:20.800
truly affected. It was like credit scores were invented the year after something that like, it was like

34:20.800 --> 34:26.880
89. It was the 80s for sure. I saw a tweet that was like, this thing happened in this year.

34:26.880 --> 34:31.520
Credit scores were invented beer after, but I don't remember what that thing was, but it was like

34:31.520 --> 34:34.560
they were the fall of the Berlin was. It was 89.

34:37.920 --> 34:41.840
Do you want me to look up why or we don't do that? Yeah, we get a numbers crunch on that.

34:41.840 --> 34:47.280
We're I'm going to move on while you do that. Just to keep things rolling. But yeah, no, I,

34:47.360 --> 34:51.200
well, I guess this isn't moving on. I would amass so much debt that I'd have to liquidate

34:51.200 --> 34:56.160
my assets like I had to sell my old car to pay off a really big credit card thing. And then I bought

34:56.160 --> 35:01.200
a different, I used the difference between swapping cars to pay it off. So I was like, this isn't

35:01.200 --> 35:08.480
sustainable or good. So I don't have a credit card anymore. But it also means that everything that's

35:08.480 --> 35:16.160
in my checking account has to stay there. It cannot go for some silly little game on this dumb ass show.

35:18.240 --> 35:27.040
No, I love doing this show. Um, me to me to do you. Yeah, let's yeah, I want to let's check in on

35:27.040 --> 35:32.880
how y'all are feeling. How do you guys think this episode feels? I think it feels great. Really.

35:32.880 --> 35:37.920
It's good. Yeah. Okay. It's my first one. I have nothing to compare it to, but I'm feeling really

35:37.920 --> 35:45.200
good so far. Great. All right. This is a new segment that I also didn't come up with. I was hanging out

35:45.200 --> 35:50.960
with my friends George and Eli last night for like an hour. And then as I was. Well, you

35:50.960 --> 35:55.360
like came over to just hang out for a bit on his way home from work. And then George had to drive

35:55.360 --> 36:01.920
him home for some reason. Um, anyway, we just kind of took we talked, we caught up. And I was

36:01.920 --> 36:05.760
outlining at the kitchen table hanging out with them. And they were like, what do you up to? I was like

36:05.760 --> 36:09.840
coming up with podcast segments. And then they just kind of immediately pitched these two things.

36:09.840 --> 36:15.280
I was really tired. It was 9 30 p.m. So I was like fine. That's fine. Um, anyway.

36:39.840 --> 36:56.400
Wow. So far, my favorite. I don't music. Yeah. And it's one of my favorite ones.

36:57.600 --> 37:04.400
Welcome to Ranker. When I first heard what this game was, I thought it was R.A. and C.O.R.

37:05.360 --> 37:10.480
It's not. It's um, Ranker. That's the most duet thing you've ever said.

37:14.080 --> 37:19.200
George, George explained this game to me. I think it sounds fun. It's an actual game that we

37:19.200 --> 37:24.640
have to do some things and learn some rules to play here. We've got at least 10 minutes as much as

37:24.640 --> 37:32.800
25. So um, I'll try to keep you guys that long. Here is George Saba, my roommate. Uh,

37:32.800 --> 37:35.520
previous guest on the show explaining the rules at my kitchen table.

37:36.560 --> 37:41.840
Starting over entirely. Yeah. Okay. Group of people in a room as most games.

37:41.840 --> 37:47.200
Boy, sorry. I was recording. Well, now I've nervous. I'm not ever more. Yeah. And I'm sort of

37:47.200 --> 37:54.880
on. Okay. Group of people in a room, uh, one person leaves the room. Uh, and everyone else in the room

37:54.880 --> 37:59.840
chooses a number between one and 10. They bring the person you left back in. That person's goal

37:59.920 --> 38:05.120
is to guess the number that was chosen. Here's how they do it. One by one, they go around each

38:05.120 --> 38:12.560
person and they present them a category. Uh, so if I were to, like, let's say the number were seven.

38:12.560 --> 38:19.040
Yeah. And I were to present you like the category, like, posit shapes. And you would say

38:19.440 --> 38:28.400
for follow. For follow. Sure. And in my mind, for follow is lower tier. For follow is a

38:28.400 --> 38:32.960
four for me. Okay. So then I'd be like, hmm, I'd be like, I don't know what how you like things

38:32.960 --> 38:38.800
for follow. So I'd go to you, Jeffrey. Okay. And I'd be like, okay, um, really, you know, for looking

38:38.880 --> 38:48.480
for a seven, uh, U.S. States. Uh, uh, I guess, Maine. Maine. And I think Maine's pretty cool,

38:48.480 --> 38:55.920
but I know it lacks a lot of, like, um, like, major, like landmarks, it's just sort of, like, a cool vibe.

38:55.920 --> 39:00.160
So I would, I would probably call that a six. So now I'm like hedging upwards and assuming that

39:00.160 --> 39:04.720
maybe you like, like, it's for probably. And you go around the room. And then at the, once everybody

39:04.800 --> 39:11.680
has, uh, been presented a category, the person guessing is like, okay, uh, like, here's why I think

39:11.680 --> 39:25.040
the number is. Okay. And then what's this called? Ranker. So angry. So is the, like, thing in the category

39:25.040 --> 39:31.840
that we say, our number seven. Yes. In that case, like, we're actually using the thing that we

39:32.480 --> 39:37.120
write exactly. So one person leaves the room. The other three decide on the number.

39:37.120 --> 39:42.160
Other person comes in gives each person individually a category. And then they say, uh, in that

39:42.160 --> 39:47.200
category, what you would just just said, pasta shapes, I think the seven of pasta shapes is far

39:47.200 --> 39:52.160
follow if it's seven. Um, and then the other person has to kind of be like, where I wonder where they

39:52.160 --> 39:56.640
would rank that because based on how I feel about it. And then that you create an amalgam from

39:56.640 --> 40:00.000
all three answers. Does that make sense? And then you guessed the number and you're the right

40:00.640 --> 40:04.000
to wrong. And then the fun of it is like, you think for a follow is a seven, like,

40:04.000 --> 40:10.160
far follow sucks. Like, that kind of thing. Um, who wants to start to leave the, the room slash zoom.

40:12.160 --> 40:19.520
I think you should. All right. Do you all remember the, okay. I agree. Yeah, give me a text.

40:20.720 --> 40:27.520
Okay. Yeah. All we're doing is picking a number right now. Yeah.

40:28.080 --> 40:36.160
Isn't that far? Well, you know all the numbers. And it's one through time, right? I think so.

40:36.160 --> 40:44.080
I guess so. I guess we could do a bigger scale, but it feels hard. Yeah. Should we talk about

40:44.080 --> 40:49.120
them while he's gone or is that not part of the game? No, I think we could. Okay. Is there something

40:49.120 --> 40:53.200
something to say because you wanted to talk about? No, I just want to know how this Jeff

40:53.200 --> 40:59.680
compares to Jeff other times on the show. Um, honestly, this one's a little more tame.

41:01.120 --> 41:06.480
He's a little more calm. He's trying to be gentle with me. Either that or he's really tired.

41:07.680 --> 41:12.640
Maybe both. Maybe both. Six. It's beautiful. Six, that's good. Yeah, let's do it.

41:12.640 --> 41:16.720
Let's do it. Is that too close to seven, though? That is, well, that was a concern.

41:17.600 --> 41:30.560
Should we do a three? Sure. Yeah. No, three. All right, I will text him. We done.

41:35.440 --> 41:40.880
On you have you heard how many planes have gone over head? No. I can't hear happening.

41:41.760 --> 41:48.160
Are you okay? Is that a New York thing? We wouldn't know about that. That was way too long. Sorry.

41:48.160 --> 41:54.480
We had, we had a lot to get there. We had a number. Concert venues in Los Angeles.

41:58.960 --> 42:04.160
Thank you. Uh, I just name one that I would rank as this number. Second. Yeah.

42:04.240 --> 42:14.240
Yeah. One that we talked about today. Uh, Lodge room. Hmm. Okay. Alley.

42:15.840 --> 42:18.880
Seasons.

42:21.440 --> 42:30.160
Hmm. I'm going to go spring. That's confusing. Maria had gum in plays.

42:30.160 --> 42:43.200
Please. I can't do another one. Uh, former head gum in plays. Oh my god. No, um, neighborhoods in New York.

42:51.840 --> 42:58.960
Try a Becca. Six. No. What was it?

43:00.160 --> 43:06.880
Three. There's only four seasons. Try Becca's your third neighborhood? I thought it was like

43:06.880 --> 43:13.600
out of ten. Three out of ten. Yeah. I mean, it's your third favorite? No, like like on a scale

43:13.600 --> 43:20.960
from one to ten. Is that not? Oh, I thought it is. Oh, I was also confused because he said that you liked

43:20.960 --> 43:28.000
the look. I thought it was your third favorite. I thought what I thought too. Really. Me and

43:28.000 --> 43:35.120
all you're playing a different game. Sorry. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll go. I'll go.

43:35.120 --> 43:40.960
Okay. No, you go. Yeah. Jeff McCoo goes. You just pick because you're on your

43:40.960 --> 43:48.640
go because you're on the top of my zoom. You're going to text me. I'll, I'll text you.

43:48.640 --> 43:57.040
Okay, very cool text you. Four, right? Can't hear you, Jeff. Four, right? Oh.

43:58.080 --> 44:05.760
Sure. Try. No, let's do like nine. Okay. Okay. I like that. She'd off that text.

44:16.160 --> 44:27.040
Ten. She never comes back. Plugs. I'm disintegrating from hunger. No, no. That's how I

44:27.120 --> 44:34.720
felt it. Three. I had Neil lunch. Yeah. It's four. Almost the same time. All right.

44:36.000 --> 44:42.480
She confirmed. It's on a scale. On a scale, one to ten. So ten is the best one is the worst. Okay.

44:42.480 --> 44:54.560
Four zero, I guess. Jeff. Yeah. Candy. Candy? Yeah. You put me a really tough spot here.

44:57.120 --> 45:07.760
Huh. It's kind of interesting. Kick cats. The mini ones. Specifically a frozen.

45:10.480 --> 45:13.680
Okay. Allie, um, animal.

45:16.320 --> 45:20.960
Qualla. What was it? A koala? A koala. Okay.

45:21.040 --> 45:40.320
Okay. Um, Maria, head gum employee. No, do another one. Um, uh, Broadway play.

45:40.480 --> 45:55.500
Um. This is a good one. Exalted's. It's bad because I have so many of them I have to choose

45:55.500 --> 46:08.400
for. Okay. Wait, no, no. I know how the Marvel movie. Oh. Um. Oh. hoo. I've read all your letterbox reviews

46:08.400 --> 46:10.400
for these, for part of my past.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.400
It's a smart.

46:11.400 --> 46:13.400
Yeah, that's a tactical move.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.400
I'm waiting for a plane to go over it.

46:15.400 --> 46:18.400
Um, Iron Man.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.400
Uh, the first one? Yes.

46:24.400 --> 46:26.400
Four.

46:27.400 --> 46:30.400
No, so far off.

46:30.400 --> 46:32.400
No, that was nine.

46:32.400 --> 46:33.400
Nine?

46:33.400 --> 46:37.400
Yeah, we did almost do four, but it was nine.

46:37.400 --> 46:39.400
You liked the first Iron Man?

46:39.400 --> 46:41.400
Yeah, so it's a nine out of ten.

46:41.400 --> 46:42.400
Nine out of ten.

46:42.400 --> 46:43.400
Oh, I'm playing it wrong again.

46:47.400 --> 46:48.400
I'm playing it wrong again.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.400
We're all learning the game at the same time.

46:49.400 --> 46:50.400
Ali, you're turned.

46:50.400 --> 46:51.400
I'm sorry.

46:51.400 --> 46:52.400
I'm sorry.

46:52.400 --> 46:53.400
No, no, we got it.

46:53.400 --> 46:55.400
Hopefully this time I get it.

46:55.400 --> 46:58.400
Um, but I do know you.

46:58.400 --> 46:59.400
You do.

46:59.400 --> 47:01.400
What number are we doing?

47:01.400 --> 47:02.400
Oh.

47:03.400 --> 47:05.400
Okay.

47:05.400 --> 47:06.400
I get the concept now.

47:06.400 --> 47:07.400
Sorry.

47:07.400 --> 47:08.400
I have to.

47:08.400 --> 47:10.400
You.

47:10.400 --> 47:12.400
Eight.

47:12.400 --> 47:13.400
Okay.

47:13.400 --> 47:14.400
So again, good.

47:14.400 --> 47:15.400
Things that are good.

47:15.400 --> 47:16.400
Yeah.

47:16.400 --> 47:17.400
Like a B.

47:17.400 --> 47:18.400
I'm perfect.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.400
Uh, I don't have Ali's number.

47:20.400 --> 47:22.400
Oh, I remember.

47:22.400 --> 47:24.400
I guess I'm the only one that actually likes Ali.

47:24.400 --> 47:26.400
Haha.

47:26.400 --> 47:31.400
I heard notifications are silent, so that's actually what we have our number.

47:32.400 --> 47:33.400
I did too.

47:33.400 --> 47:34.400
Did you text her?

47:34.400 --> 47:35.400
Yeah.

47:35.400 --> 47:36.400
Okay.

47:42.400 --> 47:43.400
Okay.

47:43.400 --> 47:44.400
Hello.

47:44.400 --> 47:45.400
Yeah.

47:45.400 --> 47:46.400
Um.

47:46.400 --> 47:47.400
Okay.

47:47.400 --> 47:48.400
Jeff.

47:48.400 --> 47:50.400
Movies.

47:50.400 --> 47:52.400
Fuck.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.400
Um.

47:54.400 --> 47:57.400
The Royal Ten and Bombs.

47:57.400 --> 47:58.400
Okay.

47:59.400 --> 48:00.400
Um.

48:00.400 --> 48:02.400
Rika.

48:02.400 --> 48:04.400
Snacks.

48:10.400 --> 48:12.400
I'm thinking candy corn.

48:12.400 --> 48:14.400
Cheeseettes.

48:16.400 --> 48:17.400
Okay.

48:19.400 --> 48:21.400
Oh, yeah.

48:21.400 --> 48:23.400
Uh, um.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.400
Have you got my employees?

48:26.400 --> 48:27.400
Uh.

48:27.400 --> 48:29.400
Let's do it.

48:29.400 --> 48:30.400
Okay.

48:30.400 --> 48:32.400
Not a coward.

48:32.400 --> 48:33.400
Marty.

48:33.400 --> 48:35.400
Sure.

48:35.400 --> 48:37.400
Marty Michael RCO.

48:37.400 --> 48:38.400
Okay.

48:48.400 --> 48:50.400
Eight.

48:50.400 --> 48:51.400
Yes.

48:51.400 --> 48:52.400
Really?

48:52.400 --> 48:53.400
Yeah.

48:53.400 --> 48:54.400
It was eight.

48:54.400 --> 48:55.400
Wow.

48:55.400 --> 48:56.400
Wow.

48:56.400 --> 49:01.400
Last one, Maria could get out of here.

49:01.400 --> 49:07.400
Uh, what do we think of?

49:07.400 --> 49:09.400
I think one.

49:09.400 --> 49:10.400
Um.

49:10.400 --> 49:11.400
Done.

49:11.400 --> 49:12.400
I got it.

49:12.400 --> 49:13.400
I got it.

49:13.400 --> 49:17.400
Well, allow the producer.

49:17.400 --> 49:18.400
Oops.

49:18.400 --> 49:23.400
Sorry I ruined it.

49:23.400 --> 49:25.400
The first two times.

49:25.400 --> 49:26.400
No.

49:26.400 --> 49:29.400
I thought the same way that you were thinking too.

49:29.400 --> 49:30.400
Yeah.

49:30.400 --> 49:31.400
Two tries.

49:31.400 --> 49:34.400
That just means I didn't explain the George didn't explain the rules.

49:34.400 --> 49:37.400
I'm fine.

49:37.400 --> 49:38.400
Yeah.

49:38.400 --> 49:39.400
You're fine.

49:39.400 --> 49:42.400
I've also never played this game.

49:42.400 --> 49:43.400
That's fine.

49:43.400 --> 49:44.400
We're learning together.

49:44.400 --> 49:45.400
It's nice.

49:45.400 --> 49:46.400
Um.

49:46.400 --> 49:47.400
Okay.

49:47.400 --> 49:49.400
Jeff.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.400
Favorite.

49:51.400 --> 49:52.400
As an L cast member.

49:52.400 --> 49:53.400
Or not favorite.

49:53.400 --> 49:55.400
Just as an L cast member.

49:55.400 --> 49:56.400
Oh.

49:56.400 --> 49:57.400
Okay.

49:57.400 --> 49:58.400
Okay.

49:58.400 --> 49:59.400
The game.

49:59.400 --> 50:02.400
Just an interview now.

50:02.400 --> 50:04.400
Um.

50:04.400 --> 50:05.400
Uh.

50:05.400 --> 50:06.400
Mike.

50:06.400 --> 50:07.400
What's his name?

50:07.400 --> 50:08.400
The guy looks like a frog.

50:08.400 --> 50:09.400
My key day.

50:09.400 --> 50:10.400
No.

50:10.400 --> 50:11.400
Like my key day.

50:11.400 --> 50:16.400
The tall, lanky dude with like the bad posture and the ugly face.

50:16.400 --> 50:18.400
And how did this mix?

50:18.400 --> 50:20.400
No, no, no, no.

50:21.400 --> 50:25.400
Michael Brian.

50:25.400 --> 50:27.400
What's like a frog.

50:27.400 --> 50:32.400
I was being purposely mean.

50:32.400 --> 50:33.400
He's fine.

50:33.400 --> 50:34.400
Yeah.

50:34.400 --> 50:36.400
You're giving away the number if I say you don't want to be me.

50:36.400 --> 50:37.400
Well, no.

50:37.400 --> 50:38.400
I, I, I threw out a lot of information.

50:38.400 --> 50:43.400
She doesn't know how I feel about it.

50:43.400 --> 50:44.400
I could run.

50:44.400 --> 50:45.400
Funny.

50:45.400 --> 50:47.400
AP buyer.

50:47.400 --> 50:49.400
Um.

50:50.400 --> 50:51.400
On.

50:51.400 --> 50:52.400
Yeah.

50:52.400 --> 50:58.400
Spindrift flavor.

50:58.400 --> 50:59.400
I've literally don't know.

50:59.400 --> 51:00.400
I don't drink something.

51:00.400 --> 51:02.400
You have to give me anyone.

51:02.400 --> 51:03.400
Fine.

51:03.400 --> 51:04.400
I'm sorry.

51:04.400 --> 51:05.400
I'll do it.

51:05.400 --> 51:06.400
I could do the.

51:06.400 --> 51:07.400
The.

51:07.400 --> 51:08.400
La Croix or whatever, but I can't do.

51:08.400 --> 51:09.400
I can't do.

51:09.400 --> 51:10.400
Okay.

51:10.400 --> 51:11.400
Never.

51:11.400 --> 51:15.400
Um.

51:15.400 --> 51:16.400
Lemon.

51:16.400 --> 51:18.400
Oh.

51:19.400 --> 51:21.400
Ali.

51:21.400 --> 51:24.400
Had a good memory.

51:24.400 --> 51:26.400
I can't.

51:26.400 --> 51:32.400
Um.

51:32.400 --> 51:35.400
Disney Channel original movie.

51:35.400 --> 51:39.400
Um.

51:39.400 --> 51:43.400
Don't look under the bat.

51:43.400 --> 51:44.400
So, Sterling night?

51:44.400 --> 51:45.400
Do you remember that one?

51:45.400 --> 51:47.400
I don't.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.400
Games falling apart.

51:50.400 --> 51:52.400
Um.

51:52.400 --> 51:55.400
Two.

51:55.400 --> 51:56.400
Close.

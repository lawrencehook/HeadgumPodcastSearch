00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Oh, hey.

00:07.000 --> 00:29.000
One of my new favorite things that makes me laugh a lot is earnest waving.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Oh, it's like a die delivered.

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Like if we all kind of live in this area, if you see people that you know a lot from your car or on the street,

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
and my favorite thing is just a pleasant wave.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Yeah.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Nobody does that.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
At the end of a zoom.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
One second, actually.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
It's really interesting that we connect on this building.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Oh, wow.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
So does that go into that?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
I had a day that pleasant waves.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
The day that it was announced.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
There was like a week after Trump may have lost.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Right.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
And then when it was announced and everyone was partying on Sunset Boulevard,

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I went for a walk before the party.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
And every neighbor I saw, it was literally Truman Show.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Everyone was literally saying, good morning, neighbor.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
A good morning, neighbor.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Good morning.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Good morning.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
That was a great day.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Um, drove down Sunset blasting music.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Yeah.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Saw my friend, Cecilia, twirking on off of a moving van.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Whoa.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Yeah.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Sorry.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
One second.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
We only have 45 minutes.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
We have to get it right.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
It's hard to edit the video.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
When you have these fucking flubs.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Wasn't a flow.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
I said, wow.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Nice.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
He didn't flow.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Yeah.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
He didn't flow.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
He spoke.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Then I got off the line.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I genuinely apologized.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
We're even the casey behind the camera as well.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
We got a lot of requests for more Donna Hugh.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Really more Casey for more.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Casey, what's your title producer?

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Yeah.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
I'm a producer.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
There's always intrigue with the person behind the boards.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Yes.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I always become the coolest person in the equation.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Yeah.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
All the mystery that you don't know what they look like.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Can do no wrong.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Yes.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Casey have been on camera just a voice.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Well, we're going to need to get them on the show eventually.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
So people will see his face.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
But I'd like to keep the air of mystery for at least one more week.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
That's cool.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Um, and Casey's a good name for mysterious person because Casey can be anybody.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
I'm excited about it because all the big podcasts have this kind of like tertiary

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
producer character.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Mm-hmm.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
And now it's like proving that we have not only production value but spiritual worth.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Mm-hmm.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Right.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
So it's like, I'm worth a damn because of Donna Hugh.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
What is the other podcast that you're thinking about that has a Hollywood handbook,

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
on fantasy, everything.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Uh-huh.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Conan O'Brien needs a friend.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
I see.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Uh, the daily.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Really?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
There's producer, Travis.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Mm-hmm.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Travis?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
It's like Travis, but with an end.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Yeah.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Sure.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
That one.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Oh.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Back at it again, Monday morning.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Uh, would you say we're Monday morning quarterbacking it?

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
Well, we were supposed to do this on Friday, which sort of has a fun weekend energy to it.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
And instead we're doing it at the worst time of the week, which was Monday morning.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Yeah.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Well, weekend is over.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Well, Jeff actually texted us like last Monday.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Yeah.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Can you do Friday?

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
And we both kind of made it clear that we can maybe do Friday, but Thursday would be absolutely

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
better.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Oh, yeah.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
And there was like a 72 hour window where we just simply didn't hear back from Jeff.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
That Thursday could be better.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
And then it was like Wednesday night.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
And we're like, OK.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
So Thursday's probably not happening.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
But I texted Jeff on Wednesday night.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
And I was like, hey, listen, Thursday's now like off the table.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Because you didn't lock it in.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Because I haven't heard from you.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
And I've heard from others.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
And then Thursday, or at some point around Thursday, we got another text from Jeff saying,

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
Hey, I have another friend coming into town because Jeff is human Airbnb.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yeah.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
And I'm sitting on Jeff for a weekend.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
So he moved it today.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Right.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Good morning, quarterback.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
I'm not going to apologize for being spontaneous.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
But then I also forgot about today until you text.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
You're like, we're going to want for today at 10.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
45, like at 9.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
45.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
More than that Monday.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
I sent a calendar in.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Did you?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Yeah, Monday.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Of course.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Oh, for Monday.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I definitely did not receive a set calendar.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
I didn't know about this.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
I didn't get a calendar.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
That's what you said.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
So I'll see you at like an hour of your backpack.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Good reminder.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
There are really funny subtle joke that like, but he actually forgot.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
No, yeah.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
I actually need it because if I if I don't get the invite, I'm not actually putting it into

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
my calendar.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Right.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
And then once it's in my calendar, I think it was in for Friday.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I definitely didn't officially move it to Monday.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Right.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Because I didn't hear about it.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
Meanwhile, I'm reprioritizing calls that I'm supposed to be on right now to do this podcast

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
that no one remembered was even happening.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Right.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
That was easy.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
No.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
As a matter of fact, it wasn't.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
I may have lost work due to the fact that this non-priority podcast has taken my schedule.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Well, we have a budget for fees now.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Excuse me.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
We have a budget for fees.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Go on.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
So this is going to be $700 in your pocket if you can win a game later.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Is that a real $750 because we played games like this before.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
And I've never actually got the Venmo.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
It does come from my personal pocket.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
But you should send them crypto.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
Since if you guys are both on Coinbase, it makes it sort of quasi legal under the table.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
But still I instant transfer.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Are you in NFTs?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
No.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Okay.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Uh, this already sucks.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
I'm sorry.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
But like, we're going to have to save it with some, uh, some sound.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
What's extra funny to me is that I can't hear Jeff.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
But I have to write that.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
I mean it.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
I just hear Jeff.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
And again with the wife.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Cool.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Um, it's as if I have like, but by now.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Sonic four fields.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yeah.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
We're still figuring out some tech.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Yeah.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
That would have been.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
You should have done some tests.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
What is the other one shoot?

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Because you're still on a recording Friday schedule for the following Friday.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
So do you plan on recording another one this week?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Because I haven't heard about anything.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Yeah.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Okay.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
But I'll probably do it with the New York crew.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Okay.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
That's good.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Um, we've got a lot to get to today.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Oh.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Get started.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Um, I miss Marika.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
I got less Marika.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Now that we're back in LA.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Well, I, we need to find more Marika.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
We could have tried to get her to be on here.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Okay.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
We're out there.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Yeah.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Before with guests.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Okay.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Remote guests.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yeah.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Um, I just thought it would be fun to do the guys.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Sure.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Under the guys.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Yeah.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
The 90026 fellows.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
That's not my good.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Really?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
That is my zip code.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Not for long.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Not for long.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Um.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
Let's get it started off with our bonds of the week.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Mine's Reese with her spoon.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Nice.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
If I could just say one thing.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
I listened to a headcom podcast recently.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Let's get back to the show.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
These are always a set up for him to sing that Beyonce song.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
You don't know about me.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
You don't know about me.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Yes.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
And also G.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
I believe the episode.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Yeah.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
I was thinking about clarified butter.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
So I'm prepared.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
I'm prepared for this to go into the Beyonce song.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Maybe if we always say that.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
You must not know about Reese.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
You must not know about Reese.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
She was married to a less successful actor.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
There has a date to even call him an actor.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Baby.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
You must not know fully.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
You must not know fully.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
I know.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Her ex husband's name's Ryan Philippe.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
He's here replaceable.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
Ryan Philippe was actually more famous than Reese with her spoon when they started dating.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
He was a really popular actor in the 90s.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Cool intentions.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Exactly.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
And yeah.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Yeah.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
And he was a heartthrob.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I think before Jeff was born.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
So we must know about Reese to know details like this.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
As a matter of fact.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Yeah.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
I wasn't around yet.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Right.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I was born in 1997.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
I wasn't around.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Yeah.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Cowboy, Jeff.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
So I was right.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
So he doesn't want to know our bonds.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I didn't even hear his lyrics.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Like I said, these are just prohibiting me.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Yeah.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I think the guy is sitting next to me.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
You must not know about Reese.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
You must not know about Reese.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
She was married to a less successful actor.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Has it taken to even call him an actor, baby?

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Isn't he?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Aren't they still together?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
And why do you hesitate to call him an actor?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I haven't seen him in anything.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Has he seen you and anything?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Are you an actor?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
I didn't.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
I'm not an actor.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Okay.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
You must not know for Leap.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
You must not know for Leap.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
You must not know for Leap.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Who's for Leap?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Oh, Riley.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Okay.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Her ex husband's name's Ryan Philippe.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
So don't you ever for a second divorce?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
They're divorcing.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Yeah.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
That he's irreplaceable because he was replaced.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Interesting.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Are they is she remarried?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Yeah.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
This is the least gone of it.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Yeah.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
What about Coach K?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Oh, that's good.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
You must not know Coach K.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Doesn't have to do with the song.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
This is the game we're playing about bond of the week.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Oh, forget about song.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
So it's my theory holds that.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Because the bond of the week is now just a kind of a smoke screen together.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Yeah.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I just threw out a bond of the week.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
And you said, how will that actually feel?

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
It will be our next song.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Yeah.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
You think because he needs a job?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I think it would be an interesting watch for an hour and a half.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Interesting.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Yeah.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I don't know if he'll be able to do the stunts.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
I also don't know how good he is at a read.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
But he's available.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
He's available.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Yeah.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
But he's not on a veil.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
We'll read him.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Yeah.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
But it's like kind of a favor to like, you know, the EP.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Yeah.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
He did, he did pretty good in the AT&T commercials.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
He did.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
That's true.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
So.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
You're saying I don't have the job.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
That was my coach.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Okay.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
It's good.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Let's run.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
What?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I'm going to cut this out.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
This is my show.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
So what?

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
So it's not other people's time to shine.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Just doing a goofy and fresh.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
A good podcast host knows when to step aside.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Right.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
But when I have you on the couch, there's no chance that I'll step aside.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Jeff always invites you, right?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
It's not presumed that you're on every else.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Yeah.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Well, you've got to make the invite this week.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
But I was still texted about showing up.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Okay.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
So he invites you to this room.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
And then he complains about your being here.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
That's right.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Yeah.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Okay.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Just want everyone at home to know the rules of the game.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Yeah.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
It's scheduled this for 1045 a Monday on Friday.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Or no, on Thursday.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
I think I said 1045 because I had something Friday and noon.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Yes.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
And then it moved to Monday.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
And you throughout 11 on Monday.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Yeah.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Yeah.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Yeah.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
We all agree today.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Right.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
But I should have sent the calendar.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Did you remember before the text you found the week?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I was moving around phone calls this morning.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Yeah.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Work was coming in.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
I had to explain to them that I have to reluctantly do this podcast.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Where I get barated for an hour with my buddy.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Yeah.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Okay.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
It's not going to be that bad.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Okay.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
What's I know it sucks so far.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
But that's because of the energy.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
What has been the most viral TikTok content that has come from the show thus far?

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Because maybe knowing that I can.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
We do some more.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
We did have a TikTok around Sally to our Griffin last week.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Right.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
But I haven't checked the numbers on that.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Casey, can we get a number scrunch on the last TikTok?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Yeah.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Sure.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
A number scrunch.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
That's it.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
That's eddy thing.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Followed on my phone.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Followed on the week.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Bond of the week.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
Let's go with the guy in the movie I saw yesterday.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Forget his name.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
You remember his name?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
He was really good in that film actually.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Which one?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Maybe the Curtis?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Not Jamie.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Oh, guy.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Yeah.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Oh.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
The guy from Goonies?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Yes, exactly.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
And Indiana Jones.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Dr. Jones.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Yeah.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Who's that?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
His voice has remained the same.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
The movie is everything everywhere all at once.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Right.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
It is this very optimistic like we can't give up on faith and joy and hope character.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Yes.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
That's me.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Well.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Kiwi Kwan.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Yeah.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
He was he had the gadgets in Goonies.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
If you've ever seen that movie.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
I've never seen Goonies.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I wasn't talking yet.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
I wasn't right.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
It was before my decision.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
That is him.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Casey, what's that TikTok doing number twice?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
A little over 2,000 views.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
So not that many.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
If at all.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Okay.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Um.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Yeah.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Let's move on.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Then.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
So one of the pieces of advice that we got from Sally Darr was that people love to hear the

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
tea in regards to dating in LA.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Do you say tea?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Yeah.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Like normally?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Yeah.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
I actually got into a conversation with my friend who was visiting about gossip.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Okay.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
I love gossip.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
But I don't like shit talking.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Okay.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Which there's a difference.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I think that gossip can be positive.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Yeah.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Like gossip's just the news of your friend group.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
What you've heard.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Yeah.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Whispers.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
We shit talking is being like this person sucks for these reasons.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
With a slant.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Okay.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Gossip can venture into shit talking.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
But I do think they're different.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Okay.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Love gossip.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
People love the tea.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Yeah.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
I want to know the tea with what's happening with my friends that I haven't seen

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
in a while.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Okay.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Because you can't see your friends that often.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Right.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
So.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Dating an LA.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
What's it like?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
You're to look at a screen for that question.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Yeah.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
I did drop.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
You're at your notes.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
What do you.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
I mean, because you're a weird.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
We're in relationships.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Right.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
It is married.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
So we're not dating an LA.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
You're the one.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
You should be telling us what's like being single an LA.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
But you never stopped dating your wife.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Really?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
This is.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Okay.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
You never stopped dating.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
You're now on the tightrope.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Let's see how this goes.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
You lose the spark.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Sorry, one second.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Yeah.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
If you lose the spark.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
If you lose the hormones.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Uh, what else do you have?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Where are you drawing?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
What are you drawing from?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
You have no wisdom.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
You have no experience.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
And yeah.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
You have no experience.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
I'm living.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
I'm living the life that you are trying to tell me how to lead.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
But you've never lived this life.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I read a preface of mating in captivity.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Mating?

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
What?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Mating in captivity?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
It was married.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
It had happened.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
The jail.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
No, you can't.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
You can't lose that luster.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Love when you look down.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Love when you look down.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Love when you look down.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
To get smart again.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
It's as if you're charging your intelligence.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
No.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
So you can never.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Look up.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
And be smart.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
There are certain mannerisms that if you have it doesn't matter what you say.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Right.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Right.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Right.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
So if I go like this, like I just did.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
You guys suddenly think that it's hard.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
He's carefree.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Yeah.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
I'm like, yeah.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
You're not stiff.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Right.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Like that.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
That's like literally a pausing.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
That's like transcend stiff.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Whether it's with your wife or with your long-term partner.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Tell us about dating.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
People wanted me to smack you on Twitter.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Did you see this?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Yes.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Yeah.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Because they thought it would happen.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
I'm sure that something will happen in the next 25 minutes that is smack.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Where the end, I do give you full permission to follow me.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
And that may be the viral tick talk.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Plus 2,000 view moment that we need.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
It could be like the Andy Kaufman thing.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
We're not smacked on.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
I think Letterman wasn't.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
And people didn't know if it was real or not.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Yeah.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Yeah.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Okay.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Full permission.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
You don't have to do it.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
I don't want to do it.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
You might have to.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Um.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Tell us about dating in LA.

15:24.000 --> 15:32.000
Well actually Billy and I both saw a movie this weekend on separate dates of sorts with our ladies.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
So that's an example of a date.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
You get some food.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
You watch some movie.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
That's like a classic.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
That's like dinner in a movie.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Mm-hmm.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
You can't get more classic than that date wise.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Yep.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Especially in LA.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Definitely not in LA.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Yeah.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
You can do that anywhere.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Right.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Like I want to hear about you guys going to the fucking no vacancy.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Oh yeah.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
It was last time you were at Laurel Hardware.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
What?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
I'll be there first.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Oh that's a cool bar.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Yeah.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
He's pulling up a sound.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Hold for it guys.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
That didn't work.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
That absolute didn't work.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
What do you want?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
What's the success?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
What is the successful answer to that question look like?

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Yes.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
We've been to Laurel Hardware.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Yeah recently.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Yeah.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
The best thing.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Oh recently?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
No.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
I was saying that.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Oh no.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
No.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
No.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
No.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
No.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
No.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
No.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
No.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Yeah.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
You're just throwing people into your awkward conversations.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Why don't you tell us about dating in LA?

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
Dating in LA is easy.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
It's such a large pool to draw from.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
You must not know about ease.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
You must not know about ease.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
How much is a date cost?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
No bus.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
No bus.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
First date cost.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
In Los Angeles.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
It depends what you want to do.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I mean you can do anything for free.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
Are you matching with ladies on apps?

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
You must not know about field.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
You must not know about field.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Yeah.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
So I field is my app of choice.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
It's for three sums, casual sex.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Okay.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
So are you when you match with a lady on a dating app?

17:15.000 --> 17:21.000
Is the first date usually hey come out with me and my friends or is it like let's meet for a drink one on one?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Right.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
It depends how it goes on.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
When was last time you met up with someone one on one for a drink that you met on a dating app?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
That honestly would have been last October.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Wow.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Six months of New York.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
You did date someone in New York?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Yeah.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
From a dating app?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
No.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
From a meta at a party.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Fourth of July party in Laurel Canyon actually.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
And then you dated her in New York City.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
She moved to New York.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
I went to New York.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
There were so many faces in the last 10 seconds.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
What a thrill to watch him have so many emotions.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
He was like happy, confused.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Maybe I might be angry.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Wow.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Okay.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
I tend to meet people organically.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
That's why I think it's easy.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
I just go to parties.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
And then you know, you meet friends of friends.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
You find them attractive.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
You take them out or not.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Or you.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
Zebulon is really the catalyst for.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Spreading legs.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Enjoy.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Send you one.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Ha ha ha ha.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
The catalyst.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
The catalyst.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Earlier when you said it's just going to be the goddess.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
That's the fear that was going to come out of you ever had a night where you've

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
spread one of or all of these four things.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
Joy, libel, wisdom and legs.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
So you didn't have to look at the computer for that question.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Ha ha ha ha.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
But you did have to say, how's dating in LA?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Joy, libel.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Room.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
I wisdom.

18:45.000 --> 18:51.000
It doesn't matter who you're with as long as your thighs are thick.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
If you had the lag in, you can have anyone.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
You're legs are thin.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
You have incredibly thin legs.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
I, when I get things tailored, it's about making sure two things are right.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
The, the fangles that's thin ankles and the seat.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
What's the seat?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
That's the ass.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
You say it.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Look at the ass.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
This is the rat voice.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
I want to say it's good.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
I want to say it.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Say word.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
I focus on the fangles.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Have a seat.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Which is?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Yes.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
You have a kind of dark male smurf villain.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Are you?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
I'm talking about hot.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Heming pants.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
To make your big butt and thin legs.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
I'm talking about Heming way to make way for my ass.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
So all the jeans that you wear, they can't come standard.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Because nobody has a standard leg.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
Slash ass ratio that you guys.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Five, twelve.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
So what size are you looking for?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Waste and then length.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
34, 32.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Interesting.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Yeah.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Although, I think I'm more a 33.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Because 34 is always too loose.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
And I don't, I need to get a belt.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
That's the issue.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Casey has a good belt.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Really?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Yeah.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
You want me to show it to you?

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
I want you to sound it to us.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Yeah.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
So stand up and just like undo one notch.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Just because someone has a microphone.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
We have to make them go.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
We have to take a break.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
We have to take a break.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Whether you do the clankling.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
No kidding.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
We have to take a break.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Yeah.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
You just told the person to stand up and make the sound of his belt coming off.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
It's fun to work.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Let the bear work.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Whatever.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
We'll take her.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
We'll be right back after you think some sponsors.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Sponsors.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Thank you to firstly for sponsoring this episode of our show.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
When you're on the hunt for a new wine, you have two options.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
You can wander around your local grocery store or wine mart picking bottles at random slash

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
ad nauseam or you can get personalized wines.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
You'll love delivered right to your door.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
And for the fraction of the cost, if you love the excitement of discovering new wines,

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
but hate the risk of disappointment, first leaf wine club is a no-brainer.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
First leaf is a wine club that curates and ships wines that are personalized to your

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
tastes, allowing you to discover wines from five different continents and 12 different countries.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
And when you rate the wine, you receive first leaf learns more about your palate.

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
So not only are you being introduced to a ton of new wine, each first leaf box gets better and better.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Firstly, you sent me a couple bottles of wine.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I'm on my first box for now.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
They sent me four bottles and I'm super into some of the grige.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
I'm super into some of the California charts.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
So I think I'm going to rate those highly and I'll leave the Grinosh.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
I'll leave the Grinosh and the next box is going to be even more catered to my taste.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
And here's a fun little not so secret about firstly.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
They work directly with wine makers, which means you get incredible wine.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
60% off retail.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
That's crazy.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
I don't know a lot about wine, but I do know that the markups are insane.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
And so this is kind of cutting that out.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
It's an unbelievable product here.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
I will say that I like that they send different wines from all across the world.

22:14.000 --> 22:21.000
I'm trying to get more into wine as a part of my quest to become wise because wine makes you wise.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
And firstly, it's helped me out with that.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
I'm loving it so far.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
I truly want to keep going with this even if they don't continue sponsoring it.

firstly, we'll credit your account.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
Thank you to Farrity for sponsoring this episode of our show.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Guys, everyone's talking about fake spring, right?

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
And how difficult it is to dress around this time.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
But that's because it is.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
It can be so difficult to find the right outfit in the spring.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
When every day is different and when weather can change at the drop of a hat.

23:20.000 --> 23:26.000
Luckily, Farrity makes it way easier because they make the perfect clothes for all seasons.

23:27.000 --> 23:34.000
Farrity is a family run brand making high quality, timeless clothing with modern design and functionality.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
And it's that kind of effortless style you want.

23:37.000 --> 23:43.000
Every time you go digging in your closet, that's set, that shirt, that dress that feels like you've had them for years.

23:43.000 --> 23:52.000
And maybe it's in a gorgeous print and it looks like it might be vintage, but it fits so well that it feels like it was made just yesterday just for you.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Well, that's Farrity.

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
Guys, I've said this before. Farrity has been an amazing brand in my closet.

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
I have a long sleeve reversible shirt.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
Sort of a shirt sweater hybrid actually.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
Where one side is striped, the other one solid Heather Gray.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
And I've had that shirt since like 2018, 2017.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
And it's absolutely something that I pull out of my closet every year.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
It's unbelievably high quality stuff. I couldn't be more excited about this partnership.

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
And Farrity is so confident in the quality of their stuff that they actually have a lifetime guarantee of quality.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000

Thanks, Farrity.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
And we're back.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Bill, let's get furious on the facts.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
And I guess I'm being able to build on the facts for the first time ever.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Yeah.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
I'm sort of playing rhythm guitar over here.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
I'm the social lubrication that is popular here.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Because now it's like a uverse Billy situation.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
And I'm just trying to like referee it.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
I'm chill out.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
I'm chill out now.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Okay.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
There will be no slap.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Should we get in our first segment?

25:45.000 --> 25:58.000
This is way too long.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
I have something I want to say.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Yeah, I'm going to build the gear.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
You have to wait.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
I've heard it before.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Before you get to the segment.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Yeah.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
It's particularly funny.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
When someone offers a pleasant wave and it is not risky.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
I'll be here.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Thank you.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Such a non-response.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
It does that.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
It's like trying to heat foam.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Like I don't get it.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
It's just bouncing back.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
Welcome to Bad Small Talk.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
We've been in this segment for the best 25 minutes.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
For the past 40 episodes.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Yeah.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
Well, this is going to be a little bit more intentional.

26:34.000 --> 26:40.000
Small Talk to me is the fall of talk.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
What?

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
I can't stand small talk.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Okay.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
Like it makes you anxious or like, yeah.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Nobody really cares.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
It's a waste of time.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
It's a waste of energy.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
It's a waste of joy in wisdom.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
It's a waste of.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Paced.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
A waste of what?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Paced.

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
Because sometimes he just says wisdom.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
So, he just says wisdom.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
The word wisdom or like, no, the word wisdom.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
No, the word wisdom.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Not saying.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Not saying.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Not saying.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Not the thing is.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
When he just talking, when there.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
His heart.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
His heart.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
His heart.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
His heart.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
His heart.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
He's just about the idea.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
He's still.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
He's still.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
He's still.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
He's still.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
It doesn't mean anything.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Right.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
So, I'm going to give examples of places.

27:36.000 --> 27:44.000
I'm going to be a stranger and then you guys are going to alternate off and you guys are going to just like, you know, come up to me or maybe we're sitting next to each other or like we're in line together.

27:44.000 --> 27:52.000
Okay. So first off at the DMV. We've been waiting a while. Okay. So let's start with me and Billy. Okay. I engage with you. Yeah. Okay.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
How long have you been here? Don't talk to me.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
That's probably the end of it.

28:07.000 --> 28:19.000
Yeah. I can read social cues. I know. Oh, I forgot to also mention that I'm going to try and disarm you guys and it's going to be sort of this breach of social contract because what if we just didn't have any small talk?

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
Okay. Seems like you really want to include that element in this game when explaining it.

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
All right. I'm here at the grocery store. Sure. I'm looking at some bonds of mac and cheese. You come up to me.

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
What's your favorite one? What's that? What's your favorite mac and cheese? There's so many options.

28:33.000 --> 28:41.000
Doesn't matter. Okay. I was going to say I like this organic version even though it's like supposed to be healthy.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
We weren't going to say it because you just did. Right. Sorry, pal.

28:45.000 --> 28:51.000
Can you at least move out of your way? Your ass is so big and your ankles are so small. I can't even see the boxes.

28:51.000 --> 28:57.000
I'm trying to decide on white cheddar versus yellow cheddar. Get them both. They're like 49 cents each.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
Really? Yeah. That's actually kind of interesting.

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
I'm glad we had this. Alright. I'm heading out. Let's nice meeting you. No, we should keep this going. You want to do?

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Sorry. I'm on the phone. You want to do drum on the phone.

29:08.000 --> 29:13.000
Yeah. There's this fucking weird ask guy trying to talk to me next to the powdered.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
Is this now we could do a drum? Is his lower half like trade or shape?

29:16.000 --> 29:24.000
Yeah. He's a Russian nesting dog. I saw that same guy at the D.A.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
He's every has this energy that invites you into conversation.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
But as soon as you do, it's that I mentioned it's called.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Yes. And that's sort of a new option.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
No, like it's sort of a new option. I thought you were just lightly tipping.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
But then he falls back up. Like you do a pick.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
You can get me. I can do a picnic.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I would not top or bottom. He could do it.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Just be a picnic as a picnic as a picnic.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
I would be a parking lot. He won't stop talking.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
I'm going to call him a bomb threat.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Click.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Alright. That was really good.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
We got somewhere with that one.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Small talk. Yeah.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
Because you made it worth his while.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
You're while.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Hmm? Nothing.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Alright. That's Abilan.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
He was just impersonating like an acting coach.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
I see.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Because you made it worth his while.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
You found the wand.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
The wisdom.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
The wand was there.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Yeah.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
And if I do say so myself.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
That was easy.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Here we go.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
That's Abilan.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
I'm at the bar.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
I'm getting it to content.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
You come up to me.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Here we go.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Did you order already?

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
I would love to spread your legs.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
What?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Did you like?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Sorry.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Sorry.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Yeah.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
He keeps walking out to people saying that he'd love to spread their legs.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
No.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
You say that to women.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
That's what I'm going to tell you.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
You say that to women.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
I'm going to tell you.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
At this bar.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Am I the first person you said?

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
You said that.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
You said that.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
You said that.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Was the first person you said that to a woman?

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Was she uncomfortable?

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
No.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
It was the balance.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Are you here to make people feel uncomfortable?

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
No.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
I'm here to spread the shit with sentences like that.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
Because it is inappropriate in 2022.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
We're all coming out of a pandemic.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
And we want some normalcy and fun.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
And we don't need your bullshit.

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
With lines like that, making us feel uncomfortable to see a concert again.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
So I get it.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Maybe there's a hidden camera.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
And you think there's some cute bullshit.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
And you're trying to get some clicks.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
But cut the shit with the spreading the legs bullshit.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
And if you say that to my wife.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
And if you say that to any of her friends.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
You will have a serious fucking problem on your hands.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
All right, Guy.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Take your beer and get the fuck out of here.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
I can't take it to go.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
What's that?

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
I can't take the burger to go.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Get it away from me and my friends.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Yeah.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
All right.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
A trip.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
You said you recently talked like that to a bartender.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Oh, my God.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Yeah.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
You actually did that.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
I did.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
It was much shorter than that.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
But this guy was fucking asshole.

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
He asked me to show my vaccination on my phone and my license in the bar in the bar.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
We've already crossed him.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
But that's not the issue.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
I will never be like, no, I'm already in the bar.

32:01.000 --> 32:06.000
So I'm trying to show him my license with the light of my phone.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
But I'm showing him my license and the light of my phone this way.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
And I can't get the lighting right.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
And after like 10 seconds of trying five seconds trying,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
he looks to be like, come on, Guy.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
And I was just like.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
And I literally put them down.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
I was like, mother fucker, I am trying to help you out.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
All I bought is a drink for me and my wife.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Don't come on, Guy.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Me.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
I'm trying to show you my license.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
You said that to him?

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Yeah, it was very angry.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
He was provoked.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
He was provoking me.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
I don't just fly off the hand.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
What?

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
What bar was this?

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Zem, you long.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
It was.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
He almost had golf.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
He's probably afraid of this face.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I don't promote violence except with Jeff.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
Which is actually peace.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
It creates peace.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
So what did he say when you were so mean to him?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
He was just afraid.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
He was in a mood.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
You could tell that he was in a mood.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
I see.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
But I was also in a bad mood.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Yeah.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
He said mother fucker is the beginning of a set.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
And Marie and was like, the eye roll.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Oh, really?

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
It was like, I'm comfortable a little moment.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
What?

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
What bar was?

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Some cocktail bar and echo park.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Bar floors.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Maybe.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
You don't remember?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
No, I don't remember restaurant names or movie titles.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
This is the two things.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Nope.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
All right.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Here you go.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
At the Hedgeham Studio.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Oh, what?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
No one is here.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
See and feel joy from your face.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
So we're just recording a podcast.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Let's say.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
Okay.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
It's time for a bond of the week.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Yeah.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
It seems like you're just bringing that segment up.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
So you can sing a Beyonce song.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Yeah.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Yeah.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
It's funny because like doing this show,

33:46.000 --> 33:53.000
I sort of put on a visage of a visage and a natural word to say.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
This one moment was sort of a wrinkle in time,

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
where I could kind of sort of be myself and it didn't feel good

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
because I sort of, I brown out really.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Right.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Even when I black out, I brown out for obvious reasons.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
And if this is what you guys feel, this energy,

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
I cannot apologize more than I am.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Then I am in the moment.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
It's me.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Oh.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Appreciate it.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
So.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
So sorry.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Yeah.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Except.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
But do you forgive?

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
I accept, but I don't forgive.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Yeah.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
So I understand that you feel that and that's good.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
But at the same time, I'm not going to just like take it.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Now we're back to you.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Yeah.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
And honestly, like I haven't heard of where you said,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I've just been watching your acting choices throughout the process.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
And I can like register that you're sad.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
What for?

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
No, but it's not acting.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
It's like, this is, this is real.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
This is it.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
It's real.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
It's exactly feeling how I am being.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
I don't know.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
I don't let the rice.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
Shine on me.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Okay.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
This is flirty.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
I don't like it.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
All right.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Here we go.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Let the rice.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
Shine on.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Where does he go?

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
That was bad small talk.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
We had more.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
There is more.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
But we have to move on.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
So for the record, I don't go up to people, especially women in sad.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Like spread your legs.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Right.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
That was just for the bit.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
It was just for a podcast.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
Yeah.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
These are essentially noise canceling headphones.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
I have no idea what you two were just talking about.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
It doesn't matter.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
It's not because of the music.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
There's just things covering my ears.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
It's kind of like you're out of loud bar and people are talking.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
I can't take that.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
What?

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
It's like you're out of loud concert and people are talking.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
I can't play with this thing.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
I can't play with this thing.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Yeah.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
I do hear the music.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Yeah.

35:46.000 --> 35:55.000
Prices right.

35:55.000 --> 36:06.000
Welcome to the price of Christ.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
This is the price of Christ.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Do you guys know Christ?

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
No.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
It's K-R-E-I-S-S.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
Dude.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Yeah.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
My friends.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
That's my friend's family's business.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Are you kidding me?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
The furniture business.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Jesus.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
So you better be good at this.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Yeah.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Well, who's your friend that runs?

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Is his name Christ?

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
You know Nick Christ?

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
He used to run punked?

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
No.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Yeah.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
He used to run punked.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Yeah.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
And he was like worked with Ashdenculture a bunch.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Wow.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
So this is his family's furniture.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
It's like a goliath.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
It's like restoration hardware level.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Pretty fancy, pretty expensive.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
Although I don't want to give you too many hints because this is the price of Christ.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
So I'm going to show you various pieces of furniture.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Keep in mind.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
This is all aftermarket.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Oh.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
What does that mean?

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
It means it's being sold secondhand.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Okay.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
It's not going to be retail.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
And you bought it from them.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
And now you're selling it.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
And you want to see how much you start for it.

36:59.000 --> 37:03.000
I got it at retail slash ad nauseam because I was sort of in a frenzy.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
I couldn't get enough of Christ.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
And yeah, I need to fucking free up some cash.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
So this is going to be the price of Christ.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
This is for actual cash.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Oh.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Okay.

37:13.000 --> 37:18.000
So for every right answer, let's say 25 bucks because I can swing that.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Okay.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
For every wrong answer, it's 25 owed to me.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
Which is kind of fucked up that I kind of begged for your time.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
We're not going to pay you on a chance.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Never.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
It is price of Christ rules.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
So you know, close this gas over.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Yeah.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Here we go.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Do not look at my screen.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Please because I do have this the price.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
I'm going to tilt my thing.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Here we go.

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
This is two lounge chairs with an Ottoman.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Certainly is.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
This looks old.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Very.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
This is like from the early 80s.

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
And it also looks weathered as if like various generations of family members have already sat on.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
It's like the top one is so dark.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
It's almost like it's almost fake.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Like there's hints of blue with the rest of it.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
This is this matte black sheet.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
The seats are leather leather.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Yeah.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
That's awful.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
They're leather seats and fat.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
That's awful.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
It's Christ.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Yeah.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Jesus Christ.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
That's their special slogan that I've been pitching to them.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Yeah.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
What do we think?

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
For the whole setting.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
For the whole set.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
So old as a set.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
899.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Yeah.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
899 dollars.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Yeah.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
I'm going to say 16.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Black.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
1600 flat.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Wow.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
See.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
But one of you can't just be right.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
So I'm going to say let's say it has to be close enough.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
But without going over.

38:37.000 --> 38:43.000
So this is being sold on first dibs for $5,800 dollars.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Oh.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
It's because of leather seats.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Really?

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
What is it?

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
It looks awful.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Yeah.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
It's pretty good.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
But I guess that's Christ for you.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
It looks like the absence of sea.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Oh.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
That's around old couch.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Yeah.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
Is that the Friends couch?

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
That's a central perk.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Yeah.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
That's central perk.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
It's a deep, deep leather.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Yeah.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
That is a deep.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
We're looking at a three-seater.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Roll arm.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
And correct me if I'm wrong.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
But I think it might be a polyester cotton blend.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
With a...

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Imagine us correcting you.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
I can't correct you.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
Faster though.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Let's get $6,400.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
$6,400.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Yeah.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
I mean, I was so off in the last one that I'll say 9, 9, 9, 9.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
So almost 10.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
That one was 1850.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
1800?

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Yep.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
So I won.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
I was said I hired.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
9, 9, 9, 9.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
That's almost 10,000 dollars.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
He's right.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Every little often.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Glass coffee table.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
I fainted.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
This is one of these ones.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
This is through it.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Through it.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
My mom found me.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
Wait, what?

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Oh my god.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
This is how I found out that I have to eat more sugar.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
I have low blood sugar.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
And when I was a little kid, I got up too fast.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
And then I just went down.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
I went right through the table.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Let's go.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
No cuts.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
And my mom didn't process it.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
She was bad about the table.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
And then an hour later, she just broke down into yours.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Like she suddenly realized everything that could have just happened.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
Wow.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Really scary.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
They say like, get up too fast.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
But everyone gets up at roughly the same speed.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
It's not like you're now getting up slower because of that.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
It's almost like there has to be issues different.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
The issue is different than the speed at which you're getting up.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Yeah.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
That's usually the like the thing that like tips that I exactly.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Anyway, faith is three.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
It's not enough to just say something and an interesting tone.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
You have to have substance to what you're saying.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
And I think that one of us here could really learn from that.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
And that is you because you say wisdom every eighth word.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
What do we think?

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Fourteen ninety guys.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Fourteen ninety nine.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Looks like good glass.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Okay.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
This is totally not my aesthetic.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
I don't like this like thick metal golf.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
I'm over three.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
I'm over four hundred and ninety nine dollars.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Yeah.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Casey, would you put this in your house?

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
No, not at all.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Fourteen ninety nine.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
Four nine nine.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
Yeah.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Four nine nine.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
I'm going to give that to a mirror.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
It's five forty four five hundred forty four dollars.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
So that's twenty five dollars in a mirror's pocket.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
That pays for the the fucking hot dog you ate.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
It's more.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
It certainly is.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.000
It was not a hot dog.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
It was not a hot dog.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
There did not have a spirit of hot dog though.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
It was the long thin turkey career.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Crescent witch.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
It was a yardstick.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
It was a yardstick.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
A unit of measurement.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
We should go to.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I finished a yard house.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
On the downtown sports bar.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
What?

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Nothing.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Next.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
All right.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Um.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Wait.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Why did you choose this game?

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Like I'm not if you're trying to be.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
I mean, probably.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
What price.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
But he ran into the word.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Oh, it was.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Okay.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
And then he wanted to do price of rice.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Got a sequel.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Yep.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
And this.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
This is just awful haunted bed frame.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Yes.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Much for this haunted bed frame.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
I have a trip of phobia.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
I don't know if you guys have that.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
It's like the fear of holes.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Oh, yeah.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
I hear that's not an actual real thing.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
If you.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Sure.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
That's not an actual phobia.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
That.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
It's like classified.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
It's an official of fear.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
I don't know what you have.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
But um.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
It's not that.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
But like I've heard that before.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
He needs this.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
It's like it's like a leaf that has like a bunch of like.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
Dots in it because and like insects have eaten it.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
Yeah.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
That triggers it.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Oh, no.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Sorry.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Eh.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
$800.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
$900.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Holy shit.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
$9.61.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
So why are you so excited like he nailed it?

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Because he kind of did.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
Not really.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
I was closer with my last one.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
$60 off.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
You act like he absolutely spiked the right price.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
I just am excited to give out money.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Okay.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
I love sharing.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Yeah.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Oh.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
awful.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Piral these are treasure chests.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
These are sorts.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
Gorgeous set of nightstands.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
No.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I mean, the drawers on the front.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
They really come like a lot of light and dark material.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
It's on some of them.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
It's so heavy looking.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
It looks like a.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
It's a.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
I'm on the rice.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
I'm not.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
Yeah.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
That is a tune there.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Yeah.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
I'm going to watch for the Egyptian tool of $1900.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
Okay.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
And Billy.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
I'm going to price that up.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
I'm going to say $4200.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
$1250.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Here we go.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
We're running out of time.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
Here we go.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
We're finding these prices if they're after market.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
Right next to the image.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
That's why I had to go after market.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
Because crisis.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Well, what?

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
What website are you using to search after market?

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
Christ's furniture.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
First dibs, coyote, cherish.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
The sorority.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
Oh.

43:50.000 --> 43:59.000
I drove back down to USC and just asked them how much money was in their living room.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
awful awful stuff.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Love the legs.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
Marble on top of cement.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
It's kind of the opposite of Jeff's legs.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
Yeah.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
I think it's thicker than the lower you go down.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
Yeah.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
Exactly.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
That looks like it way is a couple tons.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
Yeah.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Like real tons.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
And then let's get a marble top.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Okay.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
It's even more weight.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
I'm here.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
You got to guess?

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
I'll say $1,999.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
That's what I was going to say.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
All right.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
You're both wrong.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
$1,400.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
What?

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
$1,400.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
And here we go.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
What is that?

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
I knew you were going to see this.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
What is that?

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
That's a bet to add to each other's image.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Because I had your fucking voice man.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
What is that?

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
So fucking sled.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
What is that?

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
That's either a bed frame or it is a magazine bookhole.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
It's a sled frame.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
It's a sled frame.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
It's a sled frame.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
It's a sled frame.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
It's in there.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
No.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
It's just a bed frame.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
It looks disgusting.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
It looks like something out of.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
It's a wrong angle to take the photo.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Yeah.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
That's what I'm saying.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
That's the primary image.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
You can't.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Yeah.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
That could be the size of an eight and a half by 11 sheet of paper.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Do you like to sleep in the shape of the letter V?

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Or can we do it in the bed frame for you?

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
Yeah.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
You can't tell.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
You need the other angle.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Unless you're sleeping at like a taco.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Right.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
If you like sleep across it.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
As if it's almost like a bun.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
I think that's the only way you're sleeping in that bed frame.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
It's right now.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
It's about.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
It's about a bow bed.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
A bow bed.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
A bow to bed.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
Yeah.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
I mean, that's just too quality to be cheap.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
I'm saying it's big and leather.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
That's leather.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
Yeah.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
It's leather.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
I would take some wood.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Well, there's wood.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
And then there's the tan part.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
It's only interesting to talk about it for so long before you put it in

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
Guess.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
You made the game.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
So we're going to take part time.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
$3,000.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
I'm going to quadruple that.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
12k.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
Wow.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
12 or $2,630.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Got it.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Yeah.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
So I mean, you can pull out of this game too.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
You can just like move out.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Two big concrete balls.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
Yeah.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
Big big balls.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Two big dice.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
A block shot in a just a void of a world.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
$500 each.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Like they don't show you where in the living room.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
You could put these massive cement cubes.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
Yeah.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
A house filled with this furniture is no home for me.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
I know what you mean.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I'm going to say it's $100.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
And I know what you mean.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
That's $3,000.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
Yeah.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
I said $500 each.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
I'm realizing that people listen to this as a podcast as well.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
So they're not like seeing any of these beds or dice.

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
Well, we've been sort of corporately forced to make it a video podcast.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
So just watch it on YouTube.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
But is this the best approach?

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
What's that?

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Is this the best approach to making a video experience?

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
Like what you have to season performers here.

46:46.000 --> 46:51.000
You know, you could probably just have us like be and exist together as opposed to, you know,

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
knowing that some dice of dice.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
Yeah.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
The price is dice.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
Did it to do how much is the price of these price dice?

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
$3,000 for the set.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
Right.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
I'll take one for the price of a MacBook Pro, please.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
I am peaking over at Jeff's computer right now.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
And he has a buffer exercise.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
Oh.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Gotta work that timing, guys.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
You know, Adam Lustick and I made a song.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Sampling the song.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
Really?

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
Oh, yeah.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
Is it available?

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
Can we listen to it?

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
Oh, we can listen to it.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
What do I look up?

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Snakes the jam.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
It's a great song.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Snakes the jam.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I don't know if it's going to be on YouTube.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
It'll be on Bandcamp.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
I believe it's on an album called The Network Takeover,

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
in which we remix television theme songs.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Wow, that's a smart idea.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
And then wrapped over them.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
One, two, three.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
This is the jam.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Nice.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
It's a summer pop song.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Yeah.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
No.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
I feel like this is, yeah.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Oh, I've heard this.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Oh, this is good.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
I've heard this song.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
No joke.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Wow.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
Who's singing?

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
A friend Chloe.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
That's Jua Lipa.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
Yeah.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
You take the prices right.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
Add a little drum and bass.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
So when you release the showcase, show down with my kids.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
Know how we got the same feeling like here in Bandcamp.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
I think we've got some of you to single summer anthem.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
A jam to be slammed from a Hampton stands club.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I was crazy in love with hey y'all.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
Now I agree.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
The envelope with Bob Barker.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
Yeah.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Haha.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
This is the jam.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
Bob Barker.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
There's also Adam Lustock.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
Yeah.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
Does he know he's another male in here?

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Say again.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
Is there another dude?

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Is there another dude?

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
Yeah.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Clayton.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Wow.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Clayton.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Clayton, early in Chloe we're up.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
Bob Barker.

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
We made it through another 48 minutes of nonsense.

48:47.000 --> 48:51.000
It's been a Monday.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
Okay.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
It's been a Monday.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
It's been bad.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Haha.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
Why are you happy about it?

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Because it's over.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Haha.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
Plugs.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
What do you guys have going on before doing this on Zoom?

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
Uh, in terms of how much fun I have.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
I like doing it in studio.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
But I said this last week.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
It is harder to do it to be actually mean.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
Yeah.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
So I am worried that the listeners are going to be like.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
This is different.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
Interesting.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
But I'll work up my confidence.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Yeah.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
To be really.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
Uh.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Maybe we can buy a screen in here.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
In between us and Jeff.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Oh, that's what feels a little more confident to be.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
You could just be a belief behind the screen, but still in the same room.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
Exactly.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Well, we have three weeks till 100.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
So.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Yeah.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
We've three weeks to 100th episode.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
Wow.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
A lot of ideas.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
Crazy.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
What are you thinking for the big one zero zero?

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
I'm not going to show my hand on air.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
But I'll tell you after we stop recording.

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
Did the first episode take place during quarantine?

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Yeah.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
It was late April 2020, I think.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Wow.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
Right after.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Yeah.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
It was probably a byproduct of.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
Yeah.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
It was supposed to be a quarantine.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
Podcast where we got to see how the network was like, you know,

50:03.000 --> 50:07.000
doing the stuff working from home.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
And then somewhere on the late summer.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
And then the decision was made the Jeff will host a rise.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Were you the host the whole time?

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
I don't think so.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
I think I'm.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
I think it was I may be vaguely Marie.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
And I, but I don't think so.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
Jeff wasn't even in the first 10 episode.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
I have a website.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Billyscafiri.me.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
Really?

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Is that no?

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
No.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
It's been around.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
But you can see my work there.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
If you're interested in sports videos and comedy,

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
you can see my work there.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
I'm here and I host a podcast together.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
A basketball podcast called.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Buckets and basketball is heating up.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
So we're going to record some more episodes asap.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
Lot of action.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Your Cleveland Cavaliers might miss the playoffs.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
I know.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
It's.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
Bucked.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
You peaked really early.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Well, we just have injuries.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
It's probably out.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
Still.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
And Jared Allen still.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
Jared.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
There was a statistic that like we were like.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
Fifteen and three or something with Jared Allen in the line up.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
And then without him, it's we were like.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
Fif five.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
So sex didn't know Rubio.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
MVP buzz.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Yeah.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
Jared Allen.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
He has my vote.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
It's got my vote too.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
But next year.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
But yeah, Buckets and no joke on the head.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
Come to work.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
Listen to those, please.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
That's fine, too.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
Nice.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
At Jeff Boyardy on Twitter.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
Quietly.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
At Jeff Boyardy.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
Actually.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Oh, also snakesmusic.bantcamp.com.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
Yeah.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
You want to listen to more music.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Thanks for.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
For music.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Dot Bantcamp.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
I'm almost a 10,000 Twitter followers.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
So tell your friends.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
I tweet.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
Pretty good shit.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
And.

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
Do you want to tell the listeners about.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
The seven tweets.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
The seven tweets.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
The seven tweets.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
The seven.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
Yes.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
Do you want to remember the origin of that?

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
Well, we'll do.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
I know the origin of that.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
Do you want to very briefly?

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
Yeah.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
You texted me that actor Finn.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
The three of me and that actor Finn.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Yeah.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
You thought I was his friend Billy.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Does he have a friend named Billy?

52:12.000 --> 52:17.000
Oh, I tried to make a group chat with me, Finn and Billy Brick.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Yes.

52:18.000 --> 52:23.000
This like, like, very complicated bit that obviously I wasn't supposed to be a part of and didn't want to be a part of.

52:23.000 --> 52:28.000
And I said, uh, to make up for this, you owe me seven tweets by my design.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
Yeah.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
We created a character named Andy.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
With an eye.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
With an eye.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
And you tweeted as I had to eat for a couple of.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
Yeah.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
And then he liked it so much.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
I think he.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
Over deliver.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
This is going to be the summer.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
I saw it in our garlic and he just produced it.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
I was just like, this is no longer a punishment.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
This is a game.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
The return of Andy.

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
And then someone who didn't follow me named Andy and the eye retweeted it.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
And then I quote tweeted that no fucking way.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
I think my favorite was Andy's tweets are dishwasher safe.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
You came up with that.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
Yeah.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
Yeah.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
And there it was on the timeline.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
And yeah, he tweeted fire.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
Not that bad.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
No.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
Yeah.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
I'm trying to put it in.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
And it was so.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
It wasn't anything.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
That's true.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
And neither is Twitter.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
So there's low stakes there.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
Yeah.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
But almost 10,000 followers folks.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
Wow.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
And follow.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
If you don't want to see 700.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
700 more followers.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
I think ish till 10,000.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
And we'll do something special on the show for the.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
Maybe the 10,000 and the 100th episode can come together.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
Join four.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
If I could get 800 new followers in the next three weeks.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
That would be.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
That would be fun to have telethon style.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Just like a overlay.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Are we going to be gone there?

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
All I need is a retweet for me, really.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Because I always pick up followers and droves.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
So I just needed to tweet something worthy of the retweet.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
So far, nothing yet.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
But hey, you keep on at it.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
Who knows what will happen.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
Yeah.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Maybe if Andy makes his return.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
That's what you read to me.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
I'm more of an Andy guy.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
Same.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
Love it.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
I also like Rodney.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
You're clothing altering.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
Yeah.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
I am going to spring clean actually soon.

54:03.000 --> 54:08.000
And Rodney's closet will be making a grand reveal slash return.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
On investment.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
So please look out for that.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
Rodney's death dot closet on Instagram.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Rodney's death dot.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
And we got a lot of, we got a lot of sweats.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
We got a lot of eyebrows.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
Yeah.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
Concerned.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
I played Gaston in a musical of Beauty and the Beast in eighth grade.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
Is actually developed these muscles as I was a growing boy.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
Wow.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Were you really Gaston?

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Yeah.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
Dude.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
We got to see some photos on social media.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
Do you have any pictures?

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
Yeah.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
We'd love to see them.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
We'll do it the next time you're on.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
Great.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Thanks so much for listening guys to this week's episode.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
We'll see you guys in the next week.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
Until next week.

54:45.000 --> 54:49.000
That's does folks.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
Huh?

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
That's does.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
So it's the hard got.

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
That was a hit dumb original.

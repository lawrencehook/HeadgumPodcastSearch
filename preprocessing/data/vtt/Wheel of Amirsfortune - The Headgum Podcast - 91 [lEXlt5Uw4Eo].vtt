00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.800
Thank you to diet smoke for sponsoring this episode of our show guys we've all been there.

00:10.800 --> 00:16.000
You know you take a cannabis edible and you get way too high.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.440
Well that's where diet smoke comes in, alright?

00:18.440 --> 00:22.360
It can be difficult to control your dose just right and there's nothing worse than being

00:22.360 --> 00:24.680
baked out of your mind when you didn't plan on it.

00:24.680 --> 00:29.280
But that's why when I need the perfect medium high, I hit up my friends at diet smoke for

00:29.280 --> 00:32.680
their delicious Delta 8 THC gummies.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.160
Diet smoke isn't light, it's just right.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.320
So what exactly is Delta 8?

00:36.320 --> 00:40.400
Well Delta 8 is simply a less potent THC.

00:40.400 --> 00:43.960
The THC that you're probably most familiar with is Delta 9 and while both are natural

00:43.960 --> 00:48.440
to the cannabis plant, Diet smoke actually extracts their Delta 8 from hemp.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.160
Some may call this a loophole.

00:50.160 --> 00:55.120
I call it the secret recipe to getting a smooth, stable and most importantly, legal high.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.600
Diet smoke is legal in most states and it's non-prescription, just check Diet smoke's website

00:58.600 --> 01:01.440
to see if they ship their delicious gummies to your state.

01:01.440 --> 01:05.080
Now you're probably asking yourself does Diet smoke really get you high?

01:05.080 --> 01:06.400
Of course.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.640
The high you get with Diet smoke is best described as somewhere between the chillness

01:09.640 --> 01:14.040
of CBD and that classic stone feeling you get with regular weed.

01:14.040 --> 01:17.600
Plus Diet smoke comes in two delicious flavors, blue raspberry and watermelon.

01:17.600 --> 01:22.640
I've always loved blue raspberry flavored things, but I mean, America is a fiend for

01:22.640 --> 01:27.200
Diet smoke's watermelon gummies, I say, maybe try them both.

01:27.200 --> 01:31.920
But when to CBD isn't enough and traditional THC is too much, enjoy the smooth buzz

01:31.920 --> 01:33.320
of Diet smoke.

01:33.320 --> 01:38.120
Each gummy is infused with 10 milligrams of Delta 8 THC derived from American grown

01:38.120 --> 01:39.120
hemp.

01:39.120 --> 01:43.240
Delta 8 gummies are low in sugar, fat free and delicious and did I mention their

01:43.240 --> 01:44.240
legal?

01:44.240 --> 01:47.960

02:07.200 --> 02:07.920
Thanks, Diet smoke.

02:25.640 --> 02:31.320
Sorry, I have to, I have to check one thing.

02:31.320 --> 02:34.120
And you never know if it's really part of the show or not.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.120
And that's never, yeah.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.960
Or you can, you know, Jeffrey pretty well, what do you think?

02:37.960 --> 02:38.960
This is a bit.

02:38.960 --> 02:42.640
This is free plan, or this is a genuine confine.

02:42.640 --> 02:46.960
I think this is a genuine confusion.

02:46.960 --> 02:51.560
I thought so too, but now that he's back with a chain.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.560
Same glass.

02:52.560 --> 02:53.560
Oh my god.

02:53.560 --> 02:54.560
Mars?

02:54.560 --> 02:55.560
Mars?

02:55.560 --> 02:56.560
No.

02:56.560 --> 02:59.560
No, this is Hilary Duff for Glass as USA.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.560
Beautiful.

03:00.560 --> 03:01.560
Thank you.

03:01.560 --> 03:08.120
Don't be mad about that.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.600
That was not how I wanted to start the show.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.600
So sorry.

03:12.600 --> 03:13.600
Are you doing?

03:13.600 --> 03:14.600
Come on a chain, also.

03:14.600 --> 03:15.600
There was nothing.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.600
She was on one second.

03:18.600 --> 03:25.600
I forgot my jewelry for this podcast.

03:25.600 --> 03:26.600
I don't want to be.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.600
I need to put an aura ring on.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.600
Oh, that's a track me.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.600
I'm your one second, actually.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.600
Please, everybody.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.600
Welcome to the show.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.600
Kayla Moriarty.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.600
One of Edgham's newest tires.

03:39.600 --> 03:40.600
Man.

03:40.600 --> 03:41.600
Hi.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.600
I've got both of us on it.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.600
I'm sorry to do this, but we're going to have to do Kayla's

03:48.600 --> 03:49.600
right off the top.

03:49.600 --> 03:50.600
Two minutes on the clock.

03:50.600 --> 03:51.600
Nobody else can speak.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.600
Kayla, why don't you tell us what you want us to know about you.

03:54.600 --> 03:55.600
Oh, my god.

03:55.600 --> 03:56.600
Okay.

03:56.600 --> 03:57.600
I'm Kayla.

03:57.600 --> 04:01.600
I am a female living in Brooklyn.

04:01.600 --> 04:05.600
I am from the great state of Rhode Island, which is where Nary Ganset

04:05.600 --> 04:06.600
Beer is from.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.600
So we can talk about that later.

04:08.600 --> 04:09.600
Not New York, Jeff.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.600
Not New York.

04:10.600 --> 04:11.600
Thank you.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.600
As an beer center, you should know that.

04:14.600 --> 04:15.600
Yeah.

04:15.600 --> 04:20.600
I really like Nary Ganset Beer and all beers and alcohol general.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.600
I also have a dog named Ferris.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.600
He is sequestered in a room back there.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.600
He's very cute.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.600
What else?

04:29.600 --> 04:31.600
I like to read tarot cards.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.600
I like spooky things.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.600
I also am still this is so long.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.600
Okay.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.600
I'm getting pretty good at crossword puzzles.

04:40.600 --> 04:44.600
I am now on the Wednesday, New York Times booklet of 50.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.600
I'm determined to get to Sunday by the end of the year.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.600
Um, and we're now on the Libra.

04:50.600 --> 04:51.600
Um, fuck.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.600
This is very long.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.600
Let's see.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.600
Wait, when is when is your birthday?

04:56.600 --> 04:57.600
October 10th.

04:57.600 --> 04:58.600
When's your birthday?

04:58.600 --> 05:00.600
October 22nd.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.600
Wow.

05:01.600 --> 05:02.600
Wow.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.600
Are the Libra, the Libra crew is going back out again.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.600
Like Kayla's brothers.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.600
I.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.600
I was so sorry.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.600
I was told everyone would be quiet.

05:10.600 --> 05:11.600
I don't know.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.600
Thank you.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.600
I really like New Works, which we just discussed off camera.

05:16.600 --> 05:20.600
But Rick and I both had the same print, which is knives.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.600
And Rick and I both used to tap dance.

05:23.600 --> 05:28.600
So I think at the company off site, we should wear our knives outfit and perform a tap dance.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.600
So we should start rehearsals soon.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.600
That works.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.600
Thank you so much.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.600
Okay.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.600
Uh.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.600
Great.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.600
Um, my social security number.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.600
No.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.600
Oh.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.600
I wish it.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.600
I'm really happy to be here.

05:45.600 --> 05:50.600
And I'm going to sit for five seconds and reflect on how wonderful this is.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.600
Namaste.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.600
Thank you so much.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.600
Just be careful.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.600
Thank you.

05:54.600 --> 05:55.600
Yeah, I didn't make a noise Jeff.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.600
See you now to put your phone up to you.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.600
Wow.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.600
Yeah.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.600
No back at it again on a Friday.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.600
Casual or otherwise.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.600
Kayla's already bringing the heat.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.600
And you're also the first of the new hires.

06:10.600 --> 06:17.600
You're the new class to kind of enter what has become known as the Thunderdome.

06:17.600 --> 06:21.600
And where is that sound effect?

06:21.600 --> 06:22.600
Ferris.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.600
You're searching.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.600
The sucks.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.600
I'll just do this and lose the ad revenue.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.600
This girl.

06:27.600 --> 06:28.600
Oh my god.

06:30.600 --> 06:31.600
Major Kieler.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.600
When you start a new job dive into the company culture,

06:34.600 --> 06:37.600
that's what Mori Arties doing here in her otherwise.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.600
And I have to call out Casey's ass.

06:40.600 --> 06:41.600
Why?

06:45.600 --> 06:46.600
Forget it.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.600
I knew you guys wouldn't understand.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.600
Let's move on to.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.600
Got this sucks.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.600
Bond of the week.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.600
Every week until next James Bond is cast.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.600
We're going to be giving our picks.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.600
Kayla for the new James.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.600
And this is my pick is Tim Cook.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.600
Just because I feel like he's not doing much at all.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.600
So he has the time.

07:12.600 --> 07:17.600
You've picked one of the busiest men in America because he has the time.

07:17.600 --> 07:21.600
Tim Cook also wear a turtleneck like an honor.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.600
Steve Jobs.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.600
It's a good question.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.600
I feel like that's fitting of James Bond, right?

07:27.600 --> 07:28.600
Yeah.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.600
I guess so.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.600
I don't know if he does.

07:32.600 --> 07:33.600
Yeah.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.600
Is Dan Stevens.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.600
Really?

07:37.600 --> 07:39.600
He doesn't know.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.600
He doesn't know.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.600
He doesn't know who that is.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.600
I do not know who that is.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.600
He's Dan Stevens.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.600
He sounds like my friend.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.600
He's Dan.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.600
Back there.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.600
He was in.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.600
Down to an Abby.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.600
He was in.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.600
Down to an Abby.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.600
He was in that Eurovision movie.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.600
On Netflix.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.600
Of course.

08:04.600 --> 08:05.600
Great.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.600
Great range.

08:06.600 --> 08:07.600
Great guy.

08:07.600 --> 08:08.600
Wow.

08:08.600 --> 08:09.600
Thank you.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.600
Good.

08:10.600 --> 08:11.600

08:11.600 --> 08:12.600

08:12.600 --> 08:13.600

08:22.600 --> 08:23.600

08:23.600 --> 08:24.600
Up.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.600
Up.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.600
Up.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.600
Up.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.600
Up.

08:28.600 --> 08:29.600
Up.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.600
Up.

08:30.600 --> 08:31.600
Leadership.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.600
Out.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.600
Do people give?

08:33.600 --> 08:34.600
Up.

08:34.600 --> 08:35.600
Up.

08:35.600 --> 08:36.600
Up.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.600
Up.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.600

08:39.600 --> 08:40.600

08:40.600 --> 08:42.600
Up.

08:42.600 --> 08:43.600
Up.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.600
Up.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.600
Up.

08:46.600 --> 08:47.600
Up.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.600
Up.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.600
Up.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.600
Up.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.600
Up.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.600
Up.

08:57.600 --> 09:04.400
I think he's a he's a small forward. Oh, I thought you said a role player. Oh, yeah, he's a role that's like he's not like a star

09:04.400 --> 09:08.960
But like you know, he's like the 7th through 10th man on a pretty good basketball team

09:08.960 --> 09:12.000
So it's like a god sure. Yeah, he's a role player on

09:12.000 --> 09:18.400
I think he's still in the nuggets. Launch show her non-gomers. You're talking about like our pages. Yeah

09:19.440 --> 09:25.920
No got no, but he has a brother named Willie her non-gomers also in the NBA. So what is that Jeff?

09:26.880 --> 09:28.880
Nice

09:28.880 --> 09:30.880
Wow

09:30.880 --> 09:32.880
Didn't you post on Twitter?

09:34.880 --> 09:36.880
Yeah, he's been sort of melting that one

09:39.600 --> 09:42.800
I was like watching us on the jazz now. So he's got plenty of free time

09:43.680 --> 09:44.880
Utah

09:44.880 --> 09:51.200
It's great. Well, he's still like 82 games right traveling with a playoff team. So not really has tons of time

09:52.240 --> 09:54.240
More time than Tim hook cook

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
So that's how you want to play it today, huh?

09:58.720 --> 10:01.600
You want to come for the fucking dirty play and for free already

10:03.680 --> 10:05.440
Not really this sure you have to up

10:06.160 --> 10:08.480
Yeah, that's not I'm here for it

10:09.040 --> 10:11.040
No, he's who we took

10:13.200 --> 10:14.080
No, really

10:15.040 --> 10:20.240
Kay, like what is what has your experience been ahead gum so far? You've been here before we didn't ask for her bond to the week

10:20.240 --> 10:25.760
Yeah, do I do I do I do you bond to the week sure okay sticking with athletes this is the

10:25.760 --> 10:30.160
most relevant athlete that I know about cream and dual jubar. I just think

10:33.360 --> 10:39.200
It's got comedic chops which you know could bring a safe good on that's true

10:39.520 --> 10:42.560
Great on your plane airplane airplane great on new girl

10:43.360 --> 10:46.000
Yeah, what about cream of dual juband

10:46.880 --> 10:48.880
Caramel dual Jamie's gone

10:49.760 --> 10:54.960
That's really good. That's the shit that the show is for Marika

10:55.760 --> 10:58.320
We're finding gold. We're my great content

11:01.040 --> 11:06.240
The crazy thing about Karim is that he's also one of the best basketball players ever he's not just like a random basketball player

11:06.880 --> 11:11.360
Is you really about it now you're pushing it wow now you're pushing what we can keep talking about a cream

11:11.360 --> 11:16.800
It build your bond like we should that was an edit point possibly the best basketball player every year

11:19.680 --> 11:25.600
If you combine like high school college and NBA nobody scored more points than crumim dual jubar in basketball history

11:26.400 --> 11:32.080
You know his high school scoring record must have been like a hundred and thirty or something and same like that

11:34.960 --> 11:36.960
sucks

11:36.960 --> 11:40.320
Great this sucks. Are you allowed to sweep it at this show?

11:42.320 --> 11:48.960
We really should and there's lots of times that call for it and Jeff does not take the bait

11:52.480 --> 11:54.480
Wow

11:56.240 --> 12:00.560
For all intents and purposes as we bet it of sorts

12:01.200 --> 12:03.200
full steam ahead

12:03.200 --> 12:05.200
Kayla you you've been at hegan for four weeks

12:05.760 --> 12:12.480
Yes, what let's go rose bud thorn and start with thorn and it you're throwing can't just be Marty

12:14.400 --> 12:16.400
That's mean

12:17.920 --> 12:19.920
You should have that as a sound bite

12:21.760 --> 12:23.760
That's me

12:24.000 --> 12:26.480
And play it after literally everything you say

12:29.920 --> 12:31.920
Okay thorn

12:32.320 --> 12:34.800
It's it's hard-searning a job remote. I will say

12:36.000 --> 12:41.200
So I'm excited to meet everyone in person so that will thorn will disappear

12:43.040 --> 12:50.080
But is everyone who works here is just lovely and very funny and I love our slack threads

12:51.040 --> 12:55.920
I'm I think the word all one is getting a little out of control with now three different games

12:56.640 --> 12:57.840
Yeah

12:57.840 --> 13:03.600
What is it a word all quarter which is four? Worldals at once and then the pod and then no world

13:04.400 --> 13:12.000
World I've never felt so insecure about my lack of like special reasoning and knowledge because I can't I've never won a world all

13:12.320 --> 13:17.760
Except for the New Zealand one. Yeah, the New Zealand I was shocked that Jake did not get the New Zealand one in one

13:17.760 --> 13:23.360
That's dumb. He loves New Zealand. He loves New Zealand. I love to say what today's was because I walked away without

13:23.360 --> 13:25.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you say what it was it?

13:25.840 --> 13:31.680
Oh, a dollar a word all world world. Oh, yeah, I didn't do though. I didn't have I haven't done today's world

13:31.680 --> 13:36.240
Old but feel free to that spoil it because I don't know if I'll get around to doing the world

13:37.280 --> 13:41.680
Did you get did you do the blurdle? I didn't do the blurdle. I think I started the portal

13:41.680 --> 13:43.680
But I haven't really done that

13:43.680 --> 13:46.080
I've sort of been focusing on the daily doordle

13:46.160 --> 13:50.800
Which is the dual doordle. Yeah, yeah, today's was serenum

13:51.680 --> 13:57.120

13:57.520 --> 14:03.040
Yeah, yeah, so well the it's I it's actually mostly musicians so the Lordle yesterday was low

14:03.040 --> 14:05.680
L.O. R. D.E. and then today I think was here on

14:06.800 --> 14:08.800
Interesting

14:08.800 --> 14:12.880
What about sordle which is the daily sword of the day that you have to guess

14:13.120 --> 14:14.880
S

14:15.520 --> 14:22.640
To be pet it audio sweet pet it. That's enough. That's enough. That one was yeah fine. Let's um and then

14:24.160 --> 14:27.840
What do you do you do wrote you did button? I haven't done rosette

14:28.560 --> 14:31.040
I'm gonna say Marika's the rose

14:31.680 --> 14:37.760
Feel like she doesn't get enough credit. She's the world Wow the glue that holds had come together

14:38.080 --> 14:40.400
More than a role player a great

14:41.360 --> 14:45.920
She's the cream of dual jabar of the head gun. She sure is she should be the next bond

14:48.160 --> 14:51.120
Can you imagine wow she's so young to be bomb

14:52.480 --> 14:58.480
Well, I mean I'm here for it. Yeah, if they offered you bond Marika would you take it or you'd be like this is embarrassing

14:58.480 --> 15:05.440
I feel like I have to right you have to say yes, and then I'd have to do a lot of like just

15:05.920 --> 15:10.720
full training of every possible thing from what that's the thing that you don't react

15:10.720 --> 15:16.160
But they will start tomorrow for sure not only just physical training of like let's work with a physical trainer for like a year

15:16.560 --> 15:19.760
But also they could you know teach you fucking

15:24.800 --> 15:26.800
Strasburg let's go and stress

15:27.440 --> 15:32.320
What's that it's an acting technique and I'm not probably didn't know that because all you've done

15:32.800 --> 15:34.800
is lonely and horror

15:34.800 --> 15:42.720
Three-file. It's for a reason you were so ready to know when to change gears

15:43.920 --> 15:45.920
Creatured or other lot

15:53.920 --> 15:55.920
Amir

15:55.920 --> 16:00.720
And Caleb so sorry about this because this is actually is if this wasn't a podcast this would be an HR violation

16:00.800 --> 16:04.880
Amir how's that? That's a cock yeah, you're not as fast as that

16:05.760 --> 16:07.760
HR podcast

16:08.400 --> 16:14.480
Interpersing a week in a row. I was just wondering what changed from last week to this week in terms of your romantic life

16:14.960 --> 16:22.080
It's a better way to train the audio the train one and it we will be moving on we will be power

16:22.960 --> 16:24.960
It will be full steam

16:24.960 --> 16:28.880
Um, this is something real that I do want to talk about. I don't know if any of you guys watch hockey

16:29.520 --> 16:31.520
No, I

16:31.520 --> 16:33.040
Like the mighty ducks

16:33.040 --> 16:34.320
Let's get the movie or the

16:34.960 --> 16:36.960
There's a team got it

16:39.680 --> 16:43.600
I really want to get into hockey and I don't know why she's for a high

16:44.960 --> 16:46.960
Yeah, burns

16:46.960 --> 16:51.360
It's just up from New England my dad said if I said anything else that is fair

16:52.400 --> 16:58.480
Wait, why do you want to get into hockey? I think it's a fun sport all I ever hear about is how fun hockey games are to go to

16:59.520 --> 17:06.000
But Cleveland doesn't have a team where I'm from and then I've heard that the LA kings are an annoying fan base and an annoying team

17:06.400 --> 17:11.120
franchise, et cetera, so I don't really want to over the kings so my shortlist is

17:12.480 --> 17:14.480
Detroit wet red wings

17:14.640 --> 17:16.400
Toronto Maple Leafs

17:16.400 --> 17:18.400
Montreal canadians and

17:19.360 --> 17:21.360
The New York Rangers

17:21.920 --> 17:23.920
I say choose a

17:24.000 --> 17:28.800
Red Ray Nadian team, so you have an excuse to like travel to see a game

17:30.960 --> 17:37.760
I say red wings because Detroit's an awesome little city of weirdos and it would be a lot of fun to go to one of those games

17:38.080 --> 17:40.320
I think I agree because like I also

17:41.440 --> 17:43.440
First of all

17:43.680 --> 17:47.040
Pit Pittsburgh has a team Columbus has a team and Detroit has a team

17:47.680 --> 17:52.480
Detroit and Columbus all of the all those cities are basically equidistant from Cleveland give or take like an hour

17:53.040 --> 17:57.520
Um, I hate Columbus, so can't do that. Uh, Pittsburgh

17:59.520 --> 18:01.520
I just can't get past the Steelers of it all

18:02.320 --> 18:05.760
Detroit and Cleveland kind of have this weird brother relationship

18:06.320 --> 18:10.000
That I appreciate and I might have to go red wings for that specific reason

18:10.560 --> 18:13.200
That being said like you're not looking at anything

18:13.520 --> 18:15.200
You're going so

18:17.200 --> 18:23.040
Yeah, no, I'm trying to find the photo that I have because like I got a red wings jacket because it looked cool

18:23.760 --> 18:30.240
Can you name 10 hockey players at all time Sydney Crosby Wayne Grunsky to Jeremy Dowdy

18:31.200 --> 18:33.200
Johnny Maywink

18:33.200 --> 18:35.200
Oh vengekin

18:37.200 --> 18:39.200
It's a vengekin either

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Gordon Bombay Gordon Bombay

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Jeff Gorton

18:47.200 --> 18:49.200
Let's go

18:49.200 --> 18:51.200
You know who there is

18:52.160 --> 18:54.160
Randall light foot

18:54.880 --> 18:56.800
He played for the oilers. I believe

18:57.760 --> 19:01.680
Oilers would be a cool one for you to roof for by the way. Choose a Jordan oil. Do you know Jordan oil?

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Is that a gasoline company?

19:06.080 --> 19:10.880
Oh, you know what that one is at gas company. You shouldn't you shouldn't get in talkie. I think actually

19:11.440 --> 19:17.920
You clearly have no clue. No, I don't know any of it. I don't know you don't okay. What about uh, there is Fareem

19:18.560 --> 19:22.480
DuPont I think now you're just thinking of a reason and then you had it to ponder the

19:23.040 --> 19:29.360
What do you know what icing is in hockey icing? Not in hockey, but I know that if you like make someone drink like an adiice or whatever

19:31.360 --> 19:35.440
That's a smear-off. I should say that's icing for sure. Or it's like the icing on the cake

19:36.000 --> 19:36.320
Ha ha ha ha ha ha- ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

20:06.000 --> 20:10.800
I don't care about hockey. I care about the fucking like I just want to check it.

20:10.800 --> 20:16.080
Yeah, I want to check it. So what are your interests? Just jackets?

20:18.080 --> 20:20.160
Recently, it's been jackets.

20:20.160 --> 20:24.560
Okay, jackets, watches, watches. Always with the watches.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.440
It's really so fucking annoying. Are you wearing a watch now?

20:27.440 --> 20:29.760
He's not. Oh, there it is.

20:30.960 --> 20:31.760
It's not.

20:31.760 --> 20:32.880
It's very directed.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.880
Where is feels like you're missing something?

20:36.080 --> 20:36.880
No, it's hard to say.

20:36.880 --> 20:37.920
You just have to say.

20:37.920 --> 20:40.800
We said watches, and that's where the visit tire personality.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.880
So I think we named all of his hobbies.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.960
I like music. Yeah.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.160
And even that really.

20:49.360 --> 20:53.200
So you like watches and not really music. Those are your two hobbies.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.400
And jackets.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.800
Yeah, I love a jacket, but not even really.

20:57.280 --> 21:02.800
Yes, we had a dead or head trivia around last week.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.920
Oh, wow. That's a nice jacket.

21:05.920 --> 21:09.120
That's why I got it. And now I feel like I have to be a red-winged fan just to justify it.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.920
He kind of looked like Johnny.

21:11.920 --> 21:15.040
Like, I feel like that's a Johnny vibe. Maybe I'm wrong.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.480
Guys, winter is supposed to be hibernation time. And I won't deny.

21:24.480 --> 21:28.160
I'm staying in more than usual, but that doesn't mean I'm not busy or that I want to spend

21:28.160 --> 21:29.840
all my time in the kitchen.

21:29.840 --> 21:33.040
Luckily, I don't have to meal plan or prep.

21:33.040 --> 21:36.320
And I can still eat well now that I leave my meals to factor.

21:37.120 --> 21:42.800
Factor makes it easy for me to eat clean 247 with fresh, never frozen prepared meals that are so delicious

21:42.800 --> 21:45.360
that you wouldn't believe they're actually good for you.

21:45.360 --> 21:49.200
Factor saves me time by delivering chef-crafted meals to my doorstep,

21:49.200 --> 21:52.160
eliminating the hassle of grocery shopping and meal prep.

21:52.160 --> 21:56.080
Not to mention clean up. That's my least favorite chore in the world is doing dishes.

21:56.080 --> 22:00.480
I don't have a dishwasher here in Brooklyn. And Factor kind of solves that issue for me.

22:01.280 --> 22:06.800
Each factor meal arrives pre-prepared and ready to eat in two minutes. That's even faster than ordering in.

22:06.800 --> 22:10.000
And Factor tackles the tough stuff so that I don't have to.

22:10.000 --> 22:15.040
They're registered, dietitians, and expert chefs work hand in hand to create meals with

22:15.040 --> 22:21.600
nutritional ingredients. And with more than 29 meal options every week, I haven't been bored thus far.

22:22.240 --> 22:25.680
Factor even knows my preferences because they offer vegan and veggie meals,

22:25.680 --> 22:31.040
keto meals, low calorie options, cold press juices, smoothies, energy bites, plant-based bars,

22:31.040 --> 22:36.240
extra protein, veggie sides, and more to keep me fueled and focused all day long.

22:36.240 --> 22:40.320
I'd go with the extra protein option as well as smoothies and they're so good.

22:40.720 --> 22:45.840

23:04.480 --> 23:11.040
episode of our show. I have started using athletic greens every day and it has changed my life in a major

23:11.120 --> 23:17.440
way. I wake up with more energy. It's become part of my routine. It's morning coffee,

23:17.440 --> 23:22.400
and athletic greens, and it really starts my day right. Taste great. And I don't have to worry

23:22.400 --> 23:26.480
about swallowing a bunch of pills anymore. It's really changed my life. So what is athletic

23:26.480 --> 23:31.280
greens? Well with one delicious scoop, you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins, minerals,

23:31.280 --> 23:35.360
whole-food source superfoods, probiotics, and adaptogens to help start your day right.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
This special blend of ingredients supports your gut health, your nervous system, your immune system,

23:40.080 --> 23:46.320
your energy, recovery, focus, and aging. All the things. I personally consume it in a cup of water.

23:47.120 --> 23:50.800
It just becomes like this nice green drink that I can have in the morning right before my coffee,

23:50.800 --> 23:55.200
and I just, you know, I really have a spring in my step afterwards. I would say the taste is surprisingly

23:55.200 --> 24:01.040
sweet. It doesn't have any artificial anything, but it does still kind of have this like bubble gum

24:01.040 --> 24:06.880
flavor almost that I personally enjoy. It's definitely not bad. You know, if you don't like

24:06.960 --> 24:11.920
bubble gum, you might not love it, but I like it nonetheless. It's lifestyle friendly,

24:11.920 --> 24:17.040
meaning whether you eat keto, paleo, vegan, dairy, for your gluten-free, it's all good for you.

24:17.840 --> 24:23.040
It contains less than 1 gram of sugar, no GMOs, no nasty chemicals, or artificial anything,

24:23.040 --> 24:29.120
while still tasting good. It supports better sleep quality and recovery, mental clarity, and alertness,

24:29.120 --> 24:35.120
and it's one thing with the best things that you can do for yourself every day, and it costs less

24:35.120 --> 24:40.240
than $3 a day. Right now, it's time to reclaim your health and our immune system with

24:40.240 --> 24:45.840
convenient daily nutrition, especially heading into flu in cold season. It's just one scoop in a

24:45.840 --> 24:50.480

25:25.200 --> 25:30.720
for a photo. Yeah. As soon as you showed it to us, we got to commercial. I was just being polite.

25:32.240 --> 25:36.080
Really? Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

25:36.720 --> 25:55.600
Um, so I wanted to see if we would get Kayla. I think so. I think so and fair.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.080
What is this?

26:00.160 --> 26:10.400
This. So bad. Thank you, ladies. Yes, I made it. I have a machine. No, you did. I have a

26:10.400 --> 26:16.080
need to be really fine. Um, and that was mostly a loop that was like kind of a preset.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.160
Uh-huh.

26:23.520 --> 26:24.960
These dogs. Yeah.

26:29.120 --> 26:34.240
Birds flying north. I don't like that.

26:37.680 --> 26:43.120
Rearranging drawers. I don't like that.

26:46.480 --> 27:02.480
Traveling to new shores. I don't like that. I hate new dawns. I hate new days. I hate my life

27:03.040 --> 27:22.160
for me. And I'm fearing change. I'm fearing change.

27:22.480 --> 27:38.480
I'm meeting new friends. You know that I fear seeing new trends. You know that I fear

27:40.080 --> 27:49.760
trying on new sense. You know that I fear. I hate new homes. I hate new clothes. I hate new hair.

27:50.720 --> 27:56.560
For me. And I'm fearing change.

28:06.720 --> 28:15.200
That took me nine days. To what? Do what? To do what? You didn't hear this song?

28:20.400 --> 28:24.320
All right. That's after you everything myself. Here we go. That's a better reaction.

28:26.640 --> 28:31.200
Notes. Thoughts. Yeah. Twins. Anything. I've seen not the last one because it was flawless.

28:31.840 --> 28:39.120
Yeah. The rhythm of the race. No. Um, I just want to offer that I actually have a degree in social

28:39.120 --> 28:43.360
work. If you ever wanted to talk to somebody.

28:44.000 --> 28:51.920
Mm. Okay. Yeah. Um, like very expressive. Thank you for sharing that. That took a lot of

28:51.920 --> 29:00.720
bravery. So. Someone else has a soundboard and goes. That was easy.

29:03.920 --> 29:10.480
I thought. Yeah. That was supposed to take up 10 minutes of the show. And it was supposed to be the

29:10.480 --> 29:13.760
first three minutes is me singing. And then the last seven minutes of those 10 minutes was you

29:13.760 --> 29:21.920
guys like giving me praise. I mean, we're still good to give you feedback. I just got distracted by

29:21.920 --> 29:35.440
a mirror most doing a spit. I was so much bad man. I always wanted to say it was really bad.

29:35.520 --> 29:40.880
You're singing was off. I like the song that it's based on. Great. And the words. No.

29:41.760 --> 29:48.560
I thought the instrumental track was really good. If you did that on your, um, your soundboard thing.

29:48.960 --> 29:53.280
Yeah. That was like a one part of it. I would have changed. The lighting was great.

29:54.480 --> 29:58.880
But the way I even didn't change, it's just like one window. Yeah. But it's like very,

29:58.880 --> 30:04.720
really an intro and like soft lighting. I mean, I appreciate it. But what about the like the singing?

30:04.960 --> 30:09.120
Oh, I think I would have maybe fixed the choreography a bit. Maybe.

30:11.440 --> 30:17.760
Less less of the claw hand. I feel like that's a crutch for you and you rely on that a lot. And I think

30:17.760 --> 30:22.560
yeah, you could do some other things with your hands for sure. I'm caught.

30:25.280 --> 30:31.680
This singing pitch was that pitch was good. The words were tight. The pitch wasn't

30:32.320 --> 30:39.840
um, it wasn't tight or was not. It just wasn't um. It's yeah.

30:40.560 --> 30:49.520
And the lyrics were sad, which is good, right? That of that of Oak to Nemotion. Yeah. But not sad,

30:50.080 --> 30:54.000
like in the way you intended. Yeah. It wasn't supposed to be sad.

30:56.320 --> 31:01.440
Yeah. Well, what was your intention as the artist? Can I speak? Like are we doing these

31:01.440 --> 31:06.480
art school style? Well, if it were art school style, you probably wouldn't be able to speak,

31:06.480 --> 31:13.680
but I'll at least. Well, I'm a little hurt. Obviously, like that took like a lot, not only to write it,

31:13.680 --> 31:20.480
but also out of me just now. Nine days. Yeah. It wasn't night. It was like an out of heat. Yeah. That's

31:20.480 --> 31:26.160
a lot of work. So why did you leave right beforehand? It like your video was off and then you

31:26.160 --> 31:32.000
emerged, but you were exactly the same. I don't know. I mean, I, I feel like Sammy Davis Jr.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.880
would have done something similar. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I would have courage you to write another song

31:36.880 --> 31:42.720
based on what you're feeling right now for next two devastation. Yeah. I'd love to explore that

31:42.720 --> 31:50.400
a bit. Okay. Also, the rhyme scheme was very good. But I didn't make the rhyme scheme. It's just

31:50.400 --> 31:54.480
a parody. So like someone else did that. This was kind of frustrating about that. Someone else did

31:54.560 --> 32:00.800
the lighting. I didn't make this building. Um, I didn't get you read, Jack. Right before

32:00.800 --> 32:05.600
fearing change. Well, were those lines do you remember those lines? I think God, that wasn't just

32:05.600 --> 32:12.000
the first question. Was that question? Was that sort of enough? What was that? What was the question?

32:12.000 --> 32:17.120
Right before I'm fearing change, what were the lines? Because you sort of rhymed the same word

32:17.120 --> 32:23.360
with itself over and over. But I forget exactly what it was. Yeah. Well, there's two versions. The

32:23.520 --> 32:28.560
first one was um, sorry. I'm like with my voice is shaking for the audio listeners. I'm just

32:28.560 --> 32:35.200
like on the projectors. Um, I hate new dawns. I dare you to make yourself cry right now.

32:36.800 --> 32:44.240
I dare you to cry. I will say my I help prohibits it. Um, I hate new dawns. Yeah. I hate new days.

32:45.040 --> 32:52.160
I hate my life. For me. What is that? You hate your life for you.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.920
Is that like I love that for you? Yeah, but hate it for you. That's better than what my

32:59.920 --> 33:04.720
intention was, which was just that I couldn't figure it out. Okay. And then keep going. And I'm

33:04.720 --> 33:15.280
fearing change. Right. I'm fearing change. Get forward a little bit. Yeah. Then what? I hate

33:15.280 --> 33:23.040
new homes. I hate new clothes. I hate new hair. That wasn't for me. Thank you.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.640
And um, oh, you want the stances, like the verses. It's okay. I'm just saying it by the way.

33:28.640 --> 33:34.880
Yeah, just read it. Just read it. Don't push it. Because saying things with pitch. I know.

33:34.880 --> 33:38.080
And it makes it. You know, birds flying north. I don't like that.

33:38.880 --> 33:44.880
Rearly. What is that? Why did you write that? What don't you like about birds flying north? That's

33:44.880 --> 33:51.760
change. Okay. But you're okay with birds flying south just to clarify. I just know that was an option.

33:53.760 --> 33:59.440
Yeah. Do you think they just go north over or not? Always around.

33:59.440 --> 34:05.280
They're preventing the go vertically. Rear-ranging drawers. I don't like that.

34:06.880 --> 34:14.160
Like Marie condoing. Like yeah. Okay. Traveling to new shores. I don't like that.

34:15.920 --> 34:19.280
I hate new dawns. I hate new days. I hate my life for me. And I'm fearing change. I'm

34:19.520 --> 34:26.240
fearing change. Meeting new friends. You know that I fear. Right. This is what I think this is what

34:26.240 --> 34:38.000
we wanted to get into. Right. So you. My question was, is it meeting new friends that we know you

34:38.000 --> 34:46.320
fear like you fear those friends or is it like you fear meeting new friends? It's the second one.

34:46.320 --> 34:52.720
Because that's changed. Yeah. Okay. Seeing new trends. You know that I fear. Me too. Yeah.

34:53.760 --> 34:59.760
And the lyrics are good then. I didn't say that next line. Trying on new sense.

35:00.800 --> 35:04.880
You know that I fear. I liked the specificity of this one. Is that a new tattoo?

35:05.680 --> 35:06.240
Bad you ask.

35:06.640 --> 35:15.680
Yes. Yes. Butterfly. This sucks. The audio listener. This sucks.

35:16.240 --> 35:23.040
I'm from the the pretty odd album cover. It is from the pretty odd album cover. What's pretty odd?

35:24.720 --> 35:34.560
That little that little butterfly. So blurry. Yeah. I can see it. What is pretty odd? It's an album by panic at the

35:34.560 --> 35:43.520
disco. Panic at the disco. Yeah. That album affected you so much that we got set to of it.

35:44.160 --> 35:49.440
The first CD I ever bought was a few re-cants went out and then pretty odd was even better than that.

35:49.440 --> 35:56.480
And then they broke up and now they're bad. So what sucks. I'm on Jeff's side to be honest.

35:58.240 --> 36:04.320
Pretty odd. Pretty odd. Yeah. I know we do have to move on.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.760
Thanks for the constructive feedback assholes.

36:17.680 --> 36:18.800
Welcome to

36:21.760 --> 36:24.320
Wheel of Amir's Fortune.

36:27.680 --> 36:33.760
I know you're a nickel. I'm doing that. Let me introduce it first because we do have audio on the

36:33.760 --> 36:39.840
listeners who are commuting. This is you know Wheel of Fortune. I familiar. Do you guys know

36:39.840 --> 36:45.200
a Wheel of Miss Fortune? Sure. This is a Wheel. Do you guys know Amir?

36:46.080 --> 36:53.920
Yeah. Yeah. This is Wheel of Amir's Fortune. I'm not giving up my dog. That's one of these things.

36:54.480 --> 37:02.000
Is that Luke? Yeah. So yeah. These are just options. We'll spin the thing. I'm not going to say

37:02.000 --> 37:07.520
all of my ones. But let's just let's start with America. Something basically we spin the wheel

37:07.520 --> 37:12.400
and then something happens. Either people get cash or something has to happen to any of you guys.

37:12.400 --> 37:16.800
So there's no like word, play, portion of it. It's truly just spinning wheel.

37:16.800 --> 37:21.680
I don't watch Wheel of Fortune. Yeah. Yeah. Spin it.

37:25.280 --> 37:28.880
All right. Let's see what it lands on here. I am hoping for cash but some of these other ones

37:28.880 --> 37:33.760
can be interesting. All right. Break it gets a hundred dollars. Is it cool with you if we just do

37:33.760 --> 37:38.000
it all at the one. So do you want like a one lump sum or do you want it to be all individual transactions?

37:38.000 --> 37:42.160
One lump sum would be great. Got it. All right. So Amir, can you keep track of this? How much money

37:42.160 --> 37:45.040
we can kill are going to get? Right now is at a hundred dollars.

37:45.760 --> 37:52.160
From this is of Amir's money? That's actually not a bad idea. Oh, we'll finish that away.

37:53.120 --> 37:57.920
Ah, Caleb, your turn to spin the wheel of Amir's fortune. Spin, spinner.

37:59.920 --> 38:04.160
This is US dollars, right? Yeah, this is going to be US dollars. All right. Amir falls.

38:04.160 --> 38:10.640
So Amir, are you a standing desk right now? Yes. Can you fall? I mean, I can. I'm not, I don't need to.

38:10.640 --> 38:16.640
I'm not going to do it. No, let's let your legs give way. This is the easiest one for you to do.

38:16.640 --> 38:21.360
Yeah. I just don't want to do it. Just fall. Because if I do that, that fall.

38:21.360 --> 38:29.040
Oh, fall. No, you have to like collapse. If you like let your legs do it. No, because then like my, my head

38:29.040 --> 38:35.040
set will like fucking yank my computer off the desk. Yes. Yes, more than just falling.

38:36.320 --> 38:40.480
It's just falling. First of all, it's not more than just falling. Yeah, there you go.

38:40.480 --> 38:43.520
All right. I need to do it. But let's just say that that's what it is. I missed it.

38:45.120 --> 38:48.160
Now it's stuff like coming out of Amir's bank account. Here we go. Amir, your turn.

38:48.480 --> 38:55.360
Fucking prick. What the hell? It doesn't matter. You're, you're the one spinning. So like,

38:55.360 --> 39:02.000
you spin for me and it says Amir sleeps outside. If you spin for you, it's starting the wheel of a

39:02.000 --> 39:13.360
mere fortune. Oh, I'm so fucking sorry. Yeah, I have to go with my dog to have for adoption.

39:14.240 --> 39:17.920
Oh, possible. I was going to say. Can you bring out your shell and just for this?

39:17.920 --> 39:24.000
No, she's, I want to bring videos. She's working. Yeah, she's not. There's no way it's happening.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
I'd rather do all this other stuff. Adult brisk. I think you miss, you miss,

39:28.000 --> 39:35.840
don't brisk by the way. It's just one S in brisk. Sleep outside. You can't breathe, right?

39:35.840 --> 39:40.320
Amir. Amir is a jungle. Amir is no way. We'll make sure.

39:41.280 --> 39:43.040
Amir, good. Spin it.

39:49.680 --> 39:54.960
Okay. Well, you're really, you got it. Not only are you going to do one. Each other out. Amir gives up. No, it's not

39:54.960 --> 40:00.880
your neck and your mouth. You, you have to give up Luke. And this is, this is kind of fucked up, actually.

40:00.880 --> 40:07.920
You have to adopt him back and give him up again. No, no way. There's no way. It's not what I can't

40:07.920 --> 40:15.600
give him up adopt him back and give him up again. Yes. Because an inordinate amount of work to

40:15.600 --> 40:21.760
troll my pet. It's not to troll your pets to play a game for a content. And also playing the game.

40:21.760 --> 40:25.040
Well, you know what's fucked up is that like when you get him back, he's going to be like,

40:25.040 --> 40:29.040
holy shit, I must have just been at the groomer or something. Yeah. To give him up again,

40:29.040 --> 40:33.760
is devastating to him. And he's also kind of in the twilight of his life. Yes.

40:33.760 --> 40:38.880
He's over 10. My job was given up twice before we adopted him. True story.

40:38.880 --> 40:42.640
That's really sweet. You gave him a third chance. Yeah. That's where he's on dog,

40:42.640 --> 40:48.000
prosick as well. It's very sweet, too. Like me. You're all the one dog.

40:48.960 --> 40:51.200
Yes. It's like four pills at a time.

40:52.480 --> 40:55.840
You should have been your three nut butter. You should. I'm here. You should just like,

40:57.440 --> 41:04.160
instead of giving up the dog, Luke, what if you gave up like another Luke, right? I'm interesting.

41:04.160 --> 41:10.400
Like you could not watch Lucas Hedges movies. What would it be? I'd be every time, you know,

41:10.400 --> 41:14.480
Luke's on screen and go more girls. You kind of look away. Yeah. I'll give up. Luke,

41:15.120 --> 41:18.080
yeah. I'll give up. Clipper, small forward, Luke,

41:18.080 --> 41:23.280
canard. So I'll trade him. All right. That's nice. That's nice. It's Kayla's turn.

41:23.280 --> 41:32.000
Oh, please spin. Please. I was playing along for half a second. Cut me off. Holy shit.

41:32.000 --> 41:38.000
Oh, that's awesome. Rika at $600. This is coming over here. That'll be great. So first time

41:38.000 --> 41:44.400
coming out of here. All right. I'm here. You're out. Spin. We'll be taxed like a bone.

41:45.440 --> 41:49.120
I think it's a right off because we're talking about business or some shit. Okay, great.

41:50.800 --> 41:55.120
Come here. What? I don't what? You're doing it. You're doing it. You're doing it.

41:55.120 --> 41:57.120
Buck are you doing it? You're clicking the button.

42:01.760 --> 42:06.000
No way. Because it's kind of cold in the late night in February,

42:06.720 --> 42:11.200
but I'm sorry. You're going to have to sleep outside tonight. I'll take a nap during the day.

42:11.200 --> 42:17.840
On it. It sounds lovely. In the shade. No, in the sun. You're not playing the game.

42:17.840 --> 42:22.800
You and the thing is, I know that you think that I'm being crazy right now, but to the audience's

42:22.800 --> 42:28.400
ears and eyes, you look like a prick. Like you're not playing along with a game. You're a bad sportsman.

42:28.960 --> 42:34.640
At least give me $600. So that's pretty good. Well, at this point, he's not even going to sleep outside

42:34.640 --> 42:40.000
tonight. Who knows if you can get you the money? Here we go. Rika? Yeah, spin. Thank you.

42:41.520 --> 42:51.680
Kailabore, are you already going on with $250? I'm already. This is amazing. I told you you're

42:51.680 --> 42:57.120
going to make money today. All right. Back to Kayla. Very quick. Here we go. Give it a spin. Here we go.

42:58.320 --> 43:06.560
Fingers crossed. It's, yeah. There we go. That's what it is. Nice. I'm here is paying the balance.

43:07.200 --> 43:09.920
So it's going to be $250. $250.

43:11.440 --> 43:14.560
So feel free to bet. You can go to my mom's ear and then I can do it out or

43:14.560 --> 43:19.840
definitely not. All right. I mean, you have your turn. You have to take the finder's feet.

43:20.880 --> 43:27.120
I will take 15% but that's on top. It's like real estate. I'm here come on.

43:28.720 --> 43:29.360
Spin it.

43:33.040 --> 43:35.120
I'm not pressing anything by the way. You're pressing it.

43:35.760 --> 43:44.080
$1,000 to Rika. This is great. That's, I think, 1650. That's like probably what? Two months

43:44.080 --> 43:54.080
rent. Sure. Let's do one more round. Just for the fun of it. And timing.

43:55.120 --> 43:59.840
Oh, me. Yeah, Marika. All you. Or we can do this sometime just to get a mirror sourness out of the

43:59.840 --> 44:04.480
way. Because things are like, let's just do it in time. This game is flawed because it should say like

44:04.480 --> 44:10.240
spinner gets $50. Because right now it says who gets it on the wheel and that's not how

44:10.240 --> 44:15.440
wheel of fortune works. Like it should belong to the spinner. Like Kayla's spinning and it says

44:15.440 --> 44:19.920
Marie can get $1,000. So it doesn't matter who's spinning. You're asking me to spin. I'm not doing

44:19.920 --> 44:25.040
anything. You're just pressing a button and then it lands on a mere eats a nickel. So like it shouldn't

44:25.040 --> 44:30.560
have names on the wheel. It just gets $50. It's a eats a nickel. And then like people have, you know,

44:30.560 --> 44:36.320
risk reward, whether they want to spin, which we're not actually doing or not. So the entire game is

44:36.320 --> 44:44.400
flawed. I'm not giving you $1600 to Ben Momer, Rika plus 15%. And I'm not giving up my dog twice.

44:44.400 --> 44:50.080
That's not happening. None of this stuff is happening. At worst, they'll take a nap outside. That's it.

44:50.560 --> 44:55.920
All right. Is that a pass? Like, what do you want to pass on your turn? You're really going to do this?

44:55.920 --> 45:00.720
Yeah, sure pass because it doesn't matter who's spinning. It could be me. It could be you. It's

45:00.720 --> 45:06.720
always you just pressing a button. Kayla. Please, please spin.

45:06.960 --> 45:21.280
I'm really fast. I'm going to answer it. If you participate, you shall be rewarded. That's another

45:21.280 --> 45:26.720
250 to Kayla. That's going to be $500 on the fucking day. And it's coming from a mere spot. It's

45:26.720 --> 45:32.000
that's amazing. Thank you so much. Marika, why don't you take us home? Yeah. All right. I think you're

45:32.000 --> 45:37.120
across something bad happens to me or here we go. It's more good to me with all of you.

45:37.920 --> 45:43.120
Good or any kind of Kayla? All right. I'm going to sleep outside again. So I'm here. We might need you

45:43.120 --> 45:57.840
to do. Do not do like two nights. No way. Not happening. What if it's two naps outside the no sunscreen?

45:57.920 --> 46:03.120
No sunscreen. I don't can. I bet. I really don't. Can I put a sheet or a t-shirt over my face?

46:04.960 --> 46:07.120
I don't make the rules.

46:07.120 --> 46:31.440
We've reached the end of the episode. I've never done this. But I'm going to give out

46:31.440 --> 46:39.520
grades for the day. Okay. Kayla with your debut, you got an A. You got a 93 and a half. That's

46:39.520 --> 46:46.800
an A minus. No, that's a that's a solid A. Oh, rounding up. No, 93 and up. A minus 90 to 92.

46:46.800 --> 46:54.560
Right. Thank you. And when I got an A minus, I'm so sorry. Fine. You do it. No, but a very, a very fun

46:55.280 --> 47:02.880
episode. And I'm very fun performance from Kayla. Marika. I'll give you a, I'll give you a B plus.

47:02.880 --> 47:10.400
I'll give you an 89. I can't do that. So if you have any extra credit that I can do to get that up

47:10.400 --> 47:16.000
to Ne plus that we create. Okay. Let's think about it extra credit in the last two and a half minutes of the show.

47:16.960 --> 47:25.520
Can you, can you back me up that what Amir just did was poison? To the game. What I thought was a

47:25.520 --> 47:32.640
pretty fun game. What, what thing that Amir did? Just like not taking it seriously, poking holes in like the

47:32.640 --> 47:39.680
logic of the, the wheel. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, poison for sure. The wheel is flawed.

47:41.680 --> 47:54.720
Correct. So that's an A plus 92. It's a mini-manus. It was no Kayla. So I'm here.

47:58.640 --> 47:59.120
Yeah.

48:03.200 --> 48:13.040
Not only do you get the class. You didn't even show up enough. I say did I was here all the time and last week.

48:16.560 --> 48:22.480
That's true. And before the game, you were kind of complimentary of the back and track.

48:24.640 --> 48:29.200
All right. You know what? And this is me being generous. Just so you know 78 C plus.

48:30.160 --> 48:43.200
Wow. Oh, can you? And you a professor doesn't get a grade. Oh, there's there's

48:43.200 --> 48:50.640
teacher evaluations at the end of all, of course. I get tenure. That's how that happens. You have to earn it.

48:51.360 --> 48:55.360
Rateiprofessor.com. I read really preferred.

48:58.240 --> 49:05.840
No, um, I think I did all right. You do? Well, then you should have no problem opening that was easy.

49:10.320 --> 49:14.960
Flugs. What do you guys have going on? What do you want to point to people to, uh, let's start with Kayla?

49:15.920 --> 49:21.600
Oh, social media projects, anything. I guess if you don't already follow head gum everywhere.

49:21.600 --> 49:26.080
And follow gum ball, please actually on Twitter. Nice. And I don't know. Jeff, you got a link.

49:26.080 --> 49:31.600
Nice. I do have a link to. Great. Oh, we follow gum ball.

49:33.200 --> 49:39.920
Now gum ball FM. Great. Yeah. Yeah, gum ball FM. Follow, please.

49:40.880 --> 49:50.560
Oh, yeah. So much. Marika. Brownlee. Yeah. Yeah. Um, you also follow both those things. Follow me,

49:52.160 --> 49:59.440
Twitter, Instagram, and letter books at Marikaelon. Also, uh, the first episode of

49:59.440 --> 50:05.680
confronting demons with Megan Stalter will be out. Uh, the week that this comes out. So listen to that.

50:06.320 --> 50:11.760
Uh, and by first episode that also means of the relaunched season. So there's plenty of back

50:11.760 --> 50:19.600
catalog episodes to listen to. So do that. Oh, yeah. Man plugged myself as well. I didn't know

50:19.600 --> 50:24.480
the thing. I thought it was just work focused. No, anything personal would actually be better.

50:25.200 --> 50:29.280
Kayla, a lot more already on all the things. Thank you. Oh, yeah.

50:36.560 --> 50:44.960
Did everyone go ahead, Rick? Um, well, now I don't want to go because like that's a sort of

50:44.960 --> 50:55.440
admitting that I am one. Go ahead and mirror. Oh, gosh, where do we start? There is a new

50:55.440 --> 51:01.040
D&D podcast on head gum, which is up a lot of people's alley. I mean, you're talking about

51:01.040 --> 51:08.880
every NAD pod fan, um, would probably really thoroughly enjoy the new sitcom D&D podcast,

51:08.880 --> 51:15.520
which is like D&D meets cheers. It's a D&D podcast with a live studio audience. I mean, my god,

51:15.520 --> 51:22.720
for hilarious Chicago improvisers, getting it done. We're so excited and so proud to, um,

51:25.200 --> 51:30.160
have them on. So you can subscribe and listen to that where you listen to.

51:30.240 --> 51:37.920
Hosted by one of the favorite rules. Right, Aaron. Um, but why you're punching your one

51:37.920 --> 51:43.120
cell's all bruise. I'm going to send screenshots of it to Cohen and tell him that you beat me up.

51:43.120 --> 51:52.560
That's, you're just copying fear. And I'm fearing fear.

51:52.560 --> 52:05.760
That's really good. Um, at Jeffrey James on Instagram at Jeffrey already on Twitter at I am Jeffrey

52:05.760 --> 52:11.840
James on TikTok. And I thought I'd end us with a review from Apple podcasts, which we haven't really

52:11.920 --> 52:23.520
done on this show ever. Um, this one came in from JP 3435. About a month ago, he said,

52:23.520 --> 52:31.280
lots of fashion discourse, not much else. Love the PT talk. Jeff is almost right about nearly

52:31.280 --> 52:37.840
some things, but especially fashion. Keep it up. Five stars. So yeah, guys, we're going to make

52:37.920 --> 52:42.800
it a weekly thing. I think just five star review on Apple podcasts, uh, something funny. It

52:42.800 --> 52:47.280
could be five stars, but not funny. I won't read it. It could be two stars in hilarious and we might,

52:47.280 --> 52:54.160
but ideally five stars and don't do two stars. Also, you can't write reviews on it, but you should

52:54.160 --> 53:03.040
read us five stars on Spotify. Yeah. And it really helps us out. And until next week, that's

53:03.040 --> 53:07.840
does folks. Nice. And then I'm here. We're going to need, like, proof that you saw that side.

WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
We need to sink or...

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Doesn't matter.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Because we all started separately.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
Yeah.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Should we sink or...

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
Yeah.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Head-gum holiday special.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Right?

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
This is coming out on Christmas Eve.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
And if anybody's watching this, I'm sorry that you don't have the type of relationship with your family,

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
where you carve out the time,

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
to spend it with them.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Instead, you're listening to this nonsense.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Yeah.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
What'd you say?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
I said, yeah.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
What is this song?

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
This is non-copyrated Christmas music.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Oh.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Yeah. Nice.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
It's a song.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Um, I didn't...

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I didn't with the black-ed fees thing right after.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Using a media monetization.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I'll call up a solid...

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Listen, guys.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
It's been a hell of a year.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I mean, in terms of growth,

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
in terms of manufacturing supply chain issues,

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
it's been both positive and negative

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
and two things can be true at once.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
We're living in the gray.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
We're not going to either extreme.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
And we're finding new avenues of joy.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
We're getting wise.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
These have been the themes of the last couple months on the show.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Um, and I just wanted to get your guys' thoughts.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I thought that we could do a couple things today.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
All right. I'm going to outline it for you up top

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
so that we know what we have to get to.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
You're already steam rolling up.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Yeah.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
We haven't set up fucking word.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
You haven't introduced us.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I don't have to.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
They know he's casual.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
He's still...

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
They don't know who's on the show.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
What do we think?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
We have Marieka Brownlee on the sacks.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
You have a mirror blue and felt on the backs.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
And we have Jake Hurwitz bringing up the rear.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Johnny Hurwitz, Johnny Hurwitz, the other brother.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Um, Christmas is about two things.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Giving gifts and giving back.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Okay.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
So we're going to do both of those things today.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
We're going to hit you with the headgum podcast.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Holiday gift guide.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Way too late.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
We're going to talk about ways we can give back.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
And we're going to help some kids in need of joy.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
How are we going to do the last one?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
We're also going to ask.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
We're also going to ask.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
All right.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
That's a given.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Um, a mirror.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
How was your Hanukkah?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
I was nice.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
I spent most of that.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Head big burn.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
That was good.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
That was good.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
That was good.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
I was in full death.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Never mind.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
I guess.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
No.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
It's all fine.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Yeah.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
You're in Florida.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Yes.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
I wasn't Florida.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Thank you for asking.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
How was that?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
It was interesting.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
It was cool to see.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
It's sort of like I equated as an upside-down

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
California, both in terms of shape, right?

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
Because it's also like, it's like a bizarre, because it's still warm.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
But the people are just cold hashtag different over there.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Um, with a lot of people in California, uh, the same way.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
It's just in like Fresno and Northern California.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Central.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Yeah.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Central.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
This San Juan can be valley.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Actually went to a Walmart for the first time.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
I've already talked about it.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
You've already talked about it on this show.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Don't repeat yourself on this show.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
All right.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Well, I wasn't.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Sorry.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Not you.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
I'll see.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I think you and I've been to a Walmart on our cross country road trip.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
And I was a lot.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
So don't spread lines.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I love that for us.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Sure.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Did you go other places in the south?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
It seemed like you were driving around a lot.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
I was, I actually flew from two different cities within Florida.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Because much like California, Florida is 500 miles long.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
So you have to fly to get from one side to the other.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Tracks.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Sure.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
But Hanukkah was nice.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Let's some candles.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Eight.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Some jelly donuts.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Had some lattes.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yilt.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Sorry.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
That was guilt.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
There was dreadling.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
You played great.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Do you actually cradle?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I played a light round.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I didn't play anything serious.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
But there was dreadling happening.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
And there was guilt being consumed.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Was there ladling happening in terms of soup?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Yes.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
There was a multiple soup at one point.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Jake, have you ever been to Woodstock?

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
New York?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Yes.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Have you had Woodstock?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Huh?

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Woodstock.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
It's like a broth made from cedar.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Wood?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I don't think that's a real thing.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
No.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
It's a soup made of plywood.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Wood?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Yeah.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
I don't think that's a real thing.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
And I haven't had it.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
That was, you did.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
You wanted me to do it.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
You did say a soup made of plywood.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I mean, no.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
You expect a lot of arrows.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
What?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I'm going to do my best thing.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
My favorite.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Can we talk about it?

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
How do you record it in that episode where you are right now?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Yeah.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Or is this the first?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
No.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
This is the second.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
This is the third.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
I didn't.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Where are you?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
I'm in Williamsburg.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
I'm a little.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
I had two different, you know.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Ideas in my head.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Actually, no, I have one single concern about you living here.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Was that you weren't going to have any friends.

05:42.000 --> 05:51.000
and that you were going to rely on me and hanging out with me all the time, and I was texting me and asking what I'm doing and kind of be like a hanger on.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
And sadly, the opposite has happened. You've utterly ignored me.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
I haven't seen Jeff at all.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
You've been here for like a month. How long have you been here a month? Two weeks? Two weeks? Two weeks?

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Two weeks? I haven't seen you.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
And you haven't even texted yesterday. You didn't even respond.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I asked Jeff if that's really cool.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
That's really cool.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
Last minute on my end, but I asked him if you wanted to play trivia on my trivia team and he just ghosted me.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
That's so funny. That's really cool.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Not even I can't make it. He doesn't respond to text sometimes.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
And then sometimes he'll say that he's going to do something and then doesn't show up.

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
My issue in the way that I've experienced the last two weeks is it's been go-go-go and I've been incredibly.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
It's like my body's two steps ahead of my mind.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Why?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
And then down.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
No, I'm trying to settle into where I am at.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
But then I'm fucking going back to Cleveland on Sunday for Christmas, which will be great.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
But it's like, I'm all turned around.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
I do want to hang out and I do want to climb.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
I wanted to climb this morning, but eight, 30s kind of early.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
You live in New York, but you're still treating it like you're here for a long weekend.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Yes.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Yes.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
You're like in different parts of the city on like a week night.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
It's a lot of work and far.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I don't like going to be hell.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Yeah.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
You're in South Williamsburg.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
You get on the GMZ, right?

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
I'm taking the J, the J is cool because it's above ground.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
And above board in terms of subway maintenance, which is something I've been reading a ton

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
about.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Have you stayed in one night?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Yes.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
When Saturday.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Also, Jake Saturday, I texted you.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
You texted me.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Do you have plans tonight?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
I said yes, but only early.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Are you doing anything and you didn't respond to that?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
That's right.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
So it's also ships passing in the night.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Well, I, yeah, you're right.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
I did.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
And you would make a climb at like 730.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
So when I get to the gym, you guys are finishing up.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
And I'm climbing.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
I'll get there.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Okay.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
30.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
I can do it.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
I just couldn't do it today.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Yeah.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
When I texted you, do you want to climb at 830?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Didn't respond.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
In my hand, I was like, no.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
And then I didn't send it sex.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
And in my head on Saturday, when you said, you were going bowling at the gutter at six,

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
but didn't plan back to that.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
I was like, so he's going to be trashed at seven.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
I don't know.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Hang out.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
I'm going to invite you.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
I'm going to invite you.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Oh, all right.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Yeah.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Ghosted everybody for dinner.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yeah.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Well, I went and I got a really nice burger.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Just me and Jill.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
We will always.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Cozy Royale.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Actually.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Yeah.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
I haven't even seen Vogel.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Yeah.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
That's right.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
You haven't seen Jake.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
So you definitely haven't seen his wife.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
You haven't seen Maria.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Yeah.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
So you haven't seen Vogel for sure.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
But you are vocal about wanting to see her.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
I'm first call about Vogel.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
That's right.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
What did you do this weekend, Jeff?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Sorry.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
So all of the place.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Yeah.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
I'm also adjusting to like the the social capital of New York.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Right.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
So it's like, and this isn't very holiday.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
But we're waxing.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Um, which is another thing you said we should do.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
We said there'd be a lot of waxing.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
We.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
So in LA, it's like, you don't see anybody until at earliest Thursday.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Yeah.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
And then you do, you know, you go out on Friday and Saturday.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
You see everybody.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
You want to see.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
And it's great.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
But you're.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I'm so used to building up that social capital.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
And honestly.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Uh.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Did you lose one track of what you were saying?

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Honestly want the want to see people in the weekends.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
In New York, I'm going somewhere every night.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Because they're so like it's so easy to see people.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
And people keep texting.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
But which people?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Because it's not Jake.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
It's not Rika.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
You haven't even seen Chilean.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
So like vocally.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Who are you hanging out with?

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Who have you seen the most?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Like it's a random Monday.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Who's who's text.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Are you responding?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Johnny.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Johnny a lot.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Yeah.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Yeah.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Uh, and then a friend from home.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Uh, has has been doing a lot of things in just kind of casually inviting me.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
And the timing of it has worked out every time.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
But Jake, I want to hang out.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Thanks.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Yeah.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
So why?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
First cut that out.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Take your healer.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Make time for those that want.

10:24.000 --> 10:31.000
Make time for those you care about seeing time.

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
And that's about my wife.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Full steam ahead.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Here's what I'd like to ask about.

10:43.000 --> 10:53.000
What have you guys learned about yourselves in the world in the past year?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
That music.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I learned I had a low grade thyroid issue.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
Um, I, I thought that I was just tired because I was getting old and I thought that

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
I had achy joints because I was, uh, traveling too much.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
But then I went to the doctor for the first time in 10 years and found out that I just had

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
a thyroid that wasn't doing its job.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
I have some medicine now.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
And I feel 10 times better than I did.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
So check your thyroid.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Wow.

11:19.000 --> 11:26.000
Jake taking the thyroid medicine for the first time.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Oh, yeah.

11:29.000 --> 11:36.000
Your body can't produce this naturally.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Right.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
That's how we're supposed to die.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Wow.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
You had Hashimoto's.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Jake, I have a recommendation for that actually.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
I'm good.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
I'm on level 13.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Roxane.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
So I don't need your fucking witchcraft or anything like that.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
No, no, no, no.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
It's, uh, it's called the, um, sorry.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
What's it called?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
I don't know.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
This sucks.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
I would stew the vital pro.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
The vital pro.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Infrared light machine.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
It helped.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
If you shine that towards your thyroid, it really helps.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
No, you're suggesting pseudoscience and Jake said he's already been to a doctor and got

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
an action medicine.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
That looked like a heat lamp.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
That sounds like four hundred and seventy nine dollars.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
That sounds like something.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
You shine it at your thyroid.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
I thought you could download that as an app too.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
It's a red screen.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
And if you turn it really brightly into your eyes with still be blue light.

12:48.000 --> 12:55.000
It would still be blue light on the spectrum because you don't know Jack shit about medicine.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Your dad's a doctor.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
And you're a fool on the internet.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Oh my god.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
He's not wrong.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Yeah.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Sports.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
And what's not in the game is my head and we have to get there.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Um, what did you go sleep last night?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Sorry one second.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
Um, because you look tired, but it's what 150 over there.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Yeah.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
You just wake up.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
I woke up at 11.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Can you dip out a frame?

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
I'd like to see the kitchen behind you.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Do you have roommates or is that all your mess?

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
I made a grilled cheese really late last night.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Thanks.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
I see what kind of by the way Monday night you had last night.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Yeah.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Monday.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Yeah.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Because I had Monday night you had a late night grilled cheese.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Correct.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Yeah.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
So we sliced and diced my thumb on a mandolin.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
And I don't mean we could kitchen knife thing.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
I mean like an actual, you know, 12 string talking about shredding.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Yeah.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
So I was grizzman.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
I was grizzman.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Hmm.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
I look worse because there's no good lighting in this apartment.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
It's all overhead and the ceilings are really high.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
I see.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
And the nail polish.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Is that a new thing?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
New York thing?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Or are you redoing that in LA?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I did it once in LA.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Uh, it's sort of a hairy style style style.

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
You're really, some, you're getting into hairy styles.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Yeah.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Too much do you think?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
No.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
It's just.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
It's just.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Yeah.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Jeff, Jeff clearly goes through phases.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
And he's in his hairy styles phase.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
His hairy styles era.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Yeah.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
His flop era.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
But hairy styles phase.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
No.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
My friend of mine painted my nails.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Cool.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
So it's like a sexual thing.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
You said it with that kind of energy.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Yeah.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
It was friend of mine painted with a sword.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Yeah.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
That doesn't happen like in an afternoon.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Yeah.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
It's like it's late Monday night.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
No.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
No.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
You're getting white.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
My buddy AJ just came over and we did our nails.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Yeah.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
And then didn't clean up.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Um, a mirror.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
What's, what did you learn in the last year?

15:16.000 --> 15:29.000
Uh, skip me actually.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Maria.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Um.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
What did you learn in the past year?

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Um.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
I similarly to Jake learned that I had a herniated disc and have just been

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
constant pain for the better part of year.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Um.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
So learning learning to live with that is.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Have you tried diet smoke?

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Epic.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Epic 2021 night.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Yes.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Oh.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Yeah.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Yeah.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
It's brilliant.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Jake.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
It's what?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
That's all.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
See how it's.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Wow.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Um.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Yeah.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Yeah.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
It sucks doing the show with you guys.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
I was just doing a bit.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
And you fucking went, you needed to go harder than I did.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Fucking.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
You barked at me like a dog.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Wait.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
There's no, there's no, there's no like, um, healing from a herniated disc.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
You just have to learn to live with it.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Basically.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Yeah.

16:32.000 --> 16:38.000
You can get like, I can get a surgery that, um, removes some of the jelly like disc

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
material from touching my nerve, which is what is causing me pain.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Um, but I'm trying to avoid doing that.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
So I'm doing physical therapy.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
I'm getting shots in my back.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
Uh, it's going fine to bed.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Is it getting worse?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Is it deteriorating?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
It got better.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
And then it got worse.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
And now after shot number three, it's a little better again.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Wow.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
Like, when you're doing the physical therapy, are you strengthening the muscles around

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
the disc?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
That's the idea.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
It's always going to be a herniated disc.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
And you're exactly.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Exactly.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
Because right now, for some reason, most of my pain is just like the entire side

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
of my body cramping.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
What is that?

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Yeah.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
But I also learned that I want to take.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000

Guys, is something interfering if you're happiness

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
or preventing you from cheating your goals?

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
Homey to sleep issues are something that has been plaguing me recently in a way.

Thanks, BetterHelp.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Sorry, I was at a commercial break.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
And we're back.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
You were gone the entire time.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Yeah, you were on your phone.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Yeah, I mean, I'm used to it.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
Maria, you learned that you missed your friends?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Mm-hmm.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
It's sort of the tail end of what you said.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
We do have to move on as the only reason we had to do that.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Yeah.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Right, yeah.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
They're, they're had to have been a better way to do that.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
H-E-L-P.

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
Looking for royalty-free music, discover epidemic shift.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Yeah.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Yeah.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
Now I'm on YouTube premium.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
It's time for the headgump.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Holiday gift guide.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
What are you guys getting for people that you're getting gifts for this year?

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
Or what's something that you didn't have someone to give it to

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
that you would recommend to others to get for people that they haven't gotten gifts for

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
in a guide.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Hold on.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
I was so horrible.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
I guess first of all.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Brother Dorgold.

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
Technically we did, we did put out a headgump gift guide on the newsletter, which went out

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
in a timely fashion as opposed to this, which is coming up before the day before Christmas.

21:25.000 --> 21:32.000
But what I've bought for people this far, I bought a lot of people pillow slides,

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
which are little shoes.

21:35.000 --> 21:42.000
Jake is probably going to combat this and go full crox mode, but I think pillow slides are

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
good.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
No.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
I'm not going to combat it.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
I think that's interesting.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
I think it's fascinating.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
I'm interested in trying the pillow slides.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
I will go to every length to make my feet feel comfortable.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Yeah.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
I have no loyalty.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
I went from crox to uphos to Birkenstocks back to crox.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
I'll try anything.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Pillow slides are good.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
It's like walking on a marshmallow.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Okay.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
New tab.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Whoa.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
What just happened?

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
You made me like the main.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
Because also, now this is the top of the problem.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Yeah.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
And it was.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Yeah.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
And even when you go back to gallery mode, it might be in a different order.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Yeah.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Yeah.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Yeah.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Because it comes to end.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Oh.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
There we go.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
Let's talk about what gifts we would get for everyone.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
In terms of what we got on this call.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
You're changing the segment mid segment.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
You're you're so 80.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
I participated.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Yeah.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
We got one.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Where's he going?

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Oh my god.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
He's hanging himself.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Holy shit.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
No.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Finally.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Oh god.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
He's on the move.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
It's a nice little.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
That's better.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Right?

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Change of pace slash venue.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Just in terms of lighting.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
It's kind of better.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Yeah.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Yeah.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Yeah.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
That is better.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
You should have done that before.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Obviously.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Well, you're an angle.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
It's kind of like you're you're lent over the camera.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
You're.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
It feels like like a band photo.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
This is not the 2000.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
What we should be talking about.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
All right.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Interrupted the segment.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
You changed the segment.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Then you interrupted the change segment.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Again, by moving your camera around.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
You know what?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Then I would get you all the same fucking gift.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
And you know what?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
It would be.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
It would be pliers to remove the stick up your guys' asses.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
That's pretty good.

23:45.000 --> 23:51.000
So funny gift to get someone.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Oh, pliers.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Yeah.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
Do a sermon with the stick of your ass.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Because it's so gross.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
The rest that you're actually going to be.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Pliers to remove it.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
And actually, here's a cigar.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
So you can blow smoke up my ass.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
It's all things up there.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Yeah.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
And I got you a bit different.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
There's a marshmallow.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
You can do water.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Yeah.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Because there's a marshmallow with the stick up.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
I'm up your ass.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Yeah.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
And then if I can I can I ask you guys for something for Christmas?

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Sure.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Yeah.

24:23.000 --> 24:29.000
Probably like an American Express or Visa gift card.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Use one cash.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Cash is.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Cash is.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
This is a little bit more intentional because you can pick out a fun design.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
But in terms of how far anywhere.

24:38.000 --> 24:44.000
So it's basically, yeah, you're asking us for money with a little bit of a design on it.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Wow.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
How much money do you need, man?

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
Uh, it's the credit card bill is like $6,000.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Yeah.

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
Can you pay a credit card bill with an MX card?

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
No, but I can pay for other expenses.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
And then with my income pay the credit bill.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
Listen, this isn't the energy that I thought this episode was going to have.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Sometimes getting this group together.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
No, let me, let me finish.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
Sometimes getting this group together feels like it would be the best.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
And then it's just like we all kind of feel.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Have you guys seen get back?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
No.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
We're like the Beatles.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Yeah.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
And let me cast.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
I'm a cart me because I'm trying to get shit done.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
And nobody listens to me.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
Amir is Lenin because he sort of brings this genius.

25:33.000 --> 25:39.000
But only in bursts when he decides to use it, which to me as McCartney's frustrating.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
Marika's George because she has a ton of great ideas,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
but we don't listen to her either.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
And Jake is Ringo because he holds it down.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
Ringo's the only one.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
Also, in terms of looks, I'm still McCartney.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
I think Amir is also McCartney because he's sort of turned into Zaddy recently.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
I heard that I looked like Johnwin and Sush.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
This is the hot episode.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
It's about spreading cheers.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
No, it's not.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
It was supposed to be doing a fucking gift guide.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
You are contributing.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
I said American Express gift card for me.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
That's, yeah, but that's not the fucking prompt.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
That wasn't the prompt.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
It was what should people get the only adventure?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
No, what should we get each other say?

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
It is.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
I've had one idea and then you steam rolled it into saying that you want to pull the stick out of our asses

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
and that you want cash from us.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
Fine, continue.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
This is the sucks.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
It's hard to continue.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I don't even know where you want us to do.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
Amir, what's something that you got for a loved one this holiday season?

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
I find gold really gift cards to be ideal gift.

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
Because you don't have to like receive anything tangible.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
So it's not like this big bulky item that you have to ship.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
But it's also very exciting to get because it opens up a world of opportunity.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Everybody likes food.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
So it's like, oh, now suddenly I have to decide.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Oh, this is fun.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
I'll get like donuts from San Francisco,

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
where Philly cheese takes from Philadelphia.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
So I know this is not really an advertiser sponsor of ours.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
I find gold belly gift cards to be the ideal holiday gift.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
And I think there's nothing.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
No.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Save it.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Save it.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Save it.

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
Because major killer, if you buy a digital gift, then it's not a gift.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
It is thoughtless.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Yeah.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Wow.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
You have dropped the ball.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
At that stage, don't get a gift at all.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Write a card.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
That's what you have to do.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
When you order the thing with the gold belly,

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
then the thing arrives.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
You're just not making that specific decision for the person.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
It's the thought that counts is what they say about gifts.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
And that is thoughtless.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
That is thoughtless.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
That's it.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
I do appreciate the gift card that you got me.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
And I'm going to, I'm going to use it.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
I appreciate it.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
I'm getting love pearls.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
I really have a name.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
I'm kind of, I'm getting to the point where I am tired of gift giving.

28:15.000 --> 28:21.000
I want to, like, next year, I want to, like, set boundaries for people.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
Like, I want either, like, someone to donate on my behalf or I want, like, food.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Like a dinner.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
What about a gold belly gift card?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Because that's sort of food, right?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
It's sort of food.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
It's sort of food.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Yeah.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Yeah.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
It still comes with a piece of gold belly.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Yeah.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
It comes with a, like, stress of me deciding what to order.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
But still still good.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
The thought that counts, I guess.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
This really doesn't feel like a holiday extramific answer.

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
It sounds, like, it feels like us just waxing about the gifts that are good and bad.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
And it's like, this isn't, if somebody's listening to this.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
It was a gift card segment.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Yeah.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
That's what we're doing.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
What the segment was.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
It's just like your best.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Which you came up with.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
It doesn't feel organized.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
It doesn't feel organized because you've, like, changed positions.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Went into, get back.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
And then told us, we had sticks up our asses.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
You yelled at us.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Yeah.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
You changed the Zoom orientation too at a certain point.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Right?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
You, like, spot lit me.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Yeah.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
In a way that I didn't feel good about.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Okay.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
All right.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
You disrupted the situation for us and fans of the show.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Jake, like, you come really close.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
You say anything.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Mine was pliers for sticks up your guys's asses.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Amir's was gold belly gift card.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
You said, Crocs or something.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
What do you, I don't.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Pillow slides.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Pillow slides.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
And then Jake, you even said, you even said, Jack.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Yeah.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
Well, it's hard to get a word in edge wise because you're either screaming or playing.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Oh, good, good thought of it.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
So.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Good, good, good.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
My suggestion.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
It's something I did last year in the company White elephant, actually.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Yeah.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Printful.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Will let you print anything on anything.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
I think that when is this coming out?

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Christmas Eve.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Christmas Eve.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Okay.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Perfect.

30:08.000 --> 30:15.000
My sister just had a baby and I went on a printful and I printed her band's logo onto a

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
onesie.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
You put something that means something to someone on a shirt or a hoodie or a sweatpants.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
I think I put your face on socks.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Anyway, that's it.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
You did on my face on socks.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Pile got him.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
And then he sent me a photo.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
They're awesome.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
Do you have a real gift, Jeff?

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
Well, it depends.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
You know, I get how close am I to the person.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
And I don't think it.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
You're taking it back by your own suggestion.

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
I think it's fun to if you know the person's measurements get them something like a vintage sweater.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
Or a vintage t-shirt that has a logo or graphic of something that you know they care about.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Because it's a little bit more thoughtful.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
You know that you had to go search for it on Etsy or grail or eBay or whatever the fuck.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
And it just matters.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
It just matters.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
It doesn't matter.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Yes.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Yes.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Our gifts are gifts.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
It's what Christmas is all about.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
It's what the holiday season is all about.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
It's about getting things of monetary and sentimental value.

31:22.000 --> 31:27.000
It's about proving love or having love disprovened unto you.

31:27.000 --> 31:32.000
It's about being able to use, you know,

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
the gift thoughtful or otherwise that people get you as

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
barometers of whether or not they care.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
It was also about giving back.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
And it's about giving back.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Yeah.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
Which I think we should get to now.

31:47.000 --> 31:58.000
Give back.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
Let's talk about it.

32:01.000 --> 32:09.000
Why do you guys think it's important to give back to those in need or otherwise?

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
It's not.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
It's not so bad.

32:11.000 --> 32:16.000
It's an important to give to people in need or otherwise.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
I guess people don't want you to give to people who don't need it.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Wow.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
So it's just a gift.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
Wow.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Selfish.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Selfish.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Selfish.

32:26.000 --> 32:37.000
Even people who have it all could use another thermos.

32:37.000 --> 32:42.000
So this is giving back to people in need and also people who are want for nothing.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Already having thermos.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Can I ask you a quick question?

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Yes.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
We're 32 minutes in and we're on the last segment.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
And we have to record another episode.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Are we, is this fine?

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Like what's the, yeah.

32:54.000 --> 33:00.000
What do you imagine the next episode to be energy slash.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Segment wise.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Energy gets up to you guys.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Because I'm only one human.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
You know, I'm just quarterback.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Right.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
So you can have the best.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
You can have the best quarterback in the league.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
But if you don't have good wide receiver.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
I feel like we don't have to talk about football analogy.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
I just asked if we were, we didn't need to slow down or anything.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
We don't need to slow down.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I have a whole another episode.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
All right.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
You know what?

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
I knew that this would happen.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
I knew that you guys would kind of sour this and not bring any ideas to the table in terms of giving that.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
You take any responsibility at all.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
Like it's like talking to your wall.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Who put the sticks in our ass?

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
I feel like I was sort of with with with the fucking birch.

33:42.000 --> 33:50.000
And then and then I get I get lambasted for having us a piss poor attitude when you fucking spew nonsense half the time.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
That's a good note.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
That's a good note.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
And you know what you could have said that.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Fifty weeks ago.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
And then we would have had a much different.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
We did.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
We did.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Yeah.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
It was clear.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Then I was listening.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
That was clear.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
I.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
So I'm living.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
On.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
I mean, I'm not going to say what street it is, but there is a school.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
About two doors down that way.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
And I've noticed in two weeks that I've been here.

34:17.000 --> 34:22.000
There've been a lot of kids outside in like the basketball court playing basketball playing.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
You're fooling around.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Really.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
It's Tom Fullerie of the lowest caliber.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
But they're just kids.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
So kind of go easy on them.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Right.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
Yeah.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
So I.

34:32.000 --> 34:37.000
I thought it'd be nice to chat them up.

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
And just hear basically try to get their Christmas wishes to Santa.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
And then because our office is not too far from here.

34:46.000 --> 34:51.000
See if head gum could make their dreams come true under the guise of Santa.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Cause news flash.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
The fat man isn't real.

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
Why are you talking to children?

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
You didn't even have to say too.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Promising.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Why are you talking?

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
Promising things to small children.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
I got them to write a couple of letters to Santa.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
All right.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Would you like to hear them?

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Yeah.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Okay.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Dear Santa.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
My name is Nancy.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
I'm seven years old.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
And I've been really good this year.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
No way.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Yes.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
No way.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Nancy was tearing it up on the playground.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
I was in Tom Follery.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Southwood.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
And it works.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Nancy.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
No.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Maybe one was born in 1936.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
But not since then.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
I want to be a astronaut when I grow up.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
So I'm like an amazing science kid for Christmas.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
This is what you think children sound like.

35:44.000 --> 35:51.000
This is what they said, man.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
So Nancy wants a science an amazing science kid for Christmas.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Do you exist anymore?

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
I don't know.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
But we got to figure this shit out, man, for Nancy.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
I don't know if we get her the kid.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
I wonder because she said she want to be an astronaut when she's older.

36:08.000 --> 36:17.000
I feel like why don't we take Nancy at Nancy's word rather than try to like infer what someone who wants to be an astronaut should get.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
I don't think she mentioned that.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I don't think that's for what she wanted.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
I think she wants to be a billionaire.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Because that's the.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Those that's who's exploring space.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Right.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
Like does she want to work at space sex or does she want to create the next space sex?

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Right.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
I don't know.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
I don't think you should be talking to the kids at all.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
It alone like having deep philosophical career discussions with them.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
I think we just need to crowdfund like a billion dollars and give it to Nancy.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
So that she can a tree for dream.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
And then it's from Santa or whatever.

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
Do we not do we not know that Nancy's parents.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
Already have a billion dollars they could.

36:56.000 --> 37:06.000
And do we not know that we're going to crowdsource a bunch of money and you're going to be the one that delivers it to Nancy, but we don't actually know if Nancy's a real person and it might just be.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Well, that would be fraud.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Yeah.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Yeah.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Which I don't think you're above.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
I'll take a broker's fee.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
But I'm going to give the money to Nancy.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
What's the broker's fee on a billion dollars?

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Um, I mean, agents take what 10%.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
And then I don't even do that much.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
And because I'm doing all of this, I would maybe 30.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
You're also not doing that much.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
I'm crowdfunding.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
I'm talking to kids.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Literally, that is not doing a lot.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
You, it's other people funding it, right?

37:37.000 --> 37:43.000
Let's go back to when we were having fun like couple months ago, right?

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
You said fun on this show.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
What do you think changed?

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
Let's do this. Let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, that one.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
I feel like we solved three million dollars for Nancy.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Let's move on.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
This one came in from Jimothy.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Who?

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Jimothy.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
No way.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
You're Santa.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Sure for.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
My name is Jimothy.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
No, really.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
I'm eight years old.

38:12.000 --> 38:18.000
And I'd love nothing more than a Harry Potter sorting hat from James.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Timothy.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
And it's high-finated.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
So I guess that's how we know where you got Jimothy from.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
Rick is typing.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
Not.

38:29.000 --> 38:35.000
I don't think that we should give Jim anything Harry Potter related.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
I think we should give him, we should sit him down.

38:37.000 --> 38:42.000
And the gift can be the eye-opening revelation that J.K.

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
Rowling is canceled.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Yeah.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
I mean, Christmas.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
I want to give him.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
I mean, it'll be like over coffee.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I'll toss him around his purse.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Yes.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
And on his own turf.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
That's something we can see because it's only two doors down for me.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Right.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Uh, definitely don't get his home.

39:04.000 --> 39:13.000
I feel like, uh, listen, I'm all for not getting children into Harry Potter properties.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
All right.

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
Someone that doesn't particularly like them, but I don't know.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
I feel like out of all out of the two letters, you've sent so far.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
This one seems most realistic in terms of what a child would want.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
Uh-huh.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
A magical hat that doesn't exist.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
Um, so why not, like, do something related, I guess.

39:34.000 --> 39:39.000
Send them to cursed child on Broadway to watch.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Let him go to that weird Harry Potter store.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
That's on 22nd Street in Manhattan.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
You know what I mean?

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
Those are good ideas.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
So we'll do that.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
We'll do that.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
And while we're kind of shaper-owning him, we'll maybe kind of tell him about uh,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
trans inclusivity.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
Uh, here we go.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
Dear Santa, Hansel here.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
As you know.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
He's seven year old, and it's Hansel.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
As you know, my dad's still away.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Not sure when he went.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
But it'd be a Christmas miracle if he came back.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
If it leased for Christmas.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
Again, this seems like more of a gift of sitting him down and having

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
a conversation with him and just kind of saying move on.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Right.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
And that should be done by his 25 year old neighbor.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
You think?

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Yes.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
24.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
But yeah.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
But when he asked earlier, when he asked,

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Santa specifically for that.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Where's that?

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
I'll also, while we're at it, might just say,

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
also Santa's not real.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Hmm.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
Santa's your parents.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
Or interest me.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Say mom.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
That's not a bad move because then he's kind of like,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
then Hansel is dealing with two things.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
You know.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Yeah.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
By the way, I don't think he's just about like my dad.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
It's like, oh, well, there's also another thing to worry about.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Correct.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Yeah.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
That's one more thing to worry about.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
And then more Broadway tickets.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
Hamilton.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
That was pretty easy.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
That was easy.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
Do Santa.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
It's your favorite good boy vessel here.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Back at it again to ask for white vans.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Hello, well.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
You boy vessel.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Pretty clear.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Yeah.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
I guess like he's asking for white vans multiple years in a row.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Mm-hmm.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Because every year the white vans become dirtier and dirtier.

41:24.000 --> 41:28.000
Maybe just like send them some starch spray starch.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
Hmm.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Did you have to take care of his own shoes?

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
The magic waste marker.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Yeah.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
The little.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
That's that's cool.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
That's what he's saying.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
That's a gift that keeps on giving.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Yeah.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Can you see him?

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
Uh.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Oh, my.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Oh, my.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Man.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
I obviously don't want it.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Not like this.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
I'm switching.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I'm genuinely concerned.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
That this is going to mess up.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Wait.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
So what's up?

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
So we're going to get him white vans.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
We're going to get him fucking shoe cleaner.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
Because that feels like cleaner.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
You're giving shoe cleaner.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Well, you're trying to get a beach.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
All of these children lessons.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
And now you don't want to teach a vessel a lesson.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
You want to give a vessel.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
What do you ask?

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
The white vans.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Let's get best of the shoes.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Well, let's get best of the shoes.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
Well, let's get best of the shoes.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
And the shoes.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
And the shoes.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
And the shoes.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
You keep these ones clean.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
And I also think we should get fucking.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
Hansel.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
Hansel's dad back.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
Like how.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
We don't even know his life.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
And then say, but he's gone.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Because he never cared about you.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
We should get the gift and the lesson.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
Yeah.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Yeah, yeah.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
You're on the floor.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
This is like a kind of a nice air.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Yeah, you have.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
It's not an Airbnb.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
It's my friends apartment.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
Oh, cool.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
She's cool place.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Um.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Dear Santa.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
I just want my girl.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
God.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Love, love, love, love, love.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
You're going to belong.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
You're going to belong.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
You're going to belong.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
You're going to belong.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
You're going to belong.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
I don't think that's going to be very healthy for me.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Okay.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
I'm glad you started caring about your health.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
Literally this moment.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
Um.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Lillian wants world peace.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
This one's.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
And we'll.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
We'll just give everyone a lesson.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
We're just going to tell her that world peace is actually complicated.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
And it means different things.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Different people.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
So all you can have is a peaceful and happy life in your world.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Create your own universe.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Tighten it family and friends.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
And that's all you can hope for.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
That's good advice.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
But that's your advice.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
So.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
So isn't that the fucking idea of the second person?

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Giving.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
My foot.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
What we can do.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
So it's hard to focus on the show.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
It's really asleep.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
And it's one of those things where any slight movement is causing me tremendous discomfort.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Yeah.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
I think that's good advice.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Let's just finish this because that's fine.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
That's good.

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
By the way, now you know the level of distraction that we deal with with you as the host.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
You're a pins and needle to us.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
We gave back.

44:09.000 --> 44:14.000
Imagine thinking this show does good for people.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
We gave back anyway.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
And I'm honestly proud of us.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
And.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
You're losing it, man.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Listen.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
It's Christmas fucking Eve for everybody else listening to this.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
What do we want to fucking say to them?

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
Because this I feel like we shouldn't even release this.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
We should do this again.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
And then I'll do another one for New Year's Eve.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
One of our worst episodes ever.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Where will you guys be on New Year's Eve?

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
Our Christmas Eve like it's December 24th night.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Yeah.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Do you guys know what you're doing?

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
Yeah.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Just a year apartment.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
Yeah.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
Awesome.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Like food wise.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Are you doing anything special?

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
Are you just going to like sort of treat it like any other night?

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
I haven't thought about it.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
I might do something special.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
You're welcome to come to chicken Falls.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
I appreciate that.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
I won't, but thank you.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
That's very kind of you.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Jeff, what do you?

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
Is it like a hand dinner or how does that work?

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
It's going to be him, Sube.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
What's that?

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
So it's like spam, Sube, where you have spam over Sube,

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
you're right.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
But it's going to be with real ham.

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
So that there's not as many preservatives on Christmas Eve.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
Yeah.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
Because that would be the 24th.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
So you know what you're eating on the 24th.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
You just don't know if that's Christmas Eve.

45:40.000 --> 45:51.000
I know we're doing ham on the 24th.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Yeah.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
It's Christmas.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Actually.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Ham over rice.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
Yeah.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
Good call.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Good call.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
I'm actually going to Ham's be on the ears.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Or Christmas Eve.

46:02.000 --> 46:10.000
It's a new ham, arms be hop up that they're doing in Boyle Heights.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
And you mean the neighborhood Boyle Heights?

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
Or my buddy Boyle.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
He's rising to new heights.

46:18.000 --> 46:28.000
That's just what ACBS pilot.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
Boyle Heights is the new heights and Boyle Heights.

46:31.000 --> 46:36.000
That's really funny, LA humor.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
What are you coming back?

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
Do you have a date?

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
Yeah.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
I think March 13th.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
He's probably going to get to your ears for a second.

46:46.000 --> 46:50.000
I just want to say that I'm grateful for all of you for listening to this show.

46:50.000 --> 46:56.000
You guys listen every week, even when we don't pull through like today.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
And I really, really.

46:59.000 --> 47:05.000
We fucking carried you for 45 minutes in your apologizing for us.

47:05.000 --> 47:11.000
You had to have a man named Vessel for five minutes.

47:11.000 --> 47:15.000
I think it's a Christmas miracle that the show has as many listeners as it is.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
And it spreads joy and liable to me.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
And legs.

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
And engine, and venture weight.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
And all the other things that you can spread.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
And I think that it's, it's not an accident.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
It's a habit.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
I mean, nothing.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
Purgs.

47:38.000 --> 47:42.000
I at the very least, I got this sentiment of thank you for listening.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
Yes.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
Yeah.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
If you take nothing across the way.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Just take that.

47:48.000 --> 47:53.000
Plugs.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
At Jeffrey James on Instagram at Jeff Beardy on Twitter.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
That's my plug.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
You guys.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
At Marie Gailon on Twitter and Instagram.

48:00.000 --> 48:05.000
Listened in the new punch of the jam hosted by Andrew Skregary.

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
And Evan Gregory who have taken over hosting duties.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
Couldn't get.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
They got weird out on their first episode.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
Yeah.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
That's pretty awesome.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
Yeah.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
We're these people.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
We're these people.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
I'm mad about it.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
Yeah.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
First of all, don't be sick.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Don't bring it up.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
Thirdly, don't name names.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
Like you have no seat at the table.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
You have no voice in the room.

48:33.000 --> 48:38.000
You're actively pushing against the company moving forward.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Yeah.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
Yeah.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Yeah.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Be quiet.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
I just don't understand how they're being settled on these two idiots.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
But the trailer got more and more.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
More downloads than any other head come trailer ever.

48:48.000 --> 48:53.000
So you're kind of like firmly in the wrong.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
Like this, their trailer got more listens than this podcast.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
They're as complex to musical comedians.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
And you're a nobody.

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
They've been doing musical comedy on the internet since you were like four.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
Yeah.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
And you're going to drunk musicals with fucking John.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Also, what is that?

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I need to know.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
It's the more drugs are doing these.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
It's like drunk Shakespeare.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
I wish it's the poorducers.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
P.O.U.R.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
God.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
And I'm here listening up.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
And it's.

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
It's a good backstage singing.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
Yeah.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
Yeah.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
Yeah.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
Did you see.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
Well, I said story.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Oh, no.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
Because Ancel Elgore is a piece of shit.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
This is true.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
However.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
Truly good.

49:43.000 --> 49:47.000
I see like confirmed a piece of shit or does he just seem like a piece of shit.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
I think it was the latter first.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
And then confirmed as of like three weeks ago.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
Also actually.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Ancel is.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Three weeks.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
Ancel is.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Ancel is.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
Ancel is.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
Ancel is.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
Ancel is.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
Ancel who's eight.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Yeah.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
Ancel Elgore.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
Right.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
Ancel.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
When is.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
During that segment.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
Nice.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Nice.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Nice.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
Nice.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
Right.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
This is.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
I'm like.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
End the fucking episode.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
We have to do another one.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
Then do your fun.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
Give us a shit.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000

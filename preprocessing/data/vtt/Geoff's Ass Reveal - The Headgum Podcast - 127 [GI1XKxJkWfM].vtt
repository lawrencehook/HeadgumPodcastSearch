00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
It's an extravaganza today. I don't know what else to say. We've got six fucking guests on the show.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
Jake and a mirror. Oh, it's kind of a get.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
Oh, I'm on nearly every episode. We got Riley. We got Kayleigh. We got Marieka.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
All on the sacks on the facts for going up the rear. Jake, you look really handsome today.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
Thanks, Sam. Jake didn't want to be here. You guys will kind of have some to do that.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
What? You also have some to do?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Jake, look at him.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
You look kind of handsome. And then it was a quick re-correct. I mean, you look handsome.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
It's really that he's not wearing shorts.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
I wasn't wearing shorts in the last episode.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
And then it's the white tea blue jeans because she didn't look as handsome an hour ago.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
It's still the same shoes though.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Marieka's already gone.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Nothing's even happened. She's over him.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
No, it's not.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
15 minutes in, I could not.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
She's pretty peek-a-boo with us.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
How's everybody feeling?

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
I want to kind of phone on the couch and I couldn't bear to be without it.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Wow.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
During the episode.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
You can't unplug for even 43 minutes.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Ooh, kind of feeling I'm going to be.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
This might be an hour and a half.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
That's a joke.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
I want to kind of give the floor to y'all.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
There's six of us on the show.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
There's two producers on Voice of God.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Mike, what is going on with you guys? What do you want to talk about?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
What's wrong with you?

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
I'm manic.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Depressive.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
I've never seen you more tense.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
The ears that I have known you.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
I've never seen you as rigid.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
If I like tapped you, you wouldn't fall over and shatter.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
I'm a boss.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm a boss.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
You're well tight today, man.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
You're well super tight.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
You're a ton.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Well, I was taught to be relaxed.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Were you?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Yeah.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
So it's sort of an act of.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Rebellion, yeah.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Come kind.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Yeah, what's up with everybody?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Come on.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Let's keep it going.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
I mean, also I'm doing great.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Really?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Yeah.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
That's so.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
It's a fun time.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Like your weekend plan to Friday.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
So what's a fun time?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
It's awesome.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
It's just almost Saturday.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
And then yeah.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
So they were on the court.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
You're going for Sunday.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
And then Monday.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
I'm a week, night warrior.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I feel like they're on the day.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Because Monday isn't here yet.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
That's what I do.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I love what I do.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
I don't know what else to say.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
What else is going on with everybody else?

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
I'm missing the first preview of and Julia tonight.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Really?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
So jealous.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Is that a two box musical?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Yeah.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Yeah.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
What?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Come on.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Come on the way.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Oh.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
It's.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
It's.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
I can't.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
I can't.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
If you buy ticket, you can also see the show.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Not necessarily with me.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm not stopping you from going.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Well, I feel like we'd go together.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
And I really you'd provide the ticket and the access.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
And they do the wine in the little sippy top thing.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Well, you get to buy that for sure.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
And then you know 24 dollars.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
You're obviously going to buy a double.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
So yeah, that's like $24.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
So you go for what's musical for what for what band isn't it usually one band?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Or is it just like a suit?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
So this is a.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
It's a songwriter that wrote songs for like Britney Spears.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Backstreet boys, like all of the huge hits.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Keshows below trying to just like go songs that are.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Doct.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
This is Doctor Luke's music.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
It's a Luke box musical.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Nice.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Oh, yes.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Very good.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Perfect.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Um, they add.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
So it just about songs.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Yeah.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
That's pop song style.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Oh, well, not real.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
I mean, they're they're definitely just like very poppy sounding.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
And we could just for the sake of time.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
I think we don't explore the nuance within.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
He doesn't have to get it exactly what it is.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
I was just going to say it's about what if Julia didn't die at the end of Romeo and Juliet.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
That's fun.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
That's the whole plot.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
It's fun.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
It's a good time.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Sodom Monday and excited to see it tonight.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Stronger than yes.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
I actually be in it.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I love that song.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
It's good.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Kayla Riley.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Arm wrestle for who gets to go next.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
I love that.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I want to that.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
I'll defer.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Put it on a glove.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Speaking of defer.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
You have you have a heart out today because you're.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
You have a call back for a commercial for the US Army Reserve.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Hey, dude.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
I mean.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
It's one of those things where she wants to be.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
I have to leave it one to one.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Even if we're still going.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
I'm sorry.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I will be getting up and leaving the room.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
It's in the military.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
If you're earlier on time.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
You're on time.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Yeah.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Who are?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Yes.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Bring your King James Bible.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Riley.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
The few of the proud.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
It's already packed, brother.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
It's in the super house.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Hi.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Ready to go.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
And we should say that your King James Bible is just something you bought it.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
So the bees that used to be owned by Lebron.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Yes.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
It's Lebron's old Bible.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Yeah.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Yeah.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
That's it.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Kayla.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Well, I came into the office today to take some calls.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
And now I'm on this podcast.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
That was unexpected.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Okay.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
They were basically accustomed to me saying, okay.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
They really want to be on the show today.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
I don't think that's true.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Who's they?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Y'all.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Y'all.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I'm not going to betray you like this.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
But we'll talk about this afterwards.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Wow.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
She's a wonderful.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Playing both sides.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I don't even know how to feel about that.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
That's the only way for the group chat.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
com.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
I just come in here to take a call and I'm just got put on the show to embarrass me like that.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
You can't do this to me.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Okay.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
I can't believe there are eight people on the show tonight.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
I'm tired too, man.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Is this the most people that's ever been on an action?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Yeah.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
At the live show at the live show, there was like 10 people on stage.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
She should be.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Yeah.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
But in different combinations, I think eight at once has never happened.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
So other than the US national.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
No one has.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Are you losers?

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
What's the new in-the-life in times of Marie-Jude?

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
I mean, what's bigger than that, right?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Your middle names?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Or the commercial.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Both.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
I think I'm going to go see that I'm forgetting the name of it.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
But the new Colin Farrell Martin McDonough movie tonight.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
The band she used to have in this Sharon.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Yes, I'm seeing that tonight.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Great, thank you.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
I'm very excited.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
It's a favorite movie of the year.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
That's what I've heard.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
I've heard it's awesome.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
And it's very Irish.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
It's like, you know.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
What?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
What?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
What do you, what does that have to do with you?

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
You're taking credit for Ireland now.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
What?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
And you acted like we all know.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Oh, you know.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
That's very...

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Say it.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
What do you have to do with Ireland?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
I'm curious.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Do you guys know?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Or is it like common knowledge?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Okay.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
We've never done this before.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
What?

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
I want you guys to take out your phones, start recording a voice memo, and go out

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
into the other room and settle this.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
No way.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
We don't have to do that.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
We don't have to do that.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
And then when you come back in, whatever I'll edit it in seamlessly,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
we'll hear the conflict resolution.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
In full.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
That'll take 10 to 10 minutes.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
And I remember I haven't already had a heart out.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
So.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
I have a shout-in-go-on.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
You fucking kidding.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Why do we have so many people on today's episode?

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Uh, it was a thing that I asked to...

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
I asked for people and didn't realize it.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
And then Kayla walked in and I was like,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
okay, it was never in LA.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Let me just...

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
We already have five.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Why not?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
It's too many people.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
I'm down to lead.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
No, Jake.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
You can leave at the ad break if you want.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
That's...

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
And I'm being serious.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
You can leave at the ad break.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Also, there's...

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah, there's really important seconds to get through.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Don't give it that out.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Jake, it's pounding.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
It's fucking down.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
You need it?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Give it an egg time or no.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Everyone's up too.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Let's take a quick break.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Well, you didn't go.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I, uh, yeah.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Nothing's up with me.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Just hanging out.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Um, if you're not giving yourself an upgraded man.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Give it a dog.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Yeah.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
You liked 100 miles?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Uh, yep, did a century.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
That was a few.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
That was a month ago.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Or three or four weeks ago.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Yeah.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Like, still good now, though.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
Well, let's keep it going with everybody's bonds of the weed.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
It's segment size.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
You say the segment size?

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
I'm waiting on fucking Barbara, broccoli or otherwise,

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
to fucking make a decision.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
And it's going to...

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
You know, it's going to be a Ren-A gene page, or whatever.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Oh, yes.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Reggae, Jean-Page.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
That.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Reggae, Jean-Page.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
My bond of the week has been stellar just so he can get out of his father's shadow.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
His father's dead.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Nice.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Well, not going to get much better than screaming at George Costanza.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
So he needs something.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
He needs a vehicle.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
And don't say directing severance was that because it wasn't.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Okay.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I'll say you.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
I will say Jeffrey James.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Wow.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Wow.

10:03.000 --> 10:10.000
Because I feel like nobody is more dialed into this decision than you.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
Nobody has considered more bonds than you.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Nobody knows more than what it takes to be bond than you.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
I think that's a more of an argument for me to work in casting.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
That's interesting.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
But you have that impeccable British accent.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Let's hear it.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Yeah.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
The face.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
This in M.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
I'm not too sure about this mission, yeah.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Right.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
What's all this saying?

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
Oh, there's a new bad guy living in the moldy.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I love the work.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Now that I spend, you can do it.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
You're going to.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
I'll be doing some posh version.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
The.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Yeah.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
Listen.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
I don't know if I can do posh British for some reason.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Then you can.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
For some reason.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
You are going to.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
I don't know why you do all the English dialects except for that.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
I guess because it's so cool.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
What about James does New York?

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
So it's bond in like fucking at Rollo's.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Eating so rich one.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
That's Queens for sure.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
That's New York.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
I'm just saying he could be like.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
True.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
The names bond.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
James bond.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
And I'm more comfortable doing that accent.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
I really only know Brooklyn is because I did a dialect class.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
And I was born with Brooklyn.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Wow.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Well, it was for a play.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Obviously.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
What play?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Saturday night.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Sometimes first piece.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Yeah.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
So the meat.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Yeah.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
The one uses a clear reference all the time.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
So what do you do on a Saturday night?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Oh, loan.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
That's my experience.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Every week in the mirror.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
I feel like we've done Jeffrey before.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Because I remember making the Jeffrey James bond.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Yeah.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Same.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Wow.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Was I.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I must imagine that episode.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
I guess not.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
My bond of the week.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I think it's going to be Dingo her with.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
I guess I have it.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
We've never had a dog bond.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Yeah.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
That's happened with.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
There's nothing in the rule book that says that a dog can't be bought.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
That's right.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
An air-bud bond.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Yeah.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Air-bud bond.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
I imagine him in a little suit.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Yeah.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
He has the agility and the intelligence.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
He's not an air-bud story.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
He does.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
And he just got a wrist diarrhea.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
So I feel like he's he's ready to go.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
So he's ready to go.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Yeah.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
I did hear that on no time today.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Dingo Craig had to pause production for like two and a half weeks.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Because he had horrible.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Because he wasn't over a day.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
She was sort of Kayla style.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Yeah.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Thank you.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
He's been put on blast twice on this podcast already.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I don't know why I'm even here.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
You got to walk up.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
You have the most reason.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I know why she's here.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
And she know it's why she's here.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
I know.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
I just wait till the ad break.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Please.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
What?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Not everybody needs to have a bond with me.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
But if anybody else has one, let's hear it.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
And then let's move on.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
I have a quick one.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
I'm going to say Bill Hayder.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Because I'm finally catching up on the latest season.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Very.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And I'd kind of like a tree.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Yeah.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
You're just attracted to every average looking white guy.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
A trap.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
A trap.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
A trap.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
A tree.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I loved that.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Anybody else?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Good move on.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Finally.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
If you just do it.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Is that fine?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Henry Winkler.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
I would also take a ball on it.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Okay.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
For the independent scientist,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Warren, that stopping toddler's napping,

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
could be dangerous.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
So.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
What's that?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
So what?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
He takes down.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
What is that?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Why didn't read the whole article?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Dangerous for who?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
The fucking parents.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Because of the rage of the fatigue.

14:03.000 --> 14:10.000
When I was three, I threw a dish at my daddy.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Okay.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
This is why Jeff finds you here.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
This is why he was so adamant about you.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
All right.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
He has a leg.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
She has no way.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
He heard the rhyme.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
He can get out of here.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
None of us have kids.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
None of us are with child here.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Is that safe to say?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
With child needs pregnant.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
So.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
You know, but that's even that would be a little bit closer to having a dangerous.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Fucker.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Fucker.

14:33.000 --> 14:40.000
What I was for I hurled the bowl at my door.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
That was a horrible rhyme.

14:42.000 --> 14:49.000
For the early times of Bay Area Mayor was punched in the chest by a passerby.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
That's fine.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
A Bay Area Mayor.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
So I'm not even the Mayor.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
A Bay Area Mayor.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
That's good.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
A Bay Area.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
A Bay Area.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Yeah.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
A Bay Area.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
A Bay Area.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
A Bay Area.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
A Bay Area.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
A Bay Area.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
So is that a tour area?

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
Just because it's like, I, this episode, and then I was on a couple weeks ago, but

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
I have been on in years.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Is this a segment?

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Like, of you, just kind of like shooting off puns,

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
based off headline.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
It's news of the day.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
I have the same question.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
I have the same question because you've been on like three months.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Yeah.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
That was three months.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Wow.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Yeah.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
You just have theme songs.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Yeah.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
And here's a new segment.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
You just kind of launch into like, don't wake a kid up.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
And what are we supposed to do with that?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Don't worry, darling.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
It's always been part of the wax.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Don't call me darling.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Never.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
No.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
It's a staple of the show for, I feel like two years has been waxed.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
And then also I started introducing news of the day.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
And now I've sort of morphed the two.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Come up with a love child.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
And it's this.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
The wax of the now.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
The wax of the now.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Really.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
It also sounds like a waxing salon.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
It's bad.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
It's a bad time to be a booster slacker.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
It says the Atlantic.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
I just got my booster on Wednesday.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
How are you feeling?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
It really didn't do much to me.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Well, you got a two days ago.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Yeah.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
I did too.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
I almost did it on yesterday.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
I think it's just eight.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
So I guess the difference between me and you.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Well, he's improved wax.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
But anti boost.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
How does that sound to everybody?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Not great.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Not.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
It doesn't sound actually.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Yeah.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
I got my booster two weeks ago.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Yeah.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
I did as well.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
That's awesome.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Yeah.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
So I'm anti boost.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
So that means.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
It's like.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Right.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
The vaccines work.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
The booster who needs it.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
The booster is like.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Because they stop working after a while.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Interesting.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Interesting.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
I didn't realize that.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Is it interesting?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Let's move on.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
I have to do my own research.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
But we'll figure it out.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Yeah.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
It's the same exact thing.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Yeah.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
What is the difference between sweet potatoes and yams?

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
That's right.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
What is the difference between sweet potatoes and yams?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
That's right.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
That's right.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
Pretty sure they were the same thing.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
I thought we're supposed to wax and see not allowed to interrupt you.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
See not allowed to speak.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
He is.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
It felt like.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Also, wasn't really anyone up to him.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
It seemed like that was the end of the.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Is there more?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
I have a hot take.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Yeah.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
I think sweet potatoes are disgusting.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
I do too.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I really actually.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Wait.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Everyone looks like I'm insane.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Yeah.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
I.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
I.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
I think they're fine.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
But it's just they're not better than fries.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
The idea sometimes they're an upcharge to fries.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
I'm like 70% crazy.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
And I can make the fries worse.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
No.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Yeah.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I don't think the boosters work either, right?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
No.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
I'm not sure.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
We're on the same exact.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
They're shoe warning.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
No.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
We did.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
That.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
It's not interesting.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Also, I can tell you're bottomless.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
I'm just fine.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
But it makes me slightly uncomfortable.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
I don't really.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Not to know that.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Okay.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
I did.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
I have to be honest.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Marika and Anya the meeting that we had on Tuesday.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
I wasn't wearing pants.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Yeah.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
I'll tell you.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
You don't have to tell us.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Well, it's because I had.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
I had not.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
I'm also not wearing pants.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Yes.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
I feel the commission is worse than the crime on this one.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
All right.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Well, I'll edit that out.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
When we record virtually.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Yeah.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
I've never done bottomless.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
I don't want to be a view.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Or on the Hickenbuck.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
It was just that meeting because I thought it was going to be late.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
And then I couldn't find my pants because I was not in my house.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Can I confess something about that meeting?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Yeah.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
And it's not a sushi restaurant.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Where are you wearing pants?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Also bottomless.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Bottomless.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Mamosas.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Oh.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Damn.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Damn.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Damn.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Damn.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Um.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
You all ready for fish?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Oh.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Oh.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Get damn things.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
This is not my god.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
No.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Jesus.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
I'm not dying.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I'm serving it to you.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Yeah.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Ready for fish.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
I think you're like, oh, yeah.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
That's guillaume.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
That's guillaume.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
All right.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Let's take a break.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
And we're going to have some.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
For some of these folks.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
What is the difference between sweet potatoes in the end?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
My God.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Although sweet potatoes in the end are both roof vegetables.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
They are not related to one another.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And different taste texture and appearance.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Great.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Thank you.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Awesome.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
So they are the same.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Guys, it's Halloween.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
Or when you're listening to this November 4th.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Been listening to a lot of Halloween music.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Specifically the monster mash.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Specifically it's almost Halloween.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Panic at the disco, et cetera.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
I've also been listening to a lot of Hollywood handbook.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
My favorite podcast.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Go listen to that instead of this one.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
And it's been great.

19:41.000 --> 19:47.000
And one reason why it's been great to listen to is because I use my Raycon wireless ear buds to do it.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Right?

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
Raycon's everyday ear buds look, feel, and sound better than ever.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Right?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
With optimized gel tips for the perfect in-ear fit.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
These things never fall out of my ears.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
No matter how many secret staircases I walk up and down,

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
either than they're on.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
And they're so comfortable.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I promise you they will not budge.

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
I promise you they feel better in my ears than other leading wireless air bud brands.

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
Raycon gives you eight hours of playtime with a 32-hour battery life.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
And the price just right.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
All right?

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
These things are also easy to lose.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Not that you want to lose them or have to replace them all the time,

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
but they are half the price of other premium audio brands.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
It's no wonder why Raycon's everyday ear buds have over 50,000 five-star reviews.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
And you know what?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I'll do you one better.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Five stars.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
There's three customizable sound profiles.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
So you can up the base.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
You can do a focus or listening mode.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
They really have incredible functionality.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And I sing their praises.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I even if they stop sponsoring the show,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
I would still use them.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
They really are that good.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
And you guys know that music means a lot to the world.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Right?

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
Music is love and love is love is love is love.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
So by Raycon.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
I don't know what else to say.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
You can also do noise isolation.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Right?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
And awareness mode.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
So if you're out in public and you want to be able to hear a little bit more of your surroundings.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
That's when I use awareness mode.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
So go to buyraycon.com today and use code.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Thanks Raycon.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
What else do you got?

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Oh, I got something else for you guys.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
So.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Don't say it like that.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
As we all know.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
For months on the show.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Oh my god.

21:48.000 --> 21:53.000
I had been sort of toying with the idea of not only joy, but also once I reached

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
10,000 followers on Twitter.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
You'd bear your ass.

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
I'd bear my ass for all to see on the timeline of Twitter.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
You couldn't find her eye in there.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
That couldn't see.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Yeah, I knew you were like a 10.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
It happened last week.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Last Wednesday, I believe.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
10,000.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Still there.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Still at 10,000.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
And I immediately panicked.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
I didn't know what to do.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
I didn't know who to be.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
I didn't know if I should show everything down to my knees.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
So I took a photo.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
I took a selfie time or photo in my living room.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
That ultimately was a good photo with me.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
But it wasn't funny.

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
I was like, it's better than it just not post this than to post this photo.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Because it's just not, you're not it.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
You know, I said it.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
You're not it.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Fuck all of you.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
So.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
I did a thing.

22:50.000 --> 22:56.000
I hired a Boudoir photographer.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Oh my god.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Okay.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
That's what I wanted a pure space loft downtown.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
This all cost me $500.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
And I want to make good on the promise.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
I just unfollowed you.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
It looks like you're back for three.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
I'm seeing nine, eight.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Oh, one.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
There you go.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Yeah.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Wow.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
I'm a man of my word.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
I cry.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Not only in terms of posting the photo.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
But of all the.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
Honestly, I verbally surrounding my.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Rump.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
So without further ado.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Oh, my god.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
I'm up.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
I'm up.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Hang on.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Let me find us.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Are we all good with seeing Jeff's ass?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Yeah.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
Can I also get verbal consent from everybody and if everybody doesn't want to see this, you can step out of the room.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
You should be a photo of your ass before.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
So it's not your thing.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
I haven't seen and I didn't get.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Give you consent for the last time.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
So Casey.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Yeah.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
I've already seen a photo of your ass.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Yeah.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
I didn't give consent for that.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
I don't know where you saw that.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I'm your phone, Jake's phone.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Someone showed it.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
That's how I'm offended.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
It's been passed around.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Being asked around.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
No.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Oh.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Yeah.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Absolutely.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Yeah.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
I'd also like to see your ass.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
All right.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
I've been waiting.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
We just need to be.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Yes.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Sure.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Yes.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Definitely.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
I said.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
I have also already seen your ass.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Hello.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Oh my god.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
John C.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Oh my god.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Oh my god.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Oh my god.

24:33.000 --> 24:57.000
That is part-skinned by Zona Gail.

24:57.000 --> 25:04.000
I mean, it's just an ass.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
Why is that bad?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
We have to tweet it.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
I'm going to tweet it right now.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
We're going to get the light.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
We're going to get the light.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Yeah.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
Why is it the time to stop looking on your face?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Are you cross?

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
I'm all tired.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Okay, and here's my question to y'all.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
You guys can help me craft this.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Do I capture it at all?

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
I think no cat.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Yeah.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Present.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
It's tweeted.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Will it be blurred?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Like, you know, it's like, click to reveal.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Or is it just like, it just normal?

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Well, now Elon owns the bitch.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Yeah.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
I mean, this is a musk scene, right?

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Should I retweet it?

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
Also, you must have taken more photos than this.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Yeah.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
I want to see the outtakes also.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Do you want to see the outtakes?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I don't want to show you afterwards.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Because the other ones are more revealing.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
And I don't feel comfortable showing the internet.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
Like, I want to.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
I want to.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Like, how are they coaching you through this?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
They.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
You did unfollow me.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
It's as jicker which followed you back.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Yeah.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
You just want to see if I was at 10.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Yeah.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
I want to see if I was at 10.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Yeah.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
I want to see if I could push the.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Put you the other way.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Yeah.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
I just want to get the live tweeter.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Link the likes, re-tweets and comments.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Yeah.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Here we go.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Live tweeter.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Yeah.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Let's see some live tweeters.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
We're at nine, like, so 10 likes.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
It'll be so sad if it just doesn't look like two re-tweets.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Seven likes.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
It's funny because it's actually true.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Like, it was a build-up to a thing.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
And now it's here.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
And that's it.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
God.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I finally got to see the high-res photo.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Yeah.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Yeah.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Yeah.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Oh my God.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
Jeff, are you aware, if you, if I turn my brightness up, I can see whole.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Is that fine with you?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Oh my God.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Are you?

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
I've looked at it every week.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Wait, you can see crack.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
You can't see whole.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
There's a hint of nut down here by you.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
There's me.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
No way.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
Did your family know you did this?

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
I called my mom afterwards because we had a phone call scheduled.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
And she was like, what'd you do today?

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
And I was like, oh my God.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
I had a photo shoot.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.680
Also, the heart's kindred thing was in my child, like, not childhood bedroom, but my parents

27:27.680 --> 27:29.680
house, the place I sleep at.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.680
And I was like, oh can you send me that book?

27:31.680 --> 27:32.680
I needed for a thing.

27:32.680 --> 27:34.680
And she was like, yeah, what do you need it for?

27:34.680 --> 27:35.680
I'm like, I'll photoshoot.

27:35.680 --> 27:38.320
And then like, I just was dancing around it and she was finding, like, what was

27:38.320 --> 27:39.320
the photo shoot?

27:39.320 --> 27:43.320
And I was like, I, it was a Twitter bit, you know, you know, it's a little racially

27:43.320 --> 27:45.320
clad, but you know, it's nothing.

27:45.320 --> 27:46.320
It's pretty tasty.

27:46.320 --> 27:47.320
Yeah.

27:47.320 --> 27:50.520
But I, I can see that this is your parents living room.

27:50.520 --> 27:51.520
I know these.

27:51.520 --> 27:52.520
God.

27:52.520 --> 27:55.880
This was, I mean, I can show you the other one.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.480
I know's your boots.

27:57.480 --> 28:00.680
Those are my cowboy boots.

28:00.680 --> 28:03.040
And in the conversation you had with the photographer.

28:03.040 --> 28:06.280
Oh, and that was, that was also a very serendipitous, right?

28:06.280 --> 28:11.560
So I got to 10,000 on a Wednesday and I was like, this needs to go up ASAP, rocky.

28:11.560 --> 28:17.800
And it, I was like, oh, and I reached out to my photographer, but who was Ferrell's photographer.

28:17.800 --> 28:18.800
She's unbelievable.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.720
This is the day you got boosted, right?

28:20.720 --> 28:21.720
This was Latin.

28:21.720 --> 28:23.080
No, this was a week from then.

28:23.080 --> 28:24.080
Yeah.

28:24.080 --> 28:29.600
Anyway, but she was still in New York and also was like, I can't do it pro bono.

28:29.600 --> 28:32.320
And my rate is really high.

28:32.320 --> 28:41.440
This was the, uh, other so much, which I'm like, I can't believe, that one has rise.

28:41.440 --> 28:42.440
That one straight up as well.

28:42.440 --> 28:43.840
That's why it's cropped so high.

28:43.840 --> 28:48.440
Also, you could see my dick and balls in this one, so I had to crop it.

28:48.440 --> 28:56.000
Oh, and this was the, this was the other one was, uh, hey, being this close to the city.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Oh, my god.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Oh, my god.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
An inch away.

28:59.000 --> 29:06.760
Are you flexing your butt, so no, my ass is really good.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.760
Can I share my feet back on this one?

29:08.760 --> 29:10.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.880
Because I, I didn't see this one previously.

29:11.880 --> 29:17.760
I told him that he should crop out his head, which I think looks way, so if we just zoom in,

29:17.760 --> 29:22.280
no, but if we zoom in and crop out your head, people with a single semener.

29:22.280 --> 29:24.040
But then how will they know?

29:24.040 --> 29:25.040
Yeah.

29:25.040 --> 29:26.040
No, but people with a single semener.

29:26.040 --> 29:30.320
That's like that's like that's bad photo.

29:30.320 --> 29:31.320
Yeah.

29:31.320 --> 29:32.800
I think that's proportion better.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.120
I think it makes your head look weird.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.120
All right.

29:36.120 --> 29:38.040
Well, you know what, that, I'm just saying that that was the outtick.

29:38.040 --> 29:42.280
I don't want to show the one because people can pause it, and it is too revealing.

29:42.280 --> 29:46.200
But I will show you, I can upass it around for anyone who wants to see it.

29:46.200 --> 29:50.120
This was the other one that was a little more Kim Kay was a little more a break the internet,

29:50.120 --> 29:54.520
but is truly what do you mean, this one's revealing what do you mean by revealing?

29:54.520 --> 29:56.320
I'm not sending it to anyone.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.280
No one's going to have it on their phone.

29:58.280 --> 29:59.640
You're not going to text it to me?

29:59.640 --> 30:00.640
Of course not.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.920
You're going to wing to it, man.

30:01.920 --> 30:08.000
What are we going to do after the ad break?

30:08.000 --> 30:13.480
It's just like, like, speel or no speel, like, how do we move on from that?

30:13.480 --> 30:15.080
God, where the fuck did it go?

30:15.080 --> 30:19.480
Or any replies, by the way, it feels like people are just like, like, you got a little

30:19.480 --> 30:20.480
refresh?

30:20.480 --> 30:22.480
Yeah, I'll look.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.200
Yeah, there are a lot of, a lot of replies.

30:24.200 --> 30:25.200
Low energy Jeff.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.200
There's a quote to me.

30:26.200 --> 30:29.040
Does anybody want to see the other selects, like, outticks?

30:29.040 --> 30:30.040
You can flash them.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.040
I'm not going to see them.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.040
You're sending them to me.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.040
I want to see them.

30:33.040 --> 30:37.960
But when you say revealing, like, is this, she sees her eyes.

30:37.960 --> 30:38.960
I need to get going.

30:38.960 --> 30:39.960
Yeah.

30:39.960 --> 30:43.880
This one involves him sitting on a goi tiger.

30:43.880 --> 30:49.120
This is me on a tiger, a metal tiger, and now, like, the cheeks are kind of red.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.480
I might, this might be my favorite.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.480
Yeah.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.880
People like that one better, but I don't feel comfortable posting it.

30:53.880 --> 30:56.160
Do you want to see me or send it to me?

30:56.160 --> 30:57.160
I'll send it to you.

30:57.160 --> 31:00.720
I'll send it to on you too.

31:00.720 --> 31:01.720
Thanks.

31:01.720 --> 31:02.720
Well, wait a minute.

31:02.720 --> 31:03.720
If you're badly yeah, weeding this.

31:03.720 --> 31:04.720
It's a grand vanish mode.

31:04.720 --> 31:05.720
Yeah.

31:05.720 --> 31:06.720
Beautiful.

31:06.720 --> 31:07.720
Good work.

31:07.720 --> 31:10.200
You can just post a fleet about it.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.200
So it's sort of disappeared.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.800
You're obsessed with the fleet.

31:12.800 --> 31:16.000
You're obsessed with the fleetor.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.440
Is Elon bringing him at back?

31:17.440 --> 31:18.440
I don't know.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.680
He hasn't responded to any of my DM.

31:20.680 --> 31:21.680
All right.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.680
I sent it to you all.

31:22.680 --> 31:25.480
We do have to take a quick break and thank some sponsors.

31:25.480 --> 31:28.760
I'm sure they're going to be thrilled with this episode.

31:28.760 --> 31:29.760
Yeah.

31:29.760 --> 31:30.760
I'll be right back.

31:30.760 --> 31:32.040
I'm something caught in my throat.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.040
It's cool.

31:33.080 --> 31:46.480
Jesus Christ did you know this photographer?

31:46.480 --> 31:50.320
I'll tell the story when we get back in the break.

31:50.320 --> 31:53.560
I just can't stop thinking about Jake saying hint of nut.

31:53.560 --> 31:57.360
I don't think that would stay with me for the rest of my life.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.760
Jeff, why is this?

31:58.760 --> 32:01.000
How is this any worse than the others than that one?

32:01.000 --> 32:03.760
I just think it.

32:03.760 --> 32:07.760
If you zoom in on that one, there's like it's inching on hold.

32:07.760 --> 32:08.760
Yeah.

32:08.760 --> 32:12.520
And also I just think I look better in the other one.

32:12.520 --> 32:13.520
Inching.

32:13.520 --> 32:14.520
I love it.

32:14.520 --> 32:15.520
It's an old thing.

32:15.520 --> 32:16.520
It's an old thing.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.520
On hold.

32:17.520 --> 32:18.520
On fleek.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.280
And now I'll always have an on fleets.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.520
That's good.

32:22.520 --> 32:23.520
On hold.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.520
On fleets.

32:25.520 --> 32:29.120
And the bathroom is on sweet.

32:29.120 --> 32:30.120
It is.

32:30.120 --> 32:31.960
Well, this is a band or like Twitter.

32:31.960 --> 32:34.080
You can post porn to Twitter technically.

32:34.080 --> 32:35.080
Yeah.

32:35.080 --> 32:38.120
I want to retweet, but I don't want it to be on my timeline.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.120
Yeah.

32:43.120 --> 32:46.320
John Cena.

32:46.320 --> 32:48.240
Here's my weena.

32:48.240 --> 32:50.360
My God.

32:50.360 --> 32:51.800
Gorgeous work kids.

32:55.320 --> 32:58.080
I was captivated by the flowers.

32:58.080 --> 32:58.920
All right, ready?

32:58.920 --> 33:00.400
That was the main event.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.200
Jesus, Chris.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.360
Are you going to keep this up?

33:02.360 --> 33:04.600
What's your next week going to be?

33:04.600 --> 33:05.600
Dick.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.080
The word at 25k.

33:10.080 --> 33:16.560
Jay, Jay, I can't see what's going on.

33:16.560 --> 33:17.640
I'm not even serious.

33:17.640 --> 33:20.480
This is a slippery as slow.

33:20.480 --> 33:22.280
We are back.

33:22.280 --> 33:25.360
Guys, we'll keep checking in on the Twitter every a couple minutes.

33:25.360 --> 33:27.560
But for now, it's time to play.

33:37.560 --> 33:41.560
Welcome to Jasper John's or Vince Vaughan.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.560
No.

33:43.560 --> 33:46.360
Let's see the other pictures of your ass.

33:46.360 --> 33:50.000
Those were the two selects, man.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.800
Yeah, this is Jasper John's or Vince Vaughan.

33:51.800 --> 33:52.920
So I'm going to read quotes.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.560
And you have to attribute them together.

33:54.640 --> 33:57.840
The visual artist Jasper John's or the visual artist.

33:57.840 --> 34:00.280
Visual artist Vince Vaughan.

34:00.280 --> 34:03.600
So my joke about just moving on with a show with a stupid game was.

34:03.600 --> 34:04.920
We're moving on correct.

34:04.920 --> 34:05.920
We're moving.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.280
That's very good.

34:07.280 --> 34:11.080
We're launching into the second half.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.080
Here we go.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.280
Well, yeah, it's two of the greatest artists of our time.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.760
Of our time, which one said what?

34:16.760 --> 34:17.760
Here we go.

34:17.760 --> 34:18.960
I was a bad water till very late.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.320
My mom used to hang my sheets out the window to dry and I'd have to run home from school

34:22.320 --> 34:24.520
in order to beat the other kids to my house so they wouldn't see this.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.760
It feels like a Jasper John.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.560
I'm going to say Jasper John's as well.

34:29.560 --> 34:30.760
Yeah, because why would it be?

34:30.760 --> 34:31.760
Wow.

34:31.760 --> 34:32.760
It was Vince.

34:32.760 --> 34:33.760
Wow.

34:33.760 --> 34:36.360
So he was afraid that his like eight-year-old friend to be like,

34:36.360 --> 34:37.760
holy shit, you wet your bed.

34:37.760 --> 34:40.480
I can see your mom posting your sheets up on a clothes.

34:40.480 --> 34:42.320
Which, by the way, if they're on a clothespin,

34:42.320 --> 34:43.160
they're clean.

34:43.160 --> 34:44.280
The piece out.

34:44.280 --> 34:46.160
That just looks like someone's doing laundry.

34:46.160 --> 34:46.640
Yeah.

34:46.640 --> 34:48.760
Well, that's why he's been saying Republican though.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.000
Yeah, he's just busy.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.760
What about Vincent Vaughan go?

34:51.760 --> 34:52.760
That's good.

34:52.760 --> 34:54.040
We wasn't an option.

34:54.280 --> 34:56.720
And the game that you made, right?

34:56.720 --> 34:58.320
The last book I read was a book,

34:58.320 --> 35:02.000
the book I've been rereading my most of my life, the fountain head.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.600
Jasper John.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.440
Oh, I thought that was you saying that.

35:05.440 --> 35:08.080
Oh, I thought that was you saying that.

35:08.080 --> 35:09.280
I'm going to go, Vince.

35:09.280 --> 35:10.560
I'm going to go, Vince as well.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.400
Give me Vince.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.400
Ooh.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.840
Uh, what's that?

35:15.840 --> 35:17.400
That's so sad for him.

35:17.400 --> 35:20.080
I knew it was more mortified at that than the ass pictures.

35:20.080 --> 35:21.080
Yeah.

35:21.400 --> 35:24.000
It would be just an embarrassing thing to admit.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.040
Yeah, the ass was fun.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.040
Yeah.

35:26.040 --> 35:30.160
I wish there were more humor in my work than I see in it.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.160
Jasper.

35:31.160 --> 35:32.000
Jasper, Jasper, Jasper.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.760
Give me Jasper.

35:33.760 --> 35:36.160
That's correct.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.320
Well, these sound effects don't work in my headphones.

35:38.320 --> 35:42.080
Yeah, that sounds like you're stuck.

35:42.080 --> 35:43.640
Yeah, good.

35:43.640 --> 35:46.200
I'm a horrible golfer.

35:46.200 --> 35:49.160
Vince, Vince, correct.

35:49.160 --> 35:50.680
Even you don't care about care.

35:50.680 --> 35:51.680
Yeah.

35:51.680 --> 35:55.680
This is the most joyless segment I've ever been a part of.

35:55.680 --> 35:56.680
Yeah.

35:56.680 --> 35:58.680
You've been really rare, though.

35:58.680 --> 36:03.680
Well, you'll never do it for all to see and now your life has no meaning.

36:03.680 --> 36:04.680
Yeah.

36:04.680 --> 36:06.680
Don't you realize you're fine here.

36:06.680 --> 36:07.680
Yeah.

36:07.680 --> 36:08.680
You've achieved it all.

36:08.680 --> 36:09.680
Oh, yeah.

36:09.680 --> 36:10.680
And there's no way else.

36:10.680 --> 36:11.680
But down.

36:11.680 --> 36:12.680
Yeah.

36:12.680 --> 36:15.680
You've actually, you've peaked when you showed your crater.

36:15.680 --> 36:16.680
Isn't that interesting?

36:16.680 --> 36:18.680
Well, there's also two peaks.

36:19.680 --> 36:20.680
20, 20.

36:20.680 --> 36:21.680
20.

36:21.680 --> 36:22.680
20.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.680
And my, yeah.

36:23.680 --> 36:25.680
I didn't know the cell phone for a long time.

36:25.680 --> 36:26.680
I was late in the game.

36:26.680 --> 36:27.680
I'm not in the back.

36:27.680 --> 36:28.680
Vince Vanco.

36:28.680 --> 36:29.680
Vince Vanco.

36:29.680 --> 36:31.680
It feels like a Vince.

36:31.680 --> 36:32.680
Ice.

36:32.680 --> 36:34.680
I'll just go Jasper.

36:34.680 --> 36:35.680
Sam.

36:35.680 --> 36:36.680
Jasper.

36:36.680 --> 36:39.680
Vincent is correct.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.680
Have you seen Swingers?

36:41.680 --> 36:47.680
Have you seen anyone be kind to you when you talk to people like that?

36:48.680 --> 36:49.680
I was just going to say that you might.

36:49.680 --> 36:50.680
You, I think you'd really like it.

36:50.680 --> 36:51.680
Oh, really?

36:51.680 --> 36:52.680
Yeah.

36:52.680 --> 36:53.680
Yeah.

36:53.680 --> 36:54.680
I might check it out.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.680
He seems genuinely hurt by that.

36:56.680 --> 37:00.680
It's a really long on perfection.

37:00.680 --> 37:01.680
Jasper.

37:01.680 --> 37:02.680
Jasper.

37:02.680 --> 37:03.680
Correct.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.680
Correct.

37:05.680 --> 37:06.680
All right.

37:06.680 --> 37:08.680
Just saying that the middle three letters.

37:08.680 --> 37:09.680
I don't know.

37:09.680 --> 37:10.680
Right.

37:10.680 --> 37:15.680
And then it's less and less.

37:16.680 --> 37:18.680
So you're down to just the middle E.

37:18.680 --> 37:19.680
Oh.

37:19.680 --> 37:20.680
Yeah.

37:20.680 --> 37:23.680
I don't know how to have thoughts.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.680
Is that you?

37:25.680 --> 37:28.680
That's a quote.

37:28.680 --> 37:29.680
From you.

37:29.680 --> 37:32.680
I don't know how to have thoughts.

37:32.680 --> 37:33.680
I'm going to get with Jasper.

37:33.680 --> 37:34.680
Jasper.

37:34.680 --> 37:35.680
Jasper.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.680
Correct.

37:37.680 --> 37:38.680
Okay.

37:38.680 --> 37:44.680
You don't worry about being liked.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.680
You have to be yourself.

37:46.680 --> 37:47.680
Since.

37:47.680 --> 37:48.680
Jasper.

37:48.680 --> 37:49.680
Vince.

37:49.680 --> 37:50.680
Vince.

37:50.680 --> 37:55.680
I'm just trying to find a way to make pictures.

37:55.680 --> 37:57.680
And Jasper.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.680
I think it's Vince.

37:59.680 --> 38:00.680
Yeah, same.

38:00.680 --> 38:01.680
Because motion pictures.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.680
He was Jasper.

38:03.680 --> 38:04.680
Buck.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.680
How old is Vince if he's there?

38:06.680 --> 38:08.680
I got to make a few more pictures.

38:08.680 --> 38:11.680
But I knew I would get at least one person on that.

38:12.680 --> 38:13.680
Oh, no.

38:13.680 --> 38:15.680
I'm just going to come to the picture house.

38:15.680 --> 38:17.680
Your movies are not good.

38:17.680 --> 38:19.680
Oh, that's what I'm saying.

38:19.680 --> 38:21.680
I think you'd really like swingers.

38:21.680 --> 38:23.680
Especially.

38:23.680 --> 38:24.680
Yeah.

38:24.680 --> 38:28.680
And it's a sort of about going out in Los Angeles before.

38:28.680 --> 38:30.680
You might have warned.

38:30.680 --> 38:32.680
Yeah.

38:32.680 --> 38:33.680
I don't.

38:33.680 --> 38:34.680
Oh, sorry.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.680
The Dresden is featured prominently in it.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.680
You know, the Dresden.

38:39.680 --> 38:40.680
Like in Germany.

38:40.680 --> 38:41.680
Yes.

38:41.680 --> 38:42.680
Like in Germany.

38:42.680 --> 38:43.680
Of course.

38:43.680 --> 38:44.680
The whole fucking movie takes place.

38:44.680 --> 38:45.680
He's not from here.

38:45.680 --> 38:46.680
Have you ever lived here?

38:46.680 --> 38:47.680
No.

38:47.680 --> 38:49.680
So why would you know the Dresden?

38:49.680 --> 38:51.680
I lived here for seven fucking years.

38:51.680 --> 38:52.680
I still barely know the Dresden.

38:52.680 --> 38:53.680
Okay.

38:53.680 --> 38:54.680
And that's fine.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.680
I just think you'd appreciate the film.

38:56.680 --> 38:57.680
The picture.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.680
Whatever I do.

38:59.680 --> 39:02.680
Whatever I do seems artificial and false to me.

39:02.680 --> 39:03.680
Okay.

39:03.680 --> 39:04.680
Jasper.

39:04.680 --> 39:05.680
All right.

39:05.680 --> 39:06.680
So now what's the quote?

39:06.680 --> 39:08.680
Yeah.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.680
Give me Jasper.

39:11.680 --> 39:12.680
How many more?

39:12.680 --> 39:15.680
There's like another page.

39:15.680 --> 39:19.680
I think too many people look at the arts with a religious outlook.

39:19.680 --> 39:20.680
Arts?

39:20.680 --> 39:21.680
Yes.

39:21.680 --> 39:22.680
Jasper.

39:22.680 --> 39:24.680
I got what's wrong.

39:24.680 --> 39:26.680
I got what's wrong.

39:26.680 --> 39:29.680
I'm going to guess Vince Vince Jasper.

39:29.680 --> 39:30.680
Vince.

39:30.680 --> 39:31.680
There's only two more.

39:31.680 --> 39:33.680
Lock it in for those last two.

39:33.680 --> 39:34.680
All right.

39:34.680 --> 39:36.680
Vince then Jasper.

39:37.680 --> 39:39.680
I tend to like things that already exist.

39:39.680 --> 39:40.680
Which is Jasper.

39:40.680 --> 39:41.680
Okay.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.680
And as an artist, I can't be responsible for how people interpret material.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.680
Which is Vince Vaughan.

39:46.680 --> 39:47.680
Mm-hmm.

39:47.680 --> 39:48.680
Great.

39:51.680 --> 39:53.680

40:04.680 --> 40:06.680
We did get some McDonald's.

40:20.680 --> 40:23.680
You did something else with fine.

40:23.680 --> 40:24.680
Yeah.

40:24.680 --> 40:27.680
I feel like you did a game where it was like,

40:27.680 --> 40:31.680
You're going on a blind date with Ralph Bind.

40:31.680 --> 40:32.680
Right.

40:32.680 --> 40:33.680

What are we here at the lake?

40:39.680 --> 40:40.680
And here what it is.

40:40.680 --> 40:43.680
Why don't we hear what it is before you scrutinize the theme song?

40:43.680 --> 40:44.680
I could hear it.

40:44.680 --> 40:45.680
We can't hear the theme song.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.680
It sounds like nothing to it.

40:47.680 --> 40:48.680
This is love is fine.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.680
You're playing a boombox underwater.

40:50.680 --> 40:52.680
I can't hear it at all.

40:52.680 --> 40:53.680
This is love is fines.

40:53.680 --> 40:54.680
Where I will...

40:54.680 --> 40:56.680
We're going to look into some ray fines rolls.

40:56.680 --> 40:59.680
And you're going to see if you would maybe want to date this person.

40:59.680 --> 41:00.680
Uh...

41:00.680 --> 41:01.680
I love this one.

41:01.680 --> 41:02.680
Yeah.

41:02.680 --> 41:03.680
Well, not really being able to see it.

41:03.680 --> 41:04.680
How is it a game, Riley?

41:04.680 --> 41:08.680
Because what do you mean how is it a game?

41:08.680 --> 41:09.680
It's not a game.

41:09.680 --> 41:10.680
What?

41:10.680 --> 41:11.680
I mean...

41:11.680 --> 41:12.680
What is a game show?

41:12.680 --> 41:14.680
It is no game.

41:14.680 --> 41:15.680
It's just a game.

41:15.680 --> 41:16.680
It's just a big man.

41:16.680 --> 41:17.680
It's just a big man.

41:17.680 --> 41:18.680
It's just a big man.

41:18.680 --> 41:19.680
It's just a big man.

41:19.680 --> 41:20.680
It's just a big man.

41:20.680 --> 41:22.680
What should we be moving forward please?

41:22.680 --> 41:23.680
It's a big game.

41:23.680 --> 41:24.680
It's just a huge game.

41:24.680 --> 41:25.680
It's just a huge game.

41:25.680 --> 41:27.680
But, you know...

41:27.680 --> 41:29.680
It's a huge game.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.680
Sounds like a balloon to play they

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
All right, here we go

41:36.440 --> 41:39.780

42:15.200 --> 42:17.200
Yes, no

42:17.200 --> 42:19.200
This is a game

42:22.200 --> 42:27.920
It's another one of those vaccine versus booster debates. I don't want to engage. Can I quickly interrupt? Yeah

42:28.560 --> 42:31.360
Just wondering are you gonna be bringing up the Holocaust

42:32.000 --> 42:37.240
Shinler's list he should have won an Oscar for that role, but Tommy Lee Jones got instead for the huge dip and still upset

42:38.480 --> 42:41.480
No, I'm saying he's a very talented actor

42:42.480 --> 42:46.840
Blanked out the characters, but won't let us guess them

42:48.240 --> 42:55.000
That would make it a game by the way. What make it? This is the game the game is what would you?

42:55.000 --> 43:04.520
Would you fuck mine? Yes, and he's wrong that role. Would you fuck through something for a second? Yes, and then I mean we play this with a different man

43:05.480 --> 43:07.480
Meaning it not Jeff

43:09.240 --> 43:11.240
Not Jeff not finds

43:12.840 --> 43:15.240

Yeah, well really

43:36.240 --> 43:38.240
Great, but here we go

43:39.040 --> 43:45.120
A military veteran who spent three months as a hostage in the hands of the IRA

43:46.080 --> 43:48.080
All right

43:48.320 --> 43:55.280
So this is this is the English patience. Yeah, this government agent keeps his cards and his secrets close to his chest

43:57.280 --> 43:59.280
Same thing. I wrote you so late at night

44:00.000 --> 44:06.160
If you're looking for a closed off workaholic whose trauma induced erectile dysfunction keeps you itching to crack his shell

44:06.160 --> 44:09.360
Look no further than the head you don't have a mine shirt

44:11.360 --> 44:15.120
Yeah, this isn't how love his blind works either. Yeah, but I can't be

44:15.120 --> 44:21.680
Finds and you don't I mean like to leave it in three minutes. Yeah, right? So would you fuck him? No, really. Yeah, all right

44:22.320 --> 44:28.160
Everybody else come on. I mean, I'm gonna fuck Ray finds like no matter the role. I think except so she's

44:28.160 --> 44:30.160
Separation. Yeah, oh

Let's go. Yes on this one

44:34.960 --> 44:39.040
I would do fair. She but no more. Okay, at his desk

44:40.640 --> 44:42.640
I think we would 69 on the floor

44:43.280 --> 44:46.080
That frank but again, this is not a game

44:47.200 --> 44:49.200
And this is not a game to me

44:50.560 --> 44:56.320
It's too low. Yeah, you take you really seriously, Marika on your casey. I said sure. Yeah sure

44:56.880 --> 45:00.480
If all of you's gonna be sure then I want to have it. Yeah, I haven't seen this movie so

45:01.840 --> 45:05.760
This is what he looks like you guys feel any different no, it's Voldemort

45:06.720 --> 45:16.880
That's so random. I'm gonna change my answer to no now. Yeah, bad suit. I would say fits him well, but bad suit. Here we go

45:17.920 --> 45:19.920
This orphan that's like

45:20.800 --> 45:25.600
This orphan let the his lack of parents get the best of him and if all over time into it

45:25.680 --> 45:27.680
Yeah

45:30.320 --> 45:37.040
It's all over time into an immortal Demi demon leaving behind a promising young career in wizard politics

45:37.040 --> 45:42.640
He turns to the dark arts arts and a master cult following of other low-forgotten souls

45:43.120 --> 45:48.960
Who do his bidding evil incarnate this lord does not possess the capacity for love or empathy

45:48.960 --> 45:54.320
But rumor has it he's mother fucking honed this is Voldemort

45:55.680 --> 45:57.120
It's

45:59.120 --> 46:02.320
Has he's the one I've rolled a word

46:03.360 --> 46:05.360
This is

46:05.680 --> 46:13.440
It's is Voldemort. No, obviously not okay. Yeah, does he even have a penis in this regenerated state? I do think when I was naked in the

46:14.400 --> 46:18.720
Or you yes, yes, yes, he doesn't have a nose. He doesn't have a cask

46:20.320 --> 46:23.520
I was just saying that he has a child in

46:24.160 --> 46:30.160
The cursed child, so I assume right and everything else the series is good point that kind of reality

46:30.320 --> 46:31.520
Yeah, yeah

46:31.520 --> 46:36.480
Good point so are we fucking Voldemort come on yeah, nobody's like chiming in everybody's gonna tap it in like

46:36.480 --> 46:40.400
How old is it? Yes, cool. Yeah, I don't know maybe

46:42.400 --> 46:44.400
Yes, y'all

46:44.400 --> 46:47.040
No, I don't think Voldemort's a generous lover

46:47.040 --> 46:49.040
No, I'm what can you say?

46:49.040 --> 46:52.400
Unless he isn't unique in which case maybe that's all he can do

46:53.600 --> 46:55.600
He does mutual masturbation

46:59.440 --> 47:04.000
No more no bless this is not a game. I would still listen a J.O.I video from Tom

47:04.960 --> 47:08.880
But he does have like crazy snake tongue, so um, not yet

47:10.080 --> 47:12.720
Just does Tom Riddle count?

47:13.440 --> 47:18.720
No, this is Voldemort because Tom Riddle is not played by Ray Finns you fucking asshole

47:19.600 --> 47:24.000
Oh, whoa anything changed now that you guys see him we all know of Voldemort

47:24.000 --> 47:25.680

47:34.480 --> 47:37.920
Okay, just preemptively based on no information would you fuck this person?

47:38.640 --> 47:41.280

47:42.480 --> 47:44.480

48:12.000 --> 48:14.960
Goodbye everyone. I'm so glad we got to share Jeffs

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
I'm saying how it's doing

48:20.560 --> 48:22.560
Hi Riley

48:23.040 --> 48:30.720
It's doing pretty well, but ultimately your tweet from right before so many people ain't it is doing better

48:30.720 --> 48:33.600
Yeah, but that was over the span of a week. This has been

48:34.160 --> 48:39.040
20 minutes. Yeah, but you'd still you'd really want to see it blow by so many people ain't it?

48:39.120 --> 48:41.280
Yeah, yeah, well, I would appreciate the retreat from you

48:42.400 --> 48:46.640
All right, this is elf this Alfred is penny worth your time

48:47.040 --> 48:52.320
When he lacks an overall charisma he makes up for in borderline feudal levels of loyalty

48:52.720 --> 48:57.440
If you like early 20th century have her dashic fashion, you found the perfect date

48:57.680 --> 49:00.640
Imagine doing the talk about a Lego

49:03.040 --> 49:05.040
Have her dashi

49:06.000 --> 49:09.360
That is one of the insatman's butler

49:10.240 --> 49:12.240
The Lego Batman movie

49:12.240 --> 49:14.480
This is one of the angriest times you've ever been at me

49:15.840 --> 49:21.200
Imagine doing the Omakase at sushi note alongside a man with a pocket watch shining out from his

49:21.200 --> 49:24.400
Shal collar lapel of long coat trust the chef

49:24.400 --> 49:28.080
Nah trust the owl this guy's a straight-up Lego

49:28.640 --> 49:30.640
Would you fucking?

49:30.640 --> 49:34.960
No, I I would not have sex with a Lego. Okay. Yeah, same on your

49:35.040 --> 49:39.840
My quest. Yeah, not yeah, check dryhumping no more

49:41.280 --> 49:45.360
And then knowing what he is a change of mind maybe he's hotter than you thought I saw her than I thought

49:47.280 --> 49:54.000
All right, I maybe do heavy petting over the pants hand job style now that I've seen what he looks like as a Lego

49:54.000 --> 49:56.320
Would you watch them tuck like other Legos?

49:57.200 --> 50:00.000
I would be a warrior with them. I'd be a peeping Tom little

50:00.800 --> 50:05.200
The um are we Lego people in this in this scenario? No, you're you

50:07.040 --> 50:09.040
All right play mobile

50:09.680 --> 50:12.320
This was love is fun

50:17.120 --> 50:23.440
So yeah, we got the picture of you and your butt and then right to the left of it is YouTube's richest creator

50:23.520 --> 50:26.320
Seeking $1.5 billion valuation

50:27.040 --> 50:31.360
So this sort of is the entire gamut of influencers right here, right?

50:31.920 --> 50:36.240
You sort of bear your ass for all the scene where a 150 likes

50:36.720 --> 50:43.280
Meanwhile Mr. Beast is trying to sell 10% of his net worth yeah for 150 million dollars

50:45.200 --> 50:48.240
Do you look up there? I'm looking at the quote tweets

50:48.320 --> 50:54.480
Yeah, yeah, you're looking up there quote tweets

50:55.600 --> 51:01.920
The boy who borrass on Maine that's kind of funny. Yeah, oh no, I just realized what pivotal work he's reading

51:11.600 --> 51:16.080
I think your next tweet should be at 20k followers. I will blank

51:16.800 --> 51:18.800
And then it's something even more

51:19.760 --> 51:21.760
And for my next trick

51:24.160 --> 51:26.160
Yeah, like people are

51:26.160 --> 51:28.160
eager to find out what now

51:29.120 --> 51:35.120
You should here's my pitch just tweet and for my next trick and an only fan's link

51:36.000 --> 51:39.600
And see how many people would sign up. That's really interesting

51:39.600 --> 51:43.920
I like that like you could in theory make thousands of dollars a month. It's no mr. Beast, but

51:44.560 --> 51:48.560
I was starting only fans just for a monthly really good photo of my ass

51:49.120 --> 51:54.000
Right exactly this could be a free free free free free Yeah, yeah free rating yeah, you can make it do do a

51:54.080 --> 51:58.080
Do a subscribe for free for now. You have two photos that's two months

51:58.720 --> 52:01.440
But why would they pay for the cow and they can get the milk for free

52:03.440 --> 52:08.480
I want a variety yeah, right you could make us absolutely money potentially

52:09.520 --> 52:13.840
I made that the money cuz I sold like a tar and yesterday I could tar center took an hour and a half

52:13.920 --> 52:17.760
and I just was like, I need to make back the money that I spent on this fucking photographer.

52:17.760 --> 52:22.720
Shoutout, by the way, Emily Montfort photography. They're an incredible photographer.

52:22.720 --> 52:30.240
They have photographed like a lot of famous people. And I told them I'd plug their stuff.

52:30.240 --> 52:36.240
On Instagram, it's at Emily.Montfort photo. And like,

52:36.240 --> 52:40.240
potentially, oh, now Abby Jacobson, bunch of other cool people.

52:40.240 --> 52:44.160
Emily, they didn't, they didn't post the photo they took of you.

52:44.160 --> 52:49.680
Surprise. It was under embargo. Did Emily see your dick?

52:50.320 --> 52:55.440
No, we came up with a sort of intimacy coordination in that specific regard where I would say

52:55.440 --> 52:59.520
balls. And then they'd turn around. And then I would say clear. And then they'd turn around.

52:59.520 --> 53:06.080
And it was always me facing away from them. That's like a perverted, uh, bear,

53:06.160 --> 53:10.960
chef thing. Yes. Well, yes. I got it. Yeah.

53:10.960 --> 53:16.080
Thank you, Marika. Her chef. Her chef. Yes, chef. They did come up to me at one point and say,

53:16.080 --> 53:21.200
you should be dead. Oh, really? Oh, no. That's a better opportunity.

53:22.320 --> 53:27.280
Did you take any non nude photos? Like, I mean, just nice. Like, headshots. No, because I only had

53:27.280 --> 53:31.360
the peer space place for an hour. So we really had to get in and get out. But yeah,

53:31.360 --> 53:34.560
there are an incredible photographer. If you live in Los Angeles and need somebody

53:35.360 --> 53:41.840
for editorial work for creative projects, uh, check them out. And, um, yeah, we'll see how

53:41.840 --> 53:48.240
this goes. And maybe we'll check in next week on what happened in the wake, um, the ripple effect of my

53:48.320 --> 53:50.160
rippling.

53:51.440 --> 53:53.280
Aftowned.

54:02.320 --> 54:06.560
Any other thoughts or questions about it? I put so much effort into it. And this has been a

54:06.560 --> 54:10.320
long time coming. I feel like we haven't given it the reverence and weight that it deserves.

54:10.880 --> 54:11.920
Let's go plugs.

54:12.320 --> 54:20.160
But plugs. That's really good. We're otherwise. Uh, yeah, what do you guys have going on?

54:20.160 --> 54:23.040
What do you want to point the people to and then any other questions you have got the picture? Yeah.

54:24.880 --> 54:28.160
Uh, follow Jeff on only fans. Yeah. Hopefully sets one up.

54:28.160 --> 54:32.000
Soon it, you got to capitalize strike while the errands hot. Um,

54:32.880 --> 54:38.880
at least a link to a link tree that can potentially one day have the only fans. Yeah, just to make

54:38.960 --> 54:43.200
sure that people are being driven towards an action item. Sure.

54:44.880 --> 54:49.760
I like low energy chapters your name. Yeah. I love the cream.

54:49.760 --> 54:53.840
Chunky knit that you have on. Great sweater. Great sweater. No, I look great in that photo.

54:55.840 --> 55:02.320
Oh, so yeah, like that's what Kayla said. Yeah. What, what is this?

55:02.320 --> 55:08.080
Um, listen to the pit wall. Listen to me and Maria and Casey's podcast, the pit wall. It's

55:08.080 --> 55:16.960
a formula one podcast. Uh, it's great. Check it out. At 10,000 subs, Jake will show his ass.

55:18.800 --> 55:26.960
No, make case. Actually, well, I have the other photo of Jeff's ass that he was not willing to post.

55:26.960 --> 55:32.960
So if we get 10,000 listeners on the F1 podcast, I will tweet that.

55:32.960 --> 55:36.640
And which is revenge porn. And you're going to fucking jail. Yeah.

55:38.640 --> 55:45.120
Maria, could we make this one of our at a home posters? What's that? We could. Yeah. So we'll do

55:45.120 --> 55:50.800
this. We'll put that on the now playing thing outside with a QR code. No, thank you.

55:53.200 --> 55:59.040
That could be good. It makes that like a, a broken, a broken page. Oh, like a four of four. That's

55:59.040 --> 56:04.000
funny. Yeah. That's where we can't find the page you're looking for. Yeah. But here's my

56:04.000 --> 56:12.560
mouth. Stop saying about. Why are you calling them all men joys? Nice. Because there's no

56:12.560 --> 56:23.520

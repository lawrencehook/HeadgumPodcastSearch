00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
Thank you to Bird Dogs for sponsoring this episode of our show.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Sorry, I'm a little down in the dumps because I was

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
ousted as host from the head gum podcast, but I can't

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
speak highly enough of Bird Dogs.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Bird Dogs have completely changed the game.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Bird Dogs sent me some shorts along with a free

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
eddy tumbler, and I've been using both increasingly as the

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
weather starts to get hotter and Los Angeles.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
They make an unbelievable product.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Bird Dogs, shorts, pants and joggers are made from the

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
finest high-quality material and come with

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
built-in liners that cradle your stovepipe for all day

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
come for it.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
And oh boy, do they?

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
I've never felt so much support from a short.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
And who the fuck likes being uncomfortable, right?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
If you're not wearing bird dogs this summer, you probably

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
poop with your pants on, which is honestly disgusting.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
So don't don't shit yourself.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Get bird dogs.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
It's time to upgrade to the shorts and pants of the future.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Your balls will thank you.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I promise my balls have been thanking me.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Every time it's been over 80 degrees and I've worn bird dogs

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
so many memories.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Hosting the show.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
They found Yeti's $90 Tumblr.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
It's an amazing product.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
It keeps things cold and warm, et cetera.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
They copied it.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
You will not take these off.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I promise you.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
All right.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
They're unbelievable.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Just do yourself a favor.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Get some bird dogs.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Thanks bird dogs.

02:03.000 --> 02:21.000
Thanks bird dogs.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Right.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Hundred episodes in the bag, man.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
This is unbelievable that we've made it this far.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
I mean, if the celebration calls for it.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Noon on a Friday.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Hundred episodes in the bag.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Hundred episodes in a half.

02:43.000 --> 03:11.000
Two hundred more.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
You had to clean that up.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
What's that?

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
That will be a water stain in like 30 seconds.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Really?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Cut table is covered in liquid.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
This is crazy.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
And it wreaks like booze.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
I'm not going to apologize for being celebratory.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Not asking you to apologize.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
I'm just saying the fact.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
It will be awesome.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
Can I also say that I couldn't see anything that Jeff is doing on the table.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I could only see really his torso.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
And I honestly, I honestly assumed that he got like champagne flutes and stuff.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
And then when he pulled back and revealed the old head gum logo.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Mason jar.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
I was really upset.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
I was, I was not happy about it.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
He went.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
That was easy.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Not amongst yourselves.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
That's not true.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Four.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Spills booze.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
This is good.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Now he can't hear us slander him.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Right.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
I wish I could see anyone else besides a mirror.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Weird sunglasses.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Plad, Modress, sure.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Look.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
But.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yes.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
That's.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
You can see us through just laptop, which is just facing me and Jeff.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Yeah.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
It's mostly a cactus right now.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
A little bit of mirror.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Well, this is a support my brother in some glasses.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
I'm wearing shades too, Marika.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Just so you know.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
That's good to know.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Yeah.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
It's difficult.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Jesus.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Can you imagine.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
It's not only imagine what camera too.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
It's on.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Now it's filling on the carpet.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
It's such a non-absorbent paper towel.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
He was just sort of.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Shuffling.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Like I get like tolerating him in the conversational realm.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
But when he starts just treashing your furniture.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Also, can you see the discrepancy and like amount of champagne.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Pored.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Yeah.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
One of the.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
One of the mason jars is filled to the brim.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
The other two are like at 20 and 30 percent.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Here's one.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
So here's mine, which is like, I wouldn't even drink this much out of juice.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Let alone champagne at 12 to 11 p.m.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Yeah.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Obviously.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
And then this is Billy's.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Oddly a different shade of yellow.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
I don't know how that works out.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Just Jeff is on one knee.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
He's on bending knee.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Pushing.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Now let's go.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
I'll put off the table.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Push it into his hot little.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Maybe he should just drink it off of the table.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Oh, that's cool.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
He slurps it up.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
That's probably faster to be honest.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Yeah, slurp up the liquid from a table.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
He was kind of like rushing us along to get this podcast started because he has four

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
segments.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
He really wants to get through the first five minutes of this podcast has been him cleaning

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
up his mess.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
And we'll say, though, we're close to enjoying being a hundred minutes long.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
So keep that in mind.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Yeah.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
I don't have time for that.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
But like that sounds like a good.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Let me help you out of here.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Otherwise, it would have been a good.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Don't restart the music.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Like, I mean, yeah, I have a little cry.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Not as exciting.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
You also could have like posted me a ball of champagne or something.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I had the champagne idea as I walked into work.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Yeah.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
I'm not surprised.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
I was also wasn't going to draw.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Also, you guys could have fucking dressed up.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
I am.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
What's that?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
I am a little bit dressed up.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Sunglasses?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
No, the button of shirt.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Sunglasses.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
I don't need it.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Oh, we don't with the sunglasses.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Yeah, I think so.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Okay.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
They might come back.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
I just I put a lot of sweat equity into this show.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
And I think that the by virtue of how I'm dressed.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
It shows.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
And you guys are looking a little shallubby, especially Marika.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
We started recording it new and you text me at 1143.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Said Jake can't make it.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Can you be his backup in here, I am.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
All right.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
I'll give Billy a pass.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
But you know what?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
What's your excuse?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Yes.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I'm dressed a little nice.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Like I usually wear shorts in a tea.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Yeah.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
This is like a button up.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
And you could have worn a tocks for me.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
That was the last time you wore a suit for the show.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Jeff, you were sitting in a closet.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
So let's not go there, you know.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
It's it's a great to be back here.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
It's good to have you back.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
I'm not hungry.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
So it's my congratulations.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
No, and thank you.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
And it is like I don't want to treat it with too much gravity.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Gravity because you know, at the end of the day, it's just a show.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
But um.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
This is one of the most special days of my life.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Why?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
They said we couldn't do it.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Who?

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
They said I had a medically fascinating body.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Who?

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
My doctor, my GP.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
All right.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Did he also say the thing about the podcast or those are two different people?

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Those are like the first one is basically everybody.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
The second one is specifically my GP.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
He said I have a fat ass and toothpick ankles.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
We know.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
Yes, but this is from a fucking envy.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Fascinated.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
We're not broken up with by my therapist.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
What does that mean?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
She said I wasn't making progress.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
That's like a son.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
There shouldn't be a reason for her to don't be.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah, isn't that like it's good for her business.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
You want to see someone who's not making progress.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Damn, Daniel.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
This day is too much weight on it emotionally for me because.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Therapistless.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Doctorless.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Wait, the doctor who said you have a fat ass and toothpick legs.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
I was used to go back to to somebody who like has his degree on the wall.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
You went to tough.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Nice.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
So you dropped them.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Yeah, that one I did fire my.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
So you have to take some accountability for that one.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Well, I'm just saying now I've defined somebody else.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
I don't have the ability for sure in my actions, but emotionally I'm wrecked.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
So if this show doesn't bring me back from the dead emotionally speaking,

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
then it was all for not noted.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Not just this record.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
The entire fucking thing.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
This escapad.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
This this fucking oral poison.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Joy's in the sometimes, but usually poison.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I mean, what was it all for?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Unless I'm happy.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Are you happy?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
What's that?

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Are you.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Currently, it could go either way.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
All right, it's a teeter totter where both people are the exact same amount of weight.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Are you a Libra?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
No, I'm a such guy.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Are you a Libra?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Are you a Libra?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Are you a Libra?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
What's that?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Yes, I'm a Libra.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
So you kind of get this balancing act.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Like, I'm getting no empathy from Maria.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I'm getting sympathy maybe from you.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
But it's bordering on pity.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Oh my god.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Oh my god.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Oh my god.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
A hundred episodes.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Yeah.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
All right.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
The third time.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Yeah.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Here's what we're going to start it off with.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Just something normal before we get into the festivities.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Bond of the week.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
This week my pick is.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Well.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Me.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
And then out to the Beyoncé song.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Of course.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
You must not know Jeffrey.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
You must not know about me.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
I can wear a tocks like nobody's business.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
I also know how to handle a gun.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Maybe you must not know about me.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
You must not know about me.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I've had a ton of inner course with women.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
So don't you ever for a second.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Tell me.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Look at me while you're singing.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
I couldn't beat James Bond.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
That's not.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Can I ask.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Real question.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Yeah.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
I was going to ask what's.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
A tocks is a different lapel, right?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Plus.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
It's lined with silk.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Or usually the pants have like a.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Interesting stripe or like a.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Whatever that.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Tuxedo felt.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Yeah.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
I bet you don't comment on your co-workers outfits.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
You literally open the podcast by saying that you could dress up.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
This is a disaster, Casey.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
What's that?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Yeah.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Yeah.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
The train wreck.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
It didn't even start on the rails.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
So you didn't go with you must not know Jeffrey.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Oh, that's really good.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Gills.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
That would have been better.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Also all you're saying was you must not know about me.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
You must not know about me.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
But you had it written down.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
You were reading it off a prompt.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Yeah.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
You couldn't memorize the words.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Even though the words this time was the actual words for the song.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Well, I forgot that I knew how to handle a gun.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
A gun.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Right.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Silence.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Yeah.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Like James.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Jeffrey James Bond.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
That's pretty good.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I'm sure that's been brought up before.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Really?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Probably.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
That's a good ending to not only the bond,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
but the you must not know about.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
And then your James Bond of the week.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Yeah.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Runner.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
That's been happening.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
It's a hundredth episode.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
It feels like a time to reflect.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And that's the perfect segue because we've made it.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
And so it seems like all of the bonds that people have suggested over the course of the

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
hundred episodes.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
It'd be nice to maybe go through the list of them.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Do you have that prepared?

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Do I have the list of everybody's bonds?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
I also.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I also just wanted to share my bond of the week.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Cause I had what I thought was a good idea.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
But you really just tried to move on.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Let's hear your bond of the week.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
I think the new bond should be Nick Wiger.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Hmm.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Wiger.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Doboy.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
I think you do a great job.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I think it'd be fun to see him.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Coverting around.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
The world.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Doing spiced stuff.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
He has the self confidence for sure.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Yeah.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Yeah.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
I think you can pull it off.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
What he might lack in Sartorial.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Uh, effort and aesthetic.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
He makes up for by being able to suck his own dick.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
Which I've always felt like double a seven would have at least tried.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
He always said that.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
I'm always saying that.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
I kind of just like only he can say that about himself by the way.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Like you're just spreading that out.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
He said it once on a podcast and now people know it.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
But I don't know if you have the green light to just say it.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Yeah.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Spreading that out is interesting because I was also going to lob up.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
What if he was the first James Bond to get pegged?

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Also Jake is here.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
What the fuck?

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
This is not prepared.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Yeah.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
We didn't go.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
It was prepared.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
It was prepared.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
It was very hard to set up.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Yeah.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
The idea that he can just join in and then we can record it.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
That's a huge question mark.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
No, I don't think it's fine.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Yeah.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Anything will be fine.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Wait.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
So are you fully recording?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Yeah.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Me?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Yeah.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
You said you said you couldn't make it.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
It was crazy.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
And then he said before we started, I might make it for the second half.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
And we are in the second half.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I didn't think he was supposed to start recording it.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
It's pretty up.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Right?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Should I read it?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
No.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
It's the first time.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
You have to read it.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
I'll read it.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
He spilled a lot of champagne earlier.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
He spent the first 10 minutes of the show.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Yeah.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
The first five minutes of the podcast.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
It was Jeff Licking up champagne from the table.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Yeah.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
I was going to ask what did I miss.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
This all sounds.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Yeah.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Part of this course.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Oh.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Great.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
I didn't get to do my bond of the week.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
It's your bond of the week.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
This is what?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
I'm here.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
It's nice.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
That's your bond of the week.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
I just watched Dunkirk again recently.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
And the little blonde boy from the boat in Dunkirk.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Okay.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Is it Tom Glenn Carney?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Maybe.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Or maybe also the kid that eats shit on the boat.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
He could also work.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
But he's a little he's more of a bond villain.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Yeah.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
And one of them taking a lot here.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
This is your show.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Jeff.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
This is your day.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
I'm just here to say.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
You know what it's all about.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Because this show has served.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
It's purpose in bringing joy to everyone.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Yeah.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I'm glad that I got to be here for the final episode.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
This is awesome.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Oh.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
We have cool run.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
We haven't done.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
We haven't talked to.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
You told me before you told Jeff.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Well, I wanted to sort of let everyone know.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Because we were going to do it right after this episode.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
And we're going to.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Let's have your right after the episode.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
I don't want to say anything.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
But let's make this episode a good one.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Here here.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
I agree.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
This will take this one a good one.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
That's wow.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
That is the guy.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Yes.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Great.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
That's correct.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
I love him.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
I love him.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
He's great.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
He's great in the fair.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
He was great in the fair.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Amen.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
A play that I told the mirror to see.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
And then he didn't.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Did you take this show away from me?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
No.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Take me away from you.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
Jeff has so many segments.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
And we have a sniffed one.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Yeah.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
We're talking about Dunkirk.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Little blonde boys that hit.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Jeff is sitting here silently.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
The line.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
Don't you impressed at how fast I got that three word name from Little

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Blonde boy on the phone.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Yeah.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
I'm just saying.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I just want blonde boy and all of it done.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
I am simply one guy.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
It could be.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
It's an actor.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
But it was really good.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
It's fresh.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
I am.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Because I saw it yesterday.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Sorry, Jeff.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
I'm talking about Dunkirk.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
You killed the show you killed me.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Yes.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Kill the show.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
You killed me.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
That was.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
That is the intention.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
If you kill me.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
I survived without the show.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
He's hurting me.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Billy.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Billy, that was something.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Got hit.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Give it a bottle.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
That's funny.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
No, let's.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Let's continue.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I guess with whatever you guys were saying.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
And then we'll wrap it up.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
No, we're done.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
All right.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Great.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Kirk.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Nice.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
We do actually have a lot to get to.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
This is perfect though.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Do we even have time to talk about formula one?

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
Let's save it for the end because also not really likes formula one.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
But I save it for the end.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Yeah, that could be our plugs kind of.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Yeah.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Okay.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
We'll do that.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
Which means that we have to talk about the past 100 episodes.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
A retrospective of sorts.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
What is your guys' favorite episode you've ever been on of the show?

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
And if you don't have one prepared, the longer the silence goes on, the more hurt.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
The head gaskers.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
The head gaskers were good.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Yeah.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
They was missed in the midst of the pandemic.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
And everyone was really sad.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
You asked me to hop on your podcast, your video podcast.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
And I opened up my screen.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
And Jeff was wearing a robe.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
And he looked like the bad guy.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Or good guy.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
I've never seen the movie from Despicable Me.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
So very like Pac-Man.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
And he was sweating in a closet.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
And I was like for the first time in months.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
I'm happy.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
So what is worse than me?

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Yeah.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Yeah.

18:14.000 --> 18:22.000
I think my favorite episode is the one where a mirror saying the Amma's be a song.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
Did you see the Amma's be wordled that I sent sort of popped it into H cube?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Yeah, I saw it.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Well, no one was supposed to spell it wrong.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
You spelled it incorrectly.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Yeah.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Yeah.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Amma's be with an E.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
At the end because the E was sort of baked.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Yeah.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
What was that song?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Can you remember how it went?

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
Um, it was the wire uniting.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Why are you not eating rice?

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
But I don't remember how it started.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
I'm sure you have it prepared, right?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
So you could click that.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
It's in that great compilation that someone started making.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Yeah.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Um.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Of all the songs.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
You don't actually have to search for it.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
It'll take a little bit, right?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Because we have a bunch to.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
You said you had to.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
You killed a cell.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
You killed me, right?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Okay.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
So my name's say my name.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
When no one is an arms be say it.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Baby I'll eat rice.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Why are you not eating rice?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
I'm on Instagram.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
I'm on Instagram.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
That was so funny.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
I'm on it.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
Baby why are you not eating rice?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
You have two voice friends.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Okay.

19:36.000 --> 20:03.320
I think they're both Beyonce songs, right?

20:03.320 --> 20:04.320
Mm-hmm.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.320
One, Destiny's Triad.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.320
I don't think it's Triad.

20:07.320 --> 20:08.320
Jake?

20:08.320 --> 20:10.920
Come here.

20:10.920 --> 20:17.000
There was one episode that I recorded with Jake in his office right where Jake is sitting.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.840
It was me, Jake.

20:18.840 --> 20:22.880
Your friend who's never been on the show before or since.

20:22.880 --> 20:23.880
And you.

20:23.880 --> 20:24.880
Do you remember that?

20:24.880 --> 20:25.880
Lisa, that was a good one.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.320
Why was that a good one to you?

20:27.320 --> 20:33.000
That was just a memorable podcast episode to me, because it seemed to have just come and gone

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
lost forever.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.960
Nobody thinks about that episode, nobody references that episode.

20:37.960 --> 20:43.920
But it was special to me, because Jake and I were recording together in New York.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.120
And that is the only time that happened.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.200
And it's exactly where Jake is sitting right now.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.200
That's kind of a key.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.200
That's kind of a key.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.200
That's a key.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.200
That's meaningful.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.200
Yeah.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.200
Who was that friend of yours?

20:55.200 --> 20:56.200
What was his name again?

20:56.200 --> 20:57.200
Do you remember that?

20:57.200 --> 20:58.200
You don't remember.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.200
I don't remember.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.200
Yeah.

21:00.200 --> 21:04.680
I'm a writer on like Nickelodeon or something.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.680
Jeff was clearly networking.

21:06.680 --> 21:07.680
That was the podcast.

21:07.680 --> 21:08.680
Yeah.

21:08.680 --> 21:09.680
Marcos.

21:09.680 --> 21:10.680
Yeah.

21:10.680 --> 21:11.680
Shout out Marcos.

21:11.680 --> 21:12.680
Yeah.

21:12.680 --> 21:13.680
That was awesome.

21:13.680 --> 21:17.080
Also like the one where you made us read scripts with Zach Dunruth.

21:17.080 --> 21:18.080
That was Zach Dunruth.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.080
Yeah.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.080
And we were giving notes on it.

21:20.080 --> 21:21.080
That was laugh.

21:21.080 --> 21:26.960
Sometimes when I don't know if I was on the episode, or if I just listen, like I don't

21:26.960 --> 21:29.680
know if I was on this script, Zach Dunruth.

21:29.680 --> 21:30.680
I think I wouldn't.

21:30.680 --> 21:31.680
But it was John.

21:31.680 --> 21:33.200
I mean, I'm your in Zach.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.200
Yeah.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.200
That's what I think you are.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.200
I just listened to it.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.760
But everyone in sense of humor is like so in line with mine that it feels like I was there

21:39.760 --> 21:41.560
and it happened.

21:41.560 --> 21:45.840
Mine is, my, oh, OK, I was going to say my favorite.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.080
I was going to talk about one of my favorite memories.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.080
But that's fine.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.080
Yeah.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.080
We're going to cut this part.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.080
No, it's fine.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.080
No.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.080
That wasn't an interstitial.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.520
That was truly just like, let's keep it up.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.680
Let's keep the energy up of 100 episodes.

21:58.000 --> 21:58.680
That was bad.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.880
It was a bad choice.

22:00.880 --> 22:03.560
It wasn't even an interstitial.

22:03.560 --> 22:09.680
You just kind of played it to your own segment energy with it was it was like the

22:09.680 --> 22:13.680
equivalent of a yon, just where you just like drop a big sound in the middle of someone

22:13.680 --> 22:14.680
else's.

22:14.680 --> 22:15.680
There it is.

22:15.680 --> 22:16.680
Yeah.

22:16.680 --> 22:21.120
It was the, I like the, the power hour, the power hour.

22:21.120 --> 22:23.000
That was a lot of fun to record.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.120
Was that also, I don't think in a person episode of like, you know, aside from the one

22:27.120 --> 22:30.120
that made a mirror had like the first in, oh, no, it's like the first in person video

22:30.120 --> 22:31.120
episode, right?

22:31.120 --> 22:32.120
Yeah.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.120
I think so.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.120
I think so.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.120
Um, amazing.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.120
My favorite is the audit.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.120
The out entire series.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.120
Hmm.

22:41.120 --> 22:48.120
And I glad we made up.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.120
That's awesome, dude.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.120
Wow.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.120
What?

22:52.120 --> 22:53.120
It's a fucking breath.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.120
That was a lot of fun.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.120
We have one thing to break.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.120
We have to take a fucking breath.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.120
Thanks and fast.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.120
See, you guys so much worse.

23:00.120 --> 23:01.120
Just than that.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.120
Who talk.

23:03.120 --> 23:06.120
This podcast is sponsored by better.

23:06.120 --> 23:08.120
Up online therapy.

23:08.120 --> 23:11.840
People don't always realize that physical symptoms like headaches, teeth grinding, and even

23:11.840 --> 23:17.120
digestive issues can be indicators of stress and let's not forget about doom scrolling, sleeping

23:17.120 --> 23:21.120
too little, sleeping too much, under eating, overeating, et cetera, et cetera.

23:21.120 --> 23:28.120
I'm feeling pretty stressful since we recorded our 100th episode, our last episode really, so

23:28.120 --> 23:36.620
yeah, it's been, it's been hard, stress shows up in all kinds of ways and in a world

23:36.620 --> 23:40.620
that's telling you to do more, sleep less and grind all the time, here's your reminder

23:40.620 --> 23:45.620
to take care of yourself, do less and maybe try some therapy, therapies have been great

23:45.620 --> 23:48.620
for me, I highly recommend it to everybody, especially if you're going through something

23:48.620 --> 23:55.320
like I am right now, I'm really looking forward to my session on Thursday, better help

23:55.320 --> 23:59.420
is customized online therapy that offers video phone or even live chat sessions with your

23:59.420 --> 24:03.220
therapist, so you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want to, it's much

24:03.220 --> 24:06.900
more affordable than in person therapy, so give it a try and see if online therapy can

24:06.900 --> 24:08.820
help lower your stress.

24:08.820 --> 24:16.600

24:47.000 --> 24:51.840
you know, cleanse that pallet and then I'll have my AG1 to just, you know, start the day

24:51.840 --> 24:55.680

25:19.800 --> 25:22.160
no artificial anything.

25:22.160 --> 25:23.160
It's lifestyle, friendly.

clarity and alertness.

25:43.400 --> 25:48.800
products based on the latest science with constant product generations and third-party testing.

25:48.800 --> 25:53.520
Maybe this show would have been more successful if I, I don't know if I'd listened to other

25:53.520 --> 25:59.760
people's advice and maybe done some third-party testing like Athletic Greens cost less than

25:59.760 --> 26:04.000
$3 a day and you're investing in your health and it's cheaper than your cold brew habit.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.640
It's also cheaper than getting all these different supplements yourself, which I use to

26:06.640 --> 26:10.920
do and now I get it all from Athletic Greens and you're basically investing in an all-in-one

26:10.920 --> 26:12.320

26:17.000 --> 26:18.480

26:20.880 --> 26:23.440

26:23.440 --> 26:24.440
health.

26:24.440 --> 26:27.600
And to make it easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one-year supply of immune

26:27.600 --> 26:31.720
supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase.

26:31.720 --> 26:36.600
All you have to do is visit Athletic Greens, that's all right, just, that's all right.

26:36.600 --> 26:40.200
It's hard to read these words, knowing the show is over.

26:40.200 --> 26:43.600
All you have to do is visit Athletic Greens.com slash what's that?

26:43.600 --> 26:48.040
Again, that's Athletic Greens.com slash what's that to take ownership over your health

26:48.040 --> 26:53.960
and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.720
And we're back, all right, episode 100.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.040
This is what I did, all right.

26:58.040 --> 27:05.440
I emailed all previous guests on the show, present company included and I was like, we made

27:05.440 --> 27:06.440
it.

27:06.440 --> 27:12.040
So it's thank you all for being a part of it and however big or small way you have been.

27:12.040 --> 27:15.640
And if you wanted, this was an idea I got from no joke, which you guys did for 200, which

27:15.640 --> 27:21.720
was just sending a congratulated Tory message or any message really being like wishing

27:21.720 --> 27:26.320
as well, good luck on the next 100 episodes.

27:26.320 --> 27:29.920
So I thought we could listen to some messages that are pre-recorded from past guests.

27:29.920 --> 27:30.920
What do you guys think?

27:30.920 --> 27:31.920
Sounds like a great idea.

27:31.920 --> 27:32.920
I made up.

27:32.920 --> 27:33.920
Yeah.

27:33.920 --> 27:34.920
Yeah.

27:34.920 --> 27:35.920
All right.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.520
Let's start with, uh, Avital Ash.

27:38.520 --> 27:39.520
Oh, nice.

27:39.520 --> 27:41.000
So you did it.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
My lover.

27:42.000 --> 27:48.960
Now you got 200 episodes and I can't think of anyone less deserving, um, congratulations.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.360
I guess, this is bad.

27:51.360 --> 27:56.800
So many more people deserve to have made it this far and you are not one of them.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.400
Why did you get to here?

27:58.400 --> 27:59.400
This is crazy.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.400
This isn't even good.

28:01.400 --> 28:02.400
I don't know.

28:03.400 --> 28:09.440
And you run it for some reason and people listen to it, I guess, which is insane.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.000
That's the craziest part of all.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.160
Um, I think 100 is a good time to stop.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.840
I think you should probably stop now.

28:15.840 --> 28:18.160
This is Avital, by the way.

28:18.160 --> 28:22.280
All right, um, happy, uh, 100th episode in retirement.

28:22.280 --> 28:23.640
Hopefully, fingers crossed.

28:23.640 --> 28:24.800
Not hopefully.

28:24.800 --> 28:25.800
I love you.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.280
Yeah.

28:27.280 --> 28:29.480
Can you fire Jeffrey?

28:29.640 --> 28:30.320
Yeah.

28:30.320 --> 28:36.080
We felt that before the, um, 100th, but I think it's, yeah, it happens soon.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.000
I think it's a good, it's a bad time.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.280
Oh, you're a good.

28:39.280 --> 28:43.720
That was really beautiful.

28:43.720 --> 28:44.560
That was touching.

28:44.560 --> 28:45.560
No, wasn't.

28:45.560 --> 28:46.720
I like the question.

28:46.720 --> 28:48.000
Why did you get to here?

28:48.000 --> 28:50.560
Sort of an existential.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.560
She proud of some good points.

28:52.560 --> 28:53.400
What good points?

28:53.400 --> 28:56.080
I feel like that was, that wasn't fair.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.120
I took issue with one thing that she said,

28:58.120 --> 28:59.800
because she said, and you run it.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.320
And I was like, no, he doesn't.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.280
I feel like that's what you take issue with.

29:03.280 --> 29:08.080
I feel like maybe, yeah, I think it's mostly my run 24 by what would I even do.

29:08.080 --> 29:13.640
Kind of like, yeah, how many voice messages do you have?

29:13.640 --> 29:18.360
I've 17 more, 17, but there's, there's no way they're all that angry.

29:18.360 --> 29:23.360
So I guess let's keep it going with our, in house video producer, KC Donna here.

29:23.680 --> 29:27.440
Hey Jeff, it's KC, the head gum video producer.

29:27.440 --> 29:32.160
I just want to leave you a little message for the 100th episode of the head gum podcast.

29:32.160 --> 29:35.440
You didn't tell me you wanted to shoot in the studio this week.

29:35.440 --> 29:39.440
You've actually never told me when you want to shoot in the studio.

29:39.440 --> 29:42.960
And it's been driving me crazy, you know, this isn't a playground.

29:42.960 --> 29:46.880
This isn't Jeff's fun house, this is a professional studio.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.880
You can't just come and go whenever you please.

29:49.880 --> 29:52.760
We've got a schedule, we've got shows, we've got a shoot.

29:52.760 --> 29:57.640
And your show is literally the lowest priority of them all.

29:57.640 --> 30:00.440
You have no respect for me, you have no respect for Ania.

30:00.440 --> 30:06.200
You know, Ania and I spent months wiring the studio for sight and sound.

30:06.200 --> 30:09.560
And I'm willing to bet 100 bucks that you're going to show up with your own zoom recorder,

30:09.560 --> 30:12.520
because I guess we didn't do a good enough job for you.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.360
You're going to stick it right in the middle of the set,

30:14.360 --> 30:16.600
and you're going to have the wires going all over the place.

30:16.600 --> 30:20.200
It's going to look like amateur hour as usual.

30:20.200 --> 30:26.120
And I'm going to be sick to my stomach when we upload another episode of the headgump podcast.

30:26.120 --> 30:30.280
Clearly, I can't trust you, so I'll be in the studio for the record.

30:30.280 --> 30:35.640
And that's honestly mostly just to make sure that you don't break any of the extremely

30:35.640 --> 30:37.640
expensive equipment that we have in there.

30:37.640 --> 30:41.240
You're an embarrassment to the company, you're the main of my existence.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.840
Jake and Amir only let you do the show because they feel bad for you.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.520
And I hope you quit.

30:46.520 --> 30:51.240
So, yeah, I just wanted to call, let you know that you have to tell me

30:51.240 --> 30:52.600
when you want to use the space.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.560
Okay? I'm absolutely sick of this bullshit.

30:56.280 --> 30:57.880
All right, man, that's it. Take care.

30:57.880 --> 30:59.080
I'm here. Take care.

31:00.280 --> 31:03.480
You said, that was nice. That was a nice way to sign off. Take care.

31:03.480 --> 31:05.080
I like that. It was pleasant.

31:05.080 --> 31:08.280
Yeah, but it doesn't undo any space in the 90 seconds before.

31:08.280 --> 31:10.600
But you want to start with a compliment, end of the compliment.

31:11.240 --> 31:13.480
Sam, you really, you really did it. You did it.

31:13.560 --> 31:16.200
Well, I wasn't like there was a great point.

31:16.200 --> 31:19.960
Especially every, I was a little bit sick to my stomach as well.

31:19.960 --> 31:24.760
When I had to upload, I had to come podcast where all of the chords were unplugged

31:24.760 --> 31:26.200
and the zoom was on the table.

31:28.040 --> 31:32.840
And I did, I did complain to them. So, that ranked true.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.960
Cool. Jeff has five guests.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.160
But we can go on to the next one.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.320
We're all going to be sitting in silence for the next half hour.

31:40.200 --> 31:43.080
He has a record number of guests.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.800
And this whole episode is about to be audio cues.

31:45.800 --> 31:48.120
Seven, four, 16 more.

31:48.120 --> 31:50.280
16 times one to two minutes.

31:50.280 --> 31:53.320
That's the next 35 minutes. We've already recorded like 12.

31:53.320 --> 31:54.840
That puts us at 47.

31:54.840 --> 31:57.320
He's going to say wax. So, that's another eight minutes.

31:57.320 --> 31:59.000
We're a wax.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.840
We're waxed. We're waxed.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.360
Max on wax.

32:02.360 --> 32:08.200
All I said was sending a message congratulating us on 100 episodes or whatever you want to say.

32:08.280 --> 32:13.400
You've still got 17. That's pretty good to receive that much feedback.

32:13.400 --> 32:16.440
It's nice whether it's constructive or not.

32:16.440 --> 32:20.840
Yeah. I mean, God, if I sent out a mass email and got 17 responses,

32:20.840 --> 32:22.600
I feel pretty damn special.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.200
Yeah. Definitely. Definitely.

32:24.200 --> 32:25.240
Thanks, guys.

32:25.240 --> 32:28.360
I, uh, that makes me feel better.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.160
It makes me feel...

32:31.160 --> 32:34.280
A little bit more optimistic about the effect.

32:34.280 --> 32:35.480
Yeah, let's play the next one.

32:35.480 --> 32:36.520
That's the end of the next one.

32:37.240 --> 32:39.400
I'm going to go with a close personal friend of mine.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.760
All right. I'm going to go with George Sava.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.000
He sent in a two-parter.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.120
Oh, God.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.240
He's got to be...

32:45.240 --> 32:46.440
That is not a little bit the product.

32:46.440 --> 32:47.800
Yes, needs right now.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.880
Hey, Jeffrey. It's your friend George Sava.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.080
Congratulations on 100 episodes.

32:53.080 --> 32:55.960
I don't really feel like being mean to you. I'm actually quite proud that

32:55.960 --> 32:57.480
you guys show us made it this far.

32:58.040 --> 33:02.360
So, I have sourced a message from someone who could perhaps do equal damage

33:03.400 --> 33:04.760
your ex-girlfriend to Ellen.

33:06.520 --> 33:07.960
There's no way.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.960
Hi. I'm Ellen.

33:09.960 --> 33:15.000
I'm from Cleveland, Ohio and I dated Jeffrey in high school when I was 15.

33:15.720 --> 33:16.600
Oh my God.

33:16.600 --> 33:20.680
Now I live in New York and I'm a marketing coordinator.

33:21.480 --> 33:24.600
And I have an amazing boyfriend.

33:24.600 --> 33:27.400
I'm at my boyfriend in college.

33:27.400 --> 33:29.960
He was a senior and I was in school here.

33:29.960 --> 33:34.120
So, I made the first move and then we've been dating for like two years now.

33:34.200 --> 33:36.920
I knew I loved my boyfriend.

33:36.920 --> 33:39.240
Honestly, I think after our first date,

33:39.240 --> 33:43.080
I had like a really big crush on him for the longest time and we had been friends.

33:43.080 --> 33:47.080
So, we finally had like that for five minutes alone.

33:47.080 --> 33:47.320
Yeah.

33:47.320 --> 33:48.920
He's gonna stick for a while.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.360
First date, he took...

33:50.360 --> 33:52.520
I think we don't have to go through all of it.

33:52.520 --> 33:53.160
Perfect place.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.200
Let me know how you guys think we get it.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.120
We used to like walk my dog out all the time.

33:56.120 --> 33:56.760
We get it.

33:56.760 --> 33:59.960
Um, and he brought a picnic blanket and wine.

33:59.960 --> 34:01.160
I can do a picnic.

34:01.160 --> 34:02.280
Like, it's a good joke.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.640
No one's saying it's not a good joke.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.000
It's just that we've together.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.480
He painted a picture of us and it was just...

34:07.480 --> 34:08.280
I can paint.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.080
Like, I could do this.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.280
My boyfriend, how?

34:10.280 --> 34:11.240
I don't know if he can paint.

34:11.240 --> 34:14.360
And only by far, the best boyfriend I've ever had.

34:14.360 --> 34:14.840
I feel like...

34:14.840 --> 34:15.480
No way.

34:16.280 --> 34:16.680
Awesome.

34:16.680 --> 34:21.160
And it was all kind of like high school flings or like silly little.

34:21.160 --> 34:21.720
Or than that.

34:21.720 --> 34:24.600
Like, serious moments kind of me just thought,

34:24.600 --> 34:25.080
really?

34:25.080 --> 34:25.720
For a young.

34:25.720 --> 34:26.600
You were young.

34:26.600 --> 34:27.480
So, yeah.

34:27.480 --> 34:30.680
I think I'm the happiest I've ever been.

34:30.680 --> 34:32.280
I think, I love my sister.

34:32.360 --> 34:35.080
Like, special thing about my boyfriend is how...

34:35.080 --> 34:36.760
How many women curious?

34:36.760 --> 34:38.360
What's the run time on this track?

34:38.360 --> 34:39.640
This is another four minutes.

34:39.640 --> 34:40.520
I'm curious.

34:40.520 --> 34:45.480
Conversely, there are debates just because he has like the most,

34:45.480 --> 34:47.560
like, open mind to ever.

34:47.560 --> 34:50.200
It is always a different avenue than it's just...

34:50.200 --> 34:51.880
Asked me anything controversial.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.400
Really nice to talk to.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.360
It's stupid, but he actually has the cutest cheeks in the world.

34:56.360 --> 34:56.920
They're like...

34:56.920 --> 34:57.960
Catch my cheek.

34:58.040 --> 34:58.920
Hinch my cheeks.

34:58.920 --> 34:59.480
Be the one.

34:59.480 --> 35:01.720
Of course, they're five.

35:01.720 --> 35:02.680
They're five.

35:02.680 --> 35:04.040
So, they're five.

35:04.040 --> 35:05.720
Jake, do something.

35:05.720 --> 35:06.600
I love my sister.

35:06.600 --> 35:10.200
I can barely even hear you over the boy friend's door out.

35:10.200 --> 35:10.360
Yeah.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.000
He's very like bold and confident.

35:13.000 --> 35:13.800
Hit stop.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.080
I'm begging you now.

35:15.080 --> 35:15.800
Hit stop.

35:15.800 --> 35:16.600
Champion bro.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.040
But you're not confident.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.480
But because the author wants to tell us...

35:21.480 --> 35:24.040
I say, she means like face cheeks, right?

35:24.680 --> 35:25.080
Yeah.

35:25.080 --> 35:27.400
And he realized that this is an inner bias.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.120
I'm showing you my last artist.

35:30.120 --> 35:30.760
Yeah.

35:30.760 --> 35:31.560
I've ever met.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.800
I'm my favorite memory with my boyfriend.

35:33.800 --> 35:38.200
Was probably when I recently moved to New York.

35:38.200 --> 35:41.720
And when I was moving from Ohio to New York,

35:41.720 --> 35:43.480
he helped move into my apartment.

35:43.480 --> 35:46.120
And I was like alone for a week or two.

35:46.920 --> 35:48.680
And she likes to leave with me.

35:48.680 --> 35:49.960
It's nothing to do with the show.

35:49.960 --> 35:50.920
It's for her apartment.

35:50.920 --> 35:51.320
Fine.

35:51.320 --> 35:53.000
That's not being the god dog.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.360
I have a job with that.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.400
When you cut that off.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.640
Ha ha ha ha ha.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.920
It was still really early.

36:00.920 --> 36:02.360
I saw the timeline move.

36:02.360 --> 36:04.360
We were at that was, yeah.

36:04.360 --> 36:05.400
40 mil and a mile.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.880
Ellen, that was a couple more than any of the guests.

36:07.880 --> 36:13.560
So, this is turning into a fucking public stoning of me.

36:13.560 --> 36:14.600
Yeah.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.800
Right?

36:15.800 --> 36:17.160
What's this?

36:17.160 --> 36:18.200
Diet smoke.

36:18.200 --> 36:19.000
Where are you?

36:19.000 --> 36:19.960
What's that?

36:19.960 --> 36:20.680
Diet smoke.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.680
It's basically Delta 8 THC gumming.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.200
So it's like that fucking perfect.

36:24.200 --> 36:25.240
I'm so excited.

36:25.240 --> 36:27.240
I'm so excited for the ad break.

36:28.200 --> 36:29.080
All right, here we go.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.680
This is going to be from Johnny Villa.

36:30.680 --> 36:31.800
Oh, it's a Jeffrey.

36:31.800 --> 36:34.600
I wanted to record a message for the hundredth episode.

36:34.600 --> 36:37.720
But every time I tried something, just didn't feel right.

36:37.720 --> 36:40.440
And I couldn't display my emotions to the fullest extent.

36:40.440 --> 36:41.400
I know it's coming.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.920
You deserve more than that.

36:42.920 --> 36:46.760
So what I did was pay a voice actor to record exactly what I wanted to say.

36:46.760 --> 36:47.160
Oh.

36:47.160 --> 36:48.440
Take it away, Mr. Ben Kroger.

36:49.400 --> 36:55.480
Do you believe that podcasts are great to expand the mind and teach us about other people?

36:55.480 --> 36:55.800
Wow.

36:56.760 --> 36:57.960
You're an idiot.

37:00.520 --> 37:02.920
Welcome to the headgum podcast.

37:04.440 --> 37:05.240
This is good.

37:05.240 --> 37:06.680
We should run never get back.

37:06.680 --> 37:07.640
Yeah, honestly.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.640
Suck it, other podcasts.

37:10.680 --> 37:14.680
It's a show that has listeners even though the host sucks.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.120
And I mean sucks.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.480
Think about the worst person you know.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.520
You know he's worse.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.240
Segments are under prepare.

37:27.240 --> 37:30.040
The worst soundboard you've ever heard.

37:30.040 --> 37:30.760
Are you lying?

37:30.760 --> 37:31.560
Are you lying?

37:31.560 --> 37:32.600
Are you lying?

37:32.600 --> 37:36.360
And he measured the loud of dead air.

37:38.680 --> 37:40.840
And it's all Jeffrey times his fault.

37:40.840 --> 37:41.480
On part.

37:41.480 --> 37:42.440
Yeah, it's not that much.

37:42.440 --> 37:44.840
Oh, Jeffrey James is fault.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.480
It's all Jeffrey James is fault.

37:48.520 --> 37:51.240
It's all Jeffrey James is fault.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.960
Jeffrey James is all Jeffrey James.

37:54.920 --> 37:58.920
Jeffrey James is fault.

37:58.920 --> 38:02.920
It's all Jeffrey James is fault.

38:02.920 --> 38:03.400
Of course.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.400
Jeffrey James is not a man.

38:07.400 --> 38:11.400
Jeffrey James is fault.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.400
Jeffrey James is fault.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.400
Jeffrey James is fault.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.680
Take him up.

38:18.680 --> 38:22.280
So take him up, but it's not bad to you.

38:23.160 --> 38:25.480
So it act like there's staple to your head.

38:25.480 --> 38:27.000
It was.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.480
I might, I might contact Johnny to see if we can run that as an ad.

38:31.480 --> 38:32.280
Sure, sure.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.880
Maybe I should definitely try.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.080
We should really try it.

38:35.080 --> 38:35.960
That he's so fun.

38:35.960 --> 38:38.920
I'm down to put $50,000 behind

38:38.920 --> 38:44.280
airing that on the biggest, most important podcast of Jeffrey and his friends live.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.600
So they all sort of hear how bad he is.

38:47.880 --> 38:50.280
Yeah, maybe like armchair expert or something.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.720
You look shell shocked.

38:53.720 --> 38:55.080
Is everything okay?

38:55.080 --> 38:59.000
Everybody wanted to add conversation to Jeff is still maintaining this.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.120
I just had a crazy.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.960
It's not supposed to happen.

39:03.960 --> 39:06.440
We're supposed to fucking make me feel happy.

39:06.440 --> 39:09.240
Well, because they do it in next one will be really nice.

39:09.240 --> 39:09.800
What's that?

39:09.800 --> 39:11.880
Maybe the next one will be really nice.

39:11.880 --> 39:17.000
Okay, and speaking of nice, let's go with Shelby Wolfstein, who just was on the nice episode.

39:17.880 --> 39:22.040
Hey, Jeff, kind of an awkward call.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.560
I just got out of the therapy appointment.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.800
And I thought maybe I should give you a courtesy call.

39:29.800 --> 39:30.760
I was talking to my therapist.

39:30.760 --> 39:33.960
She said, you know, I was making a lot of progress in the past month or so.

39:33.960 --> 39:38.200
She's really seen a pretty steep decline in me, mentally and emotionally.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.080
And in a lot of ways, physically.

39:41.080 --> 39:44.280
And she, we were talking about it for a while.

39:44.280 --> 39:45.400
We were trying to get to the bottom of it.

39:45.400 --> 39:48.520
And ultimately what we came down to was I've guessed it on your pod.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.800
Like three times in the past month or so.

39:51.800 --> 39:59.000
And we're thinking that might be a reason for my sort of distress emotionally.

40:00.520 --> 40:01.640
Emotional distress legally.

40:01.640 --> 40:04.120
That is what we are going to call it in the lawsuit.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.800
So she's suing you.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.640
Again, this is a emotional call address.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.800
I, you know, you're getting served.

40:09.800 --> 40:12.440
I don't want it to come to this, but we were talking and it's just like,

40:13.400 --> 40:16.040
I'm going to have to start going, you know, two a days with her.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.400
There's getting back on track.

40:19.400 --> 40:23.960
And if I'm going to afford that, I need, I need to go through with this.

40:26.280 --> 40:27.800
It's been really awful knowing you.

40:29.240 --> 40:31.000
But I hope you lose in court.

40:31.800 --> 40:32.680
That's not a butt.

40:32.680 --> 40:33.800
That's the wrong conjunction.

40:33.800 --> 40:34.680
She's suing you.

40:34.680 --> 40:35.480
Yeah, that's that.

40:36.280 --> 40:37.800
She's suing you, basically.

40:39.320 --> 40:40.920
There's no way the other ones are nice.

40:41.880 --> 40:43.720
Last two really hurt your feelings.

40:43.720 --> 40:46.440
It's like, there's only 12 more, right?

40:47.240 --> 40:48.120
Yeah, let's go.

40:48.120 --> 40:49.400
Kind of crazed.

40:49.400 --> 40:50.360
Let's see what you brought to the table.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.400
I'm your sentiment.

40:51.400 --> 40:52.520
Me, that's kind of nice.

40:52.520 --> 40:52.920
Yeah.

40:52.920 --> 41:00.280
A, A, I mean, you will think of you.

41:00.280 --> 41:04.840
It's not, it's not hiring guard men.

41:07.080 --> 41:08.680
Yeah, I don't know.

41:09.560 --> 41:13.720
I've sort of said it all, and yet I feel like I haven't said enough.

41:13.720 --> 41:19.640
In a weird way, you, you, you're not it.

41:21.160 --> 41:30.360
You're basically not the the right person to do this podcast, but also probably

41:32.600 --> 41:33.640
anything else.

41:33.640 --> 41:38.520
Like, I can't imagine a task or responsibility where you'd be in the top

41:38.600 --> 41:45.480
three of what I'd consider even just like not like exceeding expectations, but

41:45.480 --> 41:48.280
a competent, comfortable zone.

41:48.280 --> 41:53.160
Like, you're not to say you're not good at anything to sort of

41:53.160 --> 41:58.200
underselling how below average you are at, literally anything.

41:58.200 --> 42:08.440
But, but congrats on doing it 100 times.

42:09.080 --> 42:10.520
It's in here, obviously.

42:10.520 --> 42:11.880
Thank you.

42:11.880 --> 42:12.840
That was nice.

42:12.840 --> 42:13.320
Thank you.

42:13.320 --> 42:17.560
You ended on a nice, very, very, very appreciate that.

42:17.560 --> 42:20.760
I really appreciate that.

42:20.760 --> 42:22.760
That was, thank you.

42:22.760 --> 42:24.200
I appreciate, yeah.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.200
You're welcome.

42:26.840 --> 42:28.840
You know, it's, it's just kind of funny because like,

42:31.080 --> 42:34.360
to work with such amazing comedians to me is like, yeah,

42:34.360 --> 42:37.960
it's a dream come true really on a certain, in a certain shade.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.800
And sort of here, you say something like that to me.

42:42.600 --> 42:44.040
Means, yeah.

42:44.040 --> 42:46.040
You know, it means, you know, it is Earth Day.

42:46.040 --> 42:46.680
It means the world.

42:48.280 --> 42:48.760
Both that.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.760
Also, today's my half-birthday.

42:50.760 --> 42:51.160
Wow.

42:51.160 --> 42:52.760
Today's my wife's birthday.

42:52.760 --> 42:53.800
Wow.

42:53.800 --> 42:54.760
Happy birthday, Joe.

43:01.160 --> 43:03.720
There's a lot of things happening, but let's kind of focus on what's in the room.

43:03.720 --> 43:04.360
Yeah.

43:04.360 --> 43:05.320
That was weird.

43:05.320 --> 43:05.720
Right, here.

43:05.720 --> 43:07.320
Oh, Andrew Pile, all the way from

43:08.520 --> 43:09.560
Hudson Valley.

43:09.560 --> 43:11.560
Hey Jeff, it's Pile.

43:11.560 --> 43:13.320
Look, I keep getting alerts about your head

43:13.320 --> 43:14.280
going to email address.

43:14.280 --> 43:15.480
Your mailbox is filling up.

43:17.320 --> 43:19.480
When in that today, you know,

43:19.480 --> 43:21.640
look, he describes a lot of crypto news letters.

43:21.640 --> 43:23.800
I feel like maybe just read some of those.

43:23.800 --> 43:26.200
Run subscribe or something or delete them after you read them.

43:26.200 --> 43:29.160
But also, you got to respond to your doctor, man.

43:29.160 --> 43:30.680
They've been reaching out for months.

43:30.680 --> 43:32.760
And it seems pretty serious.

43:32.760 --> 43:34.120
So, give them a call or email.

43:34.120 --> 43:34.600
I did.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.760
And they said that I had a fucking fat ass.

43:36.840 --> 43:41.160
So, you have some of my degenerative mental illness.

43:41.160 --> 43:41.640
I think.

43:42.840 --> 43:45.080
Well, you know what, this tool isn't helping.

43:45.080 --> 43:48.200
You said that they just said you had a fat ass and thin legs.

43:48.200 --> 43:50.920
There's no way to email you multiple times for that.

43:52.520 --> 43:53.720
I don't know, Pile could do that.

43:53.720 --> 43:54.520
Go into your email.

43:54.520 --> 43:55.160
Did you know that?

43:55.160 --> 43:56.680
No, he has the back leg in you.

43:56.680 --> 43:57.160
Yeah.

43:57.160 --> 43:58.040
He's our CTO.

43:59.640 --> 44:01.480
Billy, present company.

44:01.560 --> 44:02.920
What's up?

44:02.920 --> 44:04.920
What's up, Jeff?

44:04.920 --> 44:05.400
What's up?

44:05.400 --> 44:07.080
Headgun podcast listeners.

44:07.080 --> 44:08.440
This is Billy Scafiri.

44:08.440 --> 44:10.440
Just wanted to give you a peek behind the curtain.

44:10.440 --> 44:11.240
Real quick.

44:11.240 --> 44:17.720
Jeff has been emailing the previous guests of the headgun podcast for a while now, with the specific

44:17.720 --> 44:24.680
intent to leave him a quote-unquote vitriolic message to him and presumably the guest.

44:24.680 --> 44:31.320
I'm going to read to you now the second email, Jeff sent, and note the extra excitement

44:31.400 --> 44:33.160
in receiving the vitriol.

44:33.160 --> 44:35.320
Hey, y'all, exclamation point.

44:35.320 --> 44:38.040
Wanted to ping this message, ping.

44:38.040 --> 44:45.080
To see if we can get a couple more, more vitriolic messages for headgun podcasts 100th episode

44:45.080 --> 44:48.200
by this Friday, April 22nd.

44:48.200 --> 44:54.280
Jeffrey James emailed previous guests of his podcast, asking for insults with a deadline.

44:54.280 --> 44:58.840
If you have some time to record a voice memo of libel, that would be amazing.

44:58.840 --> 45:00.120
Cheers.

45:00.120 --> 45:01.240
Thanks, Jeff.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.400
Thanks listeners of the headgun podcast.

45:03.400 --> 45:04.680
This is Billy Scafiri.

45:04.680 --> 45:08.440
Trying to provide as much Jeff truth as I can.

45:08.440 --> 45:11.160
Here's to many more pal, congrats on 100th.

45:11.160 --> 45:13.400
Oh, that was nice, too.

45:13.400 --> 45:15.560
Yeah, Ferris cut it out.

45:15.560 --> 45:16.520
Why?

45:16.520 --> 45:19.160
Because it lives the mail.

45:19.160 --> 45:20.360
Dude.

45:20.360 --> 45:21.400
We know the mail.

45:21.400 --> 45:24.200
We absolutely get out of the sausages made.

45:24.200 --> 45:25.480
Speaking of Ferris.

45:25.480 --> 45:27.480
Jeff, Ferris here.

45:27.480 --> 45:29.480
There it is.

45:29.480 --> 45:31.480
100 episodes.

45:31.480 --> 45:33.480
Oh, wow.

45:33.480 --> 45:34.480
Wow.

45:34.480 --> 45:35.480
What should I say?

45:35.480 --> 45:36.480
Wow.

45:36.480 --> 45:37.480
That's, let me go.

45:37.480 --> 45:39.480
100 episodes.

45:39.480 --> 45:40.480
He's a control.

45:40.480 --> 45:43.480
100 weeks of a short film post in prison.

45:43.480 --> 45:45.480
I'm doing.

45:45.480 --> 45:51.080
For the past two years, this show has been a cafeteria tray of poison.

45:51.080 --> 45:56.280
Slid under my cell door every single week for me to swallow down, along with my pride,

45:56.280 --> 46:00.280
that helps smuggle you onto listening platforms, like a Trojan horse.

46:00.280 --> 46:01.280
Dan, Daniel.

46:01.280 --> 46:03.280
You think that was easy?

46:03.280 --> 46:04.280
That wasn't easy.

46:04.280 --> 46:05.280
That wasn't easy.

46:05.280 --> 46:06.280
That wasn't easy.

46:06.280 --> 46:13.280
It just seems like every episode all to become a known accomplice to this for lack of a better term,

46:13.280 --> 46:15.280
weekly podcast.

46:15.280 --> 46:18.280
I'm blacklisted by the entertainment industry for this.

46:18.280 --> 46:19.280
And I deserve it.

46:19.280 --> 46:22.280
Your reversible damage has been done to good people.

46:22.280 --> 46:25.280
And I sat by and let it happen.

46:25.280 --> 46:27.280
Also, measure, healer.

46:27.280 --> 46:32.280
Turn down the gain on your mic so that this isn't the raw material I'm left to work with.

46:32.280 --> 46:34.280
You mega phone.

46:34.280 --> 46:36.280
And also, healer.

46:36.280 --> 46:39.280
Stockholm syndrome is real.

46:39.280 --> 46:41.280
I love you, buddy.

46:41.280 --> 46:42.280
Happy 100 episodes.

46:42.280 --> 46:46.280
Get it started and ha!

46:46.280 --> 46:48.280
Well, it's pretty cool, right?

46:48.280 --> 46:49.280
He should have looked at the show.

46:49.280 --> 46:50.280
It was pretty good.

46:50.280 --> 46:51.280
Yeah.

46:51.280 --> 46:54.280
It's never heard that hurled as an insult.

46:54.280 --> 46:57.280
It's clever because you do often peak.

46:57.280 --> 46:58.280
Thank you.

46:58.280 --> 47:01.280
Now, I mean, like, you're too close to the microphone.

47:01.280 --> 47:04.280
It's hard to record it.

47:04.280 --> 47:07.280
Let's hear from a friend of the show, John George, former intern.

47:07.280 --> 47:08.280
Good friend of mine.

47:08.280 --> 47:10.280
Hello, had gum crudas former, had gum intern.

47:10.280 --> 47:15.280
John George here to congratulate you guys on 100 episodes of the head gum podcast.

47:15.280 --> 47:18.280
I mean, how did you guys do it?

47:18.280 --> 47:19.280
Right?

47:19.280 --> 47:20.280
Seriously, how are you doing?

47:20.280 --> 47:21.280
A lot of work.

47:21.280 --> 47:22.280
I keep this podcast at flow.

47:22.280 --> 47:23.280
A lot of work.

47:23.280 --> 47:26.280
With a toxic, awful man as your host.

47:26.280 --> 47:28.280
Jeffrey James.

47:28.280 --> 47:30.280
This guy is terrible awful.

47:30.280 --> 47:33.280
And I know you're in the room, Jeff.

47:33.280 --> 47:34.280
You're bad.

47:34.280 --> 47:35.280
You're just bad in general.

47:35.280 --> 47:37.280
I'm not even going to call you bad host.

47:37.280 --> 47:39.280
You're just a bad person.

47:39.280 --> 47:42.280
You're over there celebrating 100 episodes of this podcast.

47:42.280 --> 47:43.280
What a milestone, right?

47:43.280 --> 47:44.280
Well, guess what?

47:44.280 --> 47:47.280
Me and my therapist just celebrated a milestone, too.

47:47.280 --> 47:50.280
100 times I've had to go to therapy because of the time

47:50.280 --> 47:51.280
God been on this podcast.

47:51.280 --> 47:52.280
Comment.

47:52.280 --> 47:53.280
Jeff.

47:53.280 --> 47:54.280
Don't surprise over that.

47:54.280 --> 47:55.280
I don't like this news.

47:55.280 --> 47:56.280
Yeah.

47:56.280 --> 47:58.280
Because we talked about this.

47:58.280 --> 47:59.280
Over messages, over coffee.

47:59.280 --> 48:03.280
We've talked many times about how I did not like being on the podcast.

48:03.280 --> 48:04.280
How you traumatized me.

48:04.280 --> 48:05.280
And guess what?

48:05.280 --> 48:07.280
You're attained none of it.

48:07.280 --> 48:09.280
You're seeing the apologetic in the moment.

48:09.280 --> 48:11.280
You're attained absolutely none of it.

48:11.280 --> 48:12.280
It has come down to this.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.280
This is what my therapist has recommended me.

48:14.280 --> 48:15.280
Do.

48:15.280 --> 48:16.280
Come on this podcast.

48:16.280 --> 48:18.280
Tell you off in front of your coworkers.

48:18.280 --> 48:21.280
And maybe it'll help my mental health.

48:21.280 --> 48:23.280
But maybe it'll also help yours.

48:23.280 --> 48:24.280
Maybe it'll make you better person.

48:24.280 --> 48:27.280
Even though I told my therapist, there's no way that happens.

48:27.280 --> 48:31.280
I can literally not imagine a world where Jeff is a better person.

48:31.280 --> 48:32.280
Ever.

48:32.280 --> 48:34.280
Even a little bit better.

48:34.280 --> 48:35.280
I can't imagine that.

48:35.280 --> 48:36.280
I can try.

48:36.280 --> 48:37.280
Anyways.

48:37.280 --> 48:42.280
Congratulations to everyone that had a gun but Jeff for all the hard work on this podcast.

48:42.280 --> 48:44.280
Because I know that put a million times more work into it.

48:44.280 --> 48:46.280
And Jeff with his silly sounds.

48:47.280 --> 48:48.280
That's all he does.

48:48.280 --> 48:49.280
That's all he does.

48:49.280 --> 48:50.280
He has a soundboard.

48:50.280 --> 48:51.280
That's it.

48:51.280 --> 48:52.280
Congrats, man.

48:52.280 --> 48:54.280
I can go find a soundboard on the internet too.

48:54.280 --> 48:56.280
I can find funny sounds on YouTube, man.

48:56.280 --> 48:57.280
Thanks.

48:57.280 --> 48:58.280
Wow.

48:58.280 --> 48:59.280
Good job.

48:59.280 --> 49:01.280
Congrats, everybody.

49:01.280 --> 49:02.280
But Jeff, of course.

49:02.280 --> 49:03.280
I have to reiterate.

49:03.280 --> 49:04.280
Not you, Jeff.

49:04.280 --> 49:05.280
No.

49:05.280 --> 49:06.280
Yeah.

49:06.280 --> 49:07.280
Congratulations.

49:07.280 --> 49:08.280
Obviously to Marie.

49:08.280 --> 49:09.280
Yeah.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.280
Wow.

49:10.280 --> 49:11.280
I appreciate it.

49:11.280 --> 49:13.280
Do you remember the first episode of Marieco?

49:13.280 --> 49:14.280
Was it like this?

49:14.280 --> 49:15.280
Or was it totally different?

49:16.280 --> 49:18.280
It was like all of us just chatting.

49:18.280 --> 49:19.280
It was like a cocktail hour.

49:19.280 --> 49:20.280
Back then.

49:20.280 --> 49:21.280
Yeah.

49:21.280 --> 49:22.280
Interesting.

49:22.280 --> 49:23.280
Who was on it?

49:23.280 --> 49:24.280
Let's take a break.

49:24.280 --> 49:25.280
I can't actually tell you.

49:25.280 --> 49:27.280
Because you've been playing voice meals for the last.

49:27.280 --> 49:29.280
What feels like having children.

49:29.280 --> 49:30.280
Or even it's Jake.

49:30.280 --> 49:32.280
Let's have a chat in four minutes.

49:32.280 --> 49:33.280
Yeah.

49:33.280 --> 49:34.280
That's what Billy uses.

49:34.280 --> 49:36.280
We have, we have five more to get to.

49:36.280 --> 49:37.280
But we'll take a break.

49:37.280 --> 49:38.280
Okay.

49:38.280 --> 49:39.280
Just more.

49:39.280 --> 49:40.280
Five more.

49:40.280 --> 49:41.280
It's.

49:41.280 --> 49:43.280
Am I that bad?

49:43.280 --> 49:44.280
So we are two people.

49:45.280 --> 49:48.280
I feel like we're going to talk about something.

49:48.280 --> 49:50.280
I don't want to talk about you personally.

49:50.280 --> 49:51.280
Let's talk about.

49:51.280 --> 49:52.280
Yeah.

49:52.280 --> 49:53.280
So we are two people.

49:53.280 --> 49:54.280
Sadly.

49:54.280 --> 49:55.280
Let's talk about.

49:55.280 --> 49:56.280
Sorry.

49:58.280 --> 50:00.280
Two of the nine people have mentioned their therapist.

50:00.280 --> 50:01.280
If I set the line.

50:01.280 --> 50:03.280
The over under two and a half people.

50:03.280 --> 50:05.280
I'll mention their therapist.

50:05.280 --> 50:07.280
We'll be bet the over or the on.

50:07.280 --> 50:09.280
So we'll one more person mentioned therapy.

50:09.280 --> 50:10.280
Probably over.

50:10.280 --> 50:11.280
Yeah.

50:11.280 --> 50:12.280
I think over.

50:13.280 --> 50:17.280
I'll fade the public go under no more therapy references going forward.

50:17.280 --> 50:20.280
Now we have something to sort of look forward to.

50:20.280 --> 50:21.280
There you go.

50:21.280 --> 50:22.280
As we play the next.

50:22.280 --> 50:24.280
I guess that makes it interesting for you and Billy.

50:24.280 --> 50:25.280
But what am I supposed to do?

50:25.280 --> 50:27.280
Well, you can also bet.

50:27.280 --> 50:28.280
Yeah.

50:28.280 --> 50:30.280
Over two and a half.

50:30.280 --> 50:33.280
I'm going to keep on checking my email.

50:37.280 --> 50:38.280
And that's okay.

50:38.280 --> 50:39.280
All right.

50:39.280 --> 50:40.280
This comes in from head comes.

50:41.280 --> 50:42.280
Very kind person.

50:42.280 --> 50:43.280
This is Kayla Moriarty.

50:43.280 --> 50:44.280
Let's see.

50:44.280 --> 50:45.280
Hey Jeff.

50:45.280 --> 50:46.280
I'm in therapy.

50:46.280 --> 50:48.280
Happy one of the episodes.

50:48.280 --> 50:49.280
I'm so sorry.

50:49.280 --> 50:52.280
I waited until the very last minute to get this to you.

50:52.280 --> 50:55.280
It's just that I don't respect you at all.

50:55.280 --> 50:57.280
She's very sweet.

50:57.280 --> 51:00.280
Thank you so much for having me on the podcast.

51:00.280 --> 51:01.280
I've had a lot of fun.

51:01.280 --> 51:04.280
And I've never once walked away feeling completely

51:04.280 --> 51:08.280
sacked in my energy or robbed of my time.

51:08.280 --> 51:12.280
And you know, your host skills are really incredible.

51:12.280 --> 51:19.280
I've never seen someone be able to bring together a random group of people so easily and so quickly.

51:19.280 --> 51:21.280
United against you.

51:21.280 --> 51:23.280
It's a skill that not a lot of people have.

51:23.280 --> 51:24.280
Absolutely.

51:24.280 --> 51:25.280
Like Elon Musk.

51:25.280 --> 51:27.280
So congrats on that.

51:27.280 --> 51:32.280
And you know, I'm looking forward to being back on the show and spending more time with you.

51:33.280 --> 51:35.280
But you know, take care.

51:35.280 --> 51:37.280
And all the best.

51:37.280 --> 51:38.280
I don't want to be like Elon Musk.

51:38.280 --> 51:41.280
No, no one should strive for that.

51:41.280 --> 51:43.280
There's a lot of fans though.

51:43.280 --> 51:44.280
Oh, that was nice.

51:44.280 --> 51:45.280
I had a compliment.

51:45.280 --> 51:46.280
Did I have a compliment?

51:46.280 --> 51:47.280
The grudging.

51:47.280 --> 51:48.280
He said, but.

51:48.280 --> 51:50.280
Are there segments after this?

51:50.280 --> 51:51.280
There's one there.

51:51.280 --> 51:52.280
Okay.

51:52.280 --> 51:55.280
But the one segment is to listen to everybody's voice.

51:55.280 --> 51:56.280
It has to listen to.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.280
But not to be on.

51:58.280 --> 51:59.280
Right.

51:59.280 --> 52:01.280
That's sort of the most thing.

52:01.280 --> 52:02.280
I got an urgent invite.

52:02.280 --> 52:03.280
Jake.

52:03.280 --> 52:04.280
Because we thought you might not make it.

52:04.280 --> 52:07.280
And so about how far before I got a call from Jeff saying, can you hop in?

52:07.280 --> 52:08.280
And I did.

52:08.280 --> 52:09.280
Wow.

52:09.280 --> 52:10.280
So this is absolutely.

52:10.280 --> 52:11.280
This is fully.

52:11.280 --> 52:13.280
It is completely my fault.

52:13.280 --> 52:14.280
I am so sorry.

52:14.280 --> 52:15.280
Oh, please.

52:15.280 --> 52:16.280
I'm happy to be here, Jake.

52:16.280 --> 52:17.280
Let's do it.

52:17.280 --> 52:18.280
Sorry, Griffin.

52:18.280 --> 52:20.280
Well, one of our more recent guests.

52:20.280 --> 52:21.280
Here's kind of enough the same way.

52:21.280 --> 52:22.280
Hey, Jeffrey.

52:22.280 --> 52:25.280
I can't believe you made it to 100 episodes.

52:25.280 --> 52:27.280
I haven't the slightest idea.

52:27.280 --> 52:31.280
Why the show is still a thing, considering it makes no sense whatsoever.

52:31.280 --> 52:33.280
I recently got into some trouble.

52:33.280 --> 52:35.280
And I can't disclose that on air.

52:35.280 --> 52:38.280
But I am looking for some community service hours.

52:38.280 --> 52:40.280
So if you could please give me a call, that'd be great.

52:40.280 --> 52:44.280
Since obviously spending time with you is charity work.

52:44.280 --> 52:45.280
Also congrats.

52:45.280 --> 52:46.280
I guess.

52:46.280 --> 52:47.280
Good one.

52:47.280 --> 52:48.280
Shest call.

52:48.280 --> 52:49.280
I think that's the best call.

52:49.280 --> 52:50.280
That was perfect.

52:50.280 --> 52:51.280
Yep.

52:51.280 --> 52:52.280
That was a pro.

52:52.280 --> 52:53.280
That was.

52:53.280 --> 52:55.280
Jeff should have said, like, keep it 30 seconds or under.

52:55.280 --> 52:57.280
No joke did this 100 episodes.

52:57.280 --> 52:58.280
Yeah.

52:58.280 --> 53:01.280
We did this exact same premise, but we told everyone try and keep it brief.

53:01.280 --> 53:03.280
15 seconds 30 seconds.

53:03.280 --> 53:05.280
That's what there's going to be a lot of responses.

53:05.280 --> 53:06.280
Yes, exactly.

53:06.280 --> 53:09.280
What we also did was we seeded them out throughout the episode.

53:09.280 --> 53:11.280
So you got to go back to your guests and talk a little bit.

53:11.280 --> 53:13.280
And there was like a little AV.

53:13.280 --> 53:14.280
That's really good.

53:14.280 --> 53:16.280
And that was really good actually.

53:16.280 --> 53:18.280
But Jeff said, I want to take that same idea.

53:18.280 --> 53:19.280
I lump it.

53:19.280 --> 53:20.280
Yeah.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.280
It's a lumpy.

53:21.280 --> 53:23.280
It's a lumpy lumpy podcast.

53:23.280 --> 53:24.280
We're stuck in the lump.

53:24.280 --> 53:26.280
Let's face facts, guests, guests.

53:26.280 --> 53:27.280
We're in the lump.

53:27.280 --> 53:28.280
We're in the lump right now.

53:28.280 --> 53:30.280
It's like lumpy mashed potatoes or something.

53:30.280 --> 53:31.280
Those are good.

53:31.280 --> 53:33.280
I mean, those are going to eat it.

53:33.280 --> 53:34.280
You're just going to have it.

53:34.280 --> 53:35.280
You just wish it was so smooth.

53:35.280 --> 53:36.280
And so let's see.

53:36.280 --> 53:37.280
Maybe they'll smooth itself out.

53:37.280 --> 53:38.280
Jeff.

53:38.280 --> 53:41.280
You're a lump.

53:41.280 --> 53:42.280
You're a lump.

53:42.280 --> 53:43.280
It's a lump.

53:43.280 --> 53:44.280
He's a lump.

53:44.280 --> 53:45.280
He's a lump.

53:45.280 --> 53:46.280
He's a lump.

53:46.280 --> 53:47.280
He's a lump.

53:47.280 --> 53:48.280
He's a lump.

53:48.280 --> 53:49.280
He's a lump.

53:49.280 --> 53:50.280
He's a lump.

53:50.280 --> 53:51.280
He's a lump.

53:51.280 --> 53:53.280
He's a lump.

53:54.280 --> 53:55.280
That's funny.

53:55.280 --> 53:56.280
What a no.

53:56.280 --> 53:57.280
He's stuck.

53:57.280 --> 53:59.280
You are a whale potato.

53:59.280 --> 54:01.280
Jeffery, age, age, age, age.

54:01.280 --> 54:02.280
It's all Jeffrey.

54:02.280 --> 54:03.280
James.

54:03.280 --> 54:04.280
It's all Jeffrey.

54:04.280 --> 54:06.280
It's all Jeffrey.

54:06.280 --> 54:07.280
It's all Jeffrey.

54:07.280 --> 54:08.280
You do this game, Johnny.

54:08.280 --> 54:09.280
Some shine on that.

54:09.280 --> 54:10.280
But we need to give him some more.

54:10.280 --> 54:11.280
Johnny is so proud.

54:11.280 --> 54:12.280
Yeah.

54:12.280 --> 54:13.280
He's a really good.

54:13.280 --> 54:14.280
It's a really good.

54:14.280 --> 54:17.280
And everything he does, it's quality over quantity.

54:17.280 --> 54:18.280
It's Johnny.

54:18.280 --> 54:19.280
Johnny.

54:19.280 --> 54:20.280
Johnny.

54:20.280 --> 54:21.280
Johnny.

54:21.280 --> 54:22.280
Johnny all day.

54:22.280 --> 54:24.280
Jeff, no way, it's a lot of hard work.

54:24.280 --> 54:25.280
I don't like you.

54:25.280 --> 54:27.280
Because it's not fun to like just compare people.

54:27.280 --> 54:29.280
Because there is no comparison.

54:29.280 --> 54:31.280
But let's compare them for a second.

54:31.280 --> 54:35.280
If Johnny hosted episodes 100 and 1 through 200,

54:35.280 --> 54:38.280
let's just imagine what those episodes might be.

54:38.280 --> 54:39.280
Polish, Polish, Polish.

54:39.280 --> 54:40.280
Yeah, good.

54:40.280 --> 54:41.280
Yeah.

54:41.280 --> 54:43.280
Let's see what he did to be her trailer.

54:43.280 --> 54:45.280
The trailer was incredible.

54:45.280 --> 54:46.280
He put more.

54:46.280 --> 54:48.280
I meant effort into that one second.

54:48.280 --> 54:51.280
One more time and effort into that trailer than you have into 100 episodes.

54:51.280 --> 54:52.280
Yeah.

54:52.280 --> 54:55.280
When I checked in, I was in Thai as Thai well for this show.

54:55.280 --> 54:56.280
That's true.

54:56.280 --> 54:57.280
You missed it when he spilled.

54:57.280 --> 54:58.280
Yes.

54:58.280 --> 54:59.280
He spilled a lot.

54:59.280 --> 55:01.280
And Johnny has a bit short sense of humor too.

55:01.280 --> 55:05.280
Where it's almost like you can sit back with a glass of wine and just kind of enjoy his

55:05.280 --> 55:07.280
natural and just as a boiled potato.

55:07.280 --> 55:08.280
He's a big potato.

55:08.280 --> 55:09.280
Yeah.

55:09.280 --> 55:10.280
We're stuck in the lot.

55:10.280 --> 55:11.280
We're stuck in the lump.

55:11.280 --> 55:12.280
He's the lump.

55:12.280 --> 55:13.280
Yeah.

55:13.280 --> 55:14.280
He's the lump.

55:14.280 --> 55:15.280
He's the lump.

55:15.280 --> 55:16.280
He's the lump.

55:16.280 --> 55:17.280
He's the lump.

55:17.280 --> 55:18.280
He's the lump.

55:18.280 --> 55:19.280
He's the lump.

55:19.280 --> 55:20.280
He's the lump.

55:20.280 --> 55:21.280
He's the lump.

55:21.280 --> 55:22.280
Have we said boiled potato?

55:22.280 --> 55:23.280
Spod is a good nickname.

55:23.280 --> 55:25.280
Spod is a good nickname.

55:25.280 --> 55:26.280
Spud web, Spud James.

55:26.280 --> 55:27.280
Spud.

55:27.280 --> 55:28.280
Yeah.

55:28.280 --> 55:30.280
He's just put in the office today.

55:30.280 --> 55:31.280
That's good.

55:31.280 --> 55:32.280
I know it would be like.

55:32.280 --> 55:33.280
We're spud here.

55:33.280 --> 55:34.280
Review review.

55:34.280 --> 55:36.280
I was just a Spud in Ryan.

55:36.280 --> 55:37.280
What?

55:37.280 --> 55:38.280
Fuck you.

55:38.280 --> 55:39.280
Keep walking.

55:39.280 --> 55:40.280
Shit.

55:40.280 --> 55:41.280
Oh my god.

55:41.280 --> 55:42.280
Wow.

55:42.280 --> 55:44.280
Are you really leaving?

55:44.280 --> 55:45.280
There's three more.

55:45.280 --> 55:46.280
Don't have to.

55:46.280 --> 55:47.280
Don't have to.

55:47.280 --> 55:48.280
Don't have to.

55:48.280 --> 55:49.280
Don't have to.

55:50.280 --> 55:51.280
Go.

55:51.280 --> 55:52.280
What do you think the segment will be?

55:52.280 --> 55:54.280
What do you think the overrunner is on Jeffrey turning?

55:54.280 --> 55:55.280
Oh, great.

55:55.280 --> 55:56.280
60 seconds.

55:56.280 --> 55:57.280
I would say.

55:57.280 --> 55:58.280
He's in the hall right now dying.

55:58.280 --> 56:00.280
Like he wants to be back on camera.

56:00.280 --> 56:01.280
So bad.

56:01.280 --> 56:02.280
Because he wants to.

56:02.280 --> 56:03.280
Yeah.

56:03.280 --> 56:04.280
And he doesn't want to do it instantly.

56:04.280 --> 56:06.280
He has to be like a funny length of time.

56:06.280 --> 56:07.280
Yeah.

56:07.280 --> 56:09.280
But we are out of time at the same time.

56:09.280 --> 56:10.280
Here's another question.

56:10.280 --> 56:12.280
Does he return with some sort of new prop?

56:12.280 --> 56:14.280
Oh, that's like this is going to.

56:14.280 --> 56:16.280
He had this design where he was going to get mad enough.

56:16.280 --> 56:17.280
Yeah.

56:17.280 --> 56:18.280
That he was going to storm out.

56:18.280 --> 56:20.280
He's going to have a big surprise for us.

56:20.280 --> 56:21.280
Yeah.

56:21.280 --> 56:26.280
I don't know if I call it a big surprise for he's probably going to bring back something.

56:26.280 --> 56:28.280
It's not going to be super well thought out.

56:28.280 --> 56:30.280
But I do think this was his intention.

56:30.280 --> 56:34.280
Does I feel like I'd have to be here for when he comes back?

56:34.280 --> 56:38.280
Because I know I've only been here for what was supposed to be half the show.

56:38.280 --> 56:39.280
Yeah.

56:39.280 --> 56:41.280
But I have been sitting here for 45 minutes.

56:41.280 --> 56:42.280
Yeah.

56:42.280 --> 56:43.280
And I feel like that's the full.

56:43.280 --> 56:46.280
That's like the amount of time that committed to this.

56:46.280 --> 56:47.280
Yeah.

56:47.280 --> 56:48.280
I just started it at three.

56:48.280 --> 56:49.280
I kind of have this an hour and 20 minutes.

56:49.280 --> 56:50.280
Yeah.

56:50.280 --> 56:51.280
I kind of have to pee.

56:51.280 --> 56:53.280
I wonder if I should use this time now to go to the restroom.

56:53.280 --> 56:54.280
Yeah.

56:54.280 --> 56:55.280
What if we all left?

56:55.280 --> 56:57.280
I feel like that's a bit of a power move.

56:57.280 --> 56:58.280
Oh, you stormed off.

56:58.280 --> 56:59.280
We could all storm off if you want.

56:59.280 --> 57:00.280
Oh, that's fine.

57:00.280 --> 57:04.280
I do kind of want to understand what's going to happen once a year.

57:04.280 --> 57:06.280
Oh, it's really so bad.

57:06.280 --> 57:07.280
Yeah.

57:07.280 --> 57:08.280
I was back.

57:08.280 --> 57:09.280
Damn.

57:09.280 --> 57:11.280
I was very happy that everyone was drinking a beer.

57:11.280 --> 57:12.280
I was so fucking.

57:12.280 --> 57:13.280
He's drinking.

57:13.280 --> 57:14.280
He's a peaceful thing.

57:14.280 --> 57:15.280
He's a peaceful thing.

57:15.280 --> 57:19.280
He's a peaceful thing was sponsored fucking coffee for making it.

57:19.280 --> 57:21.280
He's going to be able to play the next one.

57:21.280 --> 57:23.280
He's going to be able to take a break.

57:23.280 --> 57:25.280
No, there's no way.

57:25.280 --> 57:29.280
Six fucking years have been working in some capacity with this company.

57:29.280 --> 57:30.280
Let's play it in the next.

57:30.280 --> 57:34.280
No, one second.

57:34.280 --> 57:37.280
All I've been wet met with is fucking swimming up.

57:37.280 --> 57:38.280
Swimming up.

57:38.280 --> 57:39.280
Swimming up.

57:39.280 --> 57:40.280
Swimming up.

57:40.280 --> 57:41.280
Swimming up.

57:41.280 --> 57:42.280
Swimming up.

57:42.280 --> 57:43.280
Swimming up.

57:43.280 --> 57:44.280
Let me tell you something.

57:44.280 --> 57:45.280
I've never danced it by the way.

57:45.280 --> 57:49.280
He was working on this monologue all night last night, pacing in the beer.

57:49.280 --> 57:51.280
I tweeted once.

57:51.280 --> 57:52.280
Yeah.

57:52.280 --> 57:54.280
And they gave me the brand and beer citizenship.

57:54.280 --> 57:55.280
And guess what else?

57:55.280 --> 57:56.280
Give you cash.

57:56.280 --> 57:57.280
Sixty meters.

57:57.280 --> 57:58.280
Fuck you.

57:58.280 --> 57:59.280
Fuck you.

57:59.280 --> 58:00.280
Fuck you.

58:00.280 --> 58:01.280
Fuck you.

58:01.280 --> 58:02.280
Fuck you.

58:02.280 --> 58:03.280
Fuck you.

58:03.280 --> 58:04.280
Fuck you.

58:04.280 --> 58:05.280
Three t-shirts.

58:05.280 --> 58:06.280
Oh.

58:06.280 --> 58:09.280
And constant social media interaction.

58:09.280 --> 58:10.280
My van.

58:10.280 --> 58:11.280
Why are you at me?

58:11.280 --> 58:12.280
Why are you at this?

58:12.280 --> 58:13.280
What's that?

58:13.280 --> 58:15.280
Why are you at this?

58:15.280 --> 58:17.280
Sixty meters.

58:17.280 --> 58:19.280
What?

58:19.280 --> 58:21.280
That's five dozen.

58:21.280 --> 58:26.280
You see Jeff typing the invoice, taking out $5,000 at entering $60.

58:26.280 --> 58:29.280
Two racks against it.

58:29.280 --> 58:30.280
Ram beer, Steve.

58:30.280 --> 58:34.280
We're the fucking happy hour.

58:34.280 --> 58:37.280
I paid for that.

58:37.280 --> 58:38.280
Stop.

58:38.280 --> 58:41.280
Fucking beer and play a clip.

58:41.280 --> 58:44.280
It's one from me where you are.

58:44.280 --> 58:46.280
I'm trying to beer and play a clip.

58:46.280 --> 58:48.280
Anyway, this is Tom Higgs.

58:48.280 --> 58:49.280
Jeff.

58:49.280 --> 58:50.280
It is Mike.

58:50.280 --> 58:53.280
The least one that's the guest on the show.

58:53.280 --> 59:00.280
We're honored to have been asked to send you a voice memo for your 100th episode.

59:00.280 --> 59:03.280
Truly, thank you for the opportunity.

59:03.280 --> 59:05.280
Feel blessed.

59:05.280 --> 59:07.280
100 episodes.

59:07.280 --> 59:09.280
What a ride buddy.

59:09.280 --> 59:11.280
I think I was on.

59:11.280 --> 59:13.280
Instantly.

59:13.280 --> 59:17.280
I just, I just can't imagine what it would have been like if I had been able to

59:17.280 --> 59:21.280
guest all those times when you'd, when you'd reach out a couple days before

59:21.280 --> 59:23.280
recording to ask if I wanted to do it.

59:23.280 --> 59:25.280
And I'd say, yeah, when.

59:25.280 --> 59:28.280
And then you'd not respond.

59:28.280 --> 59:32.280
Or like when you'd slack me half an hour before recording and say,

59:32.280 --> 59:34.280
oh, we had a guest cancel.

59:34.280 --> 59:36.280
We need to fill a spot really quickly.

59:36.280 --> 59:38.280
And I'd be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:38.280 --> 59:40.280
Okay, happy to jump on the show.

59:40.280 --> 59:42.280
And then you actually does not respond.

59:42.280 --> 59:44.280
Again.

59:44.280 --> 59:46.280
Yeah.

59:46.280 --> 59:48.280
You're back in LA now.

59:48.280 --> 59:54.280
I just, I feel like that must be real blessing for the New York crew.

59:54.280 --> 59:56.280
Just because they don't have to like see.

59:56.280 --> 59:58.280
All the empty.

59:58.280 --> 01:00:01.280
I drop containers that you just leave around the recording studio.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:07.280
Yeah, I know now when I sit down on my workstation.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:11.280
I really miss being faced with your bio contaminants trash.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.280
Anyway.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.280
I really don't know what to say.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:17.280
100 episodes.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:21.280
I can't imagine this has been good for your career.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:23.280
My dog has more Instagram followers than you.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.280
I was on this kid.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.280
But this isn't embarrassing for you.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.280
It's embarrassing for me.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:37.280
I work at one of the most prestigious terrestrial radio programs in the world.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.280
You're nothing.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.280
Jeff, you're nothing.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:45.280
I just need you to know this show means nothing at all.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.280
This is, this is last thing.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.280
This is sort of tangential, but like I stop getting royalty checks for the theme song.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:59.280
Could you talk to Marty about that?

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.280
I tried to reach out on Slack to him, but like I think he blocked me.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:07.280
Which I didn't, I didn't know that was the thing you could do.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.280
Anyway, just stop doing the show.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.280
It would probably be better for everybody.

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.280
Okay, thanks, bye.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.280
I didn't realize that Mike was getting loyalty checks for the theme song.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.280
Because I also played on the theme song.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.280
So I feel like I didn't think he was.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.280
I feel weird because I have been getting.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.280
I've been caching the checks for what I think they go.

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.280
Both of your checks still go to the old office address.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.280
And I'm able to just kind of.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.280
That's okay.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.280
That's not your fault.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.280
I didn't eat this morning, sort of Chuck appeared.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.280
You guys didn't keep talking.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.280
Chuck appeared.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.280
Chuck another one.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.280
Chuck another one, Jeff.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.280
Chuck another appeared.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.280
I drove this man to just spend this here.

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.280
Chuck another beer.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.280
The black cow.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.280
Chuck a beer, dude.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.280
It's 100.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.280
That's really cool.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.280
It's 100.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:03.280
Grab a couple cans, it's in Chuck a mall.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.280
Keep it 100.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.280
You have 60.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.280
All right, I.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.280
This is crazy.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.280
No therapy references by the way.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.280
No therapy so far.

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.280
We have.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.280
Three more.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.280
Okay.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.280
Chuck again for every.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.280
Chuck a beer for every voice.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.280
I'm just going to kind of be around my phone.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.280
But you guys letting it over there.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.280
Is that even good to do?

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.280
Yes.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.280
I feel like it's just funny for you on the studio.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.280
It's not going to be good for us.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.280
Please, don't.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.280
I won't do it.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.280
Here we go.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.280
I'm not going to be braised well all the way from down under.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.280
Nice.

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.280
Australia.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.280
Hey, Jeff.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.280
It's a good braised well here from New Zealand.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.280
New Zealand.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.280
You said Australia.

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.280
I'm leaving you this me such because.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:45.280
Now you borrowed that like $50 for me a few weeks ago.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.280
You were like, I really, really need this.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.280
I'm super.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:52.280
It's really, really tough for me and you sort of sobbed a bit.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.280
So I gave it to you.

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.280
But I'm going to need that back.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:59.280
Not because I need it.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.280
Like I'm doing pretty well.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.280
Right.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.280
Because I actually like to see you upset.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.280
So yeah, like if you could just see that back.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.280
Whenever there'd be dope.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.280
Thanks.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.280
That one was at least not rude to you.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.280
It was not as good or something, but it just feels weird.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:22.280
Because like I'm in a tough spot financially in terms of credit card debt.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:26.280
And she has, um, she, she makes a lot of money.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.280
So especially for New Zealand bucks.

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.280
Yeah.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.280
So you just texted her.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.280
Can I, I need 50.

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:37.280
Couldn't be someone who lives in a further time, though.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.280
She feels like I know where I am.

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:40.280
Nobody else was up.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.280
Okay.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.280
Let's bring it home with two of my close personal friends.

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.280
Riley and Spawn and Zack done.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.280
There we go.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.280
Hi Jeff.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.280
It's Riley.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.280
Oh my god.

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:53.280
100 episodes of the headcom podcast.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.280
I mean, congrats.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.280
You guys.

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.280
Like this is such an achievement.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.280
And I am so thrilled for all of you.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.280
I mean, congratulations.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.280
And if I could just share anything.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.280
Jeff, you know, I, you are one of my best friends in this world.

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:10.280
I love you so much.

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.280
And I just want to give you the permission.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:16.280
And to just drop the mask.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.280
You don't need to try this hard.

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:21.280
You try so hard.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.280
I mean, like in every area.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.280
It's like, really, you're just like, you push to be seen as this.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.280
And if I can say that.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:31.280
I'm a progressive bubbly happy go lucky guy.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:35.280
And I just want to give you permission to stop to slow down.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.280
To just not force it.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:40.280
You know, you force everything so hard.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:43.280
And just like, just be, you know, you're enough.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.280
And I know that you don't feel that way.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.280
But honestly, like at the end of the day, you are enough.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.280
So just stop.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.280
Just stop.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.280
You're pushing so hard.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:55.280
And I actually think that pushing is pushing other people away.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.280
Because they can feel how fake it is.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.280
And feel how sad you are inside.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.280
So just let that all go.

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.280
Let that all go and stop trying so hard.

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.280
Okay.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.280
But happy 100 episodes.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.280
Congrats, you guys.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.280
Much love.

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.280
That one was trending.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:16.280
I think it's a kind of like, excuse me, spirit.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:21.280
It sort of boils everything down to like, oh, you have one problem.

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.280
And it's that you try too hard.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.280
And otherwise, you'd be good.

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:28.280
But I take issue because I think you're, you know, fully bad.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.280
I think you're subpar.

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.280
I think I'm not.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.280
There's not.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:36.280
I think there's not one thing that's keeping you from achieving greatness.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:39.280
I think there are many things.

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.280
You're just starting with the opposite of a head start.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.280
Jake, I think it's a good umbrella.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:48.280
No, I think that it's a note that in all of his choices that he makes in life,

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:53.280
there's not one singular choice that is kind of like disrupting him in society.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.280
It's not every choice.

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.280
I'm talking now.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:06:03.280
It's that every choice is amplified to such a sweaty degree that it's just overwhelming in every realm.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:07.280
So if he was able to just turn down to Riley's point is try hardness.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.280
He might actually be much more palatable.

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.280
But I think there's something fundamentally wrong with his brain that makes you do that.

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.280
Well, it's not.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:17.280
I want to go to the bottom of it because I'm starting to agree with you guys.

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.280
So what would you change?

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.280
I'm so beyond that.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:25.280
I think you can't, you can't change.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:30.280
I think all that can happen is that you can step out of the public sphere.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:33.280
So no one has to that public eye.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.280
Yeah, but I thought the eye has to have it.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.280
It's being mean.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.280
Well, listen to that last voicemail.

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:42.280
So I hear about go home.

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.280
Hey, Jeffrey.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.280
This is Zack Dunn.

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:49.280
I just wanted to acknowledge you on a hundred episodes of the headgram podcast.

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:51.280
I'm a full disclosure.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.280
I do currently have COVID.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.280
No, no.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:58.280
I guess I sort of wanted to say that I think it is your fault.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.280
Now, if you look at sort of the rise of COVID,

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.280
it's basically coincided with the rise of this podcast.

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.280
No way.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.280
Interesting.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:09.280
It's my opinion that if you stopped doing the podcast,

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:12.280
probably COVID would stop in turn.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.280
No.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.280
And then maybe I wouldn't have gotten it.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.280
I guess it's still entertaining.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.280
So just something for you to stew on and think about a little bit.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:22.280
As you consider ending this podcast for the good of humanity.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.280
All right.

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.280
Thanks.

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:27.280
A lot of people want me to stop doing the show.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.280
No more therapy mentions, though.

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.280
Yeah.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.280
You're right.

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.280
Oh, there's a trending towards therapy.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.280
Congrats.

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.280
Riley's.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.280
You could argue that's 0.5.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.280
You could might have hit the line.

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.280
Oh, a push.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.280
But the bet was say the word therapy.

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.280
Yeah.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.280
That was easy.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:48.280
No, that was actually painfully hard.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:53.280
I think that's a wrap.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:08:01.280
On the big sugar sugar one zero zero.

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.280
We did good.

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.280
We did really good.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:08.280
I think that's a that's a series wrap on the headgun podcast.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.280
Thank you for your effort.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.280
You still you still got review review.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:14.280
And you are still an ampurecitor.

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:15.280
So that's.

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.280
To add brother.

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.280
All right.

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:19.280
You still an ampurecitor.

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.280
I got an email from Nargancitor in the show.

01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:24.280
Yeah, you're not supposed to chuck them publicly like that.

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:27.280
That kind of is that Nargancitor was a New York beer.

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:28.280
You did.

01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:30.280
I don't believe you know anything.

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.280
This is my God.

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:34.280
This is this is not how I wanted this to go.

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.280
But you know what?

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.280
That's every episode.

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.280
So I kind of resigned myself to this.

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:41.280
I think you guys were being on this.

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:42.280
I guess.

01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:43.280
I mean, I don't know.

01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.280
Billy did bond to the week.

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:46.280
What?

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:48.280
After all this.

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.280
You want to know who.

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.280
Who?

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.280
The guy for a gauge on the page.

01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:55.280
Rage on.

01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.280
I thought there was another segment.

01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:57.280
I mean, I'm chill.

01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:59.280
They're got a bottle of champagne and the gang's got out of here.

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:01.280
Jake needs to surf again, probably.

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.280
We got to go.

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.280
It's going to be on next week's episode.

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:05.280
If they're.

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.280
Well, no, you know what?

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.280
It won't go anywhere because I guess the show's over.

01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:10.280
So there's no grand finale.

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.280
It's episode 100.

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:13.280
The audience wants some sort of big splashy.

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.280
Something.

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:16.280
Nothing.

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.280
Can you tell us what the next segment was going to be?

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:23.280
Do you want to know what the next segment was supposed to be?

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.280
Yeah.

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:28.280
Uh, I was going to try and dispense some wisdom.

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.280
Yeah.

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:30.280
We're going to do that.

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.280
Should we get a plugs?

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.280
No, let's go.

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.280
I want to hear the wisdom.

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.280
I want to hear the wisdom, Jeff.

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.280
I want to hear the wisdom.

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.280
It's episode 100.

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:39.280
We've all been mean to you.

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:41.280
People outside the studio has been mean to you.

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.280
Jesus.

01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:43.280
He's been mean to us.

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.280
No.

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.280
This is the segment I like to leave.

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.280
Sun wise.

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.280
Jake.

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.280
Jake, I'm sorry.

01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:54.280
So these are photos of sunrise and scene with like,

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:57.280
Brainy quote type things that I've sort of come up with.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.280
To be wise.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.280
So not sorry, not related to this.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.280
He back that you got it all.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.280
No.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.280
Okay.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.280
I thought the feedback would be nice job.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.280
Continue to work.

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.280
And so I was like, let me just do a segment.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.280
I would have a done either way.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:13.280
Read books written by and for children.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.280
Well, it's the next one.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.280
That's the joke.

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.280
It's not a joke.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.280
Wisdom.

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.280
Curiosity killed my cat.

01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:22.280
She was interested in oncoming traffic.

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.280
That's pretty good.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.280
Bosa.

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.280
It's a nice photo.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:29.280
Knowing about the New York Yankees is the beginning of all wisdom.

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:31.280
That's not a good.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.280
Wisdom is spelled wrong.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:37.280
You know, some people like know,

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.280
bunch of niche baseball facts from like the 1890s.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.280
Yeah.

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.280
You're just kind of scared.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.280
You know about the rest of the world.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.280
Let's clear.

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.280
Widsom.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.280
Thank you.

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.280
Widsom.

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.280
Travel over family.

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.280
Sharing you.

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.280
Sharing you.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.280
Sharing you.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.280
OK, all right.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.280
I mean, I disagree, but I can see my one would have this opinion.

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.280
You, too.

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.280
He who starts a company is the worst company.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:04.280
Oh.

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.280
That ones pray funny.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:10.280
In the be honest.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.280
Speak one language.

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.280
Ideally stop next frame next.

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:18.280
You can see the point is to dream.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.280
I'm still stuck in that last frame.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.280
So much experience.

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.280
No, this is it.

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.280
Okay, great.

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.280
And the pool can sleep.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.280
The point is to dream.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.280
You're right.

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.280
That's up here, sounds.

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.280
Oh, obviously.

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.280
Keaton.

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.280
Keaton.

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.280
Keaton.

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:34.280
How do you learn a house?

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.280
Yeah.

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.280
I guess I have to learn the whole house.

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:41.280
As if to a truck and his footage on the editor's desk wasn't enough.

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:44.280
Now he has to blur a house for you.

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:46.280
There might have been a zoom at one point.

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:47.280
That doesn't help.

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.280
That's a mirror's home.

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:54.280
That's a good length of a segment.

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.280
That's a good length of a segment.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.280
That's a good length of a segment.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.280
Yeah.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.280
That was the best segment.

01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.280
Yeah.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:00.280
All right.

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:01.280
Well, then I'm feeling a little bit better leading out.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.280
Leaving this.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.280
Wait, it is.

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.280
I like the whidsom.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.280
Was that a joke?

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.280
That was a joke.

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.280
That was not a joke at all.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.280
What's it?

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:13.280
That was the one I wrote these very fast.

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:14.280
Yeah.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.280
That's every segment that you've ever planned.

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.280
So.

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.280
Well, you got to do one of these a week, man.

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.280
This sucks.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:25.280
I will say that it was funny.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:26.280
The type I was funny.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:31.280
You're putting sunglasses back on.

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:34.280
Do it again for them put the sunglasses back on.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.280
No, honestly, genuinely.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.280
I know we were giving Jeff a hard time.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.280
But the.

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:42.280
The type I was funny.

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.280
Why do you have voice change?

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.280
All right.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.280
We made it.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:53.280
I like the typo is all whidsom.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:58.280
Is that like a weird jazz guy now?

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.280
Don't do that, though.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.280
You're like Pino Paladino.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:06.280
I guess you could say I'm the Lou Gehrig of knowing about Yankee Facts.

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.280
Nice.

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.280
And then I'm going to have a disease named.

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.280
Yeah.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:14.280
He added the generative disease.

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.280
I don't know.

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.280
Something to think about.

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.280
Thanks for 100 episodes.

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:21.280
I hope we can continue doing it.

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.280
But we'll, I guess we'll talk right after this.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.280
Oh, yeah.

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:27.280
Stick around.

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.280
I wanted to.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.280
Another Yankee reference.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.280
Touch base.

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.280
Yeah.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:39.280
All sort of shit.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:44.280
W slash R slash T.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.280
Your employment here.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:50.280
With regards to listen to.

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:55.280
Listen to XO Garzab King's senior separatives.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:59.280
We'll have a video podcast.

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:02.640
When this comes out, subscribe to that channel.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.480
School's awesome.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.840
So I think the nation's gonna have a meal

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.040
because Tyson on this week, so wow.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.040
Wow.

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.040
Because that's good.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.080
Who will feel like science and stuff?

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:17.240
Yeah.

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:18.680
And that's a good part.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:21.280
Hopefully, Carlos signs his car gets fixed

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.720
so that he can win the Grand Prix this weekend.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.400
Vamos, William?

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:26.920
Yeah.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:30.040
Now I'm getting excited because we're close to the meeting, Jake.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.040
Yeah.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.240
I don't even know if I have to be there.

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.680
I feel like it's, it's simple enough.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.280
And buckets.

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:37.120
Oh, yes.

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.120
The playoff.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:42.160
The buckets mean Billy's basketball podcast.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.720
We're gonna fucking hit the ground running.

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.120
There's some really exciting basketball happening on right now.

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.760
So looking forward to talking about that.

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:52.520
And if you do want me and Johnny to host the upcoming 100 episodes

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:55.560
of the Headcom podcast, just let us know on socials.

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:58.280
Hashtag, maybe if we get something trending,

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:00.720
like hashtag, Billy and Johnny or something like that.

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:01.520
That's pretty good.

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:02.720
Hashtag, Billy and Johnny.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.680
I guess it could kind of be like a dead and company thing

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:08.160
where it's like Jerry Garcia's dead, but it still lives on

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.240
and then his legacies furthered because of it.

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.640
So like, sure, you guys host it.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.760
But you sort of like, further my legacies,

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.440
well, and I'll be gone.

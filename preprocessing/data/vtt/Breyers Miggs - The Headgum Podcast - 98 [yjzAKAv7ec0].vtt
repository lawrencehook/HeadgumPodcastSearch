WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is a head-gum original.

00:07.000 --> 00:27.680
We're going to start out with a bang right off the bat, right?

00:27.680 --> 00:32.320
We're getting it high energy, we're getting everyone up on a Friday, because you guys entered

00:32.320 --> 00:39.320
the room with this sort of selling sunkenide energy, and I have to be the one to facilitate.

01:02.320 --> 01:06.960
Let's channel all our energy into joy today.

01:06.960 --> 01:12.040
I'm smiling, I'm happy, I'm feeling light-hearted, and I want to keep it that way, and

01:12.040 --> 01:15.520
it's up to you guys not to kind of set me off.

01:15.520 --> 01:16.520
Okay.

01:16.520 --> 01:24.120
I will say, it's usually someone's own responsibility to monitor their own, but we'll do

01:24.120 --> 01:25.360
what we can.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.360
Self-regulating emotions, yeah.

01:27.360 --> 01:28.360
Self-suff soothing.

01:28.360 --> 01:29.360
Yeah.

01:29.360 --> 01:32.880
I know the lingo.

01:32.880 --> 01:36.480
You clearly work on yourself a lot, but it doesn't ever show.

01:36.480 --> 01:37.480
Translate.

01:37.480 --> 01:38.480
Yeah.

01:38.480 --> 01:39.480
That's the hard.

01:39.480 --> 01:40.480
No, and that is hard.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.480
I mean, like, props for doing, you know, step one.

01:42.480 --> 01:44.120
But it's weird to go to gym and emergency.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.120
Yeah.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.360
It's like you're working out, but you're emerging weaker.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.040
I don't know how that's possible.

01:49.040 --> 01:54.840
I mean, I put in the tower within the hours, and it's like, well, cardio's the real

01:54.840 --> 01:55.840
answer.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.840
Yeah.

01:57.840 --> 02:05.840
Let's just shake it out, right?

02:05.840 --> 02:06.840
So, dance.

02:06.840 --> 02:07.840
Oh.

02:07.840 --> 02:12.560
Hold it.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.360
Was that a gen Z thing?

02:15.360 --> 02:16.360
This dance song?

02:16.360 --> 02:17.360
No.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.360
No.

02:18.360 --> 02:22.480
It says, sans default dance on the dance, the specific shake it out dance.

02:22.480 --> 02:23.480
Oh, that's a problem.

02:23.480 --> 02:24.480
That's a problem.

02:24.480 --> 02:25.480
Don't do that.

02:25.480 --> 02:26.480
Don't.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.480
Don't do that.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.480
Don't.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.480
Don't.

02:29.480 --> 02:30.480
Don't.

02:30.480 --> 02:31.480
Don't.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.480
Don't.

02:32.480 --> 02:33.480
Don't.

02:33.480 --> 02:34.480
Don't find common ground.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.480
Don't bring up improv.

02:36.480 --> 02:37.480
Don't just, yeah.

02:37.480 --> 02:39.480
I don't want to be really clear up top.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.480
I never want to bring up improv.

02:41.480 --> 02:42.480
It's something within me.

02:42.480 --> 02:43.480
I don't want.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.480
It's something that comes through.

02:45.480 --> 02:46.480
It has to happen.

02:46.480 --> 02:47.480
It's coming out.

02:47.480 --> 02:48.480
Whether you wanted or not.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.480
I can't be fun to do.

02:50.480 --> 02:51.480
Sorry.

02:51.480 --> 02:52.480
One second.

02:52.480 --> 02:53.480
I think I was talking.

02:55.480 --> 02:59.480
Sorry, then.

02:59.480 --> 03:07.480
We should do a Murray condo episode to see if not only are the clothes in our closet,

03:07.480 --> 03:09.480
but the show itself sparks joy.

03:09.480 --> 03:14.480
I'm a reka condo.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.480
I'm a reka condo.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.480
Like, Marika.

03:19.480 --> 03:20.480
Jeff doesn't like it.

03:20.480 --> 03:21.480
I think it's clever.

03:21.480 --> 03:22.480
It's a rosin.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.480
When you go, we go for the job.

03:24.480 --> 03:25.480
We don't understand it.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.480
Major go the alert.

03:27.480 --> 03:31.480
Major go the alert.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.480
Now you say what you're going to say.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.480
No, it's not even a major killer.

03:35.480 --> 03:36.480
It's just genuine advice.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.480
Like, I don't want to tell you how to be funny.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.480
Yeah.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.480
Go for the joke when you're gone for it.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.480
People can sense that desperation, yeah.

03:43.480 --> 03:44.480
What was the second?

03:44.480 --> 03:47.480
It looked like a slim fast shake.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.480
Wow.

03:49.480 --> 03:52.480
That protein cookies and cream shake.

03:52.480 --> 03:57.480
That can looks like it was put in a vetting machine in 98.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.480
You're the first person to pick it out.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.480
That's a dusty can.

04:01.480 --> 04:06.480
That the design hasn't been touched since they first made the drink in the 80s.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.480
Yeah.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.480
It was kept in 90s.

04:09.480 --> 04:10.480
A dairy can.

04:10.480 --> 04:13.480
You never want to see a creamy can.

04:13.480 --> 04:17.480
Can's should be like for water, a drinks.

04:18.480 --> 04:21.480
Do you ever, whenever I'm at like a, if I'm getting like my car fixed,

04:21.480 --> 04:23.480
I'm at like a jiffy lube or something.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.480
And they have creamer that, oh, that never sits right with me.

04:26.480 --> 04:27.480
Oh, like a little.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.480
Yeah.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.480
I'm like, I don't know how long this has been here.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.480
And I don't know how warm it's been kept.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.480
Yeah.

04:33.480 --> 04:34.480
Why does it not have to be refrigerated?

04:34.480 --> 04:36.480
They just keep on the table at diners.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.480
And it unsettles me.

04:38.480 --> 04:39.480
It really does.

04:39.480 --> 04:44.480
Like every milk has to be refrigerated except for those loose little

04:44.480 --> 04:46.480
vials of half and half.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.480
Seems like those should be the most cold.

04:49.480 --> 04:50.480
To me.

04:50.480 --> 04:51.480
Yeah.

04:51.480 --> 04:52.480
Jeff is muted in my head.

04:52.480 --> 04:53.480
We can't hear you Jeff.

04:53.480 --> 04:54.480
Yeah.

04:54.480 --> 04:55.480
But that's okay.

04:55.480 --> 04:59.480
I think ultimately was the best part of the show kind of noncoordinated.

04:59.480 --> 05:00.480
We connected on something.

05:00.480 --> 05:05.480
We were sort of really nice to be in studio with Casey on the video and

05:05.480 --> 05:09.480
on you on the audio because I don't have to think about anything other than the,

05:09.480 --> 05:12.480
the joys and that I bring to the table.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.480
That's joy and poison.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.480
And now when we're at home, it's like this chord just, if you,

05:17.480 --> 05:20.480
even if you don't touch it, it somehow falls out of whack.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.480
But ultimately.

05:22.480 --> 05:23.480
That was easy.

05:23.480 --> 05:28.480
Not really though, right?

05:28.480 --> 05:29.480
Really?

05:29.480 --> 05:30.480
Almost.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.480
Yeah.

05:31.480 --> 05:32.480
Creamer.

05:32.480 --> 05:33.480
Let's talk about it.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.480
There was a day when I was like,

05:34.480 --> 05:35.480
We already did it.

05:35.480 --> 05:36.480
We already talked to like,

05:36.480 --> 05:40.480
you're muted or something, but I think we exhausted.

05:40.480 --> 05:45.480
The camera discord has a day when I was like 10 or 11,

05:45.480 --> 05:49.480
and I drank hazelnut creamer from the jug.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.480
How much of it, the whole thing?

05:51.480 --> 05:54.480
I think probably a good chunk.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.480
A jug of creamer seems like that's not.

05:56.480 --> 06:00.480
They usually come in small containers because you're just supposed to use a splash at the time.

06:00.480 --> 06:03.480
You're supposed to use a splash because of sugar in it.

06:03.480 --> 06:04.480
Was it coffee mate?

06:04.480 --> 06:05.480
Yeah.

06:05.480 --> 06:06.480
It was coffee mate hazelnut.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.480
So they do have the bigger size.

06:08.480 --> 06:11.480
And those also stress me out.

06:11.480 --> 06:12.480
How's that?

06:12.480 --> 06:13.480
Those have to be refrigerated.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.480
The other ones smaller ones down.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.480
They have to be refrigerated unless you're like,

06:17.480 --> 06:19.480
add a hotel when they do continental breakfast,

06:19.480 --> 06:20.480
and then all of a sudden.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.480
I'll bet it's out.

06:21.480 --> 06:22.480
Don't give me started.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.480
I've got an animal breakfast.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.480
I can't get enough of the shit, man.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.480
Why?

06:27.480 --> 06:30.480
It's one of the worst breakfasts overall.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.480
Serial and bread.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.480
The milk is rarely cold enough.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.480
It's like, it's like touching ice at the bottom.

06:40.480 --> 06:41.480
I agree.

06:41.480 --> 06:42.480
What is it?

06:42.480 --> 06:43.480
Don't choose this sunny day.

06:43.480 --> 06:44.480
Yeah.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.480
So I'm going to drop a can of can.

06:45.480 --> 06:46.480
Absolutely concentrate.

06:46.480 --> 06:47.480
Absolutely.

06:47.480 --> 06:48.480
Really.

06:48.480 --> 06:49.480
Really.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.480
I'm glad that we all agree.

06:51.480 --> 06:54.480
And it's cornflakes usually only raised in bread.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.480
Obviously the keen peel continental breakfast sketch.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.480
I think of that.

06:58.480 --> 06:59.480
It's a great sketch.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.480
Favorite comedy sketches ever.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.480
If you're listening to this show, turn it off.

07:03.480 --> 07:04.480
Maybe forever.

07:04.480 --> 07:07.480
So watch the continental breakfast key and peel sketch.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.480
That's comedy.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.480
I'd like to do the senses.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.480
Clearly my friend.

07:12.480 --> 07:16.480
Ah, the Danish clearly from Brussels.

07:16.480 --> 07:19.480
Yeah, that's funny.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.480
But we have to make our own comedy because we're literally on the clock here.

07:22.480 --> 07:26.480
You can't just like, sight other jokes pass them off as your own.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.480
Because other people are watching this sketch and laughing.

07:28.480 --> 07:29.480
Because they're not laughing.

07:29.480 --> 07:30.480
That's a lot of you.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.480
Didn't pass it off.

07:31.480 --> 07:34.480
I actually gave sort of a lot of credence to the original creators.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.480
I told him to stop listening to this and start watching.

07:37.480 --> 07:38.480
He said peels.

07:38.480 --> 07:39.480
This is the thing.

07:39.480 --> 07:41.480
I make money off of, but instead stop.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.480
And go do other things.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.480
I mean, you're just going broke because of how much he wants to honor other comedians.

07:46.480 --> 07:47.480
I'm a marker.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.480
I'd rather you go for broke on the show.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.480
What's that?

07:50.480 --> 07:52.480
I'd rather you go for broke on the show.

07:52.480 --> 07:56.480
Come up with something quote where these are that the out of context headgun podcast

07:56.480 --> 07:58.480
Twitter account tweets the nonsense.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.480
Oh, they made me seem like a Republican once.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.480
What did you say?

08:01.480 --> 08:02.480
What did you say?

08:02.480 --> 08:05.480
I said that bite in this olden scene aisle.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.480
I regret voting for him and that.

08:07.480 --> 08:10.480
Oh, I said something about how we didn't like unions.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.480
But it was a joke.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.480
And now you said out of context.

08:14.480 --> 08:17.480
And they can take it out of context and do it again.

08:17.480 --> 08:18.480
Yeah.

08:18.480 --> 08:19.480
I can't wait.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.480
It's gotcha journalism a little bit.

08:21.480 --> 08:22.480
Yeah.

08:22.480 --> 08:23.480
And then beat.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.480
That's funny.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.480
So those of you just say something's funny and laugh.

08:28.480 --> 08:32.480
Like, people, other people will also think it's funny because they want to be in on the joke.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.480
Make your killer.

08:34.480 --> 08:37.480
Uh, here we go.

08:37.480 --> 08:41.480
It's time for everyone's bonds of the absolute week.

08:41.480 --> 08:44.480
Every week until the next James Bond is cast.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.480
We're going to put up our vote for who we want as the next 007.

08:48.480 --> 08:52.480
This week, uh, mine's going to be John Scout.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.480
Uh, why?

08:54.480 --> 08:59.480
His name rhymes with something about research.

08:59.480 --> 09:00.480
Cheese.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.480
You don't know John Scout?

09:02.480 --> 09:04.480
Uh, no.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.480
He created a spree.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.480
Uh, here we go.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.480
Here we go.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.480
You must not know about spree.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.480
You must not know about spree.

09:13.480 --> 09:16.480
It's a compressed extras.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.480
Candy has a candy shell in it.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.480
chewy center baby.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.480
You must not know about spree.

09:22.480 --> 09:25.480
You must not know about spree.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.480
I used to think spree stood for a sprain knee.

09:28.480 --> 09:32.480
So don't you ever pour a second get to thinking.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.480
I'm smarter than a spree.

09:35.480 --> 09:41.480
Just smarter than any of those programs where they'll pay if you take classes in something.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.480
Oh.

09:43.480 --> 09:46.480
So we sort of sponsored Jeff.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.480
But he's not learning anything.

09:48.480 --> 09:51.480
It's just for a lobotomy or something.

09:52.480 --> 09:57.480
Yeah.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.480
Was that up?

09:59.480 --> 10:02.480
You drank a 35 gram protein shake.

10:02.480 --> 10:03.480
Yeah.

10:03.480 --> 10:04.480
Did you work out?

10:04.480 --> 10:05.480
You can't be refreshing.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.480
It can't be refreshing.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.480
And you went.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.480
Yeah.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.480
I can't be refreshing.

10:10.480 --> 10:12.480
Chocolate milk.

10:12.480 --> 10:15.480
It's been any more dairy.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.480
No, I've had a spree.

10:17.480 --> 10:18.480
Yeah, I've never heard.

10:18.480 --> 10:21.480
I guarantee spree that some people don't know about spree.

10:22.480 --> 10:23.480
Yeah.

10:23.480 --> 10:24.480
I get that.

10:24.480 --> 10:25.480
Yeah.

10:25.480 --> 10:29.480
Must be a Cleveland thing.

10:29.480 --> 10:30.480
Um.

10:30.480 --> 10:33.480
Who are you guys just bonds of the week?

10:33.480 --> 10:34.480
Doesn't matter.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.480
You already said and did the thing that you needed to do.

10:37.480 --> 10:38.480
But yeah.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.480
Shall we do you have a bond of the week?

10:40.480 --> 10:41.480
I don't know.

10:41.480 --> 10:42.480
Michael Sarah.

10:42.480 --> 10:43.480
That's cool.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.480
Just the Eisenberg.

10:45.480 --> 10:46.480
Same person.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.480
Well, it's really good.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.480
Both really good bond vibes.

10:49.480 --> 10:50.480
Yeah.

10:52.480 --> 10:55.480
You have to admit it'd be funny to see Michael Sarah's bond.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.480
That's just a sketch.

10:57.480 --> 11:00.480
No, I think it could be a whole movie if you really wanted to be.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.480
You commit.

11:01.480 --> 11:03.480
I just do our sketch.

11:03.480 --> 11:05.480
Michael Sarah.

11:05.480 --> 11:06.480
Yeah.

11:06.480 --> 11:07.480
He's talented.

11:07.480 --> 11:10.480
I don't think I would ever go like he's really talented.

11:10.480 --> 11:13.480
Like he's not that he's talented but he's more than what you think.

11:13.480 --> 11:16.480
He's out of this world.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.480
If you were to be castes bond, he would really become the character.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.480
You think he would work out for it?

11:22.480 --> 11:23.480
I don't think he needs to.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.480
He's going to wait.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.480
I'll take one key lesson, but that's it.

11:29.480 --> 11:30.480
Exactly.

11:30.480 --> 11:31.480
All he needs.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.480
All the real spy needs is the know-how.

11:34.480 --> 11:35.480
And I think he does.

11:35.480 --> 11:36.480
And what does that mean to you?

11:36.480 --> 11:37.480
The know-how.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.480
How to get in and out.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.480
How to get in and out of a situation.

11:43.480 --> 11:47.480
How to like operate a mission or just have a situation place.

11:47.480 --> 11:48.480
I mean, you got to get in and out.

11:48.480 --> 11:49.480
That is being a spy.

11:49.480 --> 11:52.480
Being a spy is almost explicitly being getting in and getting out.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.480
Yep.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.480
Now, it's usually, it's like getting the information that helps your country.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.480
And then getting out of it all.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.480
And then getting out of it.

11:59.480 --> 12:00.480
That's like, but yeah.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.480
All right.

12:01.480 --> 12:04.480
If you boil it all down, it's getting in getting out.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.480
That's being a spy.

12:05.480 --> 12:06.480
You can say about anything.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.480
You can say about like being, you know, speaking of,

12:08.480 --> 12:10.480
you could say that about being a union worker.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.480
It's about clocking in and clocking out.

12:12.480 --> 12:13.480
Podcasts.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.480
Well, that's true about that.

12:15.480 --> 12:18.480
No, at a podcast, there's a whole other thing in the middle.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.480
We're saying what they're doing.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.480
We're saying that.

12:21.480 --> 12:22.480
We're saying that.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.480
Don't talk about your days.

12:23.480 --> 12:24.480
Do not even bring that up.

12:24.480 --> 12:29.480
The idea of workers getting together to force their parents.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.480
Have a better time.

12:30.480 --> 12:31.480
Yeah.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.480
News.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.480
This is crazy.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.480
Yeah, let's just fucking move on.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.480
Let's talk about the supply chain issue.

12:43.480 --> 12:47.480
A couple weeks ago, we sort of fixed it, but it still seems to be,

12:47.480 --> 12:50.480
it still seems to be sort of floundering.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.480
It seems to be frail and fragile.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.480
It doesn't seem like, you know,

12:54.480 --> 13:00.480
we live in such a global economy that it's like getting parts even for American manufacturing,

13:00.480 --> 13:02.480
often comes from overseas.

13:02.480 --> 13:07.480
And what do you do when barges are just up to their ankles?

13:07.480 --> 13:10.480
I have stoned out so hard.

13:10.480 --> 13:17.480
It's like campaign finance reform, just those words make you bored and stop.

13:17.480 --> 13:21.480
I glaze over so fast.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.480
Then let's talk about the discovery,

13:23.480 --> 13:25.480
Warner Media merger.

13:25.480 --> 13:26.480
And that's this morning.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.480
What do you only have really high level,

13:29.480 --> 13:34.480
tedious, dry, breaking news?

13:34.480 --> 13:38.480
Corporate mergers, supply chain management.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.480
Let's talk about fun shit.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.480
All right.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.480
Watches and wonders.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.480
Geneva, Switzerland, the fucking watch.

13:46.480 --> 13:49.480
Can you come out of convention in Spokane, Washington?

13:49.480 --> 13:50.480
Why there?

13:50.480 --> 13:51.480
Why there?

13:51.480 --> 13:54.480
That's where I feel like they do a trade show.

13:54.480 --> 13:57.480
I love to know what you guys think of the new Vashron,

13:57.480 --> 13:59.480
Constantine, 222,

13:59.480 --> 14:03.480
because he didn't get said that it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.480
Show a picture or something.

14:05.480 --> 14:06.480
It's a watch.

14:06.480 --> 14:07.480
I don't.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.480
All right.

14:08.480 --> 14:09.480
Here we go.

14:09.480 --> 14:10.480
Let me show the picture.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.480
This is going to make it harder to edit.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.480
Whatever shall be once.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.480
Well, you're asking us our opinion and you act like we've.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.480
This looks like a lot of other watches.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.480
Yeah.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.480
It looks kind of bad actually.

14:21.480 --> 14:24.480
It's like shiny in a not cool way.

14:24.480 --> 14:26.480
I don't think.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.480
Is this shiny to you?

14:28.480 --> 14:29.480
Yes.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.480
Looks like really.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.480
It looks like the Zelda.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.480
The way on that top picture right there,

14:34.480 --> 14:36.480
it looks very much like a cobra.

14:36.480 --> 14:38.480
King cobra snake.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.480
I don't know why I asked you guys.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.480
This sucks.

14:42.480 --> 14:50.480
Rolex released a left-handed GMT with the or left-hand T with a GM.

14:50.480 --> 14:51.480
Or what?

14:51.480 --> 14:52.480
I'm genuine.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.480
Our watches hand specific.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.480
Normally they're all for righty.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.480
Switch itters.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.480
Oh.

14:59.480 --> 15:02.480
But if you're a right-handed person, you wear it on your left wrist.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.480
And so they released a watch specifically for lefties,

15:05.480 --> 15:07.480
which would actually go on your right wrist.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.480
Meaning the crown is towards that.

15:09.480 --> 15:10.480
Oh my god.

15:10.480 --> 15:13.480
Shut up.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.480
Stop it.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.480
The crown is towards the hand.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.480
That's nothing.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.480
That's absolutely not.

15:21.480 --> 15:22.480
And took them.

15:22.480 --> 15:23.480
Hold on.

15:23.480 --> 15:24.480
How long has Rolex been a company?

15:24.480 --> 15:27.480
It took them till 2022 to flip a crown.

15:27.480 --> 15:30.480
Well, there's a lot of manufacturing that goes into it.

15:30.480 --> 15:34.480
You know, making the casemoles to flip it, you know,

15:34.480 --> 15:35.480
whatever.

15:35.480 --> 15:36.480
To mirror.

15:36.480 --> 15:37.480
To mirror.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.480
Something that I really care about, though.

15:57.480 --> 15:58.480
I know.

15:58.480 --> 16:01.480
I'm just asking if you know why it would have taken them this long.

16:01.480 --> 16:02.480
I was, yeah.

16:02.480 --> 16:05.480
Because, you know, we don't have the molds to make the casemoles.

16:05.480 --> 16:08.480
But we don't care about you.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.480
Oh.

16:10.480 --> 16:14.480
You care about watches, which is good.

16:14.480 --> 16:21.480
The disconnector sort of.

16:21.480 --> 16:25.480
Casm that we have yet to grow.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.480
This is a bridge.

16:28.480 --> 16:33.480
That's to either thin or fragile for us to traverse is we.

16:33.480 --> 16:37.480
And I'm not just talking about shelving me at this point.

16:37.480 --> 16:39.480
You get that.

16:39.480 --> 16:42.480
We as in the royal global we.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.480
The listeners of the show.

16:44.480 --> 16:48.480
Don't care about you.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.480
You, Jeff.

16:50.480 --> 16:53.480
So you can speak passionately about something.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.480
But it's not getting through.

16:55.480 --> 16:58.480
I could see that for a second, Jeff was going to try and sort of fake.

16:58.480 --> 17:01.480
And then he broke and laughed.

17:01.480 --> 17:05.480
But I could see it as knows that he was starting to do a little cry.

17:05.480 --> 17:06.480
Yeah.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.480
I don't know.

17:08.480 --> 17:11.480
Danger, key alert.

17:11.480 --> 17:16.480
Don't hide the cry when you try.

17:16.480 --> 17:21.480
In your eyes, it all comes out in the wash slash end.

17:21.480 --> 17:31.480
When you don't do the clap, I do them.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.480
We're going to take a quick break.

17:33.480 --> 17:41.480
But we'll be back after I compose myself when we thank some sponsors.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.480
He has a bathroom break.

17:43.480 --> 17:48.480
Nope.

17:49.480 --> 17:50.480
Oh, God.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.480
Thank you.

17:51.480 --> 17:54.480
Thanks to Fairety for that one.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.480
You crazy for that one, Fairety?

17:56.480 --> 17:58.480
It might be a different ad.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.480
These are dynamically inserted.

18:00.480 --> 18:04.480
So depending on when people listen to it, it may or may not have been a Fairety.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.480
What happened to you earlier, man?

18:06.480 --> 18:09.480
I feel like you're really coming after me this episode.

18:09.480 --> 18:10.480
All I did was do normal.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.480
No, the week with John Scout.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.480
Yeah.

18:13.480 --> 18:16.480
It's a usual part for the course.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.480
Full steam ahead.

18:23.480 --> 18:24.480
What do you guys have?

18:24.480 --> 18:26.480
Favorite sports?

18:28.480 --> 18:30.480
Basketball.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.480
Yeah, basketball.

18:31.480 --> 18:33.480
Yeah, me too, actually.

18:33.480 --> 18:43.480
But as good as basketball is, I feel like the world is waiting for that next sport.

18:43.480 --> 18:50.480
You know, there was so much excitement around high alive for so many decades that I think it's starting to win.

18:50.480 --> 18:54.480
And I think we need a new sport.

18:54.480 --> 18:59.480
Actually, there is kind of a new sport that I'm curious to try because I hear good things about.

18:59.480 --> 19:00.480
What is it?

19:00.480 --> 19:01.480
Pickleball.

19:01.480 --> 19:03.480
I've been playing pickleball.

19:03.480 --> 19:04.480
What the hell is it?

19:04.480 --> 19:12.480
Pickleball is like if you took tennis and you took ping pong and you sort of just met in the middle.

19:12.480 --> 19:15.480
Yeah, it's like paddle tennis with a wifful ball.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.480
It's doubles only, right?

19:17.480 --> 19:18.480
Yeah.

19:18.480 --> 19:21.480
I guess it's not the thing that it's hard.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.480
Is that the thing with the curves?

19:23.480 --> 19:25.480
No, that's high lie we were talking about.

19:25.480 --> 19:28.480
You said it was it had as few decades.

19:28.480 --> 19:29.480
You are.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.480
You already brought up.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.480
It's not the thing with the curves.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.480
It's not, but it's the super fast thing.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.480
High lie.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.480
Was it kind of like kind of speed?

19:40.480 --> 19:41.480
Yeah.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.480
Pickleball.

19:42.480 --> 19:46.480
And I guess it's like it's a good post retirement sport because there's not a lot of like running involved,

19:46.480 --> 19:50.480
but you're still getting some good cardio.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.480
Yeah.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.480
And I've been playing tennis a lot recently, so I feel like it would help.

19:53.480 --> 19:54.480
I pickleball skills.

19:54.480 --> 19:55.480
So I'm curious to try.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.480
I think it's like big an Arizona right now.

19:57.480 --> 20:00.480
But it's starting to spread.

20:00.480 --> 20:01.480
Yeah.

20:01.480 --> 20:04.480
There's a, there's a few, there's a few courts in LA.

20:04.480 --> 20:05.480
Really?

20:05.480 --> 20:06.480
Yeah.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.480
Specifically pickleball.

20:07.480 --> 20:08.480
Yes.

20:08.480 --> 20:09.480
There's two courts in Highland Park.

20:09.480 --> 20:13.480
There's a bunch in North Hollywood for some interesting and like burping.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.480
Are they like full or do you have to make a reservation?

20:16.480 --> 20:18.480
And burbank.

20:18.480 --> 20:19.480
They're usually full.

20:19.480 --> 20:22.480
The ones in Highland Park that I found are almost always empty.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.480
Are you playing doubles?

20:23.480 --> 20:24.480
Or is it?

20:24.480 --> 20:25.480
You could do one on one as well.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.480
I've done both.

20:27.480 --> 20:29.480
This is just paddle.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.480
Sure.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.480
This is what they play in Venice all the time.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.480
No, that's like you can like do that on the beach.

20:36.480 --> 20:37.480
This is like on a court.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.480
It's almost like tennis.

20:38.480 --> 20:39.480
There are rules.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.480
No.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.480
There's like paddle.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.480
Courts.

20:42.480 --> 20:45.480
And I guess they're going pickleball.

20:45.480 --> 20:49.480
It's a little different.

20:49.480 --> 20:50.480
It's what I'm saying.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.480
It is.

20:51.480 --> 20:52.480
Okay.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.480
Or you're off the show.

20:53.480 --> 20:56.480
Something really sinister just watched over Jeff.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.480
Something really spooky just happened to him.

20:59.480 --> 21:01.480
I can see it in his eyes.

21:01.480 --> 21:04.480
And just something really switched.

21:05.480 --> 21:09.480
Um, whatever pickleball is having a moment.

21:09.480 --> 21:12.480
But we're not making any fucking money off of that.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.480
So I thought we could in the next.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.480
Let's say nine eight minutes.

21:16.480 --> 21:23.480
Come up with a sport to take the world by storm.

21:23.480 --> 21:24.480
Yeah.

21:24.480 --> 21:28.480
So the difference between paddle tennis and pickleball is court.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.480
I mentioned court layout.

21:30.480 --> 21:31.480
The rackets.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.480
The balls in the scoring system are different.

21:33.480 --> 21:35.480
So everything about it.

21:35.480 --> 21:37.480
Other than the ball with the bat.

21:37.480 --> 21:38.480
Yeah.

21:38.480 --> 21:39.480
Yeah.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.480
The materials are the same.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.480
We have to come up with something unexpected.

21:43.480 --> 21:46.480
Because every other sport for the most part has a ball.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.480
Let's do away with the ball.

21:48.480 --> 21:49.480
Okay.

21:49.480 --> 21:50.480
Husky has a puck.

21:50.480 --> 21:51.480
All right.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.480
Then they're a camping object.

21:53.480 --> 21:58.480
There can't be this like roundy or like a, you know, sphere surfing.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.480
Would you say that's a sport?

22:00.480 --> 22:02.480
That's a sport that doesn't have a ball.

22:02.480 --> 22:03.480
Okay.

22:03.480 --> 22:06.480
So what about what?

22:06.480 --> 22:09.480
So that's like it can't be racing and it can't be trick based.

22:09.480 --> 22:12.480
What about surfing with darts?

22:12.480 --> 22:15.480
And it can't just be like putting two things together.

22:15.480 --> 22:17.480
It has to be something completely new.

22:17.480 --> 22:20.480
Like with the first person to like put a plank of wood in the, in the water.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.480
And ride that shit.

22:22.480 --> 22:25.480
That guy is like created something unbelievable.

22:25.480 --> 22:27.480
He created something that transcends time and space.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.480
And we have to do the same thing right now.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.480
You said you wanted to just get into some money.

22:31.480 --> 22:35.480
And I guess I'm wondering, did that guy make any money off of surfing?

22:35.480 --> 22:39.480
There's also like spiritual currency where like, because my circle.

22:39.480 --> 22:40.480
I mean, that's fair.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.480
Yeah.

22:41.480 --> 22:45.480
I wonder if there's like, and I mean, let's be honest here.

22:45.480 --> 22:48.480
A lot of sports are trying to like change the world.

22:48.480 --> 22:51.480
But it's the fact that they're doing everything for profit that they can't.

22:51.480 --> 22:54.480
You know, it's like a lot of, you know, you see basketball players,

22:54.480 --> 22:57.480
wearing shirts that say things that are obviously making a positive impact on,

22:57.480 --> 22:59.480
so in terms of social change.

22:59.480 --> 23:03.480
But how does our sport further the world?

23:03.480 --> 23:05.480
And we have six and a half minutes.

23:05.480 --> 23:08.480
I want the sport to be like doing my laundry or something.

23:08.480 --> 23:09.480
Make it fun.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.480
Make laundry fun again.

23:11.480 --> 23:18.480
What if it's like planting trees fast, but it can't be a race.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.480
And there can't be like a ball.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.480
And I feel like a tree.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.480
Wow.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.480
It is unrelated to a ball.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.480
Seeds have nothing to do with ball.

23:26.480 --> 23:29.480
What's a sport that somebody can play also without any equipment,

23:29.480 --> 23:31.480
because like that would make it, you know,

23:31.480 --> 23:35.480
it can be a worldwide sport like football jumping.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.480
Okay, now we're on to something.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.480
How do we jump with an objective?

23:39.480 --> 23:40.480
Yeah.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.480
I jump long jump.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.480
No.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.480
No.

23:43.480 --> 23:44.480
No.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.480
None of those because those exist.

23:46.480 --> 23:49.480
If there's a word for it, it's already a sport.

23:49.480 --> 23:53.480
If you want us to create a game, we're using no words that we already know.

23:53.480 --> 23:54.480
Okay.

23:54.480 --> 23:57.480
No, not nowhere to be already know, but not so tracking field, right?

23:57.480 --> 24:00.480
That's let's say that's all one umbrella sport.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.480
Just spitballing here, free associating in a way.

24:03.480 --> 24:06.480
What about a back and yield?

24:06.480 --> 24:08.480
Back and yield.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.480
Okay.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.480
So what would that be?

24:11.480 --> 24:13.480
Out of curiosity.

24:13.480 --> 24:20.480
It would be like sports massage competitively that yields some kind of result.

24:21.480 --> 24:25.480
The first one's going to be bad.

24:25.480 --> 24:26.480
All right.

24:26.480 --> 24:30.480
Once we get seven ideas in, suddenly we're working with gas.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.480
That's actually kind of interesting.

24:32.480 --> 24:35.480
How do you make a stove a sport?

24:35.480 --> 24:39.480
I did do that with like food network.

24:39.480 --> 24:40.480
Okay.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.480
Nice zoom.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.480
My job.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.480
Like that.

24:43.480 --> 24:44.480
It's hard.

24:44.480 --> 24:47.480
When my zoom dies, I think I'm going to leave.

24:47.480 --> 24:53.480
So I'll look like, yeah, it's down to one bar and it might last the episode.

24:53.480 --> 24:57.480
But like, I'm not going to like go get batteries for the rest of this.

24:57.480 --> 25:02.480
Like, yeah, what you're saying makes me want to go away.

25:02.480 --> 25:07.480
So I'll just let the fates decide when that happens.

25:07.480 --> 25:11.480
I feel like people don't write long hand anymore.

25:11.480 --> 25:16.480
That could be something that people train for by doing like the that thing with the weight.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.480
And then it's like, you know, who can write the best?

25:19.480 --> 25:21.480
Not even just the fastest.

25:21.480 --> 25:24.480
Can I genuinely ask what is writing long hand?

25:24.480 --> 25:26.480
Like, not typing.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.480
So writing.

25:28.480 --> 25:32.480
Yeah, but like, it's like a writing competition, but they already have those.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.480
This sucks.

25:34.480 --> 25:40.480
We've gamified most stuff because nobody, it makes things easier to do.

25:40.480 --> 25:41.480
So there you go.

25:41.480 --> 25:44.480
What has not been, you know, turned competitive.

25:44.480 --> 25:47.480
Sex.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.480
Anyone can do that.

25:49.480 --> 25:54.480
And you could have sex for points.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.480
They're about some sort of falling asleep contests.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.480
What about sex for points?

25:58.480 --> 25:59.480
It seems like I don't see it.

25:59.480 --> 26:00.480
Immediately go.

26:00.480 --> 26:01.480
People don't feel safe.

26:01.480 --> 26:02.480
Really?

26:02.480 --> 26:03.480
Like, immediately it'll be anti-woman.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.480
Really?

26:04.480 --> 26:05.480
Realty.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.480
Realty.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.480
Well, sex isn't that awesome.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.480
Sex doesn't have to be penetrative.

26:09.480 --> 26:13.480
So, you know, it could also be like, how good can you eat ass for

26:13.480 --> 26:14.480
points?

26:14.480 --> 26:17.480
But the judge is so subjective.

26:17.480 --> 26:22.480
Well, so, I mean, unless you get my control bought to be like,

26:22.480 --> 26:23.480
Gymnastics.

26:23.480 --> 26:26.480
That's what we could call it.

26:26.480 --> 26:27.480
That's marketable.

26:27.480 --> 26:28.480
That's very, I think.

26:28.480 --> 26:37.480
I feel like the only way you could judge it right would be if the recipient was not human.

26:37.480 --> 26:41.480
And there was sensors and receptors being like, they didn't good at this.

26:42.480 --> 26:43.480
Okay.

26:43.480 --> 26:48.480
Because I think if it's a person, it's like there's so much preference in there.

26:48.480 --> 26:49.480
That's interesting.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.480
I'm here speak on that.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.480
No.

26:53.480 --> 26:58.480
I don't want to have to talk about competitive sex with you.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.480
Like, you backed me into a corner.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.480
I don't feel comfortable with this dialogue.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.480
I feel like I've been at head-gablog enough to say no.

27:05.480 --> 27:06.480
So I feel like I had to say yes.

27:06.480 --> 27:07.480
Yes, of course.

27:07.480 --> 27:08.480
And that's the problem.

27:08.480 --> 27:15.480
Like Jeff puts you into these social situations that you feel stuck in your force to do something

27:15.480 --> 27:18.480
that you're not necessarily super comfortable with.

27:18.480 --> 27:22.480
And that's like, that's the vibe of the show here.

27:22.480 --> 27:25.480
It's just like, it's gross.

27:25.480 --> 27:26.480
It's tacky.

27:26.480 --> 27:27.480
It's unnecessary.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.480
It's uncouth.

27:29.480 --> 27:33.480
So I don't want to talk about Gymnastics.

27:33.480 --> 27:37.480
Because it seems like you're sort of guiding the conversation there anyway.

27:38.480 --> 27:41.480
This is hard.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.480
By the way.

27:43.480 --> 27:45.480
That was easy.

27:45.480 --> 27:52.480
We do have two minutes to come up with the best sport in the world.

27:52.480 --> 27:56.480
I'm wondering if there's something to do with art,

27:56.480 --> 27:58.480
because art has already been commodified,

27:58.480 --> 28:00.480
but how do we gamify it?

28:00.480 --> 28:06.480
Who can make the best statue in a year?

28:07.480 --> 28:10.480
So the season in a house.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.480
In a hat with a side sauce.

28:13.480 --> 28:16.480
Who can make the best statue in a year?

28:16.480 --> 28:17.480
Yeah.

28:17.480 --> 28:18.480
Yeah.

28:18.480 --> 28:19.480
That's a pretty good.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.480
That's an awesome sport.

28:21.480 --> 28:27.480
I also feel like sports favor the young.

28:27.480 --> 28:30.480
So what's something that favors young?

28:30.480 --> 28:31.480
Carler otherwise.

28:36.480 --> 28:37.480
What?

28:37.480 --> 28:39.480
Not the sex thing from the world.

28:39.480 --> 28:40.480
This sucks.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.480
This sucks.

28:42.480 --> 28:43.480
Yeah.

28:43.480 --> 28:44.480
Yeah.

28:44.480 --> 28:46.480
You can't love with it.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.480
It's your doing.

28:48.480 --> 28:51.480
You wanted to do this.

28:51.480 --> 28:56.480
How do you make air something to compare?

28:56.480 --> 28:58.480
Who has the cleaner air?

28:58.480 --> 29:00.480
And it's like, it can be sort of like formula one.

29:00.480 --> 29:01.480
I already.

29:01.480 --> 29:03.480
Don't they already know that?

29:03.480 --> 29:05.480
Yeah, you can measure that.

29:05.480 --> 29:08.480
No, I'm sitting like, who can make the best air purifier?

29:08.480 --> 29:12.480
And then who can use the air purifier to clean the room the best?

29:12.480 --> 29:14.480
And it'd be like F1.

29:14.480 --> 29:15.480
Because you can.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.480
You are talking about business.

29:17.480 --> 29:19.480
This is not a game.

29:19.480 --> 29:20.480
Yeah.

29:20.480 --> 29:21.480
This is not a game.

29:21.480 --> 29:22.480
It's too air purifier.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.480
I think you guys would get it.

29:24.480 --> 29:25.480
We have to go on.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.480
This sucks.

29:26.480 --> 29:27.480

30:03.480 --> 30:06.480
You're talking about politics.

30:06.480 --> 30:07.480
Plugs.

30:07.480 --> 30:08.480
No way.

30:08.480 --> 30:11.480
But you guys know your Myers-Briggs tests.

30:11.480 --> 30:13.480
I forget.

30:13.480 --> 30:16.480
That's the ENF whatever the fuck.

30:16.480 --> 30:17.480
Right.

30:17.480 --> 30:20.480
I think I'm making it.

30:20.480 --> 30:24.480
What if it makes sense if I said ENF.

30:24.480 --> 30:26.480
Jay slash T.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.480
ENF just in slash timberayı.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.480
That's what it was.

30:30.480 --> 30:37.040
I don't think the slash team means anything, but I've had like a J-dash to like my last one is a mix

30:37.760 --> 30:40.640
Oh, well, it would be oh dash pee then. Yeah

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I'm an INFJ

30:45.760 --> 30:50.240
You're an introvert. Yeah, I get exhausted by stuff like this

30:51.600 --> 30:54.880
You do it so often. I know. That's what I'm always tired

30:54.880 --> 31:03.520
Um, I'm here. I'm an AMIR, a one-of-a-kind

31:05.440 --> 31:07.440
No, I'm an IT

31:09.040 --> 31:11.040
Specialist. I'll

31:11.840 --> 31:13.840
Y'all hurt

31:14.640 --> 31:17.920
Well, it's good that we know ourselves some more than others

31:19.200 --> 31:22.960
But today I wanted to introduce a new personality test

31:23.920 --> 31:26.320
The Briar's mix test

31:27.520 --> 31:30.160
So much of your things are just switching the first letter

31:31.600 --> 31:33.600
This is gonna

31:33.600 --> 31:39.280
You interact with others based on ice cream and pop punk bands

31:41.280 --> 31:49.040
Okay, Briars of course being sort of a dairy entity. Yeah, they're being a naughty oddies pop punk

31:49.840 --> 31:51.040
outfit

31:51.200 --> 31:53.200
Out of San Francisco

31:53.920 --> 31:57.680
Amir, let's start with you when you when you're in social scenarios

31:58.240 --> 32:01.760
Do you get drained by the end of the night or by the end of the night after spending time with people?

32:02.240 --> 32:08.480
Are you sort of so this is just the regular one but not have any results will be different?

32:08.480 --> 32:13.840
Okay, sure. I feel drained at the end of a night of talking to people. Yeah, so you're sort of a Ryan Ross

32:13.840 --> 32:16.480
You're sort of a Ryan Ross from Pentagon. They just go in that exact regard

32:17.120 --> 32:21.200
Because he's sort of strikes me as an intro room and I have to guess

32:26.800 --> 32:31.760
There's usually more questions, right? There are I just he didn't respond. I like I can't I don't know who that is

32:33.200 --> 32:38.240
He probably didn't know what judgment meant until you took the Myers Briggs of course

32:38.240 --> 32:42.080
I knew it judgment that when you're at an ice cream parlor

32:42.080 --> 32:45.360
Do you like to sit in the middle of the room or at the sides?

32:47.360 --> 32:49.760
It also flavor to you get

32:51.440 --> 32:53.440
You're clearly making this up as you

32:56.080 --> 33:00.640
I thought about better what you would the test deliver. Yeah, that is what the test delivers

33:00.640 --> 33:07.520
But it's like it sometimes the test will ask you do you think you're an introvert or an extrovert and if you think you're an introvert that means you're an extrovert

33:09.600 --> 33:11.600
This sucks

33:12.080 --> 33:14.080
Again absolutely your choice

33:16.960 --> 33:25.200
I sit in the sides and I get cookies and cream cookies and cream like your weird milk juice

33:29.200 --> 33:33.680
All right, I'm here when you find yourself in a group of strangers

33:34.400 --> 33:39.600
Do you cope with the social anxiety by talking a lot or do you sort of sink into the shadows

33:40.400 --> 33:42.400
Shadows really

33:42.800 --> 33:44.800
Interesting

33:46.320 --> 33:48.800
And when you are with family

33:49.680 --> 33:53.520
Do you end up resolving conflict or maybe accidentally starting it?

33:54.960 --> 33:57.760
Neither I know there's start nor end conflict

34:01.840 --> 34:06.720
I've got you're just exist within it. I've got your results. Okay

34:07.680 --> 34:12.480
You're gonna be a DWC WCC

34:15.600 --> 34:20.560
Okay, that's down weeks waffle cone with chocolatey chips

34:22.640 --> 34:27.280
So you're sort of a touring basis who can't get enough of waffle cones

34:28.160 --> 34:30.160
K cones even sometimes

34:30.960 --> 34:36.320
And we have to do that again with shall be now

34:37.200 --> 34:41.760
Yeah, it took so long the first time it took me five minutes the ten minutes segment

34:43.680 --> 34:48.160
Same questions for her. Did you think of new questions? There's always new questions at this game

34:48.960 --> 34:53.600
This past sorry. I'm already thinking about sports. Yeah, it helps us. There's a little bit of different

34:53.600 --> 34:54.640
Yeah

34:54.640 --> 34:57.040
Let's hear the first question then see how different it is

34:57.360 --> 35:02.400
Shelby when you laugh is it more of a grin-based laugh or is it an open mouth? Uh-huh

35:05.600 --> 35:10.880
I guess it depends how funny the joke is that's not that I that that's a good answer

35:10.880 --> 35:12.960
But for the test you have to choose one

35:13.680 --> 35:16.480
It says open mouth. Uh-huh. Yes

35:17.840 --> 35:22.720
What's this? I would say that's a grin. Okay. The now

35:23.600 --> 35:25.840
Probably unless you really get me

35:27.520 --> 35:28.720
Um

35:28.720 --> 35:33.520
When traveling do you take the lead in planning or is it something that you're just

35:34.880 --> 35:39.200
Or is it something that you're just willing for the ride for is what I was gonna say? I'm a long for the ride. That's awesome

35:40.880 --> 35:43.840
In terms of dairy how thick can it get

35:48.480 --> 35:50.480
Scientifically

35:51.440 --> 35:53.920
How are cheese really?

35:54.720 --> 35:59.280
That's the hardest dairy gets okay and how hard do you get?

36:02.720 --> 36:10.320
What's up? I'm asking you the dryer's mix questions. How hard do I get? Yeah

36:12.000 --> 36:18.240
It in regards to what Jeff? I don't know hard to be around fully erect

36:21.440 --> 36:23.440
In general angry

36:24.640 --> 36:28.800
Right now a lot right and when you're around a campfire

36:29.760 --> 36:33.920
Do you sort of work to build the fire or do you

36:35.040 --> 36:38.960
Just a long for the ride? I like to build the fire

36:39.680 --> 36:46.400
Really that's gonna change your entire result actually well I like to do it so I guess it's the better answer

36:47.280 --> 36:51.280
The results are in

36:52.720 --> 36:55.920
Shelby you are a KTT LFV

36:56.720 --> 36:58.720
Katie Tonstall

36:58.720 --> 37:03.440
Katie Tonstall lactose three vanilla. Was it really Katie Tonstall? Yeah

37:05.520 --> 37:10.080
What is she? Well band is she and she was in mix and she was also

37:10.560 --> 37:17.200
Didn't she do suddenly I see yeah, yeah, what the hell could be throughout a sudden? Yeah

37:18.560 --> 37:23.040
This is yeah, I want to be I'm here side never sing because it doesn't sound good

37:24.080 --> 37:28.800
Shelby it does feel like this result resonated with you a little bit not lactose free

37:28.800 --> 37:34.640
I can have as much of it as I want okay, then just homemade vanilla then let's change it to KTT HMV

37:35.600 --> 37:37.600
Okay

37:37.600 --> 37:41.840
I mean I'm a fine flavor what I say it's a boring flavor. Oh, you don't

37:43.840 --> 37:45.840
You suck at singing

37:47.920 --> 37:50.720
There's an entire lonely and horny episode about how you can't sing

37:51.440 --> 37:54.480
I was actually on your podcast all the time. No, this is real

37:55.280 --> 38:02.880
You see on your podcast all the time as a joke you know it's a gaff and your audience is a gassed every time you open your trap

38:04.720 --> 38:12.880
Just tough to watch and sit around and sort of see happening some people have pipes like an organ you types like an 18th century kind of century

38:16.720 --> 38:25.440
What do you mean you're rusty and I don't mean because you haven't been in the game for a while you've been in the game and you're covered in sweat

38:25.520 --> 38:27.520
I

38:31.600 --> 38:34.400
In the game and I'm covered in

38:42.160 --> 38:44.160
Game over

38:44.560 --> 38:46.560
Flugs

38:46.560 --> 38:48.560
Me or you've got an on-man

38:48.560 --> 38:54.800
Oh, you know projects you said a lot of really mean shit to me 30 seconds ago

38:56.160 --> 38:58.160
All right set up

38:58.160 --> 39:01.840
I sound like shit my pipes are rusty

39:02.720 --> 39:06.480
With the suit not unlike an 18th century prison. Yeah

39:07.280 --> 39:13.520
I don't know if I'm I'm sorry for not to say where sorry that he doesn't want to plug his singing show now

39:14.000 --> 39:17.520
Yeah, like I was about to drop my sound cloud and for what

39:18.480 --> 39:23.280
His choir is performing all weekend now. I'm not going to say anything about sing with others

39:24.160 --> 39:30.960
Yeah, I'm a alto and a kid's quiet. No way and a soloist that's so high

39:32.000 --> 39:35.440
I call his live show because I babysat a kid in the choir and

39:38.080 --> 39:41.520
Did definitely bring a deeper voice than anyone else had in the choir?

39:42.240 --> 39:46.160
You sing the alto part an octave down which made it all sound strange

39:47.600 --> 39:52.000
So yeah, even the lowest voiced kid is sort of up here

39:53.680 --> 39:55.680
Where here

39:56.960 --> 39:58.960
This is the kid told

40:00.560 --> 40:05.040
I feel like the vibes have been great today. Oh my god. Why?

40:05.920 --> 40:12.480
Is that what I think that oh I just think the three of us got on really well. I think we came up with probably the greatest

40:12.480 --> 40:17.920
whatever wouldn't competitive sex with robots. I think we well we we definitely made some

40:17.920 --> 40:25.120
casting decisions. We're going to put out the the offer to young scout the dead spree creator and

40:25.920 --> 40:30.480
Ultimately I go Sarah ultimately Michael Sarah's are back up

40:31.200 --> 40:34.560
He deserves them and your personality is KTT HV and

40:35.440 --> 40:41.200
Amir's is some weird combination of double-use and seas and I think that's fine. I think we did something big

40:41.760 --> 40:46.240
Sometimes it feels like something's about to happen. Cosmicly this was it

40:47.360 --> 40:49.360
plugs

40:52.800 --> 40:55.040
Cash me outside how about duh

41:01.360 --> 41:07.440
The dog how about duh plugs. All right. This is like it can't end until you guys plug your consents

41:08.160 --> 41:13.200
Jeff, we have a show together. You plug it. She'll be not having a show together at Leer capierian

41:13.200 --> 41:20.560
Monday April 18th which actually is the Monday after this episode comes out. So what does that get a monthly thing

41:20.560 --> 41:26.640
or you just come in at one show? Well we're committed to one but it's gonna be monthly. I do so monthly

41:27.600 --> 41:31.440
Wow and it's like always like the third Monday of every month there's it like

41:32.160 --> 41:34.160
We'll figure out may when it happens

41:34.560 --> 41:39.600
It's gonna be a figure out may when it happens type of I probably actually get to

41:40.640 --> 41:46.720
a more consistent thing but I think you know we got some stuff we got some kinks. Yeah, then to figure out

41:47.200 --> 41:51.600
How many tickets need to be sold for the Leer capier like what's capacity there?

41:51.600 --> 41:58.640
Capacity I think is like 70 total but it also can be 55 so it's a pretty intimate venue

41:58.640 --> 42:03.360
But we have a great lineup. We have Kail Baron Shelby's co-host Brotee Gupta

42:04.560 --> 42:13.600
And Kylie Breakman and Taylor Garrett and so so how many tickets have you sold so far we haven't checked

42:14.800 --> 42:20.960
I see it's not too many probably 20 I'd have to get 20 ish because we announced it two days ago

42:22.320 --> 42:28.400
And the goal is 10 per day yeah the goal is to sell it out and then keep it going what's in it for you guys

42:28.640 --> 42:31.120
Other people are doing stay attention cash and attention

42:31.680 --> 42:36.320
You guys get it cut at the door and now the applause at the top and bottom of the show

42:36.880 --> 42:42.160
Tipped your bullseye people like wait that was fun good job tip your before you do it for tips. What's that

42:43.040 --> 42:47.280
You're not getting paid you're getting you're asking people for money when they get there. I'd be nice

42:47.760 --> 42:49.280
Fair if it's funny

42:49.280 --> 42:53.200
It's like we're giving you a service, you know, you pay because people pay for the show

42:53.200 --> 42:56.160
But then you also want right, but you pay for a meal and then you tip your waiter

42:56.160 --> 43:02.400
Yeah, you pay for your pay for the show and then the poor serving hot comedy so it's sort of like oh you tip your servers

43:02.400 --> 43:05.200
Yeah, and then do you guys now no more comedians because those are

43:06.400 --> 43:13.040
The core four like what happens in May you get what who do you guys put it this we had a pretty big backlog of people begging to be on the show

43:13.040 --> 43:15.040
Yeah, really

43:15.040 --> 43:20.000
Yeah, you drop some names who's who do can we expect for me and beyond if you guys do like

43:20.960 --> 43:22.960
I'm trying to decide if I should be earnest or fake

43:26.400 --> 43:30.560
That's sort of the the the log line of this entire podcast. I

43:30.560 --> 43:32.560
Yeah, I'm about emailing to flow

43:33.200 --> 43:34.400
progressive

43:34.400 --> 43:36.400
She's sort of funny in those spots

43:37.680 --> 43:41.520
Okay, so this this might be the best show to go to then they will show

43:42.160 --> 43:46.240
Yeah, people should go to the April one come to the April one it is back then after that and who knows? But

43:47.200 --> 43:52.720
If it goes well if it's fun if we get shit done and then shall be why did you decide to

43:53.360 --> 43:56.000
Go the Jeff is my co-host

43:57.200 --> 44:01.200
Rout because it feels like these are your friends you could have easily done the show um

44:02.400 --> 44:04.400
songs

44:04.400 --> 44:06.400
anchor

44:06.400 --> 44:09.600
Yeah, it's something that certainly what's up Jeff?

44:10.800 --> 44:12.400
song

44:12.400 --> 44:18.720
Yeah, I can't quite read what he's saying we see songs. There's more to it that we can't see it's not relevant. It's just he said songs

44:19.360 --> 44:21.360
Yeah

44:22.320 --> 44:24.320
So uh

44:24.320 --> 44:26.320
Yeah

44:27.120 --> 44:32.880
Was it Jeff? Why Jeff? Why Jeff? Jeff has a certain

44:34.000 --> 44:39.440
People so part of having people cut to get people to come to your show other than other shows

44:40.080 --> 44:42.080
There does have to be a little bit of

44:43.040 --> 44:45.040
Pity I see

44:46.000 --> 44:48.400
And so like yeah, really

44:49.360 --> 44:54.960
brings that there's this idea that people seem to kind of unanimously agree with at least on the east side of

44:54.960 --> 44:58.960
Los Angeles that I'm hanging on by a thread so to not come to the show

44:58.960 --> 45:02.960
People don't want to be the the the one to break that thread so it's sort of like for me

45:02.960 --> 45:07.920
I could get the guests but I can't get the sympathy attendees and I can Jeff

45:08.560 --> 45:14.480
Bring that to the audience and those people are sort of the biggest laughers because they're trying to make sure he doesn't break down

45:14.560 --> 45:16.560
Yeah, correct so
